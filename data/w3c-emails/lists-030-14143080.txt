It would be good if the link checker offered multidocument publication support 
...

e.g. today (1st december) i wish to link check 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/draft/

(OWL Test Cases hopeful PR)

which is dated 9th december and has links to other 9th dec. docs.

If the link checker had an additional box where you could put up a set of 
pairs of URLs

  INTENDED  => CURRENT

then it could check a "future" URL by mapping it to the current editors draft 
URL. (In fact this could be used to check all the documents in a 
multidocument set at the same time); also could flag any use of one of the 
CURRENT urls (which is usually a mistake, not always).
