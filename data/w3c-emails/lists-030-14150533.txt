The link checker is very hard to use for the OWL Test Cases document because 
it incorrectly complains about URLs that have fragIDs inside an RDF/XML 
document. This could be fixed by parsing the RDF/XML to extract the fragIDs 
(or by a simple XSLT search for rdf:ID, rdf:about and rdf:resource attributes 
- just rdf:ID would do for starters)
