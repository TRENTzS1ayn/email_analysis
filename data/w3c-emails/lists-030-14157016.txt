Very minor point - the pubrules checker says of a PR

[[
Is there an email feedback link for the AC Reps to a team only mailing for PR 
Review? 2 email addresses found in the status section. Check that one of 
public-webont-comments@w3.org, www-rdf-logic@w3.org, is a team only mailing 
list
]]

It could turn this into a NO automatically by noticing the existeance of 
public (or member) archives for the stated mailing lists

An algorithm for detecting an appropriate team only list that uses only public 
data is that e.g.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/team-graphics
gives a 401 (or 200 if you are in the team presumably)
whereas the incorrect
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/team_graphics
gives a 404

i.e.   foobar@w3.org is a team only mailing list iff
  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/foobar gives a 401 or 200 response

Similar checks could insist on public and/or member only lists for feedback on 
various documents
