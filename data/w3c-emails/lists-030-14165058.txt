[FWIW, the link checker is maintained by people at www-validator@w3.org,
rather than by spec-prod]

The linkchecker has this function, but only available as a command line
parameter; cf http://www.aero.jussieu.fr/WEB-outils/docs/checklink.html

(I agree that having this as an advanced capabitility of the on-line
version would be good; but this is better proposed/discussed on
www-validator)
