Perhaps this is on-topic for this list then ...
the needs of multidocument spec-prod would be better met by having support 
for a specific link checker for each multidocument set.
e.g. for OWL there would be a particular page with the mappings set (by 
perhaps the team contact)
Each editor could then use that page to check their document.

I suppose this could be provided by the link checker page accepting a query 
part of the URI that sets up the mappings. (Then the multidocument set 
specific checker would just be the standard link checker with a specific 
query part).
