Hello, Norm,

You had asked if there was a standardized way to split specs. I asked
and it evidently will go into the Manual of Style [1] rather than
Publication Rules [2], probably in 2004. Dominique Haza?l-Massieux has
already written an XSLT based on div class="part" [3]. Does that meet
your needs?
