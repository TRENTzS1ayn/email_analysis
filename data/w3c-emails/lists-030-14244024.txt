Hello Spec-prod,

The QA Activity has started a while ago a Wiki [1] as a community place
to share thoughts, techniques and ideas on how to improve the QA
practices in W3C ; a fair number of the topics addressed in this Wiki
concern the problems that may arise when writing a specification ; in
particular:
* Usage of RFC Keywords http://esw.w3.org/topic/RfcKeywords
* defining a language through semantics or operations
(http://esw.w3.org/topic/MeaningVsBehavior)
* defining errors handling in a spec
http://esw.w3.org/topic/ErrorHandling
* possible issues when defining a language both in a formal language and
in English prose http://esw.w3.org/topic/FormalLanguageVsProse

Since this forum is the main way of communication with and between W3C
Editors, the QA Activity would be very interested to get feedback and/or
direct participation on these pages from the participants of this
mailing list.

I'm also interested in knowing if W3C Editors would be interested in a
more formal community to exchange tips and ideas using this same mailing
list, or if they would rather keep it in this low-traffic state.

Thanks,

Dom
