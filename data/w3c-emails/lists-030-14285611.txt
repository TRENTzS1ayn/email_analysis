  With your solution, what would be needed would be to use
  Omega/Lambda (Unicode versions) instead of TeX/LaTeX.

Nothing would be needed: the character data in Dan's stylesheet just
"drops through" to latex so it will by default do the wrong thing there
(sorry, TeX has this in built bias towards 1970's US-English:-)
Although you could load one of the utf8 packages which will deal with
many cases of utf8 documents even using standard TeX, or should just
"drop through" to omega and do the right thing by default if omega is used.

While such a stylesheet is useful if you have some hand authored xhtml
it relies on some very special conventions and magic comments (for table
layout) so it's not a general xhtml to latex convertor. If you are having
to write the document specifcally for this tool you seem to get more
benefits from XML if you author in some other format rather than xhtml
so that you  can get much better automated procesing of cross refs etc,
you can then generate the xhtml and latex in parallel from this
source. Styles to go to xhtml and latex from the w3c's xmlspec dtd
markup are in the mathml REC distribution, for example.
