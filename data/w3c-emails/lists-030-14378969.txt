Hi Norm.

A few things changed in the process. There are now Working Group
Notes, Member and Team submissions.

Also, LCS has been replaced by CSAIL.

Attached is a diff against the XSLT producing XHTML (version 1.10) to
take care of those two things. It requires a change in the DTD to
allow wgnote, memsub and teamsub as valid values for w3c-doctype. I
left note as a recognized value.

Also, it would be nice to have figure numbering included in the main
XSLT style sheet. I stole the following from the Web Services
Description Working Group, with slight modifications:

Regards,

Hugo
