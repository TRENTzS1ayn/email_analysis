/ Hugo Haas <hugo@w3.org> was heard to say:
| A few things changed in the process. There are now Working Group
| Notes, Member and Team submissions.
|
| Also, LCS has been replaced by CSAIL.
|
| Attached is a diff against the XSLT producing XHTML (version 1.10) to
| take care of those two things. It requires a change in the DTD to
| allow wgnote, memsub and teamsub as valid values for w3c-doctype. I
| left note as a recognized value.

Thanks for the patch! I will publish a new release today.

| Also, it would be nice to have figure numbering included in the main
| XSLT style sheet. I stole the following from the Web Services
| Description Working Group, with slight modifications:
|
|   http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2002/ws/arch/xmlspec-v24/xmlspec.xsl.diff?r1=1.3&r2=1.6

Changes that I make the base stylesheet are global, so I'm reluctant
to change the presentation unless it is necessary to correct an
obvious bug.

By the way, your CVS URI suggests that you're editing the xmlspec
stylesheet directly in some project. Using a customization layer
(xsl:import of the base stylesheet and overriding the templates you
wish to change) tends to be easier to maintain. FWIW.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
