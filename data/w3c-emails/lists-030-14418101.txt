/ ht@inf.ed.ac.uk (Henry S. Thompson) was heard to say:
| Attached patches should do it, please encorporate in next release.
|
| Sorry, no patch for HTML stylesheets or other schemas, should be obvious.

Done. Note: the XHTML stylesheet is machine generated from the HTML one.
I encourage you to make patches in the HTML one and regenerate the XHTML.
But for a patch this small, it doesn't really matter.

Likewise, the DTD is the normative form today, so that's the right
place to do the patches.

Checking them into CVS today...

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
