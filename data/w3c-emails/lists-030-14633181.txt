Hi :

I am having troubles with the BE tests when running from behind
a firewall with the crimson parser...

It seems that crimson does not understand the ID in many/all of the
BE tests, which is 

------------- Begin Included Message -------------

<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000303 Stylable//EN" ^M
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/03/WD-SVG-20000303/DTD/svg-20000303-stylable.dtd">^

------------- End Included Message -------------

In order to run behind a firewall I have to hack the doctype to
something like 
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000802//EN" 
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/DTD/svg-20000802.dtd">
  
I thought you'd like to know... it would be nice if the DOCTYPE in the BE tests
were one of those which crimson and xerces understood without trying to
contact the w3c server, since it can be quite messy/tedious to set up the
HTTP proxy for Java2...

Thanks,

Bill
