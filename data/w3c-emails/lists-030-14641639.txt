We always use the second form now.  In fact, after the next (pending) 
public SVG spec release, we will update the test suite, and the DOCTYPES 
will be identical to the 2nd form except for 20000802 changed to 2000mmdd 
(mm and dd correctly designating the month and day of the document release).

As I'm sure you are aware, any BE tests with the 20000303 form and date 
have been superseded and replaced by newer versions, with the 20000802 form 
and date.  (I.e., 20000303 test versions should not be used now, unless you 
have historical interest in the evolution of the SVG spec and test suite).

Yes, thanks.

Be on the lookout for announcement of a new public spec release, and 
probably not long thereafter, a new public release of the test suite.  If 
there are still any problems, please let us know.

Regards,
Lofton
