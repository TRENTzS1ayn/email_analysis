What is the crimson parser, and which SVG viewer were you using?

Since those are identical constructs but merely reference different
versions (on the same website, outside your firewall), it seems that your
SVG viewer has cached one but not the other.

Is there any documentation on which DTDs the crimson parser already knows
about?

The DOCTYPE for the test suite is in any case being updated to the latest
one, so hopefully you will not have the same problem in future.
