Hiya,

One of your test suite examples fails on my converter. Well, many of
them do, but one fails in a way that is not-consistant with the
specification, as far as I can tell.

Whilst I'm not implementing large chunks of the SVG specification
because of limitations of the file format I convert to, the
matadata-sample-BE-01.svg example fails to plot the fill of the
star and the text below it in orange. I found this curious, so I
looked at the specification.

The SVG specification says in 4.3.6 that 'The list of keyword color
names is: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon,
navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow. These
16 colors are defined in HTML 4.0.'

orange is not one of these colours (and isn't one of the system
colours that follows in the description), and so the fill colour
of the text and the star are ignored by my parser.

Am I misunderstanding the specification on the point of keywords
for colours ? Or is the test case actually using an undefined
colour, which just happens to come out correctly on other parsers ?
