Good morning. 
 
Please permit me to reach you on your private capacity irrespective 
of the fact that we hardly know ourselves but I have been referred 
to you by an associate who has assured me of your reliability. 

I am sure you have heard of my late uncle General Sani Abacha who 
was the late head of state of my country and you know that he was 
a very wealthy man before he died. Unfortunately he died interstate 
suddenly and most of his assets were not known immediately. It has 
taken a while to discover the extent of his assets both here and 
in Europe and North America. It is worthy to note here, that the 
late General while in power did made to be taken out of this country 
in diplomatic cases huge amount of money in excess of US$100 million. 
The monies are presently in the safe custody of a security firm.
 
The fact remains that inspite of this huge wealth the immediate 
family of the late General are going serious severe financial hardship. 
Attempts in the past to have known and very close associates to 
retrieve some of this funds have been met with betrayals. Thus this 
decision to use a neutral person not known to the family but of 
high integrity and of average financial standing who would not abscond 
with the money to be entrusted in his care was decided on.
 

I will like you to think carefully before you make a response to this 
proposal as there is a limit to which I can divulge at this moment due to
the sensitivity of the matter in hand but should you wish for more explanation
please do not hesitate to contact me. I will also like, please keep it confidential.
 
I thank you in anticipation of your prompt response. Please in your response, it 
Will be helpful if you could include your phone numbers for quick access to you. Thank you
  
Yours truly,
 
Aruna Banda
