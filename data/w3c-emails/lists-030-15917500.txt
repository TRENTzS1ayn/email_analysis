Hi,

My first comment.

I think there is an error in the coords-units-BE-O4.svg test.

The following lines are excerpt of the svg files

<svg  id="svg-root" width="450" height="450">


(1)
<!-- Draw marker using percentages: 7.5 = 1.667% of 450                -->
<circle cx="1.667%" cy="1.667%" r=".3333%" style="fill:red"/>

(2)
<!-- in user space. 3.536 = .785% of 450px                              -->
<circle cx="20" cy="0" r=".785%" style="fill:green"/>


Well, the specification says that the radius (r) of a circle is a length
unit, and so a percentage refers to the length of the viewport NOT its
width or height
so
(1) means r =  0.3333% of sqrt(450 * 450 + 450 * 450)
(2) means r = 0.785% of sqrt(450 * 450 + 450 * 450)  which is 4.99  and not
3.536.


And the result should look like

(See attached file: coordbe4.png)
However thanks to Chris Liley and others for this test suite.
