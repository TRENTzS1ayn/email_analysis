INTRODUCING PRINTHOTLINE
Trade printing and graphics referral service.

Printing Distributors and Resellers

Whether you are a printer that uses other printers for work you do not 
produce in-house, whether you are a graphic design firm, an advertising 
agency or a print broker, PRINTHOTLINE will make your job easier.  
PRINTHOTLINE is created to assist in the outsourcing of printing and 
graphics services.  If you would rather spend your time getting new 
customers, visit us on www.printhotline.com and let us refer you to 
qualified trade printing and graphics companies.

We realize the importance of establishing relationships with quality 
vendors and that is why we introduce you to qualified trade printing 
companies and allow you to work directly with these companies so that 
you can form long-term relationships with them. 
Our role is strictly in the referral process, once the project begins, 
distributor and manufacturer work directly with one another.


Trade Printing and Graphics Manufacturers

When it comes acquiring new customers, being a trade printing or 
graphics company can have its difficulties.  Having the same avenues 
of promoting your business, whether through journals or word of mouth, 
the choices are very limited.  For a fraction of advertising in printing 
journals, PRINTHOTLINE provides an alternative marketing medium.  
PRINTHOTLINE now has several options through which you can partner 
with us.  Whether you like to pay per job or whether you prefer a flat 
annual listing fee, we have created our new PRINTHOTLINE partnership 
arrangements with feedback from trade printing providers from all facets 
of our industry.  If you want continuous leads for new business, chances 
are we have a partnership option for you.  For more information visit 
www.printhotline.com or call 1-877-447-HOTLINE  for additional details.
