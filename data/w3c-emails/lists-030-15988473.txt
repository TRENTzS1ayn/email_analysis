Hello.

I'm trying to implement an svg viewer, but I don't understand the test:
coordSystem-unitsProcessing-BE-04.svg

especially the 3 skewed circles with radius expressed in user space
units, pixels, and percentage.

How exactly is the radius computed ? There is some discussion
as comments in the test file, but it's still strange for me...

First, the inverse matrix is computed.
Then the length ot the diagonal of the viewport.
Then something in relation with what could be the "translate"
coordinates
of the inverse matrix, then the radius.

Could someone be kind enough to explain me what happens here ?
I find the CR pretty vague on that subject...

Thanks,

    st?phane.
