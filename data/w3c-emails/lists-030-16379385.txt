Hello.

I am writing to inform you we have several IC Design and ASIC Verification
Engineers and 2 FAE's looking for permanent or consulting opportunities.
They were victims of a recent company shutdown and are eager to resume work;
IC, FPGA, circuit design, verification, synthesis, physical design, mixed
signal, SRAM/DRAM, EDA tools, verilog, VHDL.

As requested by one of the candidates, I visited your website and was
quickly convinced you would likely have an interest in speaking with one or
two of these individuals.

If so, may I ask who would be an appropriate contact and to whom would I
forward a resume?

Thank you in advance for any attention you can afford.  Please advise or
telephone directly when convenient.

Cheers.
