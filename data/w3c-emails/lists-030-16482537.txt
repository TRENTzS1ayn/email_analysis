Dear Sir,

I am writting you with trust and confidential, my name is GABRIEL MOPUNDU
from the Republic of Angola. And I got your contact from a business Journal I received at the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce, and after due consideration after going through your profile, I became aware and assured of your credibility of handling this profitable transaction. Thus, my humble decision to solicit for your understanding and cooperation in this business that will benefit you and I.

At the mid term of the rebellion which is still on till date, my father
thinking fast decided to send my brother and I out of the countr(Angola)with a total sum of (US$68M.)Sixty Eight million United states Dollars only,sealed in a Diplomatic Bag meant for the purchase of Arms and Ammunitions for the rebels.

And the bills were carefully defaced for security reasons.
On arrival in Ivory Coast (Abidjan) because we are political Asylum seekers, we were not allowed to operate a bank account, so with the instruction of my father I deposited the boxes in a security company, though I did not declare the content to them.And unfortunately because of my father's polical
influence, he was assasinated.

We need your help by coming to Abidjan, Republic of Cod'ivour to open a non-residence bank account with any of the Local banks, though we are still in Lagos to negotiate the transfer of our money, since we can not speak/talk French,it becomes difficult for us to negotiate properly.The non-residence account will enable the onward telegraphic transfer of the funds to your nominated bank account. The whole arrangement will be strictly under our supervision and the transaction will be absolute Risk-Free. Also, the whole transaction
will take three working days from the day of your arrival.

We intend to share the money upon sussesful completion of the transaction as follows:25% will be entitled to you for your assistance, while 75% will be for us. Should this meet your utmost consideration, please give us your earliest reply through Tel/Fax. Feel free to ask any question you consider necessary.

The confidentiality in this transaction can not be over emphasized as
we trust and believe that you will oblige us the security and attention
it demands. Please treat this transaction with absolute confidentiality.
Thank you very much.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

GABRIEL MOPUNDU
