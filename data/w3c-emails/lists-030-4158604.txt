DEAR FRIEND
 I KNOW THAT THIS LETTER WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE BUT PLEASE PERMIT ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF I AM MOHAMMED SANNI ABACHA THE ELDEST SON OF THE LATE GENERAL SANNI ABACHA FORMER PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER- IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA AS YOU MIGHT BE AWARE OF HOW I HAVE BEEN IN PRISON DETENTION  SINCE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER ON THE 8TH OF JULY 1998 FOR AN OFFENCE I NEVER COMMITTED NOR NEW ANYTHING ABOUT. HOWEVER, WITH THANKS TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD AND  OUR JUDICIARY I WAS JUST RELEASED AFTER THE COUNTRY'S  SUPREME COURT RULED OUT THAT I BE RELEASED  AFTER FINDING NO CASE AGAINST ME.   
  BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER,  I WAS ABLE TO KNOW AS THE ELDEST SON OF SO MANY OF HIS BUSINESS AND MONETARY TRANSACTIONS WORLDWIDE. SO I AM SOLICITING YOUR CO-OPERATION AND ASSISTANCE TOWARDS THE WITHDRAWAL OF CLAIMS OF A TOTAL SUM OF FUNDS WHICH CURRENTLY DEPOSITED IN WITH A SECURITY COMPANY AND BANKS WITH BRANCHES IN EUROPE AND OTHER CONTINENTS .THE FUNDS IN QUESTION TOTAL OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS ONLY (USD132,000,000.00, AND WITH A SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FROM MY LATE FATHER'S FOREIGN FINANCIAL BROKER, THE FUNDS WERE SUCCESSFULLY DEPOSITED AT OVERSEAS SECURITY COMPANY AND BANKS.

  NOW, ALL I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR READINESS AND WILLINESS TO ASSIST ME IN WITHDRAWING THOSE FUNDS OUT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY OVERSEAS. I SHALL FURNISH YOU WITH THE NECESSARY DETAILS OF THE DEPOSIT STATUS AND THE PIN CODE OF THE ACCOUNT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY DEPOSITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FUNDS WHERE DEPOSITED IN A COMPANY'S NAME.I SHALL ALSO FURNISH YOU YOU WITH THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION OF THE THE COMPANY WHICH WILL ENABLE YOU TO CLAIM THE FUNDS WITHOUT PROBLEMS.
  BECAUSE OF SO MANY YEARS I HAVE SPENT IN PRISON AND DUE TO THE FACT THAT I REALLY HAVE LOST CONTACT WITH BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES. I SHALL ALSO REQUIRE YOU TO SEND ME AREAS OF INVESTMENT ONCE YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RE-TRANSAFERRED THE FUND INTO YOUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT FROM IT'S PRESENT LOCATION. IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT I CANT BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE FUNDS 
TRANSFERRED OUT FROM THE ACCOUNT MYSELF DUE TO THE BAD IMAGE THIS COUNTRY HAS PAINTED MY FAMILY SINCE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER.

  ON RECEIPT OF YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE, I SHALL BE READY TO NEGOTIATE ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE FUNDS THAT WILL BE GIVEN TO YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR EALIEST RESPONSE. AND PLEASE ATTACH YOUR PHONE NUMBER WHILE REPLYING.
MAY THE ALMIGHTY, THE MOST GRACIOUS AND THE MOST MERCIFULL BLESS YOU AS YOU ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY.
