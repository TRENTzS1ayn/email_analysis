Subject: Save My Family and Fortune 
Tell. 002379669996

This letter may come to you as a surprise as we have not met, but it is a serious matter. 
I am desperately in need of help.  I am Mr. Toma savimbi, son of the late rebel leader 
Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of February 2002. I managed to 
get your contact details through the Internet.  Time is of the essence and I am desperate.
My late father, Jonas Savimbi was able to deposit some funds abroad  with a Security 
Company that he intended to make purchases with.  Our movement presently (including 
me) is restricted. We were released from the restrictions of Angola and has thus 
relocated temporarily to Cameroon.  Right now the Government is trying to lay claim to 
some of his wealth by saying it was gained through arms smuggling and by my father's 
extended family and relations who want a share of his properties at any cost.

 Most of his wealth remains hidden, to even me. I, being close to my father, happen to be
 in possession of documents and information of some of the wealth.  Presently, the
 US$ 14,200,000.00 (Fourteen Million, two hundred thousand United Stated Dollars) cash 
my father transferred to abroad before his death for some purchases he intended to 
make and it is now safe in a security firm. I have the pass code and the documents to
 the security firm. This is where I will need your help because at present I want to act 
fast before the Angolan Government finds out. 

I have the previlage in contacting you for an urgent assistance in this transaction. 
We have arranged to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% for 
all expenses to be made and 75% for my family.

Moreover, the political climate in Angola at the moment is so sensitive and unstable. With
 this password and information and power of attorney you will be able to proceed to the 
security firm. But you will also have to give me a guarantee first. When you are ready,
 I will give you the information needed before you can get access to the funds.  You will 
then proceed to the security company where the funds will be given to you as payment.

YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE NEEDED.

Yours sincerely, 

TOMA. SAVIMBI.
