beneficiary?s next of kin. All documents and proves

out. We have secure from the probate an order of
madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries, and
more so we are assuring you that this business is 100%

purpose. According to agreement within both parties.

proposal, we would furnish you with the necessary
modalities and disbursement ratio to suite both
parties without any conflict.
