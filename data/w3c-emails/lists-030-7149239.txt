Why?  If an author doesn't need a tag, s/he doesn't have to use it.
We've all been doing this stuff for over a decade--I don't see any
inconvenience.

The only overhead of "extra tags" is in DTD maintenance and possible
tool support.  Since the same tools will probably be used by all the
working groups, the support effort is required--and will probably be
easier if there is only one DTD.

As far as DTD maintenance is concerned, one could argue both ways,
but I would think having one DTD shared among a fairly small set of
WGs--especially if managed by Eve--is still well within the limits
of tractable and any overhead is outweighed by other benefits.

The key benefit is being able to take any XML-related spec and read
it using *the* DTD/stylesheet/whatever you've already set up without
having to futz around all over the Web finding the right customization
layer and twiddling stylesheets/scripts/whatever.
