W3C specifications are produced in all sorts of ways,
from emacs, to MS Word and everything in between.
They eventually end up as HTML, and sometimes as postscript,
PDF, or .txt. Sometimes they're submitted to the IETF
or ISO as well.

I have been maintaining a page about the problems of
maintenance, management, and production issues
in open specs since Dec '95 at:

http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SGML/spec-mgmt

I am seeing a lot of investment in tools for this
purpose by W3C staff and collaborators, and I suspect
we can begin to share resources, or at least compare
notes.

The only person subscribed right now is me. Access

but I prefer not to announce it widely just now.
