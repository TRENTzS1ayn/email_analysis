The many standards development organisations (SDO's) each have their
own ways of physically producing standards.  Some have chosen to go
with word processors, others leave it to the ingenuity of the editors
to produce camera-ready copy.

Occasionally SDOs share text e.g. ECMA and ISO/IEC, and sometimes they
even share style e.g. ISO/IEC/ITU.  From an editor's point of view, it
would be ideal to have some common ground: some way of interchanging
text while respecting each house style.  Such common ground could also
be the starting point for a common approach by editors.

Could (or should) the DTD used for XML be considered as a candidate?

Is it even in the scope of this list to consider the exchange of text
between SDO's?  The subject of Dan's invitation dated Fri, 27 Feb 1998
was "New forum for discussion of W3C Spec Production Issues", but the
invitation did mention the submission of text to other SDO's.
