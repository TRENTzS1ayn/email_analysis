Hi all,

the current XML specification DTD defines:

<!ENTITY % header.mdl
        "title, subtitle?, version, w3c-designation, w3c-doctype,
        pubdate, notice*, publoc, prevlocs?, latestloc?, authlist,
        status, abstract, pubstmt?, sourcedesc?, langusage,
        revisiondesc">

With this the lastest version must be after the (possibly many) previous
versions. Although this order can be reversed when converted to HTML I
would like it to be changed in the DTD. The reason is that access to the
latest version of a document is considered (at least by the W3C staff)
very important. So it would be nice if we could change the DTD to
accomodate this.
Thanks.
