I have now upgraded the DOM spec to the latest xml DTD. Doing so, I
think I've found a bug in it. The table element doesn't appear to be
allowed *anywhere*!?
I think in the following definition:

<!ENTITY % illus.class          "eg|graphic|scrap|htable
                                %local.illus.class;">

"htable" is meant to be "table". Or maybe the two are meant to be
allowed?

As far as the DOM spec is concerned, I worked around this by defining
local.illus.class as "|table", but you probably want to fix this.
