Hello all-- I've now made public the latest version of the XML 
specification DTD:

DTD:http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-

Documentation:http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-

Hi Eve,

I notice that the XML spec doesn't currently match up to this DTD. There are a few small things that need to be done to make it match:

1) add the attribute "align" to table: the html-tbl.mod file originally used had 
          align         (left|center|right)         "left"

2) add the attribute "bgcolor" to td: the html-tbl.mod file originally 
had
        bgcolor         CDATA           #IMPLIED

3) The XML spec uses xml:link, whereas the newer DTD uses 
xlink:form. I guess this problem is going to keep on happening; I'd 
personally rather keep the xml:link form until the XLink WG has 
figured out what they're doing. But I don't feel all that strongly 
about it. 

4) The abstract and status seem to switch positions depending on 
the WG. The DTD just needs to have 
((status, abstract)|(abstract,status))
instead of 
status,abstract
in the content model of header.mdl

cheers,


Lauren
