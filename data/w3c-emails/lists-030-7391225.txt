Yep, I'm aware that the XML V1.0 specification is out of sync with the
progression of the DTD.  There are actually a few more differences that
I've noted, too.  The variability of the status and abstract positioning is
new to me, but I can add that.

I've committed to producing a version of the DTD that works with the
original spec for people's convenience, though I've cleverly avoided
committing to a specific date... :-)  I hope it will be soon; thanks for
the reminder and the design notes.
