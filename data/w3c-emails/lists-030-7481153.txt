Paul-- Thanks for the comments and the compliments!  Here's a quick
response to your requests for DTD enhancements.  I'll probably wait for a
few weeks to collect comments from all the new editors, and then do another
revision.

This is probably not going to get changed.  The current structure allows
you to have highly structured list items (such as a paragraph, a code
listing, and another paragraph).  Putting everything in a big mixed content
bag would allow mixtures of paragraphs with raw #PCDATA, or alternatively
would allow only a single paragraph-like blob for every item.

If you begin using the ADEPT environment, the <p> tags will become pretty
transparent and (e.g.) get inserted automatically when you begin typing.

For me, this is a good enough rationale for expanding the content model!

I'll keep an eye on this, and see if the model needs updating and/or the
semantics need tightening up over time.
