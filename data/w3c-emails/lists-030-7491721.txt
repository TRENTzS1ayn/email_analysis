No, I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with using the
extensions.
It just took me alittle while to figure out why I couldn't get use the
stylesheet
with IE5b2 since it wasn't documented that the stylesheet only worked with
a particular verson of XT.  For those who don't know, the extensions are the
 use of next-element() and previous-element() in select patterns.  I
actually
thought the extensions themselves are a great idea.  By "they will be gone
by
next WD" do you mean that there will be a better way to do the same thing
in the next WD of XSL?

I'll try to clean up the changes and post here real this weekend or the
begining
of next week.
