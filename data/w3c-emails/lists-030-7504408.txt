Things like this are design tradeoffs that have a very good motivation.
In a lot of cases, the list items are only used to contain a single
logical paragraph, as Paul has shown in his example. And, as Paul says,
for those cases it seems preferable to be able to avoid having to use
an extra layer of paragraph markup. However, some list items might
contain more than one logical paragraph, or even a subordinate list.
In that case, the need for extra layers of paragraph or paragraph-like
markup is absolutely essential. Unfortunately, this means that the
simple case is harder than it might otherwise be, but the more complex
case is possible.
