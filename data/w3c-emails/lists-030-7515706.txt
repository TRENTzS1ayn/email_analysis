Absolutely right, and very important.

I once perpetrated a content model that attempted allow *both* a
simple form of the simple case, and a reasonable form of the more
complex case, by defining list items (in the TEI DTD) as

  ((%paraContent;) | (%m.chunk;)+)

This does make the simple case simple.  It also makes the more complex
case possible.  But it is responsible for more incomprehensible error
messages than any other single thing in the TEI DTD, and I now regard
it as an unmitigated disaster.

So while I understand Paul's note, I agree with Murray that in this
case the DTD is probably doing what it ought to be doing.  I believe
that in some tools, you can persuade the editor to open a paragraph
element whenever you open a list item; unfortunately not all tools
can manage that.
