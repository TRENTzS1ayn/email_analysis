Paul Grosso sent me an XMLspec comment in private correspondence this week,
and it started what we thought was an interesting discussion.

The issue was whether a copyright element should be added to the DTD, so
that a copyright statement could be supplied in fairly "cooked" form so
that it would appear in the various outputs.  I suggested that a stylesheet
might be able to output the copyright statement, if it were pretty much
boilerplate.

Paul then asked (I copy with his permission):

>Is a document properly copyrighted if the copyright is only
>in it stylesheet?
>
>I post .xml and .htm files for the XML Fragment spec.  Is
>the .xml file on the public W3C server properly copyrighted 
>if the copyright statement is only in the .fos file on my
>laptop?
>
>I think I better re-instate my request for a copyright block.
>
>Currently, I'm putting the copyright info in the ultimate
>paragraph of the status section, but it would be nice to
>have a real block for it, and I don't think removing the
>copyright from the .xml file entirely is a good idea.

I responded:

>This is an issue that I've dealt with with several customers, and it also

Does anyone have an opinion about what should happen in XMLspec, or have
comments about this issue in general?
