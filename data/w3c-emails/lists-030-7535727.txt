I haven't thought it all through, but here's one
thing I know: *DON'T* omit the copyright statement
from the source, assuming it'll get put in by the
stylesheet.

Also: *DON'T* treat the copyright stuff as a boilerplate
issue. THINK HARD about it, every time you share
a copy with anybody, if not every time you hit the
save button.
