Fair enough.  The source should be protected, so it needs (I would think) a
"cooked" copyright statement -- all necessary text present and accounted
for in the flesh.  I can add an element for this.

The problem would come in if you wanted to ensure that each form of output
is protected; I don't think you can.  Even if you have an element with the
copyright statement in it, you can never guarantee that it will be
displayed, or displayed without harmful further processing.
