Following is a document that summaries all the XMLspec processing
applications that I know about.  I haven't tested them, or even really
tested most of the URLs that were provided.  Please let me know if you have
corrections or additions.  After it has fermented a bit, I'll make it
available somewhere on the W3C web site and announce it in the usual
forums.  I'll try to keep it up to date.

BTW -- the actual list is pretty impressive!  Thanks to all for
contributing your work!

Eve
