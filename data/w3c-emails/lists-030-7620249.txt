I took a quick look.  It's a pretty well architected and documented DTD.
The metadata and overall structure are specific to RFCs and have a bit of
fancy stuff, but the design level is quite appropriate considering its
purpose.  The markup for the actual content is extremely thin; you
basically get paragraphs, lists, figures, and cross-references.

If someone forced me to union the RFC DTD and XMLspec, the result for the
document metadata would be somewhat messy because each domain has its own
metadata requirements, but for the content would probably be a straight
adoption of the XMLspec stuff.

FWIW,

Eve

p.s. I'm a hair's breadth away from publishing a new XMLspec DTD and
documentation.  This is the version that has the DOM markup and a few other
touches in it; this time the documentation also lists the known XMLspec
applications and how to get them.  I just need to sort out a bug in the
stylesheet that turns my DocBook into HTML...
