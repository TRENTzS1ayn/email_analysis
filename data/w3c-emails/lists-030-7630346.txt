I've made public the latest version of the "XML specification" (XMLspec)
DTD and its documentation.  Please note that this DTD has undergone
extensive development since it was used to encode the XML V1.0
specification, and is not backwards-compatible with that document.  In the
next few weeks, I hope to release a version of the DTD that will work with
the XML specification.

DTD:
  http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-19990205.dtd
Documentation:
  http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-19990205.htm

This version of the DTD primarily accomplishes the following:

- Fixed character entities to be fully XML-compliant
- Added IDL definitions element structure for the DOM spec
- Fixed various class and mixture entities
- Added clarifying comments to linking elements
- Used xlink:form instead of xml:link on XLink elements
  (can be changed back by modifying an entity)

A new documentation feature is a section advertising some of the
applications known to work with XMLspec.  NOTE: No claims are made about
suitability of these applications or their ability to work with new
versions of the DTD!  See:

  http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-19990205.htm#APPS

This announcement is also being sent (not cross-posted simultaneously) to
spec-prod@w3.org, w3c-xml-plenary@w3.org, and xml-dev@ic.ac.uk.  Please
feel free to forward this announcement to other forums, or to mirror the
DTD and document on other sites, as appropriate.  Please direct comments to
me at elm@arbortext.com.
