Eve,
Why isn't a glist, which is meant to be used for a glossary, just a list
of termdef elements?
My problem is that I'd like to use termref to refer to terms defined in
our glossary, but termref is supposed to be used along with termdef. And
our glossary which is a glist doesn't contain any termdef, but gitems
made of labels and defs.

BTW, there is a typo in Table 6-1 [1], the example for termref uses
termdef where you mean termref.
