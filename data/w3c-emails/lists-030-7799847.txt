Hmm, the current XML dialect has all sorts of semantic markup for
stuff like BNF and conformance constraints and so on.  Switching to
XHTML for HTML-like stuff (ordered lists, paragraphs) seems obvious;
but I'm not sure how you avoid that batch processing step if you want
to use fancy div/span or table machinery to make BNF look good and 
so on.  -Tim
