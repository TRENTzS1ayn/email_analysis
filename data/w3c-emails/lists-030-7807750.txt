First, I'd rather use CSS2 table style stuff than HTML <table> markup
to decorate BNFs and such (someday, at least...)

Second...
I'm not necessarily trying to avoid the batch processing step
altogether.
The idea is that
-- without the batch process, you can still use a web browser
to get a rough idea of your document
and
-- after you run the batch process, you don't throw away the results,
but rather fold them back into the source.


So I'd probably do something like:

<s:grammar><dl>
<dt>lhs <s:c>::=</s:c></dt>
<dd>rhs...<s:constraintRef>
<a href="#const-no-pickles"><s:c>CONSTRAINT:</s:c> no pickles</a>
</s:constraintRef></dd>
</dl>
</grammar>

<s:constraint><h3><a name="const-no-pickles">No Pickles</a></h3>
<p>Pickles are not allowed at this point in the sandwich due
to the risk of allergic reaction.</p>
</s:constraint>

for grammars with constraints.

And with the right tools, the <s:c> stuff would be added by machine
from source that looked like:

<s:grammar><dl>
<dt>lhs</dt>
<dd>rhs...<s:constraintRef>
<a href="#const-no-pickles">no pickles</a>
</s:constraintRef></dd>
</dl>
</grammar>

<s:constraint><h3><a name="const-no-pickles">No Pickles</a></h3>
<p>Pickles are not allowed at this point in the sandwich due
to the risk of allergic reaction.</p>
</s:constraint>
