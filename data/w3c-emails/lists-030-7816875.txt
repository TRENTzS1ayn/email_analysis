FWIW, the XMLspec documentation discusses some of the issues surrounding 
making XMLspec a relative of HTML:

   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-v20.htm#ISSUES

I'm kind of interested in the idea of "augmenting" the content of an 
XMLspec document with generated material, but worry about people editing it 
by hand when in a hurry.  (I've seen it happen in many a production 
environment.)

Also, over time, XMLspec has gotten more specific/semantic, not less, and 
all these constructs are miles away from HTML.  I'm not sure that much is 
gained by connecting them artificially, especially if we can commit 
(finally :-) to making a good, official XSLT stylesheet that transforms 
into HTML.  I believe this is what Ben Trafford has been working on.
