I've upgraded the XMLspec DTD to Version 2.1.  You can find it here:

   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec.dtd (latest DTD)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-v21.dtd (this release)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report.htm (latest doc'n)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-v21.htm (this release)

Changes since V2.0 are all backwards compatible.  The changes that will be 
of most interest to spec authors are as follows (see the DTD or 
documentation for an exhaustive list):

- Added the proto element for function prototypes a la XPath.
- Added the phrase-level elements function, var, sub, sup, phrase,
   el, att, and attval.
- Allowed status and abstract to appear in the W3C-dictated order.
- Updated XLink usage somewhat.
- Added a common diff attribute.
- Added a div5 element.
- Expanded the issue markup to handle issues lists better.
- Added an example element.

Though the documentation is accurate with respect to V2.1, it's getting 
long in the tooth; when I do V3.0 I'll try to overhaul it and add lots of 
examples.  I do plan a V3.0 that will have some backwards-incompatible 
changes; I will distribute it with an XSLT stylesheet to upgrade legacy 
documents.

Ben Trafford and Chris Maden are working on a canonical XSLT stylesheet for 
converting XMLspec documents to HTML; it will cover all markup and will use 
approved W3C style.  It will be announced here when it becomes available.

If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to let me know.
