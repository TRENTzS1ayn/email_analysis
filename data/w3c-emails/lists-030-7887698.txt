Thanks, we'll try and bring the mathml spec into line...

Do you have copies of the current MathML spec stylesheets?
They are available (W3C access) at 
http://www.w3.org/Math/Group/spec/style
but I could send copies to anyone without access if that is a problem.
Hopefully we could rebuild our  HTML one as an extension importing any
`canonical' HTML sheet. Currently it is a much modified sheet based
originally on Eduardo Gutentag's xmlspec.xsl.

Also there is an XSL sheet going to latex that is used for the two
pdf versions of the mathml spec but would probably work for any other
xmlspec based document. If I thought anyone would use it we could
redo this as a `canonical' sheet for xmlspec which is imported by a
mathml specific stylesheet.

Also at the above URL is a stylesheet that converts an XSL stylesheet
that writes HTML to one that writes XHTML (taking care of compatibility
issues like avoiding <hr/>) This is used for the XHTML version of the
mathml spec.
