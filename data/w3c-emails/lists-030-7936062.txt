I'm happy to collaborate on designing a joint DTD.  I have a suspicion that 
the header requirements are pretty different, but this could be 
modularized.  In fact, there's already a parameter entity in the XMLspec 
DTD that allows you to substitute your own stuff.  Please note that the 
latest XMLspec information is at the following locations:

http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-v21.htm
http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-v21.dtd

(I think there may be something funny going on with the "latest version" 
links provided in the documentation, so stick with the specific V2.1 links 
for now.)
