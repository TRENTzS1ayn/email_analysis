This is actually what I'm most interested in. If you are writing a W3C spec,
you don't have to worry about the expires field. If you are writing an IETF
spec you don't have to worry about the latest version field. But if you are
writing for both it's easy (one document, two XSLTs), and it'll pool our
experiences in writing a spec schema/dtd for everything else.

I started my unsuccessful path in finding the latest version at:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/spec.dtd
which states:

Neither of which exist ...
