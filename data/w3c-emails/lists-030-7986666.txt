Ok, done.

I'm not following. RFC2222 [1] requires ASCII. [2] specifies an XML source
format that could generate ASCII. RFC2629 specifies an XML source format
that generates ASCII and HTML. So we don't have to go from source (xml) ->
output (pdf) -> source (xml) -> ascii ?

ASCII art is tricky. However, this bit only hassles those that need to
present in both the IETF and W3C. One could have a graphic element type, and
an alternative type, which might even be included as the Web Accessibility
Initiative encourages this sort of thing.

However, one day there might be neat SVG to ASCII art formats, AND you never
know, IETF might permit HTML/XML one day. <grin>

Do you have a public list set up for discussion of and maintaining 2629? If
not, would you mind having those discussion in this forum? Dan Connolly,
would this be acceptable to you as the guy that started this list?
