I'm against creating large DTDs and would much prefer that we 
have smaller DTDs with more rigorous structure. Creating the "one-
size-fits-all" DTD often ends up with a DTD that doesn't really fit 
anything, and people end up making subsets again. 

If we really can't transform from the current style of spec DTD to 
the IETF style of documents, then that says to me that they're so 
different that they should use different DTDs, i.e. they really are 
different classes of documents.
