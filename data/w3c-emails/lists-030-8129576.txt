The Math working group has some experience with the XMLspec DTD,
and we also have the experience that a lot can be done with the
markup this DTD defines and appropriate style sheets.

Daivd Carlisle developed two style sheets (one for HTML, one for LaTeX),
based on earlier work by Eduardo Gutentag. We produce the MathML 2.0
Specification drafts with it, and are quite pleased about the results
so far. We can share our results with Ben for example.
