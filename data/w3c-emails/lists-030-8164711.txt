Or even the Amaya Make Book function, which uses types of link within HTML
documents to construct a single HTML document from a collection of liked
documents. In any event, I agree that a single version is handy.

  If I may use this occasion, one suggestion I have for the MathML specs
  (both 1.0 and 2.0) and some others is that they offer a variant (usually
  something like PostScript or PDF) that allows the thing to be printed
  out in one go.
