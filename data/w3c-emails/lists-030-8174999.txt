If you have member access to w3.org, you will find the style sheets in

http://www.w3.org/Math/Group/spec/style/html

and

http://www.w3.org/Math/Group/spec/style/pdf

This is the 'public' (read-only) CVS sand-box of our working group.

Please note that the Math WG uses LaTeX as an intermediate format 
to produce a single PDF document for the MathML Specification.

If you do not have member access, I can send a tar or zip archive.
