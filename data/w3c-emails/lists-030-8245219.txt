Hello!

I'm working on the mother of all stylesheets for the XML-based
specifications, and I need some explanation as to how to format the
following elements, which appear to be specific to the DOM spec:

attribute, case, component, constant, definitions, descr, enum, 
enumerator, exception, group, interface, member, method, module, param, 
parameters, raises, reference, returns, sequence, struct, typedef, 
typename, union

Any help that can be offered would be vastly appreciated. Alternately,
somebody could just ship me the XML source of a DOM spec with the
stylesheet you're using, and I can figure it out from there.

:)
