Thanks for the comments.  I think you're right about reorganizing the 
handling of definitions.  It will take a bit of work to do, especially 
where glossary term definitions get moved into the flow of the text.  But I 
think the result will be good.

The difference is that a link is the thing created/asserted by a linking 
element.  And notice that XLink defines elements that aren't "linking 
elements"; there's only two of those (simple-type and extended-type).
