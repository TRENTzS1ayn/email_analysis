None yet, but I'll treat this as a request and add something like it for 
the next release.

The problem is that sometimes you don't want the content to repeat the URL; 
you want it to say something in English.  Basically, loc is like A.  We 
could make the semantics be CONREF-like; I have no problem with 
that.  (That is, when the content is empty, repeat the href value as the 
content in the output.)  Comments?
