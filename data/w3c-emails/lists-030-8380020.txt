Only that it may be easier to support the second form than the first.

Supporting the first form would be as you describe, and requires a check
for empty content, which is often (always?) complicated.  (I.e. I 
don't know how to do it in XSLT, and the way I have done it in homebrew
systems is invariably a fairly ugly hack.)

Supporting the second seems simpler:  print the content as is, and
if href is unspecified, then use the content as its value.
