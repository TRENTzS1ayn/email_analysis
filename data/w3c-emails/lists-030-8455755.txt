Hi Ian-- I only have a little time right now to respond, but am very 
interested in your project.  More below.

I thought that the DOM folks were using XMLspec.  I specifically included a 
bunch of structures for them a year ago.  Their processing scripts are way 
different from the usual XSLT stylesheet that others use, though.

I would suggest that XMLspec be "canonicalized" and that a web page be 
provided that, given a valid XMLspec input, returns various forms of 
output.  Single-page HTML, chunked HTML, and possibly PDF would be good 
contenders.  The XSLT stylesheet I use (mostly written by Chris Maden, Ben 
Trafford, and me, and currently maintained by Chris) produces a pretty 
close facsimile to W3C HTML/style requirements.

I don't know of any TRs that actually have index entry, though there's 
plenty of in-line markup that could be used to generate hits (and 
interesting kinds of TOCs).  I could also add index entry markup to the DTD 
if anyone's interested.

Difficult given the current markup of XMLspec, since it assemes definitions 
are embedded in the text.  But I've been thinking about adding better 
support for true "glossary entry" markup.

Exists.

Exists, as you mentioned above.  May be useful for more and more TRs, as 
application-specific DOMs are invented.

Please also check out:

   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec.dtd (latest DTD)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-v21.dtd (this release)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report.htm (latest doc'n)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-v21.htm (this release)
   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec.xsl

Note that the XML specification itself, XLink, XPointer, and a bunch of 
other specs are using XMLspec already as-is.  I maintain it actively, with 
new releases every few months.

In summary, I think the idea is great, and we should leverage existing 
tools and practices as much as possible.
