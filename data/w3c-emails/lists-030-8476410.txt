This is true, but if your input is not an arbitrary file but known to be
an XHTML version of a document conforming to the existing HTML
guidelines for a W3C document you have a reasonable chance of getting
at least a first pass translation. The structure of the front page for
example is fairly rigid, so picking up the data from the XHTML
and translating to xmlspec is probably doable, tables (fortunately)
don't require much conversion, etc...

The MathML 1 spec was authored in HTML and we (well Nico, really)
converted it first to Docbook/XML and then (after we discovered xmlspec)
to xmlspec and it didn't require so much hand work to correct the
markup afterwards, That was the basis of the MathML2 spec which then
is authored in XML (in a slightly extended xmlspec dtd) and translated
to HTML, XHTML and tex/pdf via XSL.
