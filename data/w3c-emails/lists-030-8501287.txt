Hello,

I'm glad to see that there's interest in the project
described below. I propose the following:

1) The XML and DOM groups converge on a common DTD for
   their specs (at least a common core). Eve has said that
   she has little time at the moment but is interested. Philippe,
   I propose that you and Eve coordinate on this.

2) Once we have that core format, we figure out how to map
   xhtml to it with an xslt style sheet. I suspect that
   some of the transformations will be quite lightweight 
   (e.g., transform the first H1 of the document into the 
   title element of the common format). We obviously need
   to document the conventions, ensure that available templates
   conform to them, etc.

   David Carlisle has volunteered some time in a few weeks and
   I would be happy to participate in that discussion. I'm happy
   to schedule a phone meeting, say the week of 14 August. For
   example, 15 August at 2pm ET. 

This would already be a good start. Enthusiastic volunteers
welcome,

 - Ian
