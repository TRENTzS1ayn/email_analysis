Can you elaborate on your expected document creation scenario.
I'm still confused as to why we'd want to spend time doing
(2) given (1).  How do you forsee people actually producing
documents?  

The way Eve and I and Lauren Wood (DOM) and, I assumed, most
others generate specs to the xmlspec DTD is to author in XML
that conforms to the xmlspec DTD and then run various transformations
to generate the (x)html.  In that scenario, I don't see how an
xhtml DTD to xmlspec DTD transformation has a useful role.

I'm suspecting you have a different scenario in mind, but I'd
like to hear more about it.
