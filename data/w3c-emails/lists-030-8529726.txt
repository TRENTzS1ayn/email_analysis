Suppose that I don't want to use an XML authoring tool, just
and html authoring tool. If I follow some rules (use of H1,
some classes, etc.), I can still benefit from the scripts
that generate the table of contents, index, etc. One day I'll
start writing in the xmlspec DTD, but not today. So I want
the scripts to be based on the xmlspec DTD with some transformations
available today from xhtml to xmlspec.

For those of us who don't author (yet) directly in XML.
