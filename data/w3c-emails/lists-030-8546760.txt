I had little time last week, but my plan is actually to devote real time to 
this sort of activity in the coming couple of months.

While I can see the value in trying to get people to use "structured" XHTML 
that readily up-converts to XMLspec, I would also try to get people 
interested in using XMLspec directly.  It's not hard, and there are lots of 
tools out there to help people do it correctly.  The fact is that 
specifications have a specific "shape"/structure, and XHTML is too loose 
for it.  For specs iwth frequent publication schedules, it may be 
unreasonable to expect people to up-convert and hand-tweak every time.

This sounds great; I'll keep that time open.
