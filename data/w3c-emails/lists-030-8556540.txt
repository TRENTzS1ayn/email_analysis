[Ian, are you actually on spec-prod?  I wasn't sure, so I copied you.]

I think an important component of ensuring this whole thing works is to 
write up some clear markup/editorial guidelines.  I haven't done this yet 
because there has been no "canonical" stylesheet, but I think there may be 
quite a few specs using the one I use by now, and that will have increased 
their editorial compatibility.  I think it would take one solid day to 
figure out the desired guidelines, and then someone (Ian? me?) could write 
them up.  It helps that I could easily go into Cambridge for meetings.
