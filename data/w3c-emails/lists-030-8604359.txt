Hello,

As follow up to the proposal [1] that Philippe and I sent 
about publication tools for XMLSpec [2], I have reserved the 
Longfellow bridge for a one-hour meeting. Please reply on 
spec-prod@w3.org if you intend to attend the meeting.

Goals of the meeting:

1) Introductions <smile>. There are a number of Working Groups
   using XMLSpec or some flavor of it for their specifications.

2) Identify existing tools and tool needs. [Note: I don't
   want to talk about issues management tools at this meeting.]

3) Identify priority deliverables (e.g., any changes to XMLSpec,
   XSLT transformation from XMLSpec to a W3C TR document).

4) Get people to work on these deliverables.
 
Some questions:

1) What tools do people already use with this DTD?  What 
   transformations can Philippe's Java tools perform?

2) Are there requirements on XMLSpec in order to meet 
   the needs of other Working Groups?

3) Who would like to help design an XSLT style sheet to
   transform a XMLspec doc to a W3C technical report? To convert
   an xhtml document to an XMLSpec document?

4) Do people know about W3C "comma tools" (If not, put a single
   comma after any URI at w3.org to get help)? These tools 
   allow you to html validate, css validate, link check, and 
   perform other tests on documents residing at w3.org.

Other agenda items are welcome. I realize that 12 days notice
for this meeting is not much, and I apologize to those who
would like to attend but cannot. Please indicate whether
you would be interested in attending another call for which 
there would be more advance notice.

Thank you,

 - Ian
