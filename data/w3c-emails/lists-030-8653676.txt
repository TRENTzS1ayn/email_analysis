/ Ian Jacobs <ij@w3.org> was heard to say:
| As follow up to the proposal [1] that Philippe and I sent 
| about publication tools for XMLSpec [2], I have reserved the 
| Longfellow bridge for a one-hour meeting. Please reply on 
| spec-prod@w3.org if you intend to attend the meeting.

I plan to attend.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
