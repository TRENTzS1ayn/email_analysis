/ "Wanwisa Merakha" <wanwisa@thai-itc.com> was heard to say:
| <?xml version='1.0'?>
| <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xsl">

This is an old version of the spec, the correct URI is now

  <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

| If I change to other,it can't work.

If your XSL processor does not recognize the new URI, you need to update
your processor.

                                        Be seeing you,
