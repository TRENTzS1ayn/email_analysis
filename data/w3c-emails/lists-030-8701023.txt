Ian-- As we agreed, I've invited Marshall Rose (IESG) and Karl Best (OASIS) 
to this meeting to help us determine if there is sufficient overlap in the 
publication processes of all these organizations to suggest that we develop 
something in common.  Perhaps we can spend a little time near the beginning 
of the meeting discussing this; if the fit isn't good, then Marshall and 
Karl don't have to stay for the rest of the discussion.
