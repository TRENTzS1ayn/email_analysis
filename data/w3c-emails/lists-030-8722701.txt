Folks,

I've checked in my initial versions of everything at 

  http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/spec-prod/

Someone said they had an FO version, would you send it my way, please?
Someone said they had a chunking version, would they send that, too, please?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
