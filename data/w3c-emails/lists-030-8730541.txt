I am writing an XSL stylesheet, which already produces decent PDF
output.  However, it's far from finished (no toc, def, eg, code, var,
etc.). I should have a more complete version by next week, but if
you can't wait, let me know, and I'll send you the current one.

I've fiddled with xmlspec.xsl to output one file per section. It needs
xt and it generates pretty much the same output as what you can see on
most specs, except the <next> and <previous> links on each slice
because of the xt 'deep space' bug.

I've also made some minor changes to xmlspec.xsl, but I'd also like to 
finalize that before submitting it to your approval (tomorrow or friday).

Max.
