Further to the request in the minutes of Tuesday's telcon, here are
the DTD and stylesheets I use to produce XML Schema Part 1.  Paul
Biron uses the same DTD, but slightly different stylesheets.

Some (but not all!) of the DTD differences from the original are not
strictly speaking necessary, in that they could (should) go in the
internal subset of the schema XML sources, but they were edited in to
the DTD because some XML authoring tool (Author/Editor, maybe) was not 
handling the internal subset properly.
