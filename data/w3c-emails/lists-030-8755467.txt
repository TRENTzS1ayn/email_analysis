Hi all,

After last week's spec-prod telcon, some of you have expressed
interest in the XSL stylesheet I'm writing to produce PDF versions of
specs. Although the current version is far from being complete, I'm
sending it anyway, so you can try it out and send me comments for
further development.

A few notes:

-Since it's based on xmlspec-v21.dtd, it'll probably work only on
specs that follow that dtd. The only one I've found that's (almost)
compliant is the xlink CR [1].

-As I've only tried this stylesheet on xlink, a few templates (for
elements that don't appear in xlink) haven't been written yet. If you
want support for other specs, send them to me, I'll try them out and
complete the templates.

-The two fo formatters I use are FOP (latest CVS version) [2] and
PassiveTeX [3]. Both have shortcomings, but give acceptable results
and are under active development. Specific comments on each can be
found in the stylesheet. The version I'm sending works ok with fop,
with the exception of leaders (rule fills) in the toc. Making it work
with PassiveTeX requires commenting a few templates out.

-Formatting is loosely based on the html version of w3c specs. Maybe
non HTML-specific formatting rules should be added to the pubrules
document [4]. 

Let me know if you have trouble using it. I might be able to help (it
took me some time to figure out how to make FOP output more than 10
pages ;-)

Max.
