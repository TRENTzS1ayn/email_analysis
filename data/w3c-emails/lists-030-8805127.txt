Hello,

Just a quick status report on the action items from the 15 
August publication tools meeting [1]:

[1] http://www.w3.org/2000/08/15-spec-prod

>    Results of all actions to be sent to [18]spec-prod. Deadline for all
>    action items: 12 September 2000.
>      * EM: Propose harmonized version of various XMLspec DTDs in use by
>        different WGs.
>        Issue: What should the core be? E.g., should it include
>        possibilities for DOM APIs since more than DOM WG are developing
>        these APIs?

Pending.

>      * NW: Propose canonical style sheet for publishing XMLspec documents
>        as W3C technical reports, based on various style sheets in
>        development independently. HH and NW will work together to ensure
>        the unified style sheet available in CVS. Please send your style
>        sheets to Norm at spec-prod.

Norm has set up CVS.

>      * IJ: Update "[19]How to Release a W3C Technical Report" with more
>        information about XML processing. Clean up since some information
>        redundant with respect to [20]publication rules. Include reference
>        to comma tools.
>        IJ: Those present unanimously agreed that information about
>        publication tools should be public.
>        ISSUE: spec-prod is public and so should be any home page for
>        information to editors. How to release a W3C tech report is
>        Member-only.

Pending.

>      * JD: Talk to W3C management about securing resources for ongoing
>        tracking, development, and promotion of publication tools.

Pending.

>      * EM and IJ: Encourage participation on spec-prod by other W3C
>        editors (e.g., by sending email to chairs).

Pending. However, there's an upcoming chairs meeting this month [1]
and that would be a good time to raise this. Note: I'm not sure what
day the chairs meeting will actually take place.
