This would, of course, be a *great* XLink application: Write the 
annotations separately, then make extended links that emanate from the 
specification and generate clickable text and pop-ups.  Tim Bray did this 
in a fairly simple fashion for his Annotated XML Specification; I doubt his 
code has been maintained, but it might be a useful place to start if you're 
interested, and I think it's available (or at least a description of the 
process is) at XML.com.  But since you're "touching" the source files 
anyway, it's not so bad to introduce new text directly into them.

Yes, V2.1 is currently the latest.  You can always get the latest version 
from http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec.dtd.

An interesting idea.  What do people think about building a "layered 
annotation" facility right into the DTD?  Personally, as an XML Linking 
co-chair and XLink editor, I'd rather see an extended-link application. :-)

For the moment, if you want to use the DTD without modification, you could 
perhaps use the <note> element with a role attribute of 
"non-normative-annotation", and then make your stylesheet behave 
differently for those notes.

Thanks for the suggestion!

         Eve
