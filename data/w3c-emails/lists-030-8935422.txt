 What would really interesting he would be to hear about your experiences 
in learning and using the language, and your sense of the things that did 
or did not serve you well in doing this schema.  Thanks.  BTW:  I have 
cross-posted as you have, but wouldn't this discussion belong on 
schema-comments?  schema-dev is for developers of schema processors, I 
think.
