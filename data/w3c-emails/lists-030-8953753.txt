Hi!

As I understand you take care about creating some XSLT stylesheet used
for the creation of XHTML documents from XML documents, and as some of
these documents must be compliant with the W3C's publication rules for
technical reports (Team only: http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules), I would
like to remind you that, following these rules, the W3C's CSS stylesheet
must be the last stylesheet called:
"There must be an absolute link to the appropriate technical
report style sheet as follows. Any internal style sheets are
cascaded before this link; i.e. the internal style sheets must 
not override the W3C tech report styles"

Daniel Veillard (veillard@w3.org) advised me to tell you about that.

Regards,

Dom
