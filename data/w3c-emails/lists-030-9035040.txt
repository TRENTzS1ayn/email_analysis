I hope/expect we can address that presently... the
communication between Amaya and the annotation DB is
just HTTP, and any browser could support it.

In particular, I hope we can hook into the "what's related"
feature of Netscape (and the analog in IE) to at
least list/find annotations, and probably to add them too.

See also: http://crit.org/ for a "live within the constraints
of current browsers" approach. I hope/expect we can
share annotation databases between the Amaya-based client
and a crit.org-like client.
