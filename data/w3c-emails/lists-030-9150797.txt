I added the idea that making changes visible in the documentation is a good
thing. And a link to Norm's tool - thanks Norm. I'll add a bit more about
ways of clarifying that next time I play with it, like "candidate wording"
and why it is helpful to see things in context like that.

cheers

  One thing we started doing in the Linking group during periods of high
  activity was to send out weekly drafts showing the decisions made the
  previous week, along with a "diff" version generated by a process that
  compares the old and new XML, and sets the diff attributes (which get used
  by the diffspec stylesheet to produce change bars).  Norm did the
  comparison tool; I haven't been able to get it running myself, but he was
  kind enough to run it for me.
