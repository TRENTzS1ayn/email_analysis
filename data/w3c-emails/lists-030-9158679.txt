Norm, I've been using my own XSLT stylesheet for xmlspec for a while
instead of the official one, mostly because early beta versions of
MSXML3 were missing features that prevented the "official" stylesheet
from running.  But I ran into a problem trying to get the XInclude last
call published - the stylesheet added boilerplate.  Besides the fact
that this boilerplate was outdated according to pubrules, Dom objected
to the lack of copyright info in the XML source itself.  We pulled the
XML version because we didn't have a timely solution to these problems.
 
I'm now updating to use xmlspec.xsl, and find it has the same problems:
1) xmlspec.dtd has a <copyright> element but it doesn't allow the markup
required by pubrules.  The pubrules should provide xmlspec boilerplate
as well as html boilerplate.
2) xmlspec.xsl overwrites this markup with boilerplate.
3) the xmlspec.xsl boilerplate is obsolete.  This means lots of specs
(most notably the XML Schema recs) have obsolete copyrights in them.
4) xmlspec.xsl embeds the copyright boilerplate within the header
template so it's difficult to override it.
5) xmlspec.dtd doesn't have an equivalent to <abbr>.
6) xmlspec.dtd doesn't allow markup (specifically <abbr>) inside <loc>.
7) &copy; and &reg; aren't defined in xmlspec.dtd, although arguably all
instances should use them.
 
All these problems can be solved in the document's internal subset and
an overriding stylesheet (which I've just done for the next XInclude
version, samples available), but since each of these problems affects
every XML-sourced spec published on the W3C site, it would be nice to
extend xmlspec.dtd and fix xmlspec.xsl in a central location.
 
Would you be willing to work with me and the W3C pub team to resolve
these issues so we can start posting XML version of our specs again?
 
Thanks!
