Eve helps maintain the xmlspec DTD (she is subscribed to spec-prod).

My understanding is that the latest xmlspec DTD allows for putting
the copyright info into the document.  I guess Norm should pull the
code that auto-generates the copyright info in the stylesheet.

As far as &copy; and such, this is XML.  Why don't we use numeric
character entities rather than defining these entities in the DTD?
(I'm not opposed to declaring them in the DTD, but I'm not sure I
see the point.)

I would rather avoid having to have declarations in the internal
subset.  After all, the idea of the xmlspec DTD is to be the common
DTD for these things, so it would be nice to put all that's necessary
into the DTD and avoid modifying the internal subset.

But I ran into a problem trying to get the XInclude last call published - the stylesheet added boilerplate.  Besides the fact that this boilerplate was outdated according to pubrules, Dom objected to the lack of copyright info in the XML source itself.  We pulled the XML version because we didn't have a timely solution to these problems.
