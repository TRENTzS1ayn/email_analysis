I added the copyright element in late 1999 precisely to address the 
source/output copyright concern, though I don't know if anyone ever used 
it.  It contains %hdr.mix;, which resolves to 
(%p.class;|%list.class;|%ednote.class;)+.  I assumed that this would 
accommodate, say, a paragraph of copyight statement information just 
fine.  In what way does it not cover what the pubrules want?

Also, the notice element has been in there forever, and this could be used 
for copyright notices.  (I can't remember what the original motivation was 
for adding it.)
