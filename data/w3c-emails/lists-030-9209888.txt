I think the right thing to do is put the copyright info in the XML
documents. I'm going to update things so that this works as soon as
I can ssh back into dev.w3.org.

(Something broke, on my end almost certainly, but (nudge, nudge)
sysreq hasn't replied to my question about what I need to send to get
that working again...)
