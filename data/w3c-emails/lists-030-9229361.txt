[Returning from much-too-long silence on the spec-prod alias]

/ "Eve L. Maler" <eve.maler@east.sun.com> was heard to say:
| I added the copyright element in late 1999 precisely to address the
| source/output copyright concern, though I don't know if anyone ever
| used it.  It contains %hdr.mix;, which resolves to
| (%p.class;|%list.class;|%ednote.class;)+.  I assumed that this would
| accommodate, say, a paragraph of copyight statement information just
| fine.  In what way does it not cover what the pubrules want?

I think it covers the requirements. I've updated the stylesheet on
dev.w3.org to render the copyright element if it's present in the
header. (If it isn't present, the default statement is generated.)

The source markup below will generate the correct header and remove
the dependency on the stylesheet to point to the correct version of
the IPR statement. (Documents will now carry with them the IPR
statement against which they were published, which is the Right
Thing(TM), IMHO.)
