/ Dominique Hazael-Massieux <dom@w3.org> was heard to say:
| Currently, the XSL stylesheet used to produce TR creates tables to
| present the examples. Would it be possible to switch to CSS as this is
| a case of easily avoidable layout table?

Checked into dev.w3.org today. You need to set the tabular.examples
parameter to a non-zero value if you want the old style.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
