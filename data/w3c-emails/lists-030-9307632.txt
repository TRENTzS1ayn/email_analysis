I just ran across some links in...

[[[
2.1.2 Schema Types

        Nodes contain values that are instances of schema types.
        The following symbols denote schema types: 
             T ranges over _XML schema types_, which are either
             simple or complex.

I was suprised when the _XML schema types_ link took me to a
different spec altogether, rather than some other section
of this spec.

My experience developing specs leads me to recommend...

[[[
When linking from the middle of the document to an external
resource:

  1.Ensure that the link text, title, and context indicate you are
     leaving the document, and 
  2.After the link, link to the reference in the references section,
     and indicate section, page, or whatever is useful for those who
     don't use the link (e.g,. when printed). 

Thus, for example: ... as is done for the 'page' property of
CSS2 ([CSS2], section 13.3.2.).

Ian, I think that stuff about references should be moved to a
separate document... a public one. 30 points if you beat me to it.

Ian, Susan, see also our earlier discussion of things to check
w.r.t references
