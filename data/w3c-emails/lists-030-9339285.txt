Hello all,

Would people be interested in discussing specification production issues at 
the W3C working group event [1]?   I propose a meeting during the BOF lunch 
on Wednesday, 31 January 2001 [2]. Let me know if you're interested and 
what you would like to discuss.

My interest stems from using an XHTML source and XSLT to generate the 
newest versions of WCAG 2.0 (based on the work of Charles McCathieNevile 
and the source for ATAG).  Although I think the spec-prod dtd is cleaner, 
due to constraints of the human editors I am working with, using XHTML will 
make the process much easier.  There are others on the W3C team who are 
interested in using XHTML and there was a suggestion that we discuss the 
classes that we are using.  Perhaps we can create a standard set of classes 
to use with XHTML if one prefers to use that instead of the spec-prod dtd?

However, I am not completely convinced that using classes and XHTML will 
give me as much granularity and control as I would like. Therefore,  a 
discussion with the folks who developed the spec-prod dtd would be 
interesting. I would like to know if XHTML was considered. If it was, were 
there things that you couldn't do with XHTML and classes that you could 
with the spec-prod dtd. Or was XHTML not available at the time the 
spec-prod dtd was created?

Are there other issues to discuss?  Is there follow-up from the 15 August 
meeting [3] that needs to happen?

Be well,
--wendy
