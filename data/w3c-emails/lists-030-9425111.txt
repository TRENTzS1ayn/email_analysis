I'd rather leave these in, seems to be cleaner markup than just relying
on th to distinguish the head.

I just looked into this for MathML which uses a slightly modified
xml-spec DTD and stylesheets which have diverged but have their origins
in Eduardo Gutentag's and James Clark's original xml-spec stylesheets.

The DTD has

        rowspan         NMTOKEN         "1"

so that after DTD processing every th has a rowspan attribute.
The stylesheet copies most attributes from the source to the output
(as the xmlspec table model is largely similar to HTMLs)

  <xsl:copy-of select="@bgcolor|@rowspan|@colspan|@align|@valign"/>

The stylesheet could special case this

  <xsl:copy-of select="@bgcolor|@rowspan[1 != .]|@colspan[1 != .]|@align|@valign"/>


for example. (Maybe I'll do that anyway) but an alternative would be for
the DTD to declare it as #IMPLIED rather than giving a default.
