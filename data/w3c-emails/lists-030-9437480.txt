We found after some trial and error for the MathML spec especially DOM
bindings: 

http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/appendixe.html

that background colors worked OK in netscape 4 so long as you also
specify a solid border. (without a border you get entertaining effects
which vary from platform to platform) (They also worked in IE 4 and 5)
