CMN:

I am interested, I would reckon Monday or Tuesday evening. I want to discuss
tools for working with a spec. (I have been essentially recreating the specML
stuff in XHTML, since I have good editing tools for that...) I'm also
interested in teh topic of using shared glossaries and references - becuase
this makes groups talk the same language - more work to do, but possibly
valuable results. It is sort of tangential.

  As I mentioned this morning, I would like to meet but am
  not attending the plenary in Cambridge. Could we meet again
  by phone, and would any BOF minutes be shared on spec-prod?

  I would like to find out what is adding extraneous markup to tables
  (thead, tbody, rowspan="1" colspan="1"), and whether we can use
  divs rather than tables for examples in XML specs.

  Thank you,
