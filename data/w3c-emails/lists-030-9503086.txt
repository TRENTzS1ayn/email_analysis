I think SVG access is a valuable model. Instead of caption or table
header elements you have a figure number and text caption, which make a
border make sense. The 'strong' markup inside pre brings another
dimension to examples. The whole effect is meaning-encrusted.

This week we got unlabeled pre working pretty well in Netscape 4,6 and
Mac IE 3,4,5 in the CSS3 Selectors WD [1]:

pre {
background-color: #d5d5d5;
margin: 1em 1cm;
padding: 0 0.3cm;
white-space: pre;  /* for NS4 */
border: none;      /* for NS4 */
font-size: 92%;
}

It is unsupported in IE 3 on Macs at least. In the case above,
body is white, and background renders in stair steps so there may be
some use for background-color. (It shouldn't be used for example to
reverse colors in table headers. If body was white, background-color
was black, and text color was white, the header would be invisible.
That might be what Eve is referring to.)
