  I think SVG access is a valuable model. Instead of caption or table

CMN: Thanks Susan <grin/>. I think the use of code elements is still
important - the rest is really a question of presentational markup.

SL:
  It is unsupported in IE 3 on Macs at least. In the case above,
  body is white, and background renders in stair steps so there may be
  some use for background-color. (It shouldn't be used for example to
  reverse colors in table headers. If body was white, background-color
  was black, and text color was white, the header would be invisible.
  That might be what Eve is referring to.)

CMN: Right. Using a slightly different colour combination means that you can
get the best of both worlds - enough contrast (with the bordser and other
devices) to make the examples stand out, with enough to know that if only
some properties work the whole thing is still legible.
