true, but the later siblings are picked up by the template for the
parent:


<xsl:template match="prod">
  <!-- select elements that start a row -->
  <xsl:apply-templates select="
    *[self::lhs or
      ( (self::vc or self::wfc or self::com) and
        not(preceding-sibling::*[1][self::rhs]) or
        (self::rhs and not(preceding-sibling::*[1][self::lhs]))
      )]"/>
</xsl:template>
