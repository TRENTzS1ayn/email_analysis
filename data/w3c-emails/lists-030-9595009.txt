The underlying Proof Engine (at present) is the COQ 
Proof assistant of INRIA-Rocquencourt. But we expect
that our methodology should scale to any other 
Logical Environment or Computer Algebra System,
or whatever inference system you have in mind.
"COQ on line" is currently broken, but it should
be "on" again in a few days.

If you just need a MathML editor, our widget works
much better than Amaya, Mozilla, WebEQ and company.

I hope HELM will be mentioned in your report
on the state-of-the-art in representing
formal knowledge in the web.
Please, use the following url:

By the way, Dan, we should eventually move MathML
inside the Semantic Web area, or at least open
a new WG in that direction. MathML has been the
first WWW project putting emphasis on "semantics."
