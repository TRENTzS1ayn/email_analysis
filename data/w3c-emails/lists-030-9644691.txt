Since I hadn't thought I would be around at all, I haven't been paying too 
much attention to talk of a BOF.  But I *could* make it into Cambridge one 
evening, and if a time hasn't been settled, perhaps we could meet over 
drinks or dinner.  What about 6pm Tuesday 27 Feb or Wednesday 28 Feb?  (I 
fear everyone's booked up for dinner already...)
