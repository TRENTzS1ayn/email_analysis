/ Susan Lesch <lesch@w3.org> was heard to say:
| This week we got unlabeled pre working pretty well in Netscape 4,6 and
| Mac IE 3,4,5 in the CSS3 Selectors WD [1]:
| 
| pre {
| background-color: #d5d5d5;
| margin: 1em 1cm;
| padding: 0 0.3cm;
| white-space: pre;  /* for NS4 */
| border: none;      /* for NS4 */
| font-size: 92%;
| }

I tried this in Netscape 4.x on Linux and it didn't seem to work very
well. Has anyone else tried that?
