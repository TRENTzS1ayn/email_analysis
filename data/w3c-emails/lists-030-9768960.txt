I have written up most of what I have tried to do in the AU sources area
(also linked from WAI/AU home page) at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources

this fulfils an action item I took at the BOF. Note that this stuff is not
complete, and that I realise it needs a bit of updating at some point soon.

cheers

Charles
