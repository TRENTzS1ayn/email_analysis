Okay, thanks.  

Epic handles well-formed XML; non-well-formed stuff isn't XML, so
no promises are made, though some minor errors may be corrected
with an error message upon input.

If the input is (supposedly) valid (as opposed to just well-formed,
that is, if there is a doctype declaration that points to a DTD),
then Epic will do a validity check and give warnings for things
that don't match the DTD.  It generally would not do fixup--certainly
not without warnings.

Epic always generates well-formed or valid XML.

Except in the case of "pre-formatted" elements, Epic wraps content,
so input file indentation and line breaks are not usually retained.
For example, if you read in a file that is the result of HTML Tidy
and then save it out and then look at the result in a text editor,
it will not look as "tidy".  But the logical content is the same,
and the result in a browser should be the same.
