It may also be useful to know that you can get a free Epic add-on that 
supports formatted-view editing of XMLspec documents.  (Epic is generally 
what I use to edit W3C specs.)

There's also XED, a tool from Henry Thompson's group that provides a sort 
of "XML-aware vi" environment.  I was able to pick it up, use it, and 
become surprisingly productive in a short amount of time.
