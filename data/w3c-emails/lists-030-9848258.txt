For those of us not at the meeting, what's the context for this thread?
Is there a specific editing requirement that is being addressed, so far
it seems to be a list of editors (which could be never ending).
Also no one has mentioned emacs (It's hard for me to contemplate editing
in anything other than emacs:-) I think everyone working on the MathML
spec used emacs. 

David
