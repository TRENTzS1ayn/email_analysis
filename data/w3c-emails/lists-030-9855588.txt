In the notes to the meeting there was a discussion of tools that can be used
- one of the reasons for working with an XHTML source instead of the spec dtd
was that it is easier to find friendly HTML editing tools than XML editing
tools. (Especially for those of us with Macintoshes)

For a number of collaborators working in native XML is not a helpful
suggestion, and for others it is less efficient - overuse injuries are
aggravated by dealing with the tag trivia. Not that working with emacs (or vi
or notepad or whatever) is evil, just that it is not for everyone.

Cheers

  For those of us not at the meeting, what's the context for this thread?
  Is there a specific editing requirement that is being addressed, so far
  it seems to be a list of editors (which could be never ending). Also no
  one has mentioned emacs (It's hard for me to contemplate editing in
  anything other than emacs:-) I think everyone working on the MathML spec
  used emacs.
