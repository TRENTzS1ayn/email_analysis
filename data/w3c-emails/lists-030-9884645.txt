So I now have

XHTML:
Dreamweaver - clean roundtrip of code, no XHTML specific support i think,
widely used. Macintosh/Windows - http://www.macromedia.com - commercial

Amaya - XHTML support, Windows/Unix - http://www.w3.org/Amaya - free

XML:
XMLSpy - XML support (XML+CSS?), Windows - - commercial

Xmetal -XML support (XML+CSS), Windows - http://www.softquad.com - commercial

Epic Editor - XML support (XML+CSS with plug-in), Windows/Unix -
http://www.arbortext.com - commercial

Xeena - XML support (tree structure editing), Java -
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/techmain/xeena - I couldn't find
licensing information beyond a comercial license for the whole lot but I
thought that alphaworks software could be used for free.

Both:
emacs - supported text editing, Unix/MacOSX/Windows? - built in to
Unix/MacOSX - free
XED - supported text editing, Unix? - -

Which looks to me like it is possible to do some XML WYSIWYG style editing
that won't break content on systems other than Macintosh, and for the
Macintosh the possiblities include running a windows or unix system (there
are a couple of commercial versions available). I tseems that it is possible
to do XHTML for Macintosh too (maybe you need to run Dreamweaver stuff
through Tidy which is available for Mac - I don't know. I haven't looked very
far yet...)

There's some more stuff at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/tools
