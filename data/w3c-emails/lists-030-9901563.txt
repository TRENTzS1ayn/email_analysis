There is info about the stuff being used to generate AUthoring Tools
documents at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources

It doesn't use the spec-prod dtd it uses XHTML and XSLT tools that often
half-work at this stage (so I would be interested in following up on this).

There is a list of Authoring Tools at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/tools (that
needs updating). Comments on that are also welcome. I already have "add the
results of the recent 'editing tools' thread" on my to-do list.

Cheers

Charles
