Thanks for doing this so quickly!

(BTW, I don't find that the use of the word "ontology" clears anything 
up...  I think "vocabulary" or "markup language" is probably the safest term.)

The HTML versions of the XML 1.0 2e and XLink specs were produced with the 
xmlspec.xsl stylesheet that's in CVS.  The XML version of the XML Base spec 
uses a variant of that stylesheet that Jonathan Marsh created; it's a 
subset of the original that hews to the XSLT version that IE supports.

Proper spelling of Arbortext these days is with lowercase t's.
