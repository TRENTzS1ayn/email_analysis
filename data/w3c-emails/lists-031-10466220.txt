LIBRARY MARKETING LISTS
Library marketing is a lucrative and effective way to help your book marketing efforts. Effective library marketing is essential to ensure success in publishing. Public libraries and college libraries often order in bulk, require little or no discount, and always pay on time. We offer an academic library list, and lists of public, law, medical, religious and K-12 private school libraries. Our library databases can be an important piece in helping you solve the book marketing puzzle. 

Our library databases are more that just mailing address labels. Our academic library lists and public library lists provide you extensive databases from which you can easily create mailing labels, phone and fax lists to market your books and products. 

Our public library lists and academic library lists only include libraries with the largest number of volumes and the largest budgets. Our list of public libraries are the respective headquarters and buy for thousands of their branches. You will not be wasting your book marketing budget on public and college libraries that are unlikely to purchase your books. 

Our public library lists and academic library lists will save you hundreds of hours of work and hundreds of dollars. 
They are available in Text format and Microsoft Excel format. You can choose either or both at no additional cost.
