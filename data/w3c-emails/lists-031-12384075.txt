      Dear Chess Informant friends,

      Thank you very much for cooperating with us on the matter of link
exchange.
      In addition to ongoing technical innovations on the Internet, we have
upgraded and redesigned our banner offer. Therefore we'd also like to kindly
invite you to cooperate with us on the matter of banner exchange as well. We
are very proud to inform you that our banner offer is available at:
www.sahovski.com

      If interested to become a member of our banner exchange associates,
and for all eventual questions regarding this offer, e-mail us at this
address links@sahovski.co.yu

      If you have several e-mail addresses, for the purpose of better
successful cooperation, please contact us from this one (e-mail address that
we have contacted you).

      If not interested to cooperate with us we'd kindly like to ask you to
send e-mail with not interested as a subject.

      Hoping that our cooperation on this matter will continue in the
future,

      With kindest regards,
