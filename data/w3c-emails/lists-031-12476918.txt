Dear sirs,
    I know your website form my friend and vist it! I think you will be interested in our product:htpb.Would you like to vist this product? please look at the below details.


 The hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) was synthesized by free radix polymerization in higher-pressure reactor, with H2O2(50%by weight) as initiator, alcohol as solvent. The appearance of HTPB is a kind of light yellow or colorless liquid.It can  apply as adhesive of solid propellant. 
Introduction: 
  Molecule Structure: HO-??CH2-CH=CH-CH2??n-OH 
1?? Natural Capacity:
  Appearance: Colorless or yellowish transparent liquid .The hydroxyl content (mmol/g) varies from 0.50 to 1.00 and the average molecule weight (g/mol) varies from2300 to 4500. 
 2??Usage:
   HTPB can be used to produce all kinds of adhesive, sealant, coatings, rubber modifier, reaction & injection, typecasting. It can also apply as adhesive of solid propellant, insulation inner lining of engine, healing of engine and coating of submarine.
