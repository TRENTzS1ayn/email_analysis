I believe the following are two problems with the SVG Conformance tests.

http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20011026/masking-property-BE-07-ps.html
  On the reference PNG, overflow:scroll does not show scrollbars.
  Like the Adobe SVG plugin, the PNG shows 'scroll' the same as 'hidden'.

  The .svg file is missing...possibly incorrectly named .xml

P.S. Not an 'error', but the frameset version on IE6/Windows in general looks...gross. The top frame always shows scrollbars, is not resizable, and the horizontal scrollbar covers the bottom line of text. (I don't know why IE6 behaves this way. For some reason on both the top and bottom frames it is introducing the horizontal scrollbar, which propogates the rest of the problems.) Similarly, the bottom frame has 0px padding/margins for the content text (and the horizontal scrollbar).

I realize that this is probably a problem with IE's rendering engine, but perhaps you could attempt to modify the code for the framesets in a still-compliant manner that would make the test suite work around a bug or two in IE.
