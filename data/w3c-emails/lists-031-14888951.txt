Dear rose,  
Do Mobile Phones Cause Cancer!

Studies have shown that electromagnetic waves that come from your cell phone may be correlated to Brain Cancer.  

On our website we offer a link to Nokia's actual patent on a device that shields the human head from cell phone radiation.  Still people insist on 
rejecting claims of any health hazards from using mobile phones.

Scientists are now reporting that cell phones might emit a dangerous radiation.
Don't be the phone comapny's guinea pig!  Protect Yourself Today!

There are press releases on our site that will SHOCK every cell phone user!!!!

We sell a product that helps reduce harmful electromagnetic radiation from entering your ear.  It is brand new, patented, easy to install, easy to use,fits every phone made, and very affordable.
