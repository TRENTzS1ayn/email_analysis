I THEREFORE WISH TO EXPLAIN THIS LUCRATIVE BUSINESS INTENTION FOR OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT, THOUGH I DID NOT LET THE NIGERIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAVE THE REAL IDEA OF MY INTENDED BUSINESS PROPOSAL DUE TO THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND URGENCY, WHICH THIS TRANSACTION DEMANDS.

MY NAME IS DR. HASSAN KATSINA; I AM THE CHIEF ACCOUNTANT WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION {NNPC} HEADQUARTERS IN LAGOS NIGERIA. I AM PRESENTLY IN A POSSITION TO REMIT THE SUM OF USD$30,000,000.00 {THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY} INTO A RELIABLE FOREIGN ACCOUNT FOR OUR PERSONAL USE.

WITH THE VIEW THAT AS SOON AS THE BONAFIDE CONTRACTORS RECEIVE THEIR FULL CONTRACT PAYMENTS, WE CLAIM THE BALANCE FOR OUR PERSONAL USE. THE CONTRACTORS WHO EXECUTED THE SAID RELATIVE CONTRACTS HAS SINCE BEEN PAID THEIR FULL CONTRACT SUM/FUND, LEAVING BEHIND THE USD$30 MILLION FLOATING IN THE FEDERATED ACCOUNT OF NNPC WITH UNION BANK OF NIGERIA, SECURED AS CREDIT/PAYMENT TO A FOREIGN CONTRACTOR.
