Attention: The Managing Director/C.E.O.


My name is Mariam C. Usman (Mrs.) widow of late Col. Bello Usman, the former Governor of  Kano State of Nigeria. My late husband was one of the victims of the November 17th 1996 Nigerian A.D.C Aircraft Boeing 722 that crashed in Lagos Nigeria.

I have just been informed by our legal attorney Chief Femi Oladipo  of  Oladipo Femi & Co; that my late husband operated a secret account with fictitious name in a Nigerian bank into which a total sum of Eighteen Million United States Dollars ($18M) was transferred and credited in his favour and stated me as next of kin. The attorney now advised me to seek in confidence a foreign account unto which this fund could be transferred for disbursement as directed by my late husband in his WILL.

It has been resolved that 25% will be your share for nominating an account for this transaction and any other assistance you will give in that regards. 5% has been mapped out to pay back all local and international expenses which may be incurred in the transfer process.

Finally, 70% will  come to myself , my children , our attorney's bills and a good part of this shall be directed towards executing my late husband's Will which is to buy shares and stocks in foreign  countries to secure his children's future. . 

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer the fund, your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further contacts, and all correspondence must be directed to our family attorney Chief Femi Oladipo on his telephone number 234-80-33267478.

 I we implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response.

Best personal regards,

Mariam C. Usman (Mrs)
