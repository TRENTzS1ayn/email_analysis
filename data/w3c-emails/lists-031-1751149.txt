The Story

Asset Equity Group is a rapidly up-and-coming entertainment real estate company with a tremendous business plan for the future. It focuses on the booming trend in entertainment spending and acquires properties with the intent to construct high volume mega-entertainment complexes. The business is divided into the following three areas:
America's Playzone


Almost every child in America, and probably almost every adult for that matter, has dreamt about what it would be like to smash a home run out of Yankee stadium or slip a goal past an all-star goalie in a hockey game. ASEQ's new America's Playzone plans on giving its customers that same professional experience. With plans to develop relationships with all four major professional sports, the company has planned on incorporating sport oriented theme parks in its new mega entertainment complex planned for Henderson, Nevada by year end.   
In addition to the sports theme parks the new 12-14 acre complex will also boast a state of the art skateboard park and a premier remote control car racetrack as some of its flagship attractions.  With planned alliances with producers of some of the top quality remote control cars in the industry, these attractions are expected to be second to none. Furthermore, not only will revenues be generated from these attractions but also from leading food company endorsements in its food courts thus enhancing the profitability of the operations.
MASTERDOME

 Much like America's Playzone, ASEQ's planned 100,000 square foot (appx.) mega complex named Masterdome is expected to open on the Las Vegas strip in the near future. Currently Gameworks, a joint venture between Universal Studios and Sega, enjoys substantial revenues from its 15 worldwide locations and ASEQ plans its Masterdome to be even more technologically advanced than this competition.  Last year alone, Gameworks' 12 US locations alone enjoyed attendances of more than 25 million.  As Las Vegas is rapidly expanding and more and more parents find themselves gambling and in desperate need of entertainment for the younger demographics, Masterdome should prove a tremendous success. 

MyMobileCity.com

Since we are in the highly technological 21st century, mymobilecity.com is ASEQ?s way to tap into this market.  Mymobilecity.com is a wireless developer and application service provider created to provide businesses with application, service, and distribution solutions on wireless devices. As wireless devices move to become more of everyday business life, ASEQ is positioned to capitalize on this market. 
Concluding Thoughts About ASEQ

As Americans spend more and more on entertainment, Asset Equity Group has a vivid plan on how to tap into this market.  Its America's Playzone and Masterdome mega complexes will offer premier state of the art facilities to appeal to all aspects of consumers. From interactive sports theme parks to a skateboard park, ASEQ will provide any form of entertainment desired.
