Yes, you are right! Thanks, I will fix this as soon as possible...
time passes .... ok, its fixed now.

I will upload a zip file once I am sure that I have everything that is
needed, but the three files are up on the site now.

Please note that Adobe ASV3 fails this test, as does Batik 1.5b1
(though they will fix that soon, I believe) but the CSIRO
implementation passes this test.

Hoping that the fact Corel are looking at animation tests means what I
think it means.

Where do I send feature requests for Corel RAVE to add SVG capability?
