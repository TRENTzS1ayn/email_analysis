Hey Folks!

Did you know that you can get FREE tickets to be in the studio audience
of a TV show?  Almost all of the popular sitcoms and talk shows give away
tickets to be in the audience of their weekly or daily TV show filming.  If you
are visiting Los Angeles, this is a great opportunity to see famous stars IN
PERSON and see the behind-the-scenes of how your favorite sitcom is made!
We offer FREE information on how to get these FREE tickets to shows like
Everybody Loves Raymond (Ray Romano), Becker (Ted Danson), Just Shoot
Me, The King of Queens, Will and Grace, Whose Line Is It Anyway (Drew Carey),
The Drew Carey Show, Yes Dear, and The Late Show With David Letterman,
just to name a few...

Most sitcoms are now back into production for the new 2002-2003 television
season and there are many filming dates now available for August and
September.  If you can, we recommend booking your tickets at least 1-2
months in advance to have the best selection of available dates especially
for the most popular shows.  You might even get a chance to be seen on
national TV!

Come to the studios and watch the stars at work! And remember, ITS FREE!
