I am Mr. Kelvin Mbete a former special adviser on
Petroleum and economic matters to the late Head of
State of Federal Republic of Nigeria General Sani
Abacha. Because of my strategic position in the former
Government, and also being a close confidant of the
Head of State, I was able to acquire personally, the
Sum of $25,000,000.00USD (twenty-five Million United
States Dollars) presently lodged in Union bank of
Nigeria plc.

I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE"
And Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign oil companies
Prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocks and other
Lifting/prospecting Right. Nigeria is the 6th largest
Producer/Exporter of Crude Petroleum in the World.

As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to
Political/Economic Instability, hyper Inflation, and
Among other problems, I have therefore resolved to
Invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate
Properties and Importation of Goods for safety and
Optimum returns on Investments.

However, straight transfer of this money into a bank
Abroad will present two major problems:
1. The tax incidence will be too high, as much as 60%
Of this money will go up in Taxes, Levies, and Penalties
Etc.
2. As an official in a former military government on
Which the present democratic government of Chief
Olusegun Obasanjo is fighting very hard to freeze the
Accounts of the men that serve in the government of
General Abacha. 

So as a result of Government deliberate restrictions
On flight of capital abroad. The solution is to
Courier this money in cash abroad, through Courier
Service Company here in Nigeria in conjuction with
An embassy here in Nigeria, the money will be packed in
A Diplomatic Bag or Carton tagged Diplomatic luggage
Which will be address to you. This system is secret
And the money is therefore untraceable. It is the
System used by most top Government officials in
Nigeria to remove their fortunes to safety abroad.

I have therefore concluded every arrangement with a
Courier Company in Nigeria to Courier this money
Abroad using the courtesy and safety of Diplomatic
Bag. All I now need is an honest partner who can
receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest
as aforementioned.

There is absolutely no risk involved in this
Transaction as the money will be delivered to you in
United States Dollars Bills. 

If you are interested in assisting me, please send to
Me by email immediately your preferred contact address
Where this money will be delivered to you,
delivery, you are to lodge this money in a bank
Account and contact me for necessary arrangements for
the investment. 

For your help and assistance in this deal, you will
receive 30% of this money in cash, 10% will be set
aside to offset all expenses while the remaining 60%
is for me. 

Finally, you are to please urgently email your
personal phone and fax numbers for an easy
communication. You are also required to email your
contact address to me, so that I can instruct the
Courier Company to despatch the money to you before we
go into other necessary details. 

Expecting to hear from you.

Best regards,

Kelvin mbete.
