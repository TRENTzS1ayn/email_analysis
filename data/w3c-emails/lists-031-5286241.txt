From the Desk of: DR.MRS MARIAM ABACHA                
Abacha Court, Victoria Garden City, 
Lagos-Nigeria.

ATTENTION,
Good day and compliments. This letter will definitely
 
 come to you as a huge surprise but I implore you to
 take the time to go through it carefully as the
 decision you make will go off a long way to determine
 the future and continued existence of the entire
 members of my family.
 Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is
 Dr.(Mrs) Mariam Abacha, the wife of the late Head of
 State and  Commander- in- Chief of the Armed Forces of
 the Federal Repulic of Nigeria, Gen. Sanni Abacha,whom
 died of heart attack.
 
  I need your help May the blessing of God be upon you
and grant you the wisdom 
and sympathy to understand my situation and how much I
need your help. Late Gen. 
Sanni Abacha,ex-military Head of State (Federal
Republic of Nigeria) was my 
husband that died of heart problem. Since the death of
my husband, I have been 
subjected to all sorts of harassments, intimidations
and inhumane treatments, 
with negative reports emanating from the government
and the press regarding my 
husband's past military regime and my eldest son
Mohammed is being held.
   Most of our trusted Associates betrayed us because
of Ministerial Jobs and 
appointments. I need your immediate help, I beg of
you.
 I need your help to transfer what I call "our future
 hope" the sum of Thirty Million United State
 Dollars (US30,000,000) from my late husband's
private vault which he deposited into a security firm
before his death. 
 The last transfer of Ten Million United State
 Dollars (US$10,000,000) I made into a friend'sforeign
 account at Europe, after the successful transfer, my
 friend denied me my money because of my restricted
 movement within Nigeria. That is the main point why I
 need your help. I lost so much trying to make
transfer through some associates.
 This fund is considered as the main source of my
 family's future hope. When this US$30 Million dollars
 is transferred, my brother BARR.GEORGE ADAMSwho is also
 my close Confidant would be able to establish an
investment with your assistance on our family behalf
 until I come out of my travail and tormentors. For
your information, my communication and movement are
 under strict surveillance therefore make all your
communications to me through my E-MAIL ADDRESS.This is
to ensure maximum confidentiality and secret.If you
HELP me receive this money 
into a foreign account, I WILL reward you with 25% of
the total sum
 I will also compensate you for
your inconveniences and 10% for expenses incurred. I
am
depending on this fund and I am counting on you for my
future and that of my 
family. I wait patiently for yourresponse.Please
include your
 contact details ,telephone, fax and nationality
Yours truly, 
Dr.(Mrs.)Mariam Abacha.
