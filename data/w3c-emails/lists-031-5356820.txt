I am Mr Steve Akosa a former special adviser on Petroleum and economic
matters to the late Head of State of Federal Republic of Nigeria General
Sani Abacha. Because of my strategic position in the former Government,
and also being a close confidant of the Head of State, I was able to
acquire personally, the
Sum of $25,000,000.00USD (twenty-five Million United States Dollars)
presently lodged in Union bank of Nigeria plc.

I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE" And Good Faith Fees"
paid by foreign oil companies Prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocks
and other Lifting/prospecting Right. Nigeria is the 6th largest
Producer/Exporter of Crude Petroleum in the World.

As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to Political/Economic
Instability, hyper Inflation, and Among other problems, I have therefore
resolved to Invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties
and Importation of Goods for safety and Optimum returns on Investments.

However, straight transfer of this money into a bank Abroad will present
two major problems:
1. The tax incidence will be too high, as much as 60%
Of this money will go up in Taxes, Levies, and Penalties
Etc.
2. As an official in a former military government on
Which the present democratic government of Chief
Olusegun Obasanjo is fighting very hard to freeze the
Accounts of the men that serve in the government of
General Abacha. 

So as a result of Government deliberate restrictions On flight of capital
abroad. The solution is to Courier this money in cash abroad, through
Courier Service Company here in Nigeria in conjuction with An embassy here
in Nigeria, the money will be packed in A Diplomatic Bag or Carton tagged
Diplomatic luggage
Which will be address to you. This system is secret And the money is
therefore untraceable. It is the System used by most top Government
officials in Nigeria to remove their fortunes to safety abroad.

I have therefore concluded every arrangement with a Courier Company in
Nigeria to Courier this money Abroad using the courtesy and safety of
Diplomatic
Bag. All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money on my
behalf and help me to invest as aforementioned.

There is absolutely no risk involved in this Transaction as the money will
be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. 

If you are interested in assisting me, please send me an email
immediately, as you are to lodge this money in a bank Account and contact
me for necessary arrangements for the investment after acknowledgement of
the receipt of the money. 

For your help and assistance in this deal, you will receive 30% of this
money in cash, 10% will be set aside to offset all expenses while the
remaining 60%
is for me. 

Finally, you are to please urgently email your personal phone and fax
numbers for an easy communication and for me to instruct the Courier
Company to despatch the money to you before we go into other necessary
details. 

Expecting to hear from you.

Best regards,

STEVE  AKOSA
