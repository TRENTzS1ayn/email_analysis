ATTN:  Mrs Katy Daruwalla

HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY?   HOW IS YOUR BUSINESS?  HOPE EVERYTHING IS VERY FINE.THIS WILL BE A SURPRISE TO YOU SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY, BUT I GOT YOUR CONTACT FROM YOUR COUNTRY'S HIGH COMMISSION?S COMMERICAL OFFICE HERE IN NIGERIA.

I AM MRS. MARYAM ABACHA, THE WIDOW OF THE LATE GENERAL SANI ABACHA WHO WAS THE FORMER NIGERIAN PRESIDENT THAT DIED RECENTLY IN OFFICE AS RESULT OF ?CARDIAC ARREST?. 

 SINCE THE DEATH OF MY HUSBAND, MY FAMILY HAS BEEN UNDER RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT AND OUR BANK ACCOUNTS BOTH LOCAL AND FOREIGN HAVE BEEN FROZEN 
BY THIS PRESENT NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT, ALSO SOME MONEY BELONGING TO US IN BOTH FOREIGN AND LOCAL CURRENCIES TOTALLING ABOUT $700 MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND DUTCH 450 MILLION DUTCH MARK ALL IN CASH WERE RECOVERED FROM OUR APARTMENT. 

WHEN MY LATE HUSBAND WAS IN POWER, WITH THE HELP OF SOME GERMAN BUSINESSMEN, HE WAS ABLE TO MOVE SOME FOREIGN CURRENCIES TOTALLING USD$45 MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS DISGUISED AS PHOTOGRAPHIC 
MATERIALS TO A SECURITY COMPANY IN LOME-TOGO FOR SAFE KEEPING.
 
 THIS MONEY HAD TO BE DEFACED TO AVOID IT BEEN SPENT BY UNAUTHORISED PERSONS.

 THE SECURITY COMPANY IN TOGO HAS SPOKEN TO ME TO COME 
AND CLAIM OUR LUGGAGE IN THEIR CUSTODY.
I PERSONALLY APPEAL TO YOU SIR, WITH THE MERCIES OF GOD, THE ALMIGHTY ALLAH TO ASSIST US IN TAKING AWAY THIS MONEY FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY TO A SAFE BANK ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSE, SINCE I CAN NOT DO 
ANYTHING NOW THAT I AM UNDER HOUSE ARREST. 

 I WILL APPRECIATE IF IT CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE PROPERTIES IN YOUR COUNTRY SO 
THAT ME AND MY FAMILY CAN SETTLE THERE WHEN WE REGAIN OUR FREEDOM.

I AND MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY HAVE AGREED TO LET YOU HAVE 25% OF THE  TOTAL FUNDS FOR WHATEVER ASSISTANCE YOU HAVE DECIDED TO RENDER, 5% HAS ALSO BEEN SET ASIDE FOR ANY EXPENSES THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION BY BOTH PARTIES. 


 PLEASE BE PREPARED TO TRAVEL TO TOGO TO CLAIM THESE BOXES AS WE ARE GOING TO PRESENT YOU AS THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS CONSIGNMENT WITH THE DOCUMENTS IN OUR HANDS OR ALTERNATIVELY, WE CAN ARRANGE 
TO SEND THIS CONSIGNMENT THROUGH THE SECURITY COMPANY TO EITHER EUROPE OR ASIA BY DIPLOMATIC MEANS WHERE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO CLAIM IT.

 HOWEVER, PLEASE TREAT THIS AS A TOP SECRET AND BE PREPARED TO DO MORE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS WITH US. 

YOU ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO PROVIDE YOUR CURRENT PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS INCLUDING OTHER RELEVANT DETAILS THAT MAY BE 
USEFUL IN THIS PROJECT.  

I AM GIVING YOU 100% ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSACTION. PLEASE TRUST US AS WE HAVE ALREADY RUSTED YOU, I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE NOW WHO CAN BRING ME AND MY FAMILY OUT OF OUR PRESENT PREDICAMENT. 

MAY ALLAH IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU AS YOU ACCEPT TO HELP A WIDOW IN NEED.AWAITING YOUR URGENT AND FAVOURABLE REPSONSE.
