Dear Reader

 

You have received this E-Mail as an update to an incident that happened a few months ago, where our mail server was hacked.

This letter is meant as an apology for the Spam that you have received in that incident.

 

(ISC)2 is a world known security organization and would not be involved in the Spamming of mail.

 

Our Mail server was successfully attacked and numerous worms and trojans that having been custom made, planted on our systems.

As Symantec only deals with viruses and trojans that are targeted at the general consumer they where VERY slow in responding to our situation. As of this date we have received 10 000 complaints against us, regarding the incident with the mail server alone. The hacker is targeting us because we once had a racial policy that affected him negatively and seeks retribution in this way. Our organization saw fit to fail him on an exam that he took with us. We regret this but we have to stand by our decision, by his actions he has shown us right in our decision.

 

We eventually had to reformat our entire computer systems and purge all our data. We take this very seriously and we are looking into the hackers activities. As of now we know that our entire exam database was compromised. It will take us many months to recover from this as our exams need to be rewritten.

We know that various underground sites such as http://www.wzor.net/ and http://www.onlinereferences.net/ have copies of our exams but as of yet have not published them.

We are currently in legal contact with them but, as these servers run in Russia and China we have no way of legally stopping them from publishing the material.



If anyone has any information about this hacker \ hackers please contact us.
