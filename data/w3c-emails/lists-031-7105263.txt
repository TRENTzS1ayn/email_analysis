Hello and Good day                                  August 29 2002

I found your email on a web page in relation to the 419 Nigerian fraud.

I also received a fraud letter from Mr. Kenneth Usman (on July 27 2002) and
until now Mr. Usman keeps communicating with me and offering that sort of
business I would not take.
He has sent me documents from ?high offices? in Nigeria, and I sent him a
Proforma invoice to help with processing a giant US $49.5M for transfer.
I am not a greedy person and it took me a while to calculate and find I was
expecting some 4M as a commission. I am a painter artist and my knowledge
of costumed commission for middlemen or agents was enough to say, this
figure was right.

At  a later stage when Mr. Kenneth Usman demanded I should send a few
thousands $ as a fee to a lawyer? well, at that point I backed up.
Wondering what was going in here and further found myself reading a lot
about Nigeria. I love Africa.
I decided to start a deep search to find Mr. Kenneth Usman?s  previous
activities in this subject.

Luckily, I found that you received exactly (!) the same letter from him
I wonder if you could please spare a moment to help me find answers to
these questions:
1. Did you also receive/sent signed documents from/to Nigerian ministries
or banks in connection or through Mr. Usman?
2. Have you ever sent or received money in this deal?
 I would settle for a yes/no answer or else I am curious to learn more.
This could help me a lot, because I really like to show Mr. Usman his
reflection in the mirror. And perhaps bounce back to him his unaware racial
precognition. Plus I found myself involved in a mystery tale that would not
come to its end before the reader finds all the answers.
I am sorry if you find my questions intruding.
If so, forgive me.
Sincerely yours
Joseph Tany
