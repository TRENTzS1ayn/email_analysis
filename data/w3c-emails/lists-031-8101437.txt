Dear friend,

Listen and read carefully, I found your contact from a business
journal and that is why I have decided to involve you in this
transaction o.k, I am a woman of substance and of great importance
to my nation and the society ingeneral. I will not entertain any act
of unseriousness from you in this transaction o.k. You must take
instructions from me at all time and for security reasons you will
only communicate with me only by my e-mail for now o.k.

I am Mrs Louisa Ejercitor Estrada, the wife of Mr Joseph Estrada the
former president of Philippine located in the south East Asia. My
husband was presently impeached from office by a backed uprising of
mass demonstrators and senate. During my husband?s regime as
president of Philippine, I realized US$ 35.5 millions of dollars
from various contract projects! I executed successfully. I had
planed to invest this money in real estate and industrial
production. Now I have used diplomatic means in moving this money to
a security company in abroad as valuables, Now if you agree to carry
out this business, I will give to you the information of the
security company and you will be there o.k. There is no risk
involved o.k, you will see the money for your self before any thing,
then you will open an account there and pay in the money after you
have cleared. My husband is facing trails here with the Philippine
government so my family?s life style is restricted and all my phone
and other contracts are monitored by the Philippine authority. I
will offer you 30% of the total fund if you safely clear this money
from the security company, you must keep this business secret a! nd
confidential, not even your partner must know about this o.k until
you are through with this business. Once again, I want you to be
honest, and faithful, I shall delegate my Attorney to meet with you
o.k. I hope we will build a solid business relationship, waiting to
read from you shortly o.k.



Regards,

MRS. ESTRADA
