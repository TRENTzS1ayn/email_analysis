DEAR SIR,

I know that you must have recieved the first letter I sent
to you by post, but if you have not, here comes afollow-up
to the letter.

First I must seek for your understanding and pray that God
will give you the wisdom to understand my problem and be in
a position to help as you will be surely blessed as you
help. I am Dr Usman Ahmed,I am 41 Years old and also the
chief accountant with Gulf Bank Nig PLC . I have a
transaction which I think will be of mutual benefit to both
of us. In my desire for a foreign partner with whom to do
this ransaction, I stumbled on your contact from a
business directory.

As the head of accounts department of GBNP, I discovered
some amount of money while I was auditing accounts for the
2001 financial year which has been lying there for over 3
years. On further inquiry, I discovered that this money
totalling about USD$45.5 Million (Forty five Million five
hundred thousand United States Dollars) including
accumulated interest belonged to one MR. HUANG L. TANAGA ,
a korea Nationale who lived here and died intestate with
no beneficiary.

This man died through a plane crash of ADC airlines in
1998. I have Successfully secured the money and with the
assistance of my colleague, the money has been moved out of
my bank and deposited in a finances company. It was packed
in three(2)metal trunk boxes as photographic materials. I
would need your particulars to enable me prepare documents
which will authenticate that the Consignment belongs to you
as the next of kin to MR. HUANG L. TANAGA and to enable you
claim the money. I want to be assured of a safe account
where the money will be deposited pending my arrival.
This transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal
complications, I have made all necessary arrangements for a
successful transaction. Before this money is entrusted
into your care, there must be an agreement that will be
reached between us stating that:

1.BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT FOR ANY REASON CHEAT EACH OTHER.
2.BOTH PARTIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEE THIS TRANSACTION
THROUGH.
3.A HIGH DEGREE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE
APPLIED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR WORK.
4.I AND MY PARTNER WILL STRONGLY BE BY YOUR SIDE AS YOU
CLAIM THIS FUND AND I AND MY PARTNER WILL ARRAGE AN
ATTORNEY(LAWYER)WHO WILL WORK ON YOUR BEHALF TO GET THE
NECESSARY PAPERS NEEDED FOR A SMOOTH TRANSACTION.
5.YOU WILL NOT DISAPPEAR WITH OUR FUND AFTER YOU HAVE
CLAIMED IT.
6.DISBURSEMENT RATIO WILL BE 75% FOR ME AND MY
COLLEAGUE,15% FOR YOU, 5% WILL BE DONATED TO CHARITY,WHILE
5% WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR MUTUALEXPENCES.

There is need for you to respond to this offer immediately
as the government of my country have concluded plans to
apply the money into arms procurement to project wars and
unrest in African continent.

I must let you know that a high degree of trust is
required and also we will like to use our own share to go
into any lucrative business with your help/assistance.

Awaiting your urgent response now.

Yours Faithfully

DR Usman Ahmed
