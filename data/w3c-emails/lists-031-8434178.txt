Onyema that my late husband operated a secret account with fictitious name in a Nigerian bank into which a total sum of nineteen million, five hundred thousand U.S dollars ($19.5M) was transferred and credited into his favour. the attorney now advised me to seek in confidence a foreign account into which this fund could be transferred for isbursement as directed by my late husband in his will. 

It has been resolved that 25% will be your share for nominating an account for this purpose and any other assistance you will give in that regard. 10% has been mapped out to pay back all local and international expenses which may be incurred in the transfer process and 5% has been conceded to the local bank manager here assisting in facilitating the transfer. Finally 60% will come to my self and my children and good part of this shall be directed towards executing his will which is to uy shares and stocks in foreign countries to secure his children future. To facilitate the conclusion of this transaction if accepted, do send to me promptly by e-mail through our family attorney, the 
following.

Please note that I have been assured that the transaction will be 
concluded in ten (10) bank working days upon my receiving from you the above listed information. I shall commence the process of retrieving the will immediately I hear from you. 

May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this business demands and I Hope you will not betray the trust and confidence I repose in you.
