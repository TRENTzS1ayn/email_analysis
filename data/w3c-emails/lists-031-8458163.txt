DR. MICHAEL AMENSIN
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS & HOUSING. 
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT,FALOMO- LAGOS, NIGERIA. 

Dear Sir, 

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$25.4 MILLION (TWENTY-FIVE MILLION, FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). 

First, I must solicit your trust and strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as been utterly confidential and top secret. You were recommended to me by a director at the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce (Foreign Trade Division). He does not know what I am about to introduce to you. I simply told him that I wanted foreign partners for investment purposes. 

I am the Director of Engineering & Project of the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing in  Nigeria. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$25,400,000.00 into your private or company account for mutual benefits. This money came about as a result of a contract for the construction of several road projects, Porthacourt-Elemen Pipeline project and  Y2K compliance turn-around maintenance executed on behalf of my Ministry(F.M.W&H), in the year 1999. This contract was officially assigned to be awarded and executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of US$105,400,000.00, but in the course of my negotiation, I bargained with only one foreign contractor, a Bulgarian firm which now executed the contract at the cost ofUS$80,00.000.00. Thus leaving the remaining US$25.4M floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria(C.B.N) to the benefits of we the three members of the contract award panel unknown to the contractor and any other person in my Min!
istry. This contract has been satisfactorily executed, inspected and commissioned, and the Bulgarian firm is presently securing his payment from my Ministry. 

It is however to this effect that I seek your maximum assistance and approval to present your company name alongside with the Bulgarian contractor as the second foreign contractor to enable me transfer the difference (US$25.4M) into your account for further investment depending on your advice. 

On actualization of the transaction, the funds will be shared thus: 
1. 20% of the money go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds. 
2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction for insurance, phone bills, documentation etc. 
3. 70% to us the three members of the Contract Award Panel. 

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth actualization of the transaction within fourteen working days of commencement after receipt of the following information by fax: Your company's Name. Address. Phone/Fax number and activities. Also, if we opt for electronic transfer only other than payment by solar bank draft or cash call program, then your bank account particulars. 

The above information will enable me make the application and lodge claims to the concerned Ministries in favor of your company or name and it is pertinent to state here that this deal is entirely based on trust and the fear of God. 

If you are able to handle, feel free to reach me on my via this email box or : Thereafter, I will furnish you with my confidential line as that will enable you reach my office directly. Also furnish me with your own phone and fax numbers as I will be sending you all necessary registration documents immediately I receive your positive response. 

Thanks in anticipation for your positive response. 

Yours faithfully. 

Dr. Michael Amensin.
