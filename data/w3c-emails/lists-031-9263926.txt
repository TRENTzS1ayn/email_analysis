Do you use a cell phone?
Are you aware that the electromagnetic waves that come 
from your cell phone are directly related to brain cancer!

Cell Phones are commonplace in todays society.  
Now the truth is coming out.  For years scientists have
raised concerns over the health risks involved in using a 
cellular phone.  In Europe cell phone manufacturers are required 
to print a warning label on all phones.  Similar to cigarettes in 
the U.S.  Soon Motorola and Nokia will be printing these warnings 
on their American phones.
