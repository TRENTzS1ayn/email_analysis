Good afternoon,

You have been referred to me as an organization that would be interested in what we are doing. 
My name is Aggie Corrado and with Anthony Rubino we have launched a website called www.ussponsorship.com.
Our main goal is to unite individuals and organizations in need with those sponsors and donors who are able to give via the internet.

  We never touch one cent of the sponsorship funds - 100% of the donation goes directly to the individual or organization in need. We would like to offer your organization, and or any individual affiliated with you that might be in need of sponsorship, a free spot on our site.  We are offering free postings to the first 200 sponsor seekers on our website.

  Our 5 main categories are, Arts/Media, Charities/Non Profits, Education, Sports, and Events.Please click on the highlighted sub categories to view our active postings.

  Please take your time and review the site  www.ussponsorship.com  and let me know if you are interested in adding your organization. We can add a direct link to your website as well.  Please check out the "about us" link on our site to see our devotion to sponsorship.

Thank you for your time,
Aggie Corrado
