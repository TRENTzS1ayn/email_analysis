Introducing The Furnace, the hot new post-production and editorial service.
As a courtesy to professionals in our industry, we are inviting you to meet

editorial and EFX talent, you should know about us. We offer a complete
range of editors skilled on AVID, FINAL CUT PRO, INFERNO, and FLAME systems.
Our prices are super-competitive and our talent is tops!

The Furnace provides supervision for every aspect of post production,
including graphic elements, digital effects, and sound design and mixing.
