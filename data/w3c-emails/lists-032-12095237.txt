DEAR SIR /MA,


I AM MRS MARIAM ABACHA THE WIFE OF THE

IMMEDIATE PAST MILITARY PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL 
REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA WHO
DIED ON 8TH JUNE 1998. 
MY MAJOR REASON FOR WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU IS

THAT MY HUSBAND LEFT A LOT OF PROPERTIES AND HUGE
 AMOUNT OF CASH MONEY BEFORE
HIS SUDDEN DEATH. 
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF OUR COUNTRY THAT 
SUCCEEDED
MY HUSBAND IS NOT FAVOURABLE TO OUR
 FAMILY AND INDEED HAS SHOWN THIS, BY THE CONFISCATION
 OF MANY OF OUR LANDED PROPERTIES AND LARGE AMOUNT 
OF
MONEY BELONGING TO MY HUSBAND.FORTUNATELY, 
WE HAVE DISCOVERED MY LATE HUSBAND'S WILL. THIS WILL 
STATES THAT THE SUM OF US$18MILLION HAS BEEN DEPOSITED
 WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN NIGERIA FOR THE ENTIRE 
FAMILY. WE HAVE CONTACTED
THIS SECURITY COMPANY AND
 IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE US$18 MILLION IS STILL 
INTACT AND THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY FREE TO COLLECT 
THE BOX CONTAINING THE
MONEY ANY TIME WE WANT. 
DUE TO THE DEATH OF MY HUSBAND AND RECENT ARREST 
OF
MY ELDEST SURVIVING SON (MOHAMMED ABACHA) THE 
HANDICAP AT THIS MOMENT IS
THAT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT
 OF OUR COUNTRY WILL CONFISCATE THIS MONEY IF WE 
MAKE USE OF IT IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED THE ASSISTANCE
 OF A FOREIGNER WHO
WILL HELP TO INVEST THIS MONEY 
OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS WHY I DECIDED TO
CONTACT
 YOU TO ASSIST US. NOTE: I WILL PAY YOU 20% OF THE ENTIRE
 AMOUNT AND
THE REST TO BE RELEASED TO ME. IF YOU ARE
 INTERESTED IN GIVING THIS ASSISTANCE,

PLEASE INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THROUGH MY 
CONFIDENTIAL E-MAIL
ABOVE AND FURNISH ME WITH
 YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER I WILL THEN

GIVE YOU THE ENTIRE MODALITIES FOR THE BUSINESS ON 
RECIEPT OF YOUR EMAIL
MESSAGE.BY MY OTHER SON ABBA.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDS TO BE EXPEDITED BECAUSE 
WE ONLY HAVE SOME WORKING
DAYS FROM THE DAY OF 
NEGOTIATION. PLEASE KEEP THIS BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL.



BEST REGARDS,



 MRS MARIAM ABACHA
