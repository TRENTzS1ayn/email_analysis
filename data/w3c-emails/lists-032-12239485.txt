Re: China Investment Opportunities

Dear Sir/Madam,

It gives me great pleasure to inform you that the web site of InvestCN has been launched. By way of background, InvestCN, is a division of China Economic Herald, which is the media bureau of State Development Planning Commission, P.R.China.

SDPC is the highest authority in economic development planning for the nation, it also approves investment projects by its departments at all levels. On the other hand, CEH announces the latest policies and regulations, publishes economic reports and analysis to senior government officials and entrepreneurs. 

We aim to enhance China economic developments and promote investment projects by allowing overseas entrepreneurs to have direct access to major SDPC information through our website. We have a number of professional services including South China Review, Business to Government Strategy and Investment Mission. All the editors are government policies makers, senior officers and senior economists. It is also important for us to acknowledge your information demand, introduce foreign advanced experiences to our own country, and accelerate foreign investment activities. We serve as the key bilateral investment communication channel among China and overseas governments, local and overseas entrepreneurs. 

We are delighted to invite you to support us for notifying the above message to your members and cross-linking our websites. We desire to obtain your suggestion for how to enhance the business relationships between your members and our entrepreneurs concurrently. Also, we will inform your constructive proposition to the summit of the central government. Please feel free to contact us if you need further information. 

Sincerely, 

John Ho
InvestCN Strategist Limited
