Your Mobile Phone might Cause Cancer!

Studies have shown that electromagnetic waves that come 
from your cell phone may be correlated to Brain Cancer.

In May 2000 A large US media outlet performed a test.  
They took the 5 most popular phonessold in the US and 
tested them at a highly respected German laboratory.
Four out of five phones tested were above the radiation limit.

The worlds largest Cell Phone Manufacturers have patented 
devices to reduce the risk of Brain Tumors, yet they insist on 
rejecting claims of any health hazards from using mobile phones.

It will take thousands of tests and many years before the effects 
of electromagnetic radiation on the human body is known.
Just Like It Did With CIGARETTES!
