PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL 

My name is Moha Yadudu, I was the main lawyer to
the late President of Nigeria, General Sanni Abacha.
Since the late General's death,the present administration has done a lot to retrive his hard earned funds which they have claimed were ill gotten
They have claimed all  the
familys' wealth and I am making this contact on 
behalf of Mrs. Mariam  Abacha, his wife, not  minding
the consequences, but hoping that you would 
understand our predicament hence the need for your 
urgent assistance and co-operation.  My aim of
contacting you is to crave your indulgence  to assist
us in securing some funds, abroad for safe  keeping
which incidentally is part of the family  wealth.
Fortunately with the  assistance and co-operation of a
local banker,  we were able to safe guard some of the
funds  pending when the whole situation will be calm.
With the present agreement reached by Mrs.Abacha to
return most of the alleged ill gotten funds to the federal Government,
we are now in a position to take out the remaining
funds that had been left in Nigeria. The funds in
question were machine packed in trunk boxes said to 
contain sensitive photographic materials. We now  wish
to relocate this funds  in a  foreigner's name to
avoid any trace. Now that we are  in a democratic
government, this is our opportunity to remove the
money, and we are willing to offer you 15%  of the
funds after the transaction for your co-operation. 
Note that this money was defaced for security reasons 
and will be refaced by an agent as soon all 
arrangements are concluded by both of us. The amount 
involved is $40Million(forty million dollars)  All I need from you is an assurance that you
can  handle the amount involved comfortably and that I
can  also trust you with this very arrangement.  Be
rest  assured that there is no risk involved since I
have  taken care of everything. I want you to 
immediately  inform me of your willingness in
assisting and  co-operating with us, so that I can
send you full  details of this transaction and let us
make  arrangement for a meeting and discuss at length
on how to transfer/invest this funds. Also furnish me
with  your  private Tel/Fax Numbers  (Private) for a
personal contact with you. Finally, I  am trusting on
your full understanding on this, hoping that there
will be absolute confidentiality. Awaiting with
interest your response and hoping to  develop good
business relationship with you. 

Yours sincerely,
