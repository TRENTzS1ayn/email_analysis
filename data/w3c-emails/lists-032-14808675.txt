IT IS MY PLEASURE TO WRITE AND INFORM YOU OF A TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE TRANSFER OF US$20,000,000.00

(TWENTY MILLION U.S DOLLARS) ONLY INTO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT FOR SAFEKEEPING PENDING MY ARRIVAL WITH MY 
COLLEAGUES FOR THE SHARING WITH YOU AS THE ACCOUNT OWNER INTO WHICH THE MONEY IS REMITTED.

YOUR CONTACT WAS MADE AVAILABLE BY MY COLLEAGUE THATWORKS AT THE CORPORATE AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF OUR
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,HE HAS BEEN TO YOUR COUNTRY FORMEETING ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS.I AM AN 
ACCOUNTANT WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC), LAGOS AND THIS MONEY ORIGINATED 
FROM OVER-INVOICED CONTRACT EXECUTED FOR THE CORPORATION SOME YEARS BACK. THIS CONTRACT HAS LONG 
BEEN COMPLETED BY A FOREIGN FIRM AND THE CONTRACTOR DULY PAID. I NOW SEEK IF YOU WOULD PERMIT THE SURPLUS 
TO BE REMITTED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE TOP GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WE CANNOT 
COME OUT OPENLY TO CLAIM THIS AMOUNT. THIS IS WHY WE ARE LOOKING FOR A COMPETENT AND HONEST COMPANY OR 
INDIVIDUAL ABROAD WHOSE DOCUMENTS WOULD BE TENDERED BY US HERE IN NIGERIA AS ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS THAT 
EXECUTED THE PROJECT. HOWEVER, I WOULD WISH TO RECEIVE YOUR PERSONAL ASSURANCE THAT YOU WOULD NOT SIT

ON THE MONEY WHEN IT GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU KEEP CONFIDENTIAL THIS TRANSACTION, 
IN ORDER NOT TO TARNISH THE CONFIDENCE REPOSE IN THE OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSACTION. 

PLEASE I  REQUEST FOR YOUR PRIVATE FAX AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS FOR QUICK COMMUNICATION. SO 
FAR, AFTER DUE CONSULTATIONS, YOU WERE STRONGLY AND RELIABLY RECOMMENDED TO US ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT MET OR

ENTERED INTO ANY KIND OF CONTRACT WITH YOU BEFORE AS TO KNOW THE EXTENT OF YOUR HONESTY, BUT BASED ON THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS, I PERSONALLY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE HONEST ENOUGH AND WOULD NOT SIT ON THE MONEY IF 
FINALLY GOT INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. IT IS ON THIS NOTE THAT I CONSIDER IT PROPER TO WRITE YOU ASKING FOR YOUR 
PERMISSION AND SUPPORT TO TRANSFER THIS AMOUNT INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU SHOULD NOT FEAR ANY RISK BECAUSE WE 
HAVE CONCLUDED ARRANGEMENT TO SAVE GUIDE YOU IN THE TRANSACTION. THIS BUSINESS IS 100% RISK FREE. HENCE 
IT REQUIRES HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND SECRECY. 

MEANWHILE THIS IS THE BREAKDOWN OF THE SHARING MODALITIES: 
A. 10% WILL BE USED TO SETTLE TRANSFER CHARGES AND LEGAL PROTOCOLS; 
B. 30% IS FOR USING YOUR ACCOUNT; 
C. 60% OF IT WILL BE FOR US THE ORIGINATORS. 

BE INFORMED THAT ON COMPLETION OF THIS BUSINESS I WILL USE PART OF MY MONEY TO INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRY UNDER 
YOUR CARE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TRANSFER OPERATION WILL TAKE SEVEN TO TEN WORKING DAYS TO BE COMPLETED.
