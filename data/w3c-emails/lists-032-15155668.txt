ATTN: Sir,

I hope this mail will not come to you as a surprise.
I meant not to interrupt your box with my mail but to
pass a meaningful and well approaching matter across
to you. 

After going through your profile I decided to
transact this business with you.

I am Chief Adetola Adebayo. I  assumed duty in the
federal ministry of power and steel under the interim
president Abdul Salami Abubaka?s  regime in April,
1998. 

A united state based contractor named Michael
Douglas won a contract from the Federal Ministry of
power and steel through the Federal Government of
Nigeria worth $90 million united state Dollars and he
was paid the sum of $40million united state dollars up
front, the contract was to install eqiupments in the
"Ajeokuta steel industry"under the military dictator, 
president Sanni Abacha.

Mr. Michael Douglas executed the contract, up till now
the balance of $50 million united state dollars have
not been paid to him and the federal Government has
instructed the ministry  to pay all the contractors
that has executed their contract their balance and
that all the contract payment should go through
CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. 

So I decided to look for Mr.Michael Douglas but he is
no where to be found, then I
discovered that he is dead years ago, and no one has
come forward to claim this money.

At this juncture, I am seeking for a trust worthy
foreigner who will assist me in transferring this
money into his account.

That is the reason why I am seeking for your
assistance in transferring this money into your
account and I am ready to give 20% of the total sum to
you.

And I want you to understand that this transaction is
100% risk free, in fact there is no risk involve in
it.

And I also want you to understand that it will take
only 3 working days to get the approval in your name
for immediate transfer of the money into your account
as soon as I hear for the approval from you. 

You can also reach me through this email
address:chibayo@writeme.com.

I will go forward for the approval.

I wait your urgent respond

Best regard,
Chief Adetola Adebayo.
