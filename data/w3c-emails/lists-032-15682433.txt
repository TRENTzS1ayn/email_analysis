PROCUREMENT & CONTRACTS

URGENT


Dear Friend,

REQUEST FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION/ASSISTANCE

Through the courtesy of business opportunity and after a discreet but 
thorough inquiry .
 I write you this letter of request for partnership which I hope you 
will give 
your urgent attention. We worked as members of the Contract 
Review/Payment 
Committee inaugurated by Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
. We 
are empowered to deligently review , re-appraise, scrutinize and 
approve 
contract payments to contractors who executed contracts between 1990 - 
2000.

In the course of our work we discovered this fund, which resulted from 
grossly 
over invoiced contracts, which were executed for the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by a consortium of several Foreign 
Companies like 
ABB LUMMUS,VANIMA SHIPPING, J.G.C. CORPORATION JAPAN, BOUYGUES OFFSHORE 
AND A 
JOINT VENTURES OF SPIEBATIGNOLES AND DRESSER GMBH FOR:

1. CONSTRUCTION AND LAYING OF TWENTY-SEVEN KILOMETRES  (27KM) OF OIL 
PIPE LINE 
FROM ORON TO EKET. 
2. INSTALLATION OF TEN UNITS OF 861,000 LITERS TANKS FOR REFINDED OIL 
STORAGE 
IN PORT HARCOURT REFINERY ANNEX (70KM). AMOUNTING TO $21.5M UNITED 
STATES 
DOLLARS.

Amounting to the tune of US$253.5Million but was over invoiced to 
US$275Million. And we deliberately approved these payments and all 
contractors 
have been paid with these projects executed and since commissioned 
leaving the 
sum of US$21.5m floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of 
Nigeria 
(CBN) ready to be paid for the technical services of item  number  2 as 
stated 
above.

Before digressing further I would want you to know that our Civil 
Service code 
of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating 
foreign 
accounts while in Government service hence we are contacting you to be 
part of 
this transaction. We intend to use you as a front to get the over 
invoiced 
amount of US$21.5Million out of the Government coffers to a designated 
account 
by you.

Not regarding your field of specialization (investment) you are going 
to 
forward us with any company name that we will claim executed the 
technical 
services in the Turn Around Maintenance of the refineries mentioned 
above or 
We can  make use of your name in opening a company. All logistics are 
in place 
and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the 
transaction 
within six  to seven days of commencement after the receipt of a 
positive 
response from you. You are going to get 20% of the fund by posing as 
the 
beneficiary of this fund while my colleagues and I will get 70%  and 
10% will 
be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for all expenses 
incurred 
locally and internationally during the realisation of this transaction, 
including telephone bills, as a matter of fact you are expected to take 
a 
sincere inventory of your telephone bills.

It is imperative to let you know that I am also a project engineer with 
the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C). Despite researches 
carried 
out to verify and ascertain your personality we can only move ahead if 
you can 
further assure us of your transparent honesty, diligency and promise to 
help 
and treat this proposal with utmost confidentiality. We are men of 
proven 
integrity in our various fields who have put in 22 - 30years in the 
Civil 
Service of our country, we are therefore averse to having our image and 
career 
dented. That is why we should acknowledge the fact that confidentiality 
is the 
key to the smooth conclusion of this risk free transaction.
NOTE: FOR CONFIDENTIALITY, I WILL ADVISE YOU REPLY ME ON MY ALTERNATIVE 
EMAIL BOX ( aphills1@rediffmail.com).

Awaiting your earliest positive response. Best regards and remain 
blessed

Yours faithfully,


DR.ADEMOLA  PHILLS.
