Dear friend,

I Barrister Isaiah Muttai have decide to bestow this trust on you which I pray you may not betray.
I beleive in your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity. In a formal introduction i am  an attorney to lambert haddad who was into foreign exchange in lome-Togo west Africa. 

On oct 31 1998 my client was involved in ghastly auto crash and lost his live, since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my client's extended relatives, this has also approved abortive, after these several unsuccessful attempts, to locate 
any member of his family to present as next of kin in respect of the sum of us$11.7m (eleveen million seven hundred thousand united states dollars only) deposited with union bank du Togolaise by my late client of which the bank has contacted me to provide the next of kin to my client to come over and claim his money because they cannot release it unless somebody applies through me for it, as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in their banking guidelines.
As nobody was left behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make business with you and process the release/transfer of the money to you as the next of kin or relations of my deceased client since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into disbursement account as unclaimed bill as the banking law and guidelines where the deposit was made stipulated that if such money remained unclaimed after four years the money will be transferred into federal government account as unclaimed fund hence they have notified me of the development and instructed me to provide the next of kin before end of the year.
I beleive it will not be wise to allow this fund to go to the government account hence they cannot use it to help the masses. The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that my client was a foreigner and a citizen of this country cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 

The sharing rate of this money should be discuss later but the most important thing now is your fully commitment and assisting.Therefore to enable the immediate processing of the transfer of the fund to you as arranged, I need the your name and address ,your  
banking details. 
You should contact me at once  and indicate your direct confidential telephone/fax numbers for the effective communication required. This has to be because of security reason. I will  advise you to give this transaction the strict confidentiality it requires because of it's nature and i will not like to dent my image .

Early action is imperative.

Yours faithfully,
Barrister Isaiah Muttai.
