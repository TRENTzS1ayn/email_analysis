From:Mrs. M. Sese-seko

I am Mrs Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire 
now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am move to write 
this letter, this was in confidence considering my present 
circumstance and situation.  I escaped along with my husband and two 
other of our son Kennedy and Basher out of Democratic Republic of 
Congo(DRC) to Abidjan, Cote D'ivoire were my family and I settled, 
while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later 
died of cancer disease. 

However due to this situation we decided to changed most of my 
husband billions of dollars deposited in Swiss Bank and other 
Countries into other forms of money coded for safe deposit because 
the new Head of State of (DR) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement 
to the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my 
late husband treasures deposit in some Europeans countries.

Hence my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the 
situation till when things get better, like now that President  
Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my 
late husband's  Chateaux in southern France was confiscated by the 
French government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my 
investment will not be traced and confiscated. I have deposited the 
sum of Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) with 
a security company, for safekeeping. The funds are coded to prevent 
them from knowing the content. 

What I want you to do is to indicate your interest that you will 
assist us by receiving the money on our behalf. Acnowledge this 
message, so that I can introduce you to my son (kennedy) who has the 
out modalities for the claim of the said fund. I want you to assist 
in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I 
will also like to buy properties and stock in multi-national 
companies to engage in other safe and non-speculative investment. 

May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, 
Which 
this business demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and 
confidence, which I repose in you. In conclusion, if you want to 
assist us, 
my son shall put you in the picture of the business, tell you were 
the 
funds are currently being maintained and also discuss other 
modalities 
including renumeration for you services. 

For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information, that is 
your personal telephone and fax number for confidential purpose and 
acknowledge receipt of this mail.


Best regards,
Mrs M. Sese-seko.
