Dear Friend,

May l briefly introduce myself to you. I am hajia
Maryam Abacha, the wife of the late Nigerian Head of
State, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of
June,1998. Ever since the death of my husband, my
family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with
the present Civilian Government. Consequently, my son
-Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention
for a sin he did not commit and made to  make a lot of
confessions as regards valuables, money inclusive that
of my late husband entrusted in his handforsafe-keeping.
The latest is his confession on the US$700,000,000.00
(Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his
late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check
Newswatch Magazine of May 8th/15th, 2000 issue on
[Website:http://www.newswatchngr.com] to confirm the
above story. Also the recent publication by THISDAY
Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London
Court clear ways for more recovering of Abacha's
family looted money. Please confirm this issue on
website: http://www.thisdayonline.com, click the
Archive/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st. On these
note, I  deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00
(Forty Million ,three hundred thousand United States
Dollars) sometimes march last year with a Security
company  abroad (name with held for now). Normally, we
(I and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transaction,
by first sending the money out by Cargo to a security
company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.
And thereafter go to the security company for claim
before transferring it to any bank of our choice.
Presently, l can not travel out of Nigeria, because,if
you have gone through the above mentioned website
address, you will see how My son's confession have
implicated my husband and infact the whole of my
family. This has actually caused the Federal
Government of Nigeria to confiscate our international
passports, frozen every of my family member bank
accounts both home and abroad, even our properties.
My problem now is, l want someone that can assist me
to move the US$40,300,000.000 (Forty Million ,three
hundred thousand United States Dollars) out from the
Security Company, before Mohammed will open up to the
Security Agents. To this regard l am soliciting for
your assistance to claim the boxes containing the
money from the Security Company and move the money toyour country.   
I shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage
you might want from the sum. On your advise l shall be
ready to invest my own share of the sum in your
country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money.
I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam mustapha Abacha.You should note also that my son-Mallam mustafa Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this transaction; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by the security agents and my movement being monitored.
I would like my son(mustapha Abacha) to settle down or
involve in a dating relation with any lucky foreign
lady at the successfull completion of the transaction.
In acknowledgement of my proposal,i would want you to
furnish me with your Telephone number,Fax number,and
Address so as to enable ny son whom will be dealing
with you directly to easily have you communicated as
to how you will recieve this money on our behalf withrisk free.
Thanking you in anticipation to your kind
understanding and cooperation.I am looking forward to
a healthy business relationship with you and my entire
household.
Hoping to hear from you.

Best Regards,

Hajia Maryam Abacha.
