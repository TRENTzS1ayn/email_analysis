Examples: ?Corporate Partnership? case studies from 99 Best Ever Fundraising and Earned Income Projects Vol.1

Corporate adopts charity
? The real estate franchise group L. J. Hooker adopted the charity Cystic Fibrosis two years ago as its corporate charity. 
? In the first year of the relationship, Hookers launched the Ultimate Garage Sale, and invited everyone in the community to drop off unused - but saleable - items at their 600 local offices. 
? This initiative raised $185,000, which was boosted with a corporate donation of $50,000. 
? This year they hope to at least surpass that success, particularly as the company has organised a charity house to be built in Brisbane with donated materials. 
? When auctioned, this charity house should generate a surplus of $50,000 which will also go to Cystic Fibrosis.

Companies use charities for publicity
? There is a growing trend for companies to use charities to generate publicity - with or without the consent of the charity. 
? The franchise hairdressing chain Just Cuts took a more responsible attitude and earned enormous publicity throughout NSW with its promotion to donate $1 to charity for every haircut in its salons on a Saturday in February. 
? Their PR firm went to work and - by using photos from local salons - was able to get exposure for Just Cuts in various local newspapers. 
? 64 salons participated and $25,000 was raised for the Sydney Children?s Hospital at Randwick.

Examples: ?Community Focus? case studies from 99 Best Ever Fundraising and Earned Income Projects Vol.1

Celebrity chefs pool talents
? The annual luncheon catered by the Great Chefs of Adelaide raises over $50,000 for the Archbishop?s Appeal, and its beneficiary Anglicare. 
? Most of the fine wine and food is donated, the chefs give their time for free, as do students from the Regency Hotel School - who do the support cooking and act as waiters for the 300+ guests. 
? The event is held on a Sunday at the Adelaide Town Hall and is marketed to those who like to have a long Sunday lunch with friends.

Opportunity in credit card over-ride 
? If you have a large number of affluent supporters on your database, credit card income could be of interest to you. 
? For example, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals offers Amex credit cards to its database of 70,000 names. 
? Amex will then pay a usage fee back to the animal welfare agency. 
? The numbers work like this ? if 5% of names take up the offer, and if they each spend $10,000 a year on their card, and if Amex pays 0.25% on usage, then the RSPCA will earn $87,500 annually. 
? However the demographics of the RSPCA supporter base are unlikely to support these figures ? firstly a typical supporter is unlikely to be in an age group that would be keen to accept another credit card, secondly they are unlikely to spend $10,000 annually on credit. 
? All marketing expenses are met by Amex, and there is no breaching of Privacy Code legislation because you are marketing to your own members. 
? Save the Children, AIDS Trust, and the Starlight Children?s Foundation are also part of a growing number of community business enterprises that offer a branded credit card issued by American Express.
