Dear Sir/Madan
PLS REPLY TO MY PRAVATE BOX  (jkj2003@popmail.com)

 My name is AHMED BELLO, top ADVISER to UNITA Leader, Jonas Savimbi; Angola's
Jonas Savimbi, legendary guerrilla leader of UNITA (the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola), was killed by communistMPLA (Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola) forces in combat Feb. 2002 ( please see     
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm     
and
  http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html  )

In addition to my official job, I was also in charge of the personal finances
of the late leader; these include Gifts, anonymous donations from Countries,
revenues from Crude Oil sales and Precious Stones etc. When UNITA conditions
began to deteriorate rapidly, I took the precaution of converting ALL  MONIES
INTO GOLD BARS, AND  SHIPPED THE GOLD BULLION CONSIGNMENT
TO A SECURITY SAFE DEPOSIT COMPANY IN EUROPE. AT TODAY'S PRICE OF $304.90 PER
OUNCE, THE GOLD BULLION
CONSIGNMENT IS WORTH ABOUT $45,000,000.00 ( FORTY-FIVE MILLION US DOLLARS).
I negotiated with a gold merchant in the name of Arthur B White to sell them
to him and every thing went successfully. I sold the gold Bullions to him and
deposited back the funds to the Security Company awaiting for Savimbis 
instruction
to transfer the money to his personal account in Switzerland Bank. While I was
waiting for his signal, the rebels struck and killed him. 

Unfortunately for me, after Savimbi's death my personal safety and life came
 under threat by Government Security Agents, and consequently I went into 
hiding,
and had to escape to Namibia and currently seeking asylum here. I cannot travel
freely at the moment but hopefully an opportunity will present itself soon
so that I can catch my freedom!

I therefore need your help in two ways 1.  To Clear in take into your position
the $45M as  Gold Bullion consignment in Europe  and  for me until I am free.
I will provide the shipping document with which you can present to the Company,
which will immediately release the consign
ment on demand. 2.  To arrange permanent asylum/immigration for me in your 
Country.
This is because I will require to settle permanently in your Country as soon
as I am free. Please bear in mind that I do not have a visa; therefore it will
be necessary for you to consult an Attorney for advice in this regard.

I freely offer you 25%  or one quarter of the $45M disguised as Gold Bullion
for your help and assistance . 

If you are interested in helping me, please reply immediately giving me your
full contact details including your phone , fax numbers etc; You can reach me
private email above

MR AHMED BELLO
