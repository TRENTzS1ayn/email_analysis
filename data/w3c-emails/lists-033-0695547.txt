DEAR SIR

FUNDS FOR INVESTMENTS.

THIS LETTER MAY COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE SINCE I HAD NO PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU.

I AM THE CHAIRMAN TENDER BOARD OF INDEPENDENT
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC). I GOT YOUR
CONTACT IN THE COURSE OF MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE
PERSON WITH WHOM TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL
TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE TRANSFER OF FUND VALUED AT TWENTY ONE MILLION, SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$21.6M) TO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT.

THE ABOVE FUND IN QUESTION IS NOT CONNECTED WITH
ARMS, DRUGS OR MONEY LAUNDERING. IT IS A PRODUCT OF OVER INVOICED CONTRACT AWARDED IN 1999 BY INEC TO A FOREIGN COMPANY FOR THE SUPPLY OF ELECTORAL MATERIALS THAT WAS USED FOR CONDUCTING 1999 ELECTIONS.
THE CONTRACT HAS LONG BEEN EXECUTED AND PAYMENT OF THE ACTUAL CONTRACT AMOUNT MADE TO THE FOREIGN CONTRACTOR; THEREBY LEAVING THE BALANCE OF US$21.6M IN DORMANT ACCOUNT WHICH MY COLLEAGUE AND I NOW WANT TO TRANSFER OUT OF NIGERIA INTO A RELIABLE FOREIGN ACCOUNT FOR
OUR PERSONAL USE.

AS CIVIL SERVANTS WE DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FOREIGN ACCOUNT MACHINERY TO SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION. THEREFORE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SOURCE FOR A FOREIGN COMPANY WITH THE CAPABILITY
TO ACT AS THE ORIGINAL BENEFICIARY OF THE CONTRACT.

MY DEAR, IT IS A GOOD THING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
ENDORSED THE RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE SENATE THAT ALL FOREIGN CONTRACTORS OWED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA BE PAID, WE WILL SEIZE THIS GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SURPORT YOU AS ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES TO BE PAID.
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL KINDLY GET BACK TO ME BY SENDING A LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE ALONG WITH YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

MEANWHILE, MY COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE DECIDED TO SHARE THE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING RATIO: 70% FOR MY
COLLEAGUES AND I, THEN 30% FOR YOU THE ACCOUNT OWNER.

FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE
DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT CORRESPONDENCE. THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND 100% RISK FREE. NOTE ALSO THAT THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND THIS
TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCLUDED WITHIN 15 WORKING DAYS SINCE ALL LOCAL CONTACTS AND ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY PERFECTED FOR A SMOOTH AND SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION.

WE WOULD REQUIRE AS A MATTER OF URGENCY THE FOLLOWING TO ENABLE US MAKE THE NECESSARY FORMAL APPLICATION FOR THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDS INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

THE NAME OF YOUR BANK.
ADDRESS,
ACCOUNT NO
NAME OF BENEFICIARY OF ACCOUNT.
THE NAME OF YOUR COMPANY.

TEL AND FAX NOS

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANTICIPATED CO-OPERATION.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,
