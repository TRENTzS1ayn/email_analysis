Hi,

I have a few questions and comments about some of the SVG Tiny test cases (dated 2002/11/12).  I am not sure if it is a misunderstanding on my part of the SVG Mobile Profiles specification, or of the use of the test suite.  Any help would be much appreciated.

linking-a-03-t.svg:
*This test case seems to test linking into a particular view of SVG content, but according to section 15 of the spec, SVGT does not support this.

interact-events-01-t.svg, masking-path-03-t.svg, struct-group-02-t.svg, and struct-image-02-t.svg:
*All of these tests have nested 'svg' elements, but according to section 4 of the spec, SVG Tiny content cannot have this.

styling-css-01,2,3-t.svg:
*According to section 5 of the spec, SVGT does not support styling with CSS, but these 3 SVG files test this functionality.  As well, the style module is not listed as part of SVG Tiny.

My question is:  are these valid SVG Tiny test cases, or have I misunderstood the spec?

Thanks

Sincerely
Scott
