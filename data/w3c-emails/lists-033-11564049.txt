Hi,

I was looking at the files concerning the interactivity for an SVG tiny
implementation located
here:http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20021112/htmlframe/tiny-index.html
And I was wondering why are the element <script>, or the attributes
onmouseover, onclick... used in the files named "interact-dom-01-t"
"interact-events-01-t" ... since it appears in the specification that they
are not supported.

Actually, it says in the documentation in the section 14.Interactivity:
"SVGB and SVGT support the SVG 1.1 events. SVGT only allows interactivity
with declarative animation."
But, if I am looking in Appendix A. Element Index, it says that script is
n/a and later in the section Appendix B. Attribute Index, it says that
onmouseover, onmouseclick are also n/a.

So, would it be possible to have some clarifications about what can I use
and what can't I use if I want to create some interactivity in my SVG Tiny
file?

I would really appreciate your help on that.

Thanks,

Ludovic
