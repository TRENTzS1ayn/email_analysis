*Please disregard the e-mail of Suday, July 21 2002 sent under my name.  I
know nothing about it and it is the work of FRAUDSTERS operating in Nigeria.

*My correct e-mail address is as on this e-mail.

*There is no position called District Bank Manager in Broadbank.

*We do not have any Mr. George Williams as an account holder in the bank.

*We do not have any account with unclaimed Dollars.

*This e-mail came to my knowledge late last year and I reported to the law
enforcement authorities.  I have again received a copy of the same e-mail
from a friend in England.


*PLEASE DISREGARD THIS AND SIMILLAR MESSAGES FROM NIGERIA.

Thanks.


Austen Obigwe
