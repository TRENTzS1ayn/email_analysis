Is there a reason for using a custom extension for XHTML to include 
the embed tag in the SVG Test suite? It seems a bizarre situation when 
  XHTML is a W3C standard, and you write a page using a deprecated tag!

Why not use the Object tag, or at least both tags, especially given 
that Netscape 4.x is now less widely used than Gecko based browsers? 
In fact, you could easily use CSS to hide the object tag from Netscape 
4.x by putting in a DIV with display:none set, and use the @import 
command to bring in a style sheet to hide the embed tag from current 
browsers, and override the previous display:none for the object tag.

Yours curiously,
