Hi
I am using Canvas 9 (www.deneba.com) to produce svg-files.
Canvas exports svg-files.
My document program is XMLClient
(http://www.excosoft.se/sweb/site/xml_client.html)
has difficulties to accept Canvas svg-files.
I would appreciate if you could tell me what Canvas is doing wrong when it
is producing a svg-file (se attached file).

Best regards
Fredrik Andersson
