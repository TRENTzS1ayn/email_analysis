Hello all,

I am pleased to announce that Bug'n'Bots with the help of Solarbotics will be hosting two Mini Sumo Workshops. This is an all-day workshop with kits and all the equipment on hand to build your very own competition class Mini Sumo for the one time price of $60.00 CDN. 

There is limited seating with only spaces for 15 builders each day. The dates are October  11th and 18th and will be held at the Bug'n'Bots store in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Additional information and Registration can be found at www.bugnbots.com or you can send any inquires to me at stevejones@bugnbots.com .

I look forward to seeing you there!

Cheers,

Steve Jones
