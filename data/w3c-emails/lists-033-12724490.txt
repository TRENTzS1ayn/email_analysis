Thanks for the bug report. The original release of the test results noted
that ASV 3 was used for all tests except the cursor test, which was
passed by an unreleased version (ASV5).

The new test suite results
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/status/matrix.html
have separate results for ASV6 and ASV3, and fail to not the different
version for the cursor test. The results should be updated to fail
ASV3 on that test.

The other test I am not sure about, and will need to find a machine
with ASV3 installed ;-() to check it.

The test results need refreshing, because Batik now passes all the
non-animation tests, for example  (it used to have two fails and a
partial). TinyLine 1.6 also has very good test results that could be
reflected in this matrix.
