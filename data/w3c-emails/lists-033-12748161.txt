Hi,

now that KDE 3.2 is out and thus KSVG has gained "stable" status it is time to 
post some results to get included into the testmatrix. I checked the whole 
1.1 Testsuite and wrote up the results. In some cases i added some comments 
of what fails and what works. It would be really good to see KSVG in the 
testmatrix. I hope you accept it ;).

Regards,

Andreas Streichardt
