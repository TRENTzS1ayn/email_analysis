Hello! Please contact me about this business proposition. If it is a scam, 
please accept this warning. DO NOT TRY TO SCAM! A sentence of 15 years to life 
is required. If not, then welcome to my inspirations. I will be honored to 
help. Of course, you will need to contact me immeditely and since it is in an 
escrow account you will need a stamp duty receipt to transfer and you can transfer 
into my bank account. Of course you will need to do this right away. When 
funds is in my account, I will contact immediately and set up a date to arrive 
and all other info. We will want to keep this confidental for the rest of our 
lives. I am in no position to help with any fees of any kind, but I am not 
looking for a percentage. I just want to help! Contact me immediately and we can 
get started right away!

Thank you,
   Sacora
