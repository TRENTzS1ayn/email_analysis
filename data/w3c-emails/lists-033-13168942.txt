Hi All,

Probably I used wrong address:

Boris> Chris,

Boris> Could you please resend this letter to a valid address:
Boris> Working with W3C SVG Mobile Test Suite (Tiny) we found two problems:

Boris> 1. Unlike of the rest of the test suite, two svg documents:
Boris>    fonts-elem-01-t.svg
Boris>    (referenced by
Boris>   
Boris> http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/htmlframe/tiny-fonts-elem-01-t.html)
Boris>    and fonts-elem-02-t.svg
Boris>    (referenced by
Boris>   
Boris> http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/htmlframe/tiny-fonts-elem-02-t.html)
Boris>    ... have following .svg attributes:
Boris>    <svg ... width="480" height="360" viewBox="0 0 480 360"...>
Boris>    The problem is that physical display size on tiny devices is not
Boris>    big enough to correctly view the images whose size is 640x480.
Boris>    Also, corresponding .png images' sizes are 80x60.
Boris>    I would also propose either change fonts sizes in these tests, or
Boris>    just remove such tests from the test suite as not completely
Boris>    appropriate to Tyny profile of SVG 1.1 spec. The problem is the
Boris>    if viewport size is quite small, fonts-elem-02-t.svg content
Boris>    turns into black rectangle as an example.

Boris> 2. An image text-intro-01-t.svg
Boris>    (referenced by
Boris>   
Boris> http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/htmlframe/tiny-text-intro-01-t.html)
Boris>    has following attribute:
Boris>    <svg ... baseProfile="basic">
Boris>    I would propose to replace baseProfile value with "tiny"

For this moment, there are new problems found in W3C SVG 1.1 Tiny test suite
(Please take a look into the problemblems above too):

---
3.
| W3C SVG Tiny test image render-elems-08-t.svg
| contains following DOCTYPE declaration:
| <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1 Tiny//EN"
| "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd">
| 
| It must be replaced with:
| <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1 Tiny//EN"
| "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11-tiny.dtd">

| struct-image-03-t.svg test would fail on an implementation
| which correctly performs gamma correction.
| This is probably an issue (not a bug - it is explicitly described
| in the test description), but it would be perfect to replace
| corresponding .png image with one that corresponds to an
| SVG viewer implementation w/o "rounding errors"

---
5.
Common issue that relates to big group of the CTS tests:
Having images' sizes 80x60, most of the tests do not allow
to validate if an implementation correctly shows image's
content. Moreover, corresponding .png images' content
could not be used to check against test description.
As an example, let's see at the test text-fonts-01-t.svg:
Description says:
"
    Purpose of test is to determine if the font family is being
correctly selected. The top two lines of text test serif fonts;
the top line in maroon tests the generic font family 'serif'
and the second line in black tests a selection of commonly
available named serif fonts. The next two lines of text test
sans-serif fonts;
the top line in maroon tests the generic font family 'sans-serif'
and the second line in black tests a selection of commonly
available named sans serif fonts. The following two lines
of text test monospaced fonts;
the top line in maroon tests the generic font family 'monospaced'
and the second line in black tests a selection of commonly
available named monospaced fonts. The lowercase 'i' and uppercase'W'
should be the same width,for monospaced fonts.
"

6. Corresponding .png image is
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/20030813/png/tiny-text-fonts-01-t.png

We understand that test suite goal is to be applicable to
all devices (even those whose screen sizes are 80x60).
Nevertheless, currently big tests' subset (most of the tests
that show the text) is almost impossible to perform visual
testing.

---
7. an issue: Unlike of the rest of SVG 1.1 Tiny test suite,
shapes-* tests do not contain descriptive information
about what is the functionality particular test checks.
Their description is too short:
"
The rendered picture should match the reference
image, except for possible variations in
the labelling text (per CSS2 rules).
"

BK>>>> I'd like to know if it is legal to use W3C SVG Test Suite
BK>>>> (http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/)
BK>>>> in commercial purposes? I would like to copy W3C SVG Test Suite
BK>>>> sources in our product. I have not found any copyright... Is this test
BK>>>> suite under GPL?

Chris>>> The testsuite is copyright W3C and is under the document license
Chris>>> (not,as you might think, the software license).

I personally would be glad to help to fix the tests
or validate/review the fixes in them.
