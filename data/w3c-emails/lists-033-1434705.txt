FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 2, 2002



Press Release Distribution Company Provides Low Cost Service

With the prices of press release distribution service souring these days,
Matt Pauley has set up a new internet company to 
help out the smaller companies.  Most distribution companies charge
anywhere from $200-$600 for similar service.  Discount 
PR specializes in one service.  This helps to keep their prices low.  It
is fixed at $75 for distribution to over 10,000 
media contacts across the nation.  These contacts work with TV, radio,
newspapers, magazines, and more.  
Although www.discountpr.com is a fairly new company, its results are
being seen by a nationwide audience.  The website 
www.sendnick2college.com has been getting growing publicity.  Newspapers
are doing interviews, TV stations are doing 
stories, and radio stations are doing on air interviews.  
Discount PR does not write the press release or edit them.  They
concentrate on the distribution services.  For any 
questions feel free to email Matt Pauley.
