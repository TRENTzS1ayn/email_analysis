ATT:PRESIDENT/CEO
 Sir,
 
 I am the Managing Director, C.E.O of a
security-consulting firm, having specialization in
governmental, industrial, and domestic security
operations and consultancy.
 
I retired from the Nigerian military service after
 30 years of service. My last appointment in the
military before retirement was as the Director of
 Army Finance Accounts (DAFA). Underthis
responsibility I administered theentire National
defense budget.
 
Upon the advent of civilian administration in the
country in 1999, myself and some other senior military
officers from the rank of Colonel, who were considered
political officers, were prematurely disengaged from
service.Before vacating office, I was able to
appropriated a sum of US$40.5million in cash from the
Special Security vault of (DAFA).

Due to some logistic constraints and inhibitions onmy
part, I have not been able to infuse this money into
the banking system in order to utilize it for any
meaningful purpose. I am writing to see if you
can liaise with me in having this money properly
channelled into a secured investment.
 
I would consider any joint investment opportunity
with you, probably in the areas of Real Estate or
any other business venture.
 
I am willing to give you further information if you
would consider my proposal.
You can also contact me through my wife e-mail address :  olodi@mail.com
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 Brig-gen. Akuyoma Nakamu (rtd).
 C.E.O
