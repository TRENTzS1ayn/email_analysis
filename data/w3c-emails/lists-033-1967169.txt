Attn: THE MANAGING DIRECTOR/CEO

Dear Sir,

I am Haruna Chukwu Esq., the CEO of a consultancy firm registered with the Federal House of Assembly of Nigeria.

This is a business proposal to transfer the sum of US$11.5m (Eleven
million ,five hundred thousand Dollars) into your account abroad.

This sum of money was discovered as unclamed by the Contract Verification Committee in the Federal House of Assembly headed by one Abubarka Ismaila In 1996, the United Nations (UN) granted money to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for its operations in Liberia and Sierra Loan (ECOMOG) which had Major General Dogonyaro as its Commander. Subsequently the Nigerian Government approved the supply of military hardware for Nigerian Soldiers to one high Chief, now late a former presidential aspirant inthe third republic.

The contract was carried out and that regime came to a stop after the 
death of the then head of state. Due to the death of the major 
contractor, the high chief, this whopping remaining some of money have 
been awaiting claim, which no one is coming forward to claim.

So the committee have secretly mandated me to find someone abroad who 
will file document as a business partner to the company that carried out the supply to enable us transfer the money abroad.

Your attention is sort because as civil servants we are not required 
have such amount of money and our accounts are periodically audited. We are determined not to return this money back to the federation's account.

Details of the contract, individuals involved and documents will later be sent to you as you indicate your interest. Terms of sharing will as 
well be discussed at your interest and willingness.

Waiting to hear from you.

Best regards.

Haruna Chukwu
