To whom it may concern:

Our institution, SAAMLanguageCenter, specializes in teaching Spanish as a Second Language (SSL) to foreigners worldwide,  basically High School, College, University students and Corporate professionals, who are looking for a practical program, with both quality and effectiveness, to help them understand and speak this language.  

Our SSL Program is an intensive language program that allows the students to obtain two important benefits: 1) the proper instruction and methodology to learn the language in a considerable short period of time, and 2) the constant cultural and living experience guided and advised throughout their stay in either of these countries by our instructors and personnel.  This in turn provides them with a fruitful learning endeavor.  

We hold our SSL Program in Panama City, Republic of Panama, which we have chosen for its reliable modern infrastructure, security, colorful culture and political stability.  We have all the comfort necessary for the well-being of your students, and our team provides all the support and the logistics for their pleasant stay in this country.  Your students will be in the best hands, just as if they were in yours.

We would like to explore the possibility to develop a liaison where your prestigious academic institution will be able to offer its students our SSL Program (Spanish as a Second Language Program) and discuss the benefits and aggregate value this relationship will provide your institution. We would appreciate if you let us know where to send you more information about us and who to contact directly as to provide you with the details of our program, and explore the different avenues that we can begin working together.  You may contact us at: (507) 263-0491 (Rep. of Panama) or at our representative office in Miami, FL, (305) 815-3495, or write to us via email: saamlanguage@tutopia.com 

Thank you very much for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
SAAMLanguage Center
