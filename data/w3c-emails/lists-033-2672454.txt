Department of Minerals And Energy
Pretoria, South Africa 

19th October 2002

Dear Sir,
INVESTMENT REQUEST.  
First I must solicit your strictest confidence in this communication. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret, as you were introduced to us in confidence through the South Africa/ Togo chamber of commerce, foreign trade division, during an official assignment to Lome.

We are top officials of the Directorate of Audit and Project Implementation at the Department of Minerals and Energy. In the course of our work, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US Funds representing a certain percentage of the Contract value executed for our Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the tune of US$24,800,000.00 (Twenty-Four million, eight hundred thousand United States Dollars only.). 

The company that executed the contract has been duly paid and the contract commissioned leaving the sum of US$24.8M floating in the escrow account of the Reserve Bank of South Africa ready for payment. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues  to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$24.8M  by legally sub-contracting the entitlement to you or your company.
 
This bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or running foreign accounts while in Government service hence the need for an overseas partner. We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been transferred into your account: (1)25% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary and recipient of the funds (2) 70% to us the Government officials(with which we wish to commence a lucrative business in conjunction with you) (3) 5% has been set aside as an abstract projection,( for reimbursement to both parties) for incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of bringing this transaction to a successful conclusion. 
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen working days of commencement after receipt of the following information From you: 
Your name, address, company details and activities, telephone and fax numbers. These information will enable us make applications and lodge claims to the concerned Ministries & agencies in favour of you or 
your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the telegraphic transfer is going to be 
made in your name or your company name.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using this email address, d.makanaki@eudoramail.com

Thank you and God Bless, as I wait for your urgent response.


Best Regards 

Dr. Desmond Makanaki
