Subject: Urgent Business Proposal
X-Mailer: ARAMAIL Web Mailer V 1.00

Dr. Andrew Osho.
Lagos-Africa


Dear  Sir,

   I, on behalf of my colleagues from different Federal
Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to
solicit your assistance as regards transfer of US$10,500,000.00 (Ten
Million,five Hundred Thousand US Dollars)into your bank account.These
funds emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of foreign 
contracting firms  who could not meet their financial obligations to 
their creditors.
  We, as holders of  sensitive positions in  our various
parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government
to scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign
contractors and we discovered that some of the
contractors have not been paid their contractual 
entitlement which collectively left the sum of
US$15,500,000.00 (Fiftheen Million, five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended  Account. 
However, from our  investigations,  we discovered that
the foreign beneficiary companies have  since been
liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no longer
exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this 
opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner,
to execute a transaction of this  nature.
  We agreed  that the said amount would be transferred 
into an overseas Bank Account to be provided by a
reliable foreign firm/associate.  This is  because as 
serving Government workers  the Civil Service Code
does not allow us to operate foreign Account.
  In our initial attempt to do this,  we  succeeded in
transferring part of this amount  US$5m (Five Million
Dollars) into a United States Dollar Account in
Beirut, Lebanon,  but our foreign associate failed to
honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that the
total amount be transferred into the Account before we
can share the money.   As a result, we have lost
confidence in the ability of our Lebanese  partner to
see this matter to its logical conclusion, and until
the initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved, we
have cancelled  further transactions  with him.
  In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that we
require a partner that  is not only capable of
rendering assistance and cooperation in executing this
matter, but will honour the terms of agreement when we
reach the concluding stages of this transaction.  We
therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in
return for services/assistance rendered in
successfully carrying out this project.
  We trust that you appreciate the sensitive nature of
this matter and the need for initial caution on our
part, but when a relationship is confidently
established and operations commence you will be
provided with all relevant information.
  I remain at your disposal to entertain any
questions/enquiries relating to this proposition and
you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail
for further information on the procedures and
requirements of this transaction.
  Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and
expediency.

Yours faithfully,
 
Dr. Andrew Osho.

Thank you and God bless.
