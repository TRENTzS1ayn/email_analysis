From Mrs. Mariam Abacha

ATTN: Sir,

I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian Head of state, 
General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on 
active service for our Country.
 
I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance 
to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of 30 million U.S 
dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes. This money came 
as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband and a Russian 
firm in our country's multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel plant.  The 
Russian partners returned my husbands share being the above sum after 
his death. 

Presently, the new civilian Government has intensified their probe into 
my husbands financial resources which has led to the  freezing of all 
our accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business 
licenses and the arrest of my first son. 
 
In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of 
our finance houses before it was closed down. I have deposited the money 
in a security  company here in Nigeria  (with a coded name) as family 
treasure in two trunks with the help of very loyal officials of my late 
husband. No record is known about this fund by the government because 
there is no documentation showing that we received such funds. 

Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to 
my family, I am closely monitored and cannot make use of this money, 
hence I seek your help in receiving these funds and pay into your account 
for the family safety. Bearing in mind that you may assist me, 

l have decided to part with 20% my personal Barrister Erim Danladi has 
been mandated to handle this entire matter with you. Therefore feel free 
to contact him at erimoma@lawyer.com Tel: 234-1-4709258 Fax: 234 
- 1 - 7597458 for more clarification and further discussion. Note that 
all correspondence should be directed to my lawyer.
Kind Regards,

 Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha
