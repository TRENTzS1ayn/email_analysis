MR UMARU BAGUDU. 
Lagos - Nigeria 

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT 

I got your contact from the British Chamber of Commerce, and they recommended you as an honest and trustworthy person. Based on this recommendation, I decide to contact you on behalf of MRS Mariam Abacha wife of Nigerian late Head of State.

When her husband was alive the head of state.I was made personal assistance, charged with the 
responsibilities of handling her personal business
and finances. Before the death of her husband, she strictly moved the sum of US$30M Unites States Dollars) in the custody of a reputable security company. 

Now her husband is dead and she can not travel out of
Nigeria yet, to avoid the present democratic
government from raising eye brow on her. She has
instructed me to contact a reliable person abroad to
go to the security company and secure the sum of
US$30M which she personally deposited at the security
company. 

Mrs Mariam Abacha want you to secure the funds in
security company, and subsequently invest it on her
behalf in your country with the trust that you will
not dissappoint or let her down. For your assistance
in this project you will be entitled to 30% of the
total sum involved. Note that this cash transaction is
only between Mrs Mariam Abacha and I therefore it is a
risk free business. 

There is nothing to bother about in this transaction.
The fund are already in a vault waiting for your
arrival. If you are interested in this project kindly
contact me immediately through the above telephone number or my e-mail address for further details before
your departure to the security company. Note also,
that this project requires a lot of secrecy and
confidentiality. Therefore you must keep this project
secret all times. 

Looking forward to hearing from you to begin a good business relationship.

Sincerely yours 

MR UMARU BAGUDU.
Personal Assistant to Mrs Mariam Abacha
