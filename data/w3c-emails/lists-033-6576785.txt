under watch by the seemingly Agent, above all our bank
accounts here and abroad have been frozen by the
Nigerian civilian Government. Furthermore, my eldest
son is in detention by the Nigerian Government for
more interrogation about my husband assets and some
vital documents.

Following the recent discovery of my husband's bank
account by the Nigerian Government with my son's bank
