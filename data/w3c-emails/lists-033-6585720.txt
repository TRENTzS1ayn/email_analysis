UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC,

LAGOS NIGERIA.

11/09/02

Attn: M.D,

My name is Clement Odunlami , the Western District Manager 
of United Bank for Africa Plc. (UBA). There is a 
domiciliary account opened in this bank in September 1980, 
in the name of Mr. Charles B. Smith, an expatriate who then 
was the manager of Petroleum & Technical Support services. 
The account was operated for about 1 year and 6 months 
after which it became dormant for about 81/2 years. Mr. 
Smith died in June 1990 in an auto crash.

After going through some old files, I observed that the 
account owner's next of kin is his wife who died with him 
in the auto crash. This has then made it impossible for 
anyone to lay claims to the funds deposited in the account. 
The top echelons of the bank are also unaware of the 
details of this account because of its length of dormancy. 
The amount left in the account is US$18,372,000.00. I have 
observed that if I do not transfer this money out of
the country, it would be forfeited.

I therefore want to transfer this money into a foreign 
account of an Individual or corporate body for safekeeping 
and investments. Since the funds belongs to a foreigner, it 
is then necessary that only a foreigner can lay claims to 
it, this is where your co-operation and partnership is 
needed. And with my position and knowledge of the history 
of the account, the transaction would be a huge
success.

I propose a meeting between us as soon as you indicate your 
willingness to co-operate with me in this transaction and a 
sharing formula of 80% for me and 20% for you at the end of 
the transaction. The transfer of the money to your
mandated account will be by swift to reach your bank within 
24 hours.

I look forward to your response by e-mail and also include 
your private telephone and fax numbers for more 
confidential discussions, I will want us to
conclude this transaction on or before next week.

Yours faithfully,

Mr.Clement Odunlami,
