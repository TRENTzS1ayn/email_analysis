  Ruth Hammond

  'All the good things'


                               
  'All the Good Things' (Tenterhook Records) features nine songs that show Ruth's craftsmanship in blending pop, jazz and funk in her own inimitable style. She has drawn her inspiration from artists such as Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crowe, James Taylor, Rickie Lee Jones, Frank McCombe, Donnie Hathaway, Sting, 
  Eva Cassidy and others, too numerous to mention.
