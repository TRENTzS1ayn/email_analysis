_PwrAmp_CAR-0206-003.htm?> CX77131-12P GaAs HBT Power Amplifier Chip Full
Circuit Analysis
The Conexant CX77131-12P is a Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC)
power amplifier module. The module includes the GaAs Heterojunction Bipolar
Transistor (HBT) chip and some bias passive components.

NetLogic
<http://www.chipworks.com/reports/flyers/NetLogic/NetLogic_NL877313_IPC
AM_CAR.htm?> Microsystems NL877313-50 IPCAM Ternary CAM Partial Circuit
Analysis
The new high-speed CAM device has an industry-leading monolithic density of
more than 4 Mbits and a user-defined width of 72, 144 or 288 bits. This
entry-width flexibility and large table depth vastly improves the
performance of address table lookups for enterprise, campus and Internet
edge routers.

The Fabless Semiconductor Association's (FSA) 2002 Suppliers Expo 
FSA is holding its annual premier event on October 3, 2002 at the Santa
Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA. FSA is dedicated to bringing
together suppliers, fabless com-panies, IDM's and other organizations that
play a vital role in the semiconductor industry of which Chipworks is proud
to be part of. The goal of the Expo is to encourage partnerships with
suppliers/vendors and illustrate what partnerships can accomplish within the
industry. This year's Expo features more than 125 exhibitors/suppliers,
allowing over 1,200 attendees. This is your opportunity to persue the latest
services, products, and state-of-the-art technology available. Visit
Chipworks at booth 112 and find out what's new inside technology.
