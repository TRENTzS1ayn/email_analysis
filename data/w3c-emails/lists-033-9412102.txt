assertion
  <http://www.chipworks.com/chipnews/2002_i03/assertion_title.gif> 
A patent asset owner has various options for realizing value from their
asset. This article, however, will focus on patent asset use in an
assertion-based exploitation model. This model has been successfully used by
a large and growing number of companies and other parties.

The starting point for such a process is to invest the necessary resources
to evaluate the contents of the patent portfolio in order to determine which
patents are the best candidates for having commercial value. Such review
processes may be undertaken using internal technical and legal resources, or
through external RE companies such as Chipworks. Whatever channel is used,
the reviews must provide an honest assessment of the commercial value at the
level of individual patents. 

The general assertion-based patent exploitation model involves the broad
steps of homework, assertion, negotiation and contract completion. The
homework step requires completion of a number of company-specific items,
such as competitive intelligence, assertion strategy, reverse engineering
(RE) and proof package. The assertion step involves use of the homework
through presentation and dialogue with the other party. When done
effectively, a successful patent licensing negotiation and contract
execution with the other party will follow.

Table 1 identifies the key process steps and functional mapping taken by
many companies. This is not the only approach possible, but it is one that
has worked very well in many instances. con't...

Just received - Micron ? Quad Data Rate(tm) (QDR(tm)) SRAM 

The Micron ? Quad Data Rate(tm) (QDR(tm)) SRAM is a high-speed, low-latency,
maximum-bandwidth, separate I/O, synchronous memory. It integrates simple
control logic and clocking schemes with programmable impedance, a
well-placed pinout, and an inexpensive small-footprint package. The QDR
features advanced 6 transistor SRAM cell CMOS process. Click

Competitive_Intelligence
  <http://www.chipworks.com/chipnews/2002_i03/comp_itell_title.gif> 


The semiconductor industry at present seems to be in the doldrums -
drifting, waiting for the economic winds of fortune to pick up and indicate
a direction. One of the tools to find a direction is competitive
intelligence (CI) -the systematic process of monitoring the competitive
environment. 
The CI process can be broken into phases:

*Planning - identifying intelligence needs, and designing the data
collection process
*Data collection and analysis (including interpretation)
*Creating recommendations for action
*Dissemination of findings and recommendations
*Feedback into the next planning phase

A key goal of CI is to present timely intelligence that allows decision
makers to use the information for competitive advantage. Consequently the CI
process must be able to collect data efficiently, distill it quickly, and
present swiftly and clearly. If the process becomes an end in itself, then
it becomes a waste of time and expense. con't

Chipworks <http://www.chipworks.com/publications/ftr.htm?> ' Focused
Technology Reviews (FTRs) compare how a process feature or a circuit block
has been implemented across many different semiconductor chips or
manufacturers. 

The FTR is an exceptional value, providing access to many reports often at a
lower cost than purchasing a single complete device report. For example, the
On-Die Interconnect Focused Technology Review takes a look at nineteen of
today's leading copper and aluminum interconnect (wiring) structures from
eleven different logic device manufacturers. Purchasing the individual full
device reports could easily cost in excess of $100K, whereas the FTR
compilation is priced at only $5K.

Other process related FTRs survey Shallow Trench Isolation Techniques and
embedded memory implementations across a number of manufacturers - SRAM and
DRAM,. Recently released circuit-related FTRs look at Phased Lock Loop and
Analog to Digital Converter circuit implementations and include actual
schematics of the circuit blocks and technical discussions on their
differences.

Device manufacturers can benchmark what the other leading edge manufacturers
are doing in production today. They can compare the available design
options, such as the tradeoffs between memory cell size and manufacturing
complexity and how this relates to cost. Fabless designers can assess the
availability of a given type of technology and make better informed
decisions as to what should be incorporated into their designs.
