Barrister AGAMA BRY
IKOYI-LAGOS.

DEAR SIR,

RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail,if the
contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics, I
appologise in advance.
I am barrister AGAMA BRY ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
Ishmaila Gwarzo estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer
of the then
military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late
General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent
of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under severe persecution due to
the sensitive position he held in the last military regime, presently
he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his
village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business
proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me
of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad.
This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to
my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security advicer to
the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds
transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and
ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president.
But before the purchase could take place the president died. my
client has deceided to keep this for himself as all his properties
has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner
that can help him facilitate the change of possession. the deposit
certificate 
and the code needed for the execution of this endeavour are in my
possession. my client is also well disposed towards reaching an
agreement with you 
that will be at par with the help required of you.

The funds in question is USD22M (Twenty Two Million United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
interest to you,
you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through
the rudiments of this endeavour.

I remain most obliged.

Yours faithfully,
Barrister AGAMA BRY(JP).
