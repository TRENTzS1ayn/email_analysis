Actually this isn't true. Assuming that the encryption was simple SSL/HTTP
the difference in security isn't very great. Anyone attacking the machine
itself would have the decrypted key either way. Any attacker snooping on the
packets as they went through could easily execute a man-in-the-middle
attack. Knowing how few users check the certificates carefully and look at
security details, I'm sure it would go by rather unnoticed for most.

Actually, if Alice's key is compromised, and you know the date of the
compromise, then you can still trust documents before that date.

I think you get some benefit from the Alice's public key being spread far
and wide, but I'm not sure what it is!
