  Is there a verbose explination of the ftp:// specifications somewhere?  
Or is it all folklore and mystery?  Or is it 1.1 in the FAQ and I have 
just missed it?  

There are helpful documents like:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/draft-casey-url-ftp-00.txt
but is there a description somewhere of how to to toggle the passive mode? 
Or can it be done?
