Thank you for the RFC 1738 reference and the PASV info.

While reading RFC 1738 3.2.2 there is an interesting section:

>  FTP URLs may also be used for other operations; for example, it is
>  possible to update a file on a remote file server, or infer
>  information about it from the directory listings. The mechanism for
>  doing so is not spelled out here.

Is it spelled out anywhere?


Cheers,
