Hello everybody.
My two cents:

There are different types of URI.
They are all identifiers.
Some are "more persistent" than others.

Example
URN:ISBN:1-56592-528-9
is definitively persistent:  (an O'Reilly book: "Apache, The Definitive
Guide")

Some others are less good as persistency,
but maybe better for other aspects.
The URL is an identifier and a locator (and maps to IP using DNS),
that makes them not so good in persistency, but
very good for resource retrieving on the network.

I think the questions are:
"Is there a better URI we can use to retrieve resources on the network?"
"Is it enough using URLs as they are, but with a careful use of them ?"
