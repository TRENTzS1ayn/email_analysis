So what?  Names that are not used are not useful, period.  Names that are
not useful are never created.  Names that are never created cannot be the
basis of a formal reasoning system like RDF.  So, unless this is yet another
exercise in navel gazing, using anything other than the same old names that
everyone else uses (commonly known as URI) is a total waste of time.

People call me "Roy" because there exists a socially-significant binding
between that name and myself as a conceptual entity within a reasonable
scope of my existance.  To increase scope, people add some more identifiers
(like my last name, my last known address, the institutions where I worked,
etc.).  They don't add syntax.

Yes, which is what gives the name a valuable association.  The fact that
some DNS names are not permanent is simply not relevant to my scope.  If
I want better scope, I use more names or pay for more resources to keep
that name around a lot longer.

PURL is maintained by the OCLC, which is essentially a library (albeit
an experimental one).  W3C is not.  However, I am quite certain that if
you give MIT a million dollar trust fund, they will give you an mit.edu
URL that will be permanent.

No, but no one can use that scheme until you do build those tools and deploy
them to the extent that the new name is more significant than some other
name.  Nobody has done that for URN without an additional layer of
indirection --- a resolution service that interprets the URN --- which
cannot avoid the problem of domain names changing any better than a
DNS-based naming authority.  Therefore it doesn't get deployed, and no
association exists between URNs and things people want to name, and thus
it is not useful as a naming system.

ISBN names are an excellent example.  They are not legitimate URNs, since
publishers are allowed to reuse them for multiple books (once the previous
ones are out of print).  And yet they are useful, so useful in fact that
folks commonly try to claim that <urn:isbn:0-201-56317-7> is somewhow
magically better than <isbn:0-201-56317-7>.  What makes an ISBN useful
is that it is used on the back of every book, not the fact that you can
squeeze it into a URL or URN syntax.

As opposed to finding a URN with any quality of service?
