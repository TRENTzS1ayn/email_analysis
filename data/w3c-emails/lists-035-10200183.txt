It's interesting to see this discussion arising again (as
it did a few months back, and seemingly every few months
for quite some time ;-)

The bottom line, as I see it, is that there are two things
we need both for the Web and the Semantic Web: (1) names, 
and (2) locations. That's the original logic between the 
URL/URN distinction (no less reflected in the very terms 
themselves). And this distinction is still crucial.

What RDF must have are universal names. URI's were adopted
(seemingly) because they offered an easy source for universal
names which theoretically should not collide. Unfortunately,
folks started to use HTTP URLs rather than some form
of URN scheme and all of the issues about persistency, authority, 
ownership, control, transferral, responsibility, etc. etc. came up 
because HTTP URLs are linked to DNS and thus inherit all such 
management issues from DNS. It also confused alot of folks into
thinking that resource URIs should be dereferencable in some
fashion and most significantly, hid the QName to URI mapping 
problem by clever use of HTML fragment syntax.

The use of HTTP URLs for resource names was a short term convenience
with long term drawbacks. It appears that more folks are
finally coming to appreciate that fact, which is certainly
a good thing.

It is significant that name and location are different. One
can have e.g. many mappings from a name to different locations or
multiple names to the same location. It's not about whether
HTTP URLs *can* be used as names (they obviously can), but about
what the requirements are for names versus locations. Name URIs tend 
to be simpler and demand less overhead (e.g. resolution). Location URIs 
tend to be more structured and incur more overhead (e.g. resolution, 
redirection, etc.). Thus URI schemes which are intended to identify 
locations may be less suitable to be used to represent names than URI 
schemes intended for that purpose.

All URIs are created equal, to a certain degree, however
the syntax, storage, processing, and other constraints
and machinery surrounding their use are dictated by specific 
purposes and needs -- i.e. how those URI schemes are meant to
be used. It's not that one cannot bend a URI scheme to
some use other than originally intended, only that to do
so may come back to bite you.

This is the case with using HTTP URLs as names. For those with
large ontologies based on HTTP URLs, bend over, the big bite is 
coming ;-)

Still, this issue of URI vs URN vs URL is not a show stopper. The
SW can proceed even using HTTP URLs for names (hampered by their
shortcomings). Those who understand the issues will use URN schemes
for names and URL schemes for locations and be happier for it. Those
who don't will face the music in due time. But, as pointed out in
this thread, the issues are really about management, not about their
inherent suitability as universal identifiers (aside from the case
of non-synonymous reuse).

Though there are "social" issues of how such choices of URI scheme
might impact the global SW as a whole, such that the choice of someone else 
to use HTTP URLs (or any other persistence-challenged URI scheme) for names 
impacting my SW agent because those URIs become reused and introduce
ambiguity 
into the mix, etc. is not nearly as critical as the present and persisting 
disconnect between QNames and resource URIs -- which IMO is far more serious

(see my posting to the www-rdf-interest@w3.org list in June entitled "A
proposed 
solution to the RDF syntactic/semantic mapping problem." and the subsequent
thread
for more details).

Cheers,

Patrick
