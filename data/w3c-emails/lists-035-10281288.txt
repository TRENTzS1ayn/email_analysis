Interesting. Someone pointed your bug report out to me and they 
are very much related. The reason Python fails the test suite is 
because it treats queries and parameters specially, where as 
RFC2396 treats them only as a normal part of the path segment. 
So perhaps the solution is to just get rid of parameters and 
query...
