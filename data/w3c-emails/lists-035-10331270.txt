Announcing RESTwiki, a Wiki devoted to documenting and understanding
REST (REpresentational State Transfer), the name given by Roy Fielding
to the architecture of the Web as implemented in HTTP and URIs. 
 
Some of the topics we expect the Wiki to cover include; 
 * various descriptions of REST and its pros and cons 
 * REST & Web services 
 * RPC, SOAP, and REST 
 * and last but not least, the obligatory "REST FAQ"
