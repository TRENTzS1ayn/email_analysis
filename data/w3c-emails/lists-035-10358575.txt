I wrote this up for discussion purposes, as a response
to some of the discussion about URNs, URIs, and the
difference between abstractions and resources that
describe them. The discussions have been on many mailing
lists (in the "to" list). However, in the interest of
reducing the number of duplicate messages, I suggest not
cc'ing all of these lists in subsequent discussions.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: 'duri' and 'tdb': URN Namespaces based on dated URIs
Author(s): L. Masinter
Filename: draft-masinter-dated-uri-00.txt
Pages:
Date: 22-Aug-01

This document defines two persistent namespaces of URNs based on
prepending a date to an (encoded) URI. The results are namespaces
in which names are readily assigned but which offer the persistence
of reference that is required by URNs. The first namespace (duri)
is used to refer to URI-identified resources themselves, while the
second namespace (tdb) is used to refer to abstractions that are
not themselves networked resources but are 'described by' them.
This idea and things like it have been discussed for several years,
but recent discussion about use of URIs and URNs for identifiers
in XML-based constructs has inspired writing this up more completely.

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.
