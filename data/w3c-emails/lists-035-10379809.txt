Do you plan to publish this as an RFC?

There's a typo in the paragraph beginning:
So "urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org" can be used to designate the
Internet Engineering Task Force organization...
You need to s/duri/tdb/

In lieu of 
<urn:duri:19990114:http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names> you may 
want to cite <http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114>. 
Can you explain why you didn't?

Using:
         urn:duri:2000:urn:ietf:std:50
to refer to "the document that was STD 50 that was in effect as 
of the first instant of 2000" seems problematic to me, since 
that URN represented the same resource in 2000 as it would at 
any other time, namely the IETF STD 50 document. You seem to be 
implying that the use of duri changes the semantics of the 
resource involved. Is this so?
