Let me experiment with that ANNOUNCE slug to discourage cross-posting in
reply.

** URI folks:  The Grid Information Services Working Group has under
consideration a proto-RFC known as the Grid Notification Framework (GNF), see

 Grid Forum Areas and Groups
 http://www.gridforum.org/groups/WG.html

The general class of applications or services served by this framework has
widespread use for the combination of the two "information fields"

producedBy=service
asOf=dateTime

And that combination is perhaps (we need to nail this semantic bit down,
yet) a sufficient key for obtaining any available further information
related to the transaction which yielded the information passed in the
notification.  Sounds like probable cause for having a URI form for this
tuple as a unit, or at least considering one.

Since the vast marjority of URI uses transiting the Web today can be viewed
just as naturally as service-request parmeters as they are viewed as
resource-identification dereferences, it is likely/desirable that the
'service' identification in the above remain conformant to or interoperable
with reference by URI.

I get overly academic.  The point is that The Grid is a user group which
_will_ be using 'duri' semantics as discussed in
