No, you haven't got the point, yet.  At least not if I get the point.

'tdb' may be heuristically expanded "that described by" and it is not the
representation or recovered value of the resource that this indicates at all,
but the abstract notion of stuff that is acceptable when the cited resource is
applied as an acceptor or filter.  XHTML 1.1 is a name we bandy about.  It is
"the name of a language."  It is notions such as "a language" in this phrase
which are extension-indefinite and intension-definite for which the 'tdb' form
of URI directing us to "apply the utterance-of-record indicated by the
embedded
URI as restrictive description" is the most accurate form of citation.

This makes "tdb(XHTML 1.1 definitive URI)" a perfectly beautiful
'predicate' to
apply in EARL even if it is a funny sort of URI.  But EARL wants that sort of
funny URIs, doesn't it?
