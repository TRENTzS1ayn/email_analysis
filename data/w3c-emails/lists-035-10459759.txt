AG:: No.? The property is intension-equivalent to the assertion that that
object plays the indicated role with regard to the object bearing the
property.? The object is not the property, it is the 'value' of the property.

Properties are memes, patterns, and not objects.? There is an actual 'thing'
which is the uttered articulation of an acceptor.? To cite it with 'tdb' and
you have a system that works.

Yes, we want to make memes "first class" but they are not "first class
_objects_."? By the time you assume they are objects, you have lost the
ballgame.? The difference is of the essence.

Everything should be as simple as possible, and no simpler.? The duality of
the
Boolean algebra is a very strong automorphism.? But the two operators, or the
two morphs, absolutely are distinct.? To make objects of memes is to attempt
the one-point compactification of the Boolean algebra by saying that the
universal set and the empty set are the same.? This is not effective software
engineering, IMHO.

AG:: Yes, that's an assumption, but not a fact.? 

It fails to be true of the large category of de_facto URIs known as search
URLs.
The service of searching persists.? but there is no persistent association to
anything beyond this verb.? In the case of this class of URIs, one has to
spell
the service request verb-object, and not object-verb, because the identity of
the object(s) recovered is the value-added innovation, what is produced
that is
novel relative to what is consumed, by this service.

AG:: sure.? Notably that's exactly what news: URLs citing articles by
Message-ID are.? And vice versa.? Names encoded as ISBNs help you locate books
on the shelves and in interlibrary loan.? That is a good bit of their
utility. 
The semantics of URLs and URNs runs together in a way that assuming a
partition
is not a very strong play.  See for historical amusement
