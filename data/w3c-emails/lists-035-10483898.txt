No, that's not what I was talking about.  The term "URN" refers to what is
in the URN RFCs published by the IETF, not the generic notion of Names that
you will often find in TimBL's, Dan Connolly's, or my own design notes.
ISBN makes for excelent Names, but they are explicitly forbidden to be "URN"
as described in the IETF RFCs because the naming authority does not
guarantee their persistence over all time (not even over a short time).

I don't think that is a good thing, but I try not to mix terminology
once its been put in somebody else's proposed standard.
