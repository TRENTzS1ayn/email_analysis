That's interesting; a number of people seem to not be under that
impression. For example:-

   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hakala-isbn-01.txt

Hmm... this is what it says under "Identifier persistence considerations":-

   The ISBN accompanies a publication from its production
   onwards. It is persistent; ISBN once given - if correct - will
   never leave the publication.

Heh, that's a bit of a fudge, isn't it? Note that according to [1] this
internet draft is listed as being of status "RFC-EDITOR", which apparently
means:-

   RFC-EDITOR -- The IESG has approved the internet-draft
   and the document is sitting in the RFC Editor's queue

Which I read as meaning that anytime soon, this document could go to RFC.

ISBN is also not listed under Dan Connolly's list of URI schemes [1], but
as that list is missing quite a few schemes, and is in no way "official",
that's not much of an indication that it isn't a URI scheme.

Of course, it really doesn't matter either way. That the RFC's don't
correspond to "TimBL's, Dan Connolly's, or my [RF's] own design notes" is a
bit worrying, but that will take time, effort, and a whole lot of
discussions...
