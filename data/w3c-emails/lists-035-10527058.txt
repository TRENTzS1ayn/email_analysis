I don't ever remember it being 'explicitly forbidden'. It was simply
pointed out as a problem that any ISBN namespace would have to address
if it was to be a URN scheme.  

Juha's document addresses it very much the way we expected it to. The 
cases where an ISBN gets 'reassigned' come in two forms: error and 
subjective equality. The first is rare and, because
its something done by humans, will always occur in any namespace. The
second is more subtle. When the publisher assigns the same ISBN to a what
you or I might consider another work it is not an error. It is a statement
of what the publisher considers 'equivalence'. If you want something
that has some vastly more granular naming system that forces publishers
to rev the name for any change whatsoever (book collectors would go so
far as to require a new name to be assigned if the type of paper changed
subtly during a print run) then that's another namespace run for 
different reasons.
