Dear URI Experts,

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-url-i18n-08.txt
about the internationalization of URIs (called IRIs) has recently
been updated and published.

This has been around for a long time, but we plan to move ahead with it
in the very near future. Please have a look at the document,
and send me any comments that you have soon.

Many thanks in advance,     Martin.



A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI)
Author(s): L. Masinter, M. Duerst
Filename: draft-masinter-url-i18n-08.txt
Pages: 12
Date: 28-Nov-01

This document defines a new protocol element, an Internationalized
Resource Identifier (IRI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from
the Universal Character Set [10646]. A mapping from IRIs to URIs
[RFC 2396] is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead
of URIs where appropriate to identify resources
