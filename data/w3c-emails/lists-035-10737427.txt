Persistent is fundamentally due to people, and technology can assist but not
guarantee. 

I very much agree with the point made here that there are legitimate,
desirable, and unavoidable reasons for changing organisation names, domains
etc.; so let's deal with it.  One aim of naming entities or resources is to
avoid tying an entity  name to a domain name (or any other piece of variable
metadata); compare the domain names/trademarks issue.  The entity can be
persistently named as a first class object irrespective of its location,
owner, licensee, etc.  Distinguishing names from locations is essential for
e-commerce:  it is trivially true that "all names are locations" (in a
namespace) - but practically, most people worry about spaces like URLs and
that's the wrong level.  Naming entities as first class objects, rather than
locations, enables better management of e.g. multiple instances of an
object.

In the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) initiative (http://www.doi.org) we
have concluded that technology can help with persistence: e.g. a redirection
resolution step enables management in the redirection directory, rather than
in bookmarks and the like, thereby ensuring that one change can be picked up
by many users even if they are unaware of the change.  But to manage the
data in the directory takes effort, time, incentive, etc. - either you do
that locally (purl like) or as a global service (DOI).  In our case we see
that as ultimately a role for registration agencies - we can learn from
other proven activities like bar codes, ISBNs, and other data systems.  And
people aren't free, so there's a cost to this (just like the physical bar
code system , the DOI aims to be a self-funding operation).  DOIs won't be
appropriate for many things, and some people won't feel this  people cost
merits the reward.  But we do think DOIs are a viable solution for content
management of intellectual property on a large scale.

That isn't true, as an orgnaization's DNS names can get taken away
from them due to conflicts of which they were not originally aware.
But even if it were true, many organizations change name and/or domain
name for marketing reasons, because new management wants to make a
change, because old management wants to appear to be making a change,
etc.

It makes no sense to me to have the stability of MIME Type /
Content-Type <-> URI mappings to depend on the name stability and duty
assignment stability of IANA or ICANN or the IETF or W3C.  This
mapping will get embedded into widely deployed code, essentially
impossible to get globally updated.
