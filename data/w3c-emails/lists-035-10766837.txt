Sadly HTTP URLs _will_ be resolved even when that's unnecessary
for them to be meaningful as bare identifiers. And if they are,
then servers (particularly ones hosting extremely popular DTDs
or namespaces) might well be in trouble.

xml-dev's RDDL or anything similar, if widely adopted, would put 
namespaces more or less on a par with DTDs on the 'XML parsers 
running off to get stuff' front. These aren't problems with
either DTDs or namespace URIs per se. The problem is using a 
protocol (and, by extension, encoding that protocol in an 
identifier via a scheme) which doesn't support distribution and 
replication in a way which is appropriate for this kind of
situation.

You've mentioned an Akamai-type solutions to this problem. I
don't see how that's supposed to help ... could you elaborate?

Cheers,


Miles
