Will they be resolved by the origin server enough that it's a problem? 
How do you know?

I couldn't disagree more.  It is a requirement on validating parsers
that the DTD be retrieved.  It is not a requirement on any existing
piece of software that a representation of an XML namespace be
retrieved.

The architecture of the Web, and the design of URIs and HTTP, is meant
to accomdate *exactly* this situation.  What exactly does HTTP not do
that you need?

Just that URL resolution (including HTTP URLs) need not ever reach the
origin server.
