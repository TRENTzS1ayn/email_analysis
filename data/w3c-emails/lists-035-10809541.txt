What's 'often enough' to cause a problem? It could be quite a low
frequency. How do I know? I don't ... and I don't want hostages 
left to fortune.

What have requirements got to do with anything? There's no
requirement that non-validating parsers retrieve DTDs, but some
do (I believe that Suns/Crimson did at one time, maybe still
does). Mutatis mutandis for namespace URIs and anything that
might be hanging off the end of them.

Huh? If my client isn't configured to use a proxy (either 
directly or transparently) then if I try to retrieve,

  http://www.example.com/blah.dtd

it goes off and hits www.example.com. What current, widely 
deployed, widely applicable, mechanism is there for redirecting 
that request elsewhere? Even if my client is configured to use
a proxy, the proxy might not have that resource cached.

By 'widely applicable', I mean a mechanism which can be applied 
to a 'hot' resource without the hosting site having to be 
radically rejigged (eg. wholesale delegation to a third party via 
DNS).

More detail please ...
