This may be of some indirect interest to people here. The WEBI WG in
the IETF (disclaimer: I'm one of the chairs) has established a work
item to define an 'Intermediary Discovery and Description' mechanism,
which clients (whether user-agents or intermediaries) can use to
determine what device it should contact - whether that device is a
proxy, surrogate (delegated authority) or the authority - to locate
the device.

Currently, the group is gathering requirements; the first draft is
available at
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webi-idd-reqs-00.txt

I think this may be interesting to this list because this mechanism
will effectively be a shim between clients and the network, and will
affect how all URIs' authorities are resolved.
