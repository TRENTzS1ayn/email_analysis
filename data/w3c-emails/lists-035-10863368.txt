Dan Connolly, at <http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#news>, points to an
Al Gilman draft which now returns:

[[ The site that you are looking for is no longer hosted on this server.
   There are no files located here for the username: asgilman. ]]
   - http://access.digex.net/~asgilman/uri/news/draft-gilman-news-url-02.txt
     404 Not Found

An older version of the document is at:
  http://www.alternic.org/drafts/drafts-g-h/draft-gilman-news-url-01.html
but perhaps someone can get a newer copy so we can fix the link on the W3C
site (or Dan can just link to the old one).

Thanks,
