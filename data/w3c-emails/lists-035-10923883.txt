There are many different meanings for "equivalent"; you must define
the purpose for which you want to know equivalence before your question
can be answered accurately. Here are some clear distinctions, however:


http://hostwhatever

and

http://hostwhatever#

are different in that the former is an 'absolute URI' and the latter
is a 'URI reference'. There are circumstances (e.g., within the HTTP
protocol talking to a proxy) where the former is allowed and the latter
is not.

http://hostwhatever

and

http://hostwhatever?

are always different. The "?" at the end is part of the path and not
equivalent.

http://host:80 and http://host and http://host/ and http://host:80/
and the case variations of the host name are equivalent because
they are defined to be so by the 'generic syntax':

RFC 2396 section 6:

    In general, the rules for
    equivalence and definition of a normal form, if any, are scheme
    dependent. When a scheme uses elements of the common syntax, it will
    also use the common syntax equivalence rules, namely that the scheme
    and hostname are case insensitive and a URL with an explicit ":port",
    where the port is the default for the scheme, is equivalent to one
    where the port is elided.

and RFC 2616 section 3.2.3:

       - A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default
         port for that URI-reference;

         - Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;

         - Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive;

         - An empty abs_path is equivalent to an abs_path of "/".

    Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
    RFC 2396 [42]) are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.
