I am very interested in learning more about the new/resurrected 
W3C activities and plans in the URI area.   

I have been working for some time with the notion of open document
identifiers for reference linking and have developed a proposal
for a bibp: (bibliographic protocol) scheme.   

BibP (bibliographic protocol) links bibliographic identifiers of published
works to bibliographic services for those works. Identifiers follow the
Universal Serial Item Name (USIN) scheme, providing a
scholar-friendly conventional notation for journal articles, books and
institutional publications, as well as a generic framework that can
scale to identify documents in any organized collection. A hierarchical
resolution model emphasizes bibliographic services available through
local libraries backed up by publisher-specified and global services.
Resolution is achieved through existing DNS technology coupled with
appropriate client-side support.   This support may be embedded
in documents directly in the form of a short ECMAscript resolver.

The BibP/USIN approach applies the principles underlying the Uniform
Resource Name (URN) concept [RFC1737] to the particular problem of
bibliographic linking. Focussing on a library-based network in this
narrower domain, BibP defines a much simpler resolution model than
that required for URN support in general [RFC2276]. Based on existing
DNS support for relative domain names [RFC1034], the model requires
no new development or deployment of DNS technology. In addition, the
problems of namespace definition and management [RFC2611] are consid-
erably simplified by restriction to bibliographic identifiers of the
USIN system.
   
See http://usin.org/ for more details about the project and some
rudimentary demos.

An internet draft draft-cameron-tatu-bibp-02.txt describes 
the protocol and has been submitted to the IETF for RFC publication.   
It's available from the usual places or from the http://usin.org/ page.
I would very much appreciate constructive feedback from the URI WG 
with respect to this document.
