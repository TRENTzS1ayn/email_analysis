Under 

Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Schemes

it says:

# RFC 1738 defines Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and an initial
# set of URL schemes. In this file, the IANA records these schemes 
# and others defined subsequently.

but 1738 has been updated:


RFC 2396 defines Uniform Resource Locators, and RFC 2717
establishes the registration proceedures. A base set was defined
in RFC 1738, but many of these were updated subsequently.
As a special case, the "urn" URL scheme is used to write 
URNs within the URI syntax.
