Interesting draft, but I have a few questions:

What's wrong with the current system of URI mapping:

    http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/

especially:

    http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/

Also, what's the point of making URIs into content types? Where would this
be used?

Thanks for clearing things up,
