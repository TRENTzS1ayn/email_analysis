IANA makes no guarantees that its web site will not change substantially
in organization.

Our examination of the current IANA web site is that the organizations
of URIs is informal and not intended for automatic processing.

There is no guarantee that "www.isi.edu" will continue to be the authority
for IANA.

I'm not sure what requirement Don Eastlake was looking at; the problem
that got the rest of us going was the proposal that CCPP
(http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/)
use URIs to identify media features and similar elements.
