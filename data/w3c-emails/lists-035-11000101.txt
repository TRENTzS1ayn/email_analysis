OK, so... let's fix that; let's set up
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/plain
and so on, similar to the existing materials, and let's get
IANA to guarantee not to change it without due process.

If you want more machine processability, use
stylized/constrained XHTML for the materials
(or any other form of XML that you like;
the widely deployed support for XHTML is
pretty handy, though).

The ability to trade a URI for information about a media
assignment using ubiquitously deployed software (DNS
and HTTP) is sufficiently valuable that IANA/isi set
up a system to do it even before there was any
institutional mandate to do so. And there's no
conflict between that sort of system and
institutionalized names. So let's not sacrifice
the utitility of the DNS/HTTP set up and
get nothing in return.

Let's not pretend that a different URI scheme
will somehow magically provide more stability
than http/dns; stability depends on
social practices, not just technology.
