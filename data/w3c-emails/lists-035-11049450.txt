IANA is more or less in the process of moving from isi.edu to
iana.org, an illustration of the instability of domain names.

There is no guarantee of this structure remaining the same and I don't
see why one would think you could design a structure that would
encompass all current and future IANA supervised protocol parameter
values.  Using a domain name in a fundamental protocol parameter
encoding is basicly a bad idea except in some cases where the domain
name is in a part of the DNS name space specifically set aside for
that purpose.  Basicly unless it is under .arpa (or a few .*.int
second level domains that were allocated before it was decided to put
future parameter domains under .arpa).

To express the types of objects that have only a URI type label
originally defined in MIME contexts such as SMTP where only
Content-Type is permitted.
