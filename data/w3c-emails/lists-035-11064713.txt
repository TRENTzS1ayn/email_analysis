Hi Larry,

I agree with you, at least in this message  :-) ...

Well, at least in principle it used to be possible for the IAB to
instruct IANA but it essentially never happened and these days IANA is
maybe sorta part of ICANN or who knows what...  But as a practical
matter you are right.

Agreed.

(If the idea is for a human to browse info about protocol parameters,
they can find their way around whatever currently is the site which
should certainly change rarely.  If the idea is that some info needs
to be automatically and mechanically retrieved, then you need to
engineer an appropriate solution, like "in-addr.arpa" or whatever,
which is almost certainly dependent on the particular protocol
parameter.)

The societal practice of DNS is that it's a giant political football
subject daily to litigation, arbitration, and loud arguments that it
has terrible data quality, provides terrible service, and should be
junked and replaced by something completely different and much better.

Or some other organization replaces IANA for some parameter(s).

Witness current suggestions to change to a new CLASS of DNS for
internationalization, etc.
