So then use iana.org -- we expect that this will be around for a while, no?

You wouldn't have to -- you could create them (as subdirectories) as they
were needed. (I think I'm missing something here... what do you mean?)

Why? It's just a string. You suggest one string, I suggest another. It just
so happens that my string has greater utility and meaning to many people at
this point in time. If that meaning and utility go away at some point in the
future, then both of our strings will be equally useful once again.

In other words, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

Ahh, I see. You should really talk to the Content-Type: whatever+xml folks
about this -- people keep asking them to use namespaces as content-types.
Perhaps your system could solve this problem.
