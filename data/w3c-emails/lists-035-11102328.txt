"If wishes were horses then beggars would ride."

If http URLs were as stable as we wished them to be,
then we could use them in all of our specs.

W3C as an organization may decide that its identifiers
will be meaningful and unambiguous only as long as it
has the right to use "http://www.w3.org/" but I see no
good reason to force that practice on everyone else.

That you, Aaron Swartz, do not see the need to use anything
other than "http://www.iana.org", which has sufficient
stability for your own purposes, doesn't mean that it will
meet the needs of everyone else.

I suppose this argument will persist until we resolve
the W3C/IETF split over the utility of URNs and their
role in protocol element identification.
