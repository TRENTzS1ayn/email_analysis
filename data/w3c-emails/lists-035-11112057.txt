I hate to see this argument pointlessly persist, so I will stop arguing
after this question:

Why aren't my URLs safe? That is, why do I have to worry about an address at
iana.org suddenly disappearing one day? What needs are not met by this
system?

I use URLs for a lot of the work I do and I'm curious whether I'm making a
mistake.

Thanks,
