From my standpoint there are two reasons:

One of the main reasons is that due to existing case law you 
don't own your domain-name (the same way you don't own your telephone
number). If a court says so a registry is required to remove that
domain-name from service and either not give it back out to anyone or
sell it to someone (probably a competitor).

Reason two: since there is nothing inherent to domain-names or
http or anything else, the only way I know I can use your
URLs anytime beyond tomorrow afternoon is that you have told me so.
That may be fine if I interact with you on a daily basis but
if I come across some URI 'in the wild' I have no idea how
persistent it may be and if I do act as though it were useable
beyond tomrrow afternoon then _I_ am the one making an error in
assumptions. Now, if the URI scheme requires that it be persistent
then I can start doing some pretty powerful things since I can
now make that assumption safely. If the URI I find 'in the wild'
is part of that scheme and it doesn't follow those rules then
I know that it is an error in the network, not in my making
erroneous assumptions....

Probably not for most cases. But if you plan on using a URI 10 or 20
years from now it just might be a problem. Heck, there was a large amount
of discussion at the last IETF about creating a new DNS class
and changing the rules _completely_ (in a new class you don't
have to follow any of the old rules, including delegation models).
