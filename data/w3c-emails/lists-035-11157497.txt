Hi,

I'ved added ietf-types to the cc list as I think people there will be
interested.

Who knows?  Mail from iana.org even today has Message-ID headers that
end with iana@icann.org.

If you are going to put a domain name into a URI value of (or mapping
of the value of) a fundamenal protocol parameter, you don't usually
want the operational inflexibity of putting all the structure into
"subdirectories".  If you put more of it into subdomains, then DNS can
be used to delegate management if/when that is appropriate.

No, it is not just a string.  It is a syntactically correct
identification of a node in the global DNS namespace.  Grabbing URIs
that just happen to be useful for human lookup "at this point in time"
and making them the permanent mapping has only a trivial current
benefit and the strategy ignores the cost of repeatedly changing them
in the future and the injury to anyone who might take over the domain
name for a different purpose in the future.

Fundamental protocol mappings and constants get locked into read only
memory.  There used to be a root DNS server at the host A.ISI.EDU
(which was the host ISIA in the global hosts.txt befor DNS was
deployed).  But that machine was soon decomissioned and the A root
server moved elsewhere.  A couple of years ago, more than ten years
after ISIA had been decomissioned, a workstation was installed at the
same IP address as ISIA used to have been.  It immediately started
getting dozens of root zone zone transfer requests a second!

In fact, I can't see why, in the dynamic environment of the Internet,
you would mandate a particular organizational domain name in the URIs
for the mapping of the values of a protocol parameter, unless your
goal was to try to lock in that orgnaization and its name.  It is my
personal opinion that neither isi.edu nor iana.org particularly want
to get locked in when the locus of managemet of some protocol
parameter could get moved elsewhere.

As above, I don't agree.

Perhaps some of them are on ietf-types which I've added to the cc list.
