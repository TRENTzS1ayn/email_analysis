While it seems likely that .arpa can be preserved exclusively for
protocol parameter uses, the control of all other .* has passed to
ICANN except maybe contries have something to say about their country
codes except maybe that the US Department of Commerce asserts ultimate
veto authority over any changes to the root zone...

In any case, it is not clear that an I-D/RFC cuts any ice for *.org
these days.  You could probably use that mechansim to assign iana.arpa
but the hardwiring of this protocol parameter mapping to and
organization which happens at any particular future time to be IANA is
one of the things that I find objectionable.
