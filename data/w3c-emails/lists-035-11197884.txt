Are you conversant with the existing work targeted to development of
service-locator services?

That is what the error recovery here might gateway into.

The recovery rules aren't necessarily site specific.  It looks as though what
the webserver needs to do is

a) on 404
b) do head matching to strip the longest BASE that actually matches your
current offerings in http: namespace
c) check the resulting tail for URI compliance
d) if in URI syntax, pass to some 'whazzat?' server on the net.
e) if success, pass results to consumer [as 300?] in lieu of the 404 you would
have sent.
f) if no match, send 404 as before

And yes, I bet that this recovery trap door into the service location service
would get lots of use.
