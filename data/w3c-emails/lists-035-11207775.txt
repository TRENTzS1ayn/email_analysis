I agree.  In which case, it seems reasonable to use a form of URI whose 
very form carries a clear signal of stable intent.  To my mind, that is the 
big advantage of using a URN form.

I don't dispute that http: URLs are technically adequate for the purpose of 
identification.  But that is a technology-led argument that seems to ignore 
the social practices and expectations that surround them.
