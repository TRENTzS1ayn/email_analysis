Maybe these folks need an answer to the question "what's behind a
namespace URI ?".

The namespace req just says a word about what's not its goal: 

"The attribute's value, a URI reference, is the namespace name
identifying the namespace. The namespace name, to serve its intended
purpose, should have the characteristics of uniqueness and persistence.
It is not a goal that it be directly usable for retrieval of a schema
(if any exists)." 

If there is no intention to reference anything, why not defining a
generic "namespace:" URI scheme with the same syntax than "http:" that
would clearly show that the only purpose is to provide an id ?

It wouldn't be perfect, but would at least avoid that everyone reinvent
its own scheme !

If there is an intention to reference something, why not specifying it ?

The W3C site seems to implement some clever ideas based on content type
negociation that could be used in conjunction with RDDL and it might be
nice to know if it's a direction that will be further documented and
specified ;=) ...
