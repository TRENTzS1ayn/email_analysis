That isn't true, as an orgnaization's DNS names can get taken away
from them due to conflicts of which they were not originally aware.
But even if it were true, many organizations change name and/or domain
name for marketing reasons, because new management wants to make a
change, because old management wants to appear to be making a change,
etc.

It makes no sense to me to have the stability of MIME Type /
Content-Type <-> URI mappings to depend on the name stability and duty
assignment stability of IANA or ICANN or the IETF or W3C.  This
mapping will get embedded into widely deployed code, essentially
impossible to get globally updated.
