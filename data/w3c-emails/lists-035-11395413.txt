From what I've seen, a lot of folks are concerned about using the HTTP
scheme for namespaces because they don't want their web servers
overloaded.

Even after explaining the concept of URL-as-name, describing HTTP's
proxy features, and using Akamai as an example, I haven't yet seen
anybody swayed by this argument.

That doesn't explain DAV though.
