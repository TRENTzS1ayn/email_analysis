Perhaps folks'd be interested in your posting a pointer to your dissertation 
and citing the applicable pages/sections in the context of this thread?

Reading the thread and poking through your (comprehensive, thus large) 
dissertation have proved fruitful to me, although I'm sure I'd find some 
pointers from you would help me ensure I don't miss some critical &| 
subtle-but-important items.

thanks,
