Mark -- w.r.t. the above quote -- can you (now) describe how "the product" 
uses URNs? Is it using ad-hoc, informal, or formal URN Namespace 
Identifier(s)? How is it making use of and leveraging URNs? What is it about 
the resources/artifacts being identified via the URNs that makes URNs more 
applicable than say using a URL-style URI (i.e. an existing URI "scheme"), or 
inventing a new URI scheme (having different semantics than URNs')?
