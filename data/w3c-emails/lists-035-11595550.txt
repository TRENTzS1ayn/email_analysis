I'm not sure what you mean, but I assume the question is when it is OK to
enter an URI like:

http://w3.org/

as opposed to:

http://www.w3.org/

The answer is that this is based on the DNS records of the domain name. When
you register a domain name, you provide two (or more) DNS servers which are
used to lookup various machines on that domain (www.domain.com,
ftp.domain.com, etc.). The effect of dropping the "www" is dependent on the
DNS records that exist for that domain.
