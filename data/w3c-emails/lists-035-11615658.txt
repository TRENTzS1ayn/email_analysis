For http URIs: the www. prefix is just a convention: whether it's needed
or not is up to the administrators who manage the parent domain name, e.g.
example.com for www.example.com. If they have made an address record for
example.com, and the webserver at that address accepts the name, then you
can use it. Likewise for home.example.com, etc.

For other URIs, especially non-URLs, www (if it appears at all) may be an
essential part of the URI, and removing it could create a completely
different URI.

No; however some Web browsers, if unable to look up an address for a
domain name in an http URL, will prefix www. and try again.

No, unless the registered name servers don't allow the necessary records
to be created.
