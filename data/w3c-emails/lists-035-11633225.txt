Agreed, it's a useful convention, as one can infer from minimal
information the type of service that's likely to be available.  For
example (and in the spirit of 2219), if I'm looking for a DNS
"authority" for a given domain, I often seek ns[1].foo.com.  In your
mail, Larry, Outlook displays a working HTTP hyperlink for
www.realbeer.com but not for realbeer.com.  

However, what I DON'T like about it is the onomotopoiea of "double-u
double-u double-u"...  <g>  -- Ian

But RFC 2219 "Use of DNS Aliases for Network Services"
is a Best Current Practice and gives several reasons why distinguishing
between www.realbeer.com and realbeer.com might be a good idea.
