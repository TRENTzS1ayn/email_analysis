I find it good practice to redirect other hostnames' port 80 to
www, rather than CNAME it, so that search engines, caches and the
like don't have duplicates.

I.e., instead of having foo.com and www.foo.com return the same
resources, have all requests to foo.com redirected to the appropriate
part of www.foo.com, to reduce duplication. This is easy to configure
in most servers.
