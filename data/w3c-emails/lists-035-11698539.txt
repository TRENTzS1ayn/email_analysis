Yes, it does, per the documentation for IIS 5.0.  It's on the Directory
(Home Directory, Virtual Directory) tab.  -- Ian

Yup.

That's what W3C does:

$ curl -I http://w3.org/
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 Jun 2001 17:10:49 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_perl/1.23
Location: http://www.w3.org/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

I was trying to help somebody set up some redirects on their server a
while back... they were using Microsoft IIS. I looked for HTTP redirect
configuration options and couldn't find it.

Does IIS support HTTP redirects? Anybody know?
