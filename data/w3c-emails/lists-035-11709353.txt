This is a couple'o (key) messages from a thread over on the 
bxxpwg@invisible.net list that may be of interest to folks here.

The discussion is nominally about whether the URI identifying a service that 
may be available via muliple protocols should convey/reflect this and how it 
might do so.

The bxxpwg@invisible.net is here..

  http://lists.invisible.net/pipermail/bxxpwg/

..and the message that instigated the thread is here..

roy - thanks.

in most of the recent cases that i have seen, the only thing that differs is
how the data gets moved, e.g., going from soap/http to soap/beep, or
ice/http to ice/beep, etc. in both cases, you have a situation where the
path is going to be the same, and i have difficulty understanding whether
the "use beep" bit should be present in the scheme component or the
authority component. for example,

    http://example.com/

may very well be a valid thing for someone doing soap over http. so, what
should we be using for the soap over beep case? here are four possibilities,
i'm sure there are more...

    beep://example.com/

    soap.beep://example.com/

    soap://example.com/?proto=beep

    beep://example.com?profile=http://iana.org/beep/soap

ideally, i would prefer to avoid having to use a new scheme everytime
someone moves yet another service on top of beep.

thanks,

/mtr

0. well, i agree that using "web:" instead of "http:" would certainly make
things a lot more clear, but that's water under the bridge.


1. let me understand your reaction to

i don't think that the http/tcp to http/sctp analogy is a good one. what i'm
trying to understand is whether it is a good thing to define two schemes for
soap.beep.tcp and ice.beep.tcp or to just have one scheme for beep over tcp.
for all three schemes, the authority part remains the same.

in guess i see your point that

> >     beep://example.com?profile=http://iana.org/beep/soap

is pretty week.


2. anyway, in comparing:

    soap://example.com:beep.tcp.21212/path
    soap.beep.tcp://example.com:21212/path

i guess i prefer the latter since when we move from "beep.tcp.21212" to
"beep.ipv6.21212" the thing to the left is going to be funky. what isn't
clear to me is whether the iana is going to be happy when i start
registering url schemes in groups of three, e.g.,

    ice:
    ice.beep:
    ice.beep.tcp:
