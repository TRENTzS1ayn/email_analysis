Thanks for bringing it up here; this is an issue folks
have been noodling on for years:

  [[[
  Short UDIs

  UDIs should be kept short and devoid of information that
  indicates the mechanism by which the document is retrieved.
  (in the theoretically clean implementation, the protocol
  information should not be present).
  ]]]

But folks have mostly avoided the practical side of
this issue by layering everything on top of http;
a noteable exception is https:, where I wish
we would have avoided putting the "secure" flag
in the name.


I hope to find time to study the practical details
of the design you're discussing. But for now,
I hope the historical pointers are useful/interesting...
