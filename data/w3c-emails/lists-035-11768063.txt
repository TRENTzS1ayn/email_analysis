Since it's somewhat pertinent;

One group of issues (11 and 13) for XMLP is what port to run on, and 
possibly how to identify the use of SOAP in URIs. Although SOAP messages 
currently use unadorned schemes (e.g., http), there is some pressure to 
use a separate default port and identify the use of XML messaging with a 
different scheme.

To that end, one of the suggested approaches is:

   soap.http://www.example.com/service
   soap.beep://www.example.com/service

or perhaps a syntax like
   soap:http://www.example.com/service

It would be nice to have reccommendations as to:

a) whether or not it's a Good Idea to make the use of XML Messaging 
visible in URIs

b) if it is necessary to have a different URI scheme for XML Messaging, 
due to a different default port, how that should be formatted.

(I'm not speaking for the group here, just giving a heads-up).

Cheers,
