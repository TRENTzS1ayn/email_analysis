I was referring to naming authorities in the sense of RFC 2396.  I don't
find that other distinction useful -- all bindings are names, all names are
bindings, and only the manager of a namespace can be authoritative about
whether the binding of name --> resource --> representation is valid.

I was only referring to the contact protocol stack, just as "http" URLs
imply that the port number (defaulting to 80) is TCP even though HTTP can
be transmitted over many different transport protocols.  An example would be

    http://example.com:scp.tcp.8000/foo
    http://example.com:sctp.80/foo

which modifies the authority syntax to indicate other transports than TCP.
In general, though, I feel that is less readable than new scheme names.
