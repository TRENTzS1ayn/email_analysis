There are some minor edits, but more to the point, there was
a lengthy comment from Leslie Daigle  (I think it is W3C Member-only
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-uri-ig/2001Mar/0040.html
right now, unfortunately).

I don't think there's any chance that IRIs will "obsolete" URIs
in any meaningful sense, even if the IRI draft were to be approved
(which it has not been).
