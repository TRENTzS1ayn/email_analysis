This /w3c/p3p.xml well-known location looks like
a bad idea.

This and the .favico and /robots.txt thingies are bad: they shift
the choice of what name to choose for some resource
from the publisher to the technology designer.

By way of suggested alternative, I propose to delete
the /w3c/p3p.xml stuff altogether; the
P3P extension header is sufficient. 

[[[
2.2.1 Well-Known Location 

        Web sites using P3P SHOULD place a policy reference file in a
"well-known"
        location. To do this, a policy reference file would be placed in
the site's /w3c
        directory, under the name p3p.xml. Thus a user agent could
request this
        policy reference file by using a GET request for the resource
/w3c/p3p.xml.
