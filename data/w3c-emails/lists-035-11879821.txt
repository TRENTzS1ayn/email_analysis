Dan,

While I don't disagree with you on a theoretical level; practically,
this is necessary. It must be possible for a User-Agent to discover
policy for a resource without requesting that resource. 

Additionally:

*  HTTP headers are difficult to configure on many servers, and/or
   publishers don't have access to a means of controlling them

*  sending an HTTP header on every response is a (to some people)
   signficant and needless overhead to serving traffic (particularly
   if they serve a lot)

*  HTTP is but one protocol on the Web; its use is not required. URIs,
   however, are common to everything on the Web. Using a URI to
   associate policy seems more sensible in this aspect.

Cheers,

(speaking for myself)
