     - An Index of WWW Addressing Schemes (in Notation3)

That'll be 1000 brownie-points please :-) With CWM it should be
possible to do things such as generate a list of all the URI schemes
sans comments [1], and so on... and of course convert it into XML RDF
(I've tested this and it works).

Feel free to link to it / copy it / modify it / bin it / ignore it /
any of the above.

[1] Using a filter like:-

     <> log:forAll <#x> , <#y> .
     { <#x> a :URIScheme; :schemeName <#y> .}
     log:implies
     { :WWW :listOfURISchemes <#y> . }

I tried it on CWM, and it worked.
