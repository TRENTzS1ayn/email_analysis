Wow! that was quick...

> That'll be 1000 brownie-points please :-)

Well... 500 so far; your transcription loses a bunch
of info; e.g. the links to all the background documents!
The 1000 point offer was for something that I could
generate schemes.html from using cwm and XSLT.

I'd like you to take my jumble of metadata about schemes and
documents and to separated it into

* descriptions of documents

* descriptions of schemes

* links between schemes and documents.

e.g.

<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1959.txt>
  dc:title "An LDAP URL Format";
  :rfc "1959";
  :content-length "7243";
  dc:creator [ foaf:name "T. Howes"], [ foaf:name "M. Smith" ];
  dc:date "June 1996";
  :specifies
    [ :schemeName "ldap" ].


where
 
 :rfc rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:identifer.
 :specifies rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:subject.

and rather than saying "a :URIScheme" each time, just say

  :schemeName rdfs:domain :URIScheme.

oh... btw...

  :schemeName a daml:UnambiguousProperty.

and

  :schemeName rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>

(hmm... is isDefinedBy appropriate when that spec
doesn't actually specify RDF properties per se?
or is it just seeAlso?)

By the way... your N3 transcription claims that I'm
its author, which is not so; I think what you meant was
that I wrote X, you wrote Y, and Y is a transcription
of X:

=======
<> is :xhtml2n3 of <http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes>;
dc:contributor
     [ foaf:name "Sean B. Palmer"; 
       foaf:mbox <mailto:sean@mysterylights.com> ] .

<http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes>
  dc:creator
     [ foaf:name "Dan Connolly"; 
       foaf:mbox <mailto:connolly@w3.org> ];
  dc:date "1996/01/02 03:37:23".

:xhtml2n3 rdfs:comment "Converted from XHTML to Notation3";
 rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:relation.
========

Also... foaf:name is a handy concept; surely there's
a standardized version of it somehwere, no?
Isn't there a p3p property
you could use? grumble... P3P isn't mentioned in
http://www.w3.org/RDF/#projects

aha... here it is... 10 Aug 2000
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Aug/0043.html
so...

@prefix p3p: <http://www.w3.org/2000/07/p3pmodel/p3prdfschema#>

 [ p3p:name [ p3p:nickname "Dan"; p3p:family "Connolly" ];
   p3p:email <mailto:connolly@w3.org>;
   p3p:uri <http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/>.
 ].

ugh... maybe it's better to just define foaf:name in
terms of p3p:name:


 { { :who foaf:name :n } log:implies
   { :who p3p:name [ p3p:formatted :n ] } } log:forAll :who, :n.


Hmmm... to call me the author when the thing is a list
of pointers seems generous; what's the guy who
builds a bibliography usually called? editor?
