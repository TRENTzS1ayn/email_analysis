The URI syntax RFC is [a feasible entry point for elaborating] the
authoritative source for what a URI scheme name is.  Or the URL [scheme]
registration RFC.  Whatever index we construct in RDF, it doesn't _define_ the
concept "URI scheme name."  It uses and depends on the externally published
concept.  I would have thought in traditional usage that "see also" would
often
be used for informative references which don't have to be followed to build a
fully formed definition.

This reference is a "q.v." normative reference.

Is there already in RDF usage a generally accepted synonym for "q.v."?

The English phrase I have found comfortable as reflecting the relationship we
need to catch (for schema references etc.) is "as used in."  This is a
normative reference to another utterance which is senior in authority to the
current utterance making the reference, as far as the usage of the subject
term
[or more generally pattern] is concerned.

Please see/use the dc:source subPropertyOf dc:relation for what you want to
say, here.

Compare with the metadata for the digital talking book standard, where they
have the same issues about documenting a derived work, see

 <http://<http://www.niso.org/Z3986.html>www.niso.org/Z3986.html>.

Sometimes it doesn't pay to put too fine a point on it.  dc:creator covers
both.  Use it. 

It is far more useful to associate your relationship to this document with
dc:creator than to distinguish it from 'author.'

And, for names of people, shadow X.500 schema or, if you find another standard
you consider better for this purpose I would be interested to hear about it. 
Where I say 'shadow,' in particular I mean make it clear that you respect the
seniority of the ISO documents and that the RDF gloss is a derived work.

If we could come up with an _authorized_ recapitulation of ISO/IEC 11179 in
RDF
we would then have a fit standard foundation for formally writing such
transcriptions (e.g. X.500 person in RDF).
