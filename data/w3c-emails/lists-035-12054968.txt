Hmm, an interesting idea. Well, considering that the syntax of an address is
specified (or not) by the country, perhaps it should be better written as:

address://us/...

where the authority section is the ISO (or whatever) two-letter country
code. 

> address:US/MA%2002139/Cambridge/545%20Tech%20Square/W3C/

An even more abbreviated from (since zip codes are unambiguous within the
US) would be:

address://us/02139/545%20Tech%20Square/W3C/

(seeAlso: http://www.usps.gov/ncsc/lookups/lookup_ctystzip.html)

And I don't like address too much, to much URI is a name/address confusion.
How about something like location: or place:? And you should probably throw
in a lat/long authority for good measure. Oh, and to be really extensible
you should add provisions for other planets.

"address: are assumed to be on planet Earth except when specified
otherwise."

;-) 

Do other planets get to use the triple slash?
