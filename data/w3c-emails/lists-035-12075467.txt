I strongly disagree. This will get you into nasty postal address conflicts.
For example, let's say I live in Russia and own a company called
Understanding Systems. My URI would be:

address:ru/00000/xxx/us

which would be indistinguishable from the American who runs Real
Universality:

address:ru/00000/xxx/us

It's just a bad idea in general. And you toss out the authority idea. URIs
are usually hierarchical -- I see no reason to break with that practice and
threaten the understanding/parsing of the entire scheme. This way, display
systems (like the one you demonstrated) can output going forward and
backwards depending on the conventions of the country they are used in. Of
course, we will still allow each country to define what goes after their
country code.
