Oh dear! Well, in that case it would probably be a good idea to make
the first "section" of the URI (the piece of data preceeding the first
occurance of a slash) the internationally recognized country code,
following ISO standard 639 [1]  for standard two bit country codes.
However, in practise these are usually quite distinct from postal
addresses... i.e. country codes aren't meant to be all that readable
as they can only consist of two characters. Therefore, it might be
useful to have a human readable form after the country code itself:-

address:ru/Russia/00000/xxx/us

Hmm... I need to make something that will convert postal addresses to
"address:" URIs really don't I? I'd already made one, but I need to
tweak it now :-)
