This problem is more general than simply country codes/names.  Might I
suggest something like:

  address:///ru:Russia/00000/xxx/us:USA

...where each section has both a `canonical' and a `presentation'
form?  You may wish to use something other than a colon, but I don't
follow uri close enough anymore to know what else might be a good
suggestion.

Oh, and *definately* change the name of the scheme from `address'.
Offhand, `geo' sounds reasonable.
