Hmm, that's interesting: I'll have to search around a bit for that.
Still, I'll bet it's only for postal addresses within the US? It would
be very useful to have a non-ambiguous postal addressing system so
that each person would have a "standard" URI for themselves... but
international systems don't seem to be as well defined as "CASS", and
the postal service is always going to allow some leeway in the
addressing system.

I need to do some more research on standards for postal addresses
really... I hadn't thought about it much until this scheme name hit me
(whilst I was converting the XHTML schemes version into N3). And
that's "hit me" in the metaphorical sense, before Aaron says something
:-)
