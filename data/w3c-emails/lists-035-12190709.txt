Thanks; good catch.

You make a good case for this. In reflection, at least
"postal-address" is non-ambiguous, and carries a meaning that wouldn't
be confused with other URI schemes. Hmm... what was my initial
objection to it?

     "postal-address:" is a bit long

That does make it one of the larger schemes... but the main problem is
that the "-" rules out IETF-ization, as per RFC 2717:-

     The NAMES of schemes registered in the IETF tree MUST
     NOT contain the dash (also known as the hyphen and minus
     sign) character ('-') USASCII value 2Dh.
     - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2717.txt

Which would currently be my main objection, although this need not be
an IETF standardized scheme.

Agreed. "Standardization/deployment" (and hence *agreement*) are the
most important qualities for establishing any new URI scheme, and in
fact many new technologies.

Clearly some liaison with the UPU is required at this point. There
doesn't seem to be a publicly addressable forum for such matters...
perhaps I shall I have to contact them direct. Ah, this might come
under their EDI project:-
