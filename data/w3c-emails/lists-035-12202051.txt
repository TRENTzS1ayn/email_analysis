Why not just "postal:"?

In this part of the world "address" is a synonym of URI, as in "ftp 
address", "email address", "web address". Thus the "address" part of 
"postal-address" is redundant, since it is implicitly already there 
(You might as well use "postal-URI:"). 


Also, postal codes ("zip" in US English) are not widely used on private 
letters here, and many people (like me) wouldn't know the codes for 
themselves or their addressees. So don't go requiring them.
