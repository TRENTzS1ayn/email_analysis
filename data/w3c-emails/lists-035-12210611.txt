Hear, hear!  The same argument I was about to make.

What is the goal of having this URI?  When will it get used?  Do we expect
to put a postal URI on an envelope and drop it into a mailbox?  Will we have
anchor tags on our web pages like <a href="postal://us/27514/103 W. Franklin
St./Nate"> that when someone clicks on, their computer will print out a
label in the format for their country that they can slap on an envelope and
mail me a check?  Maybe an online service that will send a postcard to the
specified person?
