Consider that there might be paper mail sent off the earth at some
point, either to the Space Station, or to future settlements on the moon
or Mars. It may sound nutty right now, but any addressing scheme should
allow for sending to entities that are not "countries", and that are not
geographically fixed.

And the format should be kept very compact, since databases may use this
format for storing addresses of hundreds of millions of recipients at a
time.
