Of course -- that is the definition of "identifier".

No, you are missing the point.  The terms abstract and conceptual are every
bit as formal as any mathematical definition you might invent, and far more
likely to serve the intended purpose.

What is a URI?  It is an identifier for all those things an author might
wish to identify as the target of a relationship.  It is from that goal that
we obtained the current definition of URI and its use within HTTP and
various data formats.  Inventing mathematical definitions that are
more restrictive than the one found in my dissertation will serve only
to define something more restrictive than what we intended to implement,
and thus not useful as a substitute in any further formalisms.

In other words, live with the ambiguity and learn its advantages.
