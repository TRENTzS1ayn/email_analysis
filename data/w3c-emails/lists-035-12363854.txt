It wasn't the one that was being used.

That's not so, by the definition of 'formal'. I'm not aiming for pure 
formality. I'm after just enough so that I can put my point of view across 
without others wondering what I mean.

Since we seem to be foundering in ambiguity, it does not suit my purpose: a 
widespread facility for resolving identifiers into web resources.

If you'd said "It is an identifier for all those resources authors might 
wish to assert as the targets of relationships with the identified entity" 
then I would agree with you. Those relationships are what I've written as 
the resolve-i functions.
