I'm a bit wary of this argument. We've heard this before in the guise that
"humans will never use X identifier, so it doesn't matter what it looks
like." It was said about email addresses. It was said about URLs. Humans are
making and distributing email addresses and URLs -- tags will be no
different, so we should prepare for this. Even if software produces tags,
there will be humans writing the software, and the authors may not read the
spec too carefully and may be confused. I've seen this happen time and
again, despite the best intentions of the standard-makers involved.

Sure, I like them too. But I don't like the message they give off. I, and I
bet others, on first seeing tags thought:

    ;1 -- hmm, an incrementing number? that's a dumb idea


I mean really, 2001-01-01 isn't that much longer. It would be even better if
you allowed just 2001 (as in tann).

Phonetically, I say "semi" as in "blargh dot com semi two zero zero one".

I agree, there should be one standardized format. And I must admit, that I
don't know much about bardcoding. However, it seems that it will require
special code and I think this code can deal with tags properly. (prepend
"tag:", etc.)

Well, now that you've tempted us... ;-) But seriously, I think that
providing these abbreviation forms will be _more_ confusing. The other way,
we can just say that you can't do it altogether. Now, we have to provide
some complicated rules -- which I doubt will be properly followed. I
personally like the tann: idea of time markers slowly becoming less precise.

I'd have to agree -- these sections bothered me, and anything that makes the
spec simpler sounds good to me.

OK, after reading the spec more closely, one more thing pops to mind:

   Future
   standards efforts may allow use of such names following syntax that is
   disjoint from this syntax. To allow for such developments, software that
   processes tags MUST NOT reject tags on the grounds that they are outside
   the syntax defined above.

This sounds like a recipe for extensibility disaster. How about building
forward compatibility into the spec, by prefixing the authority component:

    tag:dns:aaronsw.com;2001-0-04/blah
    tag:email:me@aaronsw.com;2001-0-04/blah

I suppose a semicolon could be used for those also:

    tag:email;me@aaronsw.com;2001-0-04/blah

Then write into the spec that the type (email/dns) component can change,
rather than messing with the whole syntax.
