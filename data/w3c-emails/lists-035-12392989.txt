Really? I sure hope not. I (and I'd bet others) count on the URL:

http://www.google.com/search?q=uri

to represent the resource "documents about the string 'uri'". I'd be quite
surprised if Google ever changed the resource that this URL was bound to.
Yahoo! is the same way.

Perhaps I am using the URL to find more resources, but that does not mean
that the URL does not identify a resource in itself.

Err, I certainly hope not. The search engine has persistently bound that URL
to the resource for my search results. Sure, the search results change
continually, but this does not mean that the binding does. You seem to have
fallen to the resource/binding/entity confusion again.

A URI is bound to a resource (hopefully for all time). The resource
identifies a conceptual mapping to an entity (a set of bits, a thing
(person, book, etc.), etc.).
