Nope. URIs and URNs never define any concepts or operations that have
to do with the Resource other than the act of binding a URI/URN to one (which
is how a Resource comes into existence). The statement "changing
the Resource" has no meaning outside of some specific application that defines
what "change" means for that application space. Low level caching might
consider 'change' to be moving it from one IP address to another while
DAV might define it as a versioning event that doesn't care what IP
address it is currently at.
