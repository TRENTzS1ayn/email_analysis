Ahh... probably a bad choice of words. What I meant to say is that someone
hadn't changed the binding to some other Resource. The http URI scheme
never says that reassignment is not allowed. Thus when things like
domain-names change or filesystems move, the binding is being intentionally 
changed to a new Resource. When I used the word meaning what I was
getting at was "the original binding". By disallowing reassignment, URNs
allow you to assume that the binding is never other than the original.
