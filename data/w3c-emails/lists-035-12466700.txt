Careful... it does not imply that URI references are
bound to resources; but nor does it imply that they are *not*
bound to resources. RFC2396 is silent on what
a URI reference is bound to.

I don't think so; I think you're reading more into RFC2396
than is there. (you're certainly not the first, and
I don't expect you'll be the last.)

RDF isn't the only spec that extends the domain
of the URI->resource mapping; XLink does too--
er... it did in earlier drafts... I pointed
that out in a review comment... during last call,
I think; they seem to have changed their mind since then...

[[[
The notion of resources is universal to the World Wide Web. [Definition:
As
discussed in [IETF RFC 2396], a resource is any addressable unit of
information or service.] Examples include files, images, documents,
programs, and query results. The means used for addressing a resource is
a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) reference (described more in 5.4
Locator Attribute (href)). It is possible to address a portion of a
resource.

Keep in mind that RDF 1.0 was finished Feb 1999,
just a few months after RFC2396 in Aug 1998. It would
seem perfectly reasonable to do an editorial revision
of RDF to make a new term for what RDF 1.0 calls 'resource',
and use 'resource' to mean just what RFC2396 defines
it to mean.

TimBL went that way in some code he wrote recently;
he uses 'Thing' for the class of things that includes
resources *and* things denoted by absolute-uris-with-fragments:

########################################  Storage URI Handling
#
#  In general an RDf resource - here a Thing, has a uriRef rather
# than just a URI.  It has subclasses of Resource and Fragment.
# (libwww equivalent HTParentAnchor and HTChildAnchor IIRC)

Hmm... my index of terms could use updating...
  http://www.w3.org/Architecture/Terms#resource
  http://www.w3.org/Architecture/Terms#anchor-address

I should make that a Semantic Web thingy, ala the
index of URI schemes.
