Eh?  It is a resource identifier. It identifies resources.

No, that is correct.  At no time whatsoever is the resource transferred
across the network when doing a GET.  Only a REPRESENTATION of that resource
is transferred, and the fragment refers to a target within the representation
and not within the resource.  That is why fragments are media-type specific.

That definition is wrong.  So are the definitions used by RDF.  That's
why they keep having semantic problems with the Web.

Dude, I finished the definition of resource a long time before RFC 2396
was published -- it was in the November 1997 draft.  And even that was
just a rewording of the "HTTP object model" (now called the REST architectural
style) that I was working on back in 1995 during our whiteboard discussions
at the W3C.

Just shoot me.  Its my fault for not sending you guys a copy of my
dissertation when I was writing it.  I didn't realize that we had diverged
so far from a common model.
