The question is about the term "URI reference". You're saying
that a URI reference identifies a resource? That's perhaps
consistent with the RFC, but I don't see it stated in
the RFC.

Leaving aside the fact that a relative URI reference needs
a bit of context (a base URI) to identify a resource,
I'm fine with this view of things; in fact, I think it's
the view used in the RDF spec; but you seem to think
otherwise; I'm confused...

The interpretation he's asking about says that
  http://example.org/q#foo
    and
  http://example.org/q#bar
identify the same resource. Are you sure that's correct?
i.e. can you justify that from the text of RFC2396?
As far as I can tell, RFC2396 doesn't say what resource
either of them identifies; it only tells you that
yes, they identify the same resource after you remove
the #fragid. Duh.

Quite; who/what suggested it was?

Yes, but again, I don't see how that's directly relevant;
the question is what
  http://example.org/q#foo
is bound to; and in particular, whether it's reasonable
to say that it's bound to a resource.

Really? how so? It just says "the term resource in this
spec is imported from RFC2396". How could it be wrong?

Really? How so? which text in the RDF spec conflicts
with which text in RFC2396?

Who is "they"? What problems?

You finished *your* definition of 'resource' a long time ago.
Getting that to be *the* definition took quite a while longer...
i.e. getting folks to read it, understand it, agree to it,
etc.

I agree; I don't think anything has changed in substance for
about 10 years.

Chill, Roy. Show me the text on which you're basing this
conclusion. I think you're being hasty. I don't see
divergence; I see two views:

I. The conservative view:

There's a mapping
Absolute URI -> Resource
Since http://example.org/q#foo isn't an absolute
URI, RFC2396 doesn't say what it identifies; folks
should use some other term for what it identifies.
(This is the view used in TimBL's recent hack
with the Thing class, probably because folks were
uncomfortable with ...)

II. The original/liberal view

There's a mapping
Absolute URI, with optional fragment identifier -> Resource
RFC2396 only explicitly talks about the part of that
mapping where the domain is an Absolute URI with no fragment
identifier, but RFC1630, among other specs, talks
about the whole mapping.
