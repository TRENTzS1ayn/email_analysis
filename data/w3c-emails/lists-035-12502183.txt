Sorry if my response sounded heated.  I am a little put off by all of the 
times I've had RDF folks say that the definition of resource isn't sufficient
for semantic description, when they haven't even defined resource correctly
in the RDF spec.  It certainly doesn't help when others from XML land want
to define a new URI scheme that has all of the properties of any good URI,
except for an arbitrarily different syntax because they don't want
"something" to mistake it for being a URL.  There comes a point when I have
to conclude that the W3C no longer understands the Web architecture.

Ooops, missed that.  RFC 2396 treats those as two separate identifiers
within the same syntactical protocol element.  I could have sworn that was
in the spec.

The RDF spec refers to the representation as the resource -- in other words,
that the fragment itself is a resource.

The resource identifier is before the fragment.  The fragment identifies
a subset of the representation retrieved after a GET of the resource.
It isn't possible to "access" the fragment on its own, and hence it is
not itself a resource until someone provides another URI that that
has the semantics of mapping to that representation as a resource
(i.e., an indirect reference).

That's what the definition you quoted said when it referred to the fragment
as a resource.

Now you lost me.  What does "bound" mean?  I would say that the namespace
is bound according to the authority example.org.  Since example.org is never
given the opportunity to interpret #foo, that part of the URI reference
isn't within example.org's authority, and hence it is not a resource.

"It is possible to address a portion of a resource."  That is wrong.
It is possible to reference a portion of a representation.  Besides that,
why does it use the term "addressable" in the first place?  Addressable
implies locator which defines URLs, not URI.  If it is going to refer to
the RFC 2396 definition, then it should use the RFC 2396 definition.

This text:

 Resources
    All things being described by RDF expressions are called resources.
    A resource may be an entire Web page; such as the HTML document
    "http://www.w3.org/Overview.html" for example. A resource may be a part
    of a Web page; e.g. a specific HTML or XML element within the document
    source. A resource may also be a whole collection of pages; e.g. an
    entire Web site. A resource may also be an object that is not directly
    accessible via the Web; e.g. a printed book. Resources are always named
    by URIs plus optional anchor ids (see [URI]). Anything can have a URI;
    the extensibility of URIs allows the introduction of identifiers for
    any entity imaginable.

and it later proceeds to be clueless about the semantic differences between
resources (mappings/bindings/names) and representations (the stuff you
might get as a response when accessing the resource).

The folks on this list who have several times requested that "resource"
be redefined to be some subset of the Web's resources in order to solve
some logic problem in RDF.  You'll have to search the archives for the
specifics.

Not my problem -- it was on a public forum, representing the future of the
most important aspect of the Web architecture, and the fact that some folks
at the W3C didn't bother to keep apprised of the definition while they
were supposedly defining the uber-meta-model for describing resources
isn't something you should be defending.  W3C marketing claims it is
on top of this stuff.

Not in URI land, hopefully.  It doesn't mean that the old specifications
were right.  Tim's design documents still refer to resources as documents.
That was true prior to 1993, but not after 1993.  My goal was to update
the semantics so that they reflected what was actually working on the Web,
without losing the fundamental principles that Tim described to me at W3C.

No worries, I wasn't upset with you -- just me.

Yeah, but I worked out a definition of that "thing" during the HTTP/1.1
stuff.  I call it a representation.  Jeff Mogul didn't like that and insisted
on calling it an "instance".  That's why neither is defined in the spec.
Representation is, however, defined in my dissertation.

Right, and we abandoned it in 1995 because that definition caused
all sorts of ambiguities in the specs.  For example, how is access
control assigned to "things" on the Web.  By the resource.  Is it possible
to define separate access control to different fragments of the same
resource?  No.  Therefore, a fragment is not a resource until it is
bound as some other URI by a naming authority that can control access
to the fragments as separate, identifiable resources.  Because if we
decided the other way -- that a fragment was a resource too -- then we'd
have to define a new term for that subset of "old-style resources" that
were actually subject to the Web behavioral model.

The same logic applies to many other aspects of the Web design beyond
access control.  That's why I separated the definition of resource
and representation, and hence why REST is an acronym for representational
state transfer.  I needed to do that for HTTP/1.1 because the old model
just didn't fit things like CGI, Apache modules, and URN indirection.
