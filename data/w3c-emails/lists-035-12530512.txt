While Roy provides a very good logical argument why the Web architecture
would be seriously messed up if we allowed fragments to be resources, to be
clear, the spec itself says:

<q cite="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">
   The term "URI-reference" is used here to denote the common usage of a
   resource identifier.  A URI reference may be absolute or relative,
   and may have additional information attached in the form of a
   fragment identifier.  However, "the URI" that results from such a
   reference includes only the absolute URI after the fragment
   identifier (if any) is removed and after any relative URI is resolved
   to its absolute form.  Although it is possible to limit the
   discussion of URI syntax and semantics to that of the absolute
   result, most usage of URI is within general URI references, and it is
   impossible to obtain the URI from such a reference without also
   parsing the fragment and resolving the relative form.
</q>

While it's true that it isn't very clear on exactly what a URI-ref
identifies, it strongly implies that it isn't bound to its own resource.
