Sure; but now let's take the two separate identifiers and look
at them as one. For example, In HTML 2.0, it was called an
"anchor address" and it was said to refer to an "anchor":

[[[
A hyperlink is a relationship between two anchors, called the head and
the
tail of the hyperlink[DEXTER]. Anchors are identified by an anchor
address:
an absolute Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), optionally followed by a
'#' and
a sequence of characters called a fragment identifier. For example: 

]]]

The editors of the RDF spec chose to use the term 'resource'
for not only those things that RFC2395 calls 'resource', but
for the whole set of things that the HTML 2 spec
calls 'anchor'. That's not wrong; it's just different.

No, when the RDF spec says that
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label 
identifies a resource, it's not talking about some particular fragment
of a particular representation of the (state of the)
resource identified by http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema ,
any more than http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema identifies
just one piece of content. http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label
identifies something that you can learn about using HTTP;
you can learn that it's a relationship between something
and a (string) label for that something.

No, *a* resource identifier is before the fragment.

If you extend the definition of the term resource (in a consistent way),
another resource identifier is the whole thing: http://example.org/q#foo
.

That's one way to learn something about that identifier; there
are other ways, too; you can get statements about it from
other documents, etc.

Well, that's a limited view of the term resource. But it can
be extended (again, in a consistent fashion) to include more
things, like properties, classes, numbers, people, noses,
pink elephants, and so on.

Er... that's like saying "42 isn't a number until somebody
writes down 6 and 7 and multiplies them." 42 always was
a number. http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label always
was a resource (in the RDF sense).

[there are some limits to what is a resource... e.g.
things like the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves;
The RDF/RDFS specs do lack answers to some questions in
that neightborhood, but I think folks will agree that's
a separate issue.]

Read it again; it doesn't say that. The XLink folks didn't go there.

For "X is bound to Y" read: "X identifies Y".
(in other words: "X denotes Y")

Interpret? huh? Surely they're given the opportunity to say
what http://example.org/q#foo means by putting a document
at http://example.org/q , no?

Er...  the question that started this thread
is asked in the context of not only
RFC2396, where 'resource' is only used to mean things
identified by absolute URIs, but *also* in the context of
the RDF 1.0 spec, where 'resource' is also used to mean things
identified by absolute-URIs-with-fragment-identifiers.

So it's not very interesting to answer "... hence it is
not a resource in the RFC2396 sense of the word."

No, it's not wrong; it's just different.

Just as it makes
sense to say (as RFC2396 does) that an absolute
URI identifies a resource that you don't directly observe... you
only indirectly observe its state by bouncing messages off it;
in the same way, it makes sense to say (RDF 1.0 does) that an
absolute-URI-with-fragment-identifier identifies
a resource that you don't directly observe... you only indirectly
observe it by looking at statements that mention it.

Note that HTML 2.0 also talked about addressing portions
of resources.

I chalk that up to editorial discretion; I don't infer any
distinction between "addressing a resource" and "identifying
a resource". It seems to be a pay-me-now (convince
the XLink folks that they should say "identify") or
pay-me-later (convince other folks that "address" means
the same thing, when talking about web resources, as "identify)
sort of thing.

I can't argue with that.

I don't think so; it's conventional, though somewhat anachronistic,
to speak of "the HTML document http://www.w3.org/Overview.html"
even though that URI actually identifies a resource that has different
representations over time, and even though it's not the
name (URI) that tells you it's HTML, but all the responses
you get back that say Content-Type: text/html.

Perhaps it's time to do away with such anachronisms. But using
old-speak is not necessarily symptomatic of cluelessness.

[by the way... what happened to 'entity' and 'entity body'?
Representation is pretty much synonymous with those, no?]

Well, I prefer to just trust you that some folks have made
such requests, and join you in dismissing them out of hand.

The RDF spec extends the definition of 'resource' from RFC2396,
but it does so in a compatible way. There's no reason
to change RFC2396. (There may be a reason to change the RDF
spec, but it's an editorial matter; technically, the definitions
work just fine.)

Well, you can stick your head in the sand about the difference
between words on paper and understanding in the community,
but I'd rather you didn't.
I didn't think I was defending anything. I was just observing
that dissemination of technical information in the community
takes time. Some folks at the W3C *did* keep apprised. But
to expect everybody in every W3C working group to read
every draft is either arrogant or silly. Waiting until
something is an RFC is an entirely reasonable position
for most of the community to take.

It didn't become false to say that http://www.w3.org/
is a document, if you take 'document' in the smalltalk/objective-C
sense, where it means something that has
mutable state and knows how to 'paint' itself in multiple formats;
that usage still makes sense; it's just not endorsed as an IETF
draft standard.

I don't think the semantics changed along the way; we just
changed "Universal Document Identifier" to "Uniform Resource Identifer"
without making any technical changes. The libwww code from 1990
or so still runs just fine.

Nope. See above starting with "but now let's take the
two separate identifiers and look at them as one."

No, not ambiguities... folks were uncomfortable with
the level of extensibility, so they took the general
model and introduced arbitrary limitations based
on which parts had been implemented. Somewhat
like denying that there are arbitrarily large
integers because we'd only seen 32bit registers
to date. Sigh.

Well, one could also say it's by the message; after all,
a GET access policy is likely to be very different from a PUT access
policy in most cases; and it's not uncommon to change
the access policy of a resource over time.

Neither view is in any ratified spec, as far as I know;
i.e. the ratified definition of 'resource' doesn't include
any notion of access control (did I miss something?)

[not to disagree, but
I presume you mean "is it practical to implement/deploy...?"
I can trivially define it: all accesses are granted.]

That's one view. The RDF spec takes another view. Note that
the view taken by TimBL's cwm.py code is this "a fragment
is not a resource" view; he's taken the view that
it's too confusing to have two different definitions
of 'resource' around, and that the RDF specs (or at least: his
RDF code) should use 'Thing' for the general case
of something that's either an RFC2396-resource or
something-identified-by-an-absolute-URI-with-fragment-identifier.

I agree that there's a distinction between RFC2396-resource
and MIME-entity-body. But there's also another distinction:
between Things and Resources.
