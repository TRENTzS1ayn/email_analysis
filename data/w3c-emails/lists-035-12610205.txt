This came up at RDF-IG in the plenary meeting...  I asked if RDF resources 
can be regarded as identical to Web resources.  The answer then (from Tim, 
IIRC) was no, RDF-resources denote a wider set of resources than just 
Web-resources, for the reasons you raise.

(This view seems to be reinforced by the other exchanges on this topic.)

I think this is also on the RDF issues list... it's alluded to in:
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-fragments
(see comment in relationship to terminologicus.)
