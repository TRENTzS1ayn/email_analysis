I've seen this occur to many times. It seems that the term 'resource'
is to popular for its own good. My current suggestion for people
who are struggling with this is to define their own term that
is 110% application dependent and then be extremely specfic about
how you can use a URI as a value for that term.

Defining your application to use URIs simply as 2396 specified sans
anything else is to simple. It would be kind of like saying
that LDAP uses OIDs but never specifying how it used them or why.
