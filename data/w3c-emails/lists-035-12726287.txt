Subject: Last Call: URIs,URLs, and URNs: Clarifications and
Recommendations Report from the joint W3C/IETF URI PLanning Interest
Group to Informational



The IESG has received a request to consider URIs,URLs, and URNs:
Clarifications and Recommendations Report from the joint W3C/IETF URI
PLanning Interest Group <draft-mealling-uri-ig-01.txt> as an
Informational RFC.  This has been reviewed in the IETF but is not the
product of an IETF Working Group.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by December 6, 2001.
