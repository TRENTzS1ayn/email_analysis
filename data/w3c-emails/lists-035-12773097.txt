This is my assertion.

Well, it'll take awhile to turn the boat around, but I think
it's worth trying...

I'm about to submit a number of I-D's to the IETF for several
URI schemes, including the following two, which address your
question:

Web Resource:

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#   
 = the web resource (if any ;-)

URI Reification:

uri:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#  
 = the reified URI of the web resource

e.g.

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="doi:10.92881929382">
      <dc:creator>Bob</dc:creator>
   </rdf:Description>
   <rdf:Description rdf:about="uri:doi:10.92881929382">
      <dc:creator>DOI's-R-Us</dc:creator>
   </rdf:Description>

in which case, Bob created the resource but the URI
itself was minted by the DOI agency DOI's-R-Us

--

Namespace Reification and Prefixation:

xmlns:rdf:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
 = the namespace, with associated namespace prefix

xmlns::http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
 = the namespace, with no namespace prefix

--

I intend to proactively support the URI registration process,
taking account of all comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc.
with the goal of seeing the above URI schemes registered
(along with some others ;-)

These two URI schemes belong to the class of URIs called
Uniform Resource Primitives (URP) as defined in section 1.1.2 of

http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/X_Values_URI.pdf

which is also being revised and expanded as an I-D.

Regards,

Patrick
