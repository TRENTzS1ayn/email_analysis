OK, go locate the abstract concept of "BRILLIANCE" for me ;-)

I think it is a fair interpretation of a technical
specification intended for implementation by computer
systems that

   is used == is intended to be used

No, it doesn't preclude other uses, but like I said,
I can cook weenies on my car engine, but I don't think
the manufacturer would consider that an intended use
of the vehicle ;-)
