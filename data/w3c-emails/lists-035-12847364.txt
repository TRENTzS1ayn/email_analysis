You can't be serious...

Well, for one, the realization that URI != HTTP URL.

Are you really going to tell me that because a *URI*  doesn't
have to resolve to something that a *HTTP URL* doesn't?

Pleeeeaaase.  ;-)

And I'll continue to cook weanies on my car engine, until
someone shows me where it's written that car engines are
*not* stoves.

You're in URL denial, Sean ;-)

As in they don't represent locations, only keys in a global
dictionary defined by the URN scheme.

I'm sure if I went digging, I'd find *lots* of references where
folks say that, but since it's so obvious (to me at least) I won't 
waste my time on that.

I completely disagree, and don't even know where
to begin in response to that. It's so "out there"...

Yup. Major URL denial...  ;-)
