If you'll take the time to read my mail again carefully, you'll find
that I was simply establishing a ground fact about URIs, that in
general they can denote anything which may be identified, and then
asking you to point out where - in any specification - it says once
and for all that HTTP URIs cannot identify "abstract concepts". Since
I have asked and you have not provided (indeed - your "weanie" point
notwithstanding - you cannot), I am not inclined to believe that HTTP
URIs cannot identify abstract concepts.

> You're in URL denial, Sean ;-)

If anyone is in denial here, it is surely you; whatever you say,
Patrick, you can't change the way things are, and when they work just
fine, I don't see why you would want to. Your arguments have always
come across as contentious to me.

People *are* using HTTP URLs to identify abstract concepts. People are
using URI references with absolute HTTP URIs as bases as such; the W3C
is using them as such, everyone in their right minds is using them.
Dublin Core uses URLs to identify concepts such as "creator" and
"identifier". HTTP URIs were designed to meet the utility of
identifying things on the Web and proving an authoritative route to
get a representation of that resource. It is staggering to me that
after years of people using URLs as namespaces (in XML), and URLs and
URI-views of all kinds in RDF, with many working implementations, that
you could deny that HTTP URIs are unfit for the task on practically
any ground other than DNS persistence, or ease of creation [1].

Your comparision is a little weak here, because car stoves clearly do
both their "intended" job, and the extra job of cooking decent food
(as long as you know what you're doing). So what if I drive my URIs
and cook food on them?

Er... who says that they don't? What makes them explicitly different
from HTTP URIs? URNs can quite easily resolve (by network) to a set of
resources; they may even map into HTTP space. Take the series of URNs
that identify the RFCs. You can set your program so that when you
enter:-

   urn:ietf:rfc:2396

You get the URI RFC back. Perhaps you'll do that via. HTTP. Perhaps
you won't. Perhaps you'll do it using a series of different protocols,
or whatever. How do you think HTTP URIs got established? In the same
way: by programming browsers to accept them, and to open up HTTP
connections. The only fundamental difference is that HTTP URIs have
the recipies for opening up the connections and getting the resource
back contained within the string - they have the server address, and
the name of the document in there. That's a useful utility, but all it
says is that "hey, you can try this if you want to get some
authoritative information back about this resource".

Oh come on Patrick, if you can't present a structured argument against
something that you consider to be so "out there", then why on Earth
are we even bothering to discuss it?

Cheers,

[1] And, of course, PURLs sort out that mess to a great extent.
