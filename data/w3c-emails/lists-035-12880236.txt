Sure: you define another property which is the inverse (in the DAML
sense) of the one above; say ":uriOf", such that:-

   "http://www.w3.org/" :uriOf <http://www.w3.org/> .

(actually, from a datatypes POV, that needs to be something different,
but I shall defer discussions about that). Then you can say:-

   [ :uriOf <http://www.w3.org/>; :creator "W3C" ] .

or whatever.

Perhaps, but I was just showing you a different way to do it. I like
your proposal, but it gets close to the datatypes discussion, and
that's not something that I really want to drag onto these mailing
lists :-)
