That's true, but it is also the case that the HTTP URI scheme, by
virtue of its use of the HTTP protocol, is an extremely generic
information space.

To get some idea about how generic HTTP is, an Internet Draft I'm
working on may be of value[1].  It defines a model of the type of
resources HTTP was designed to access & manipulate.  What's not in
the draft is the conclusion; that the model is sufficient to
represent all resources.  That is, after all, the objective of the
Web; a universal information space.
