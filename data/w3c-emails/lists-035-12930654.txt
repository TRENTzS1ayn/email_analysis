> Yes, URIs *may* denote abstract resources. No, HTTP URLs may *not*.

Patrick, as an author of both of those specifications, I can
definitively state that what you are saying does not match what I intended
when I wrote the sections to which you have referred.  That does not
necessarily mean that both working groups interpreted those same words
in the same way that I intended, but as far as I am concerned you are
speaking fantasy.

The URI spec is specifically modeled on the properties of HTTP URLs
and the properties of HTTP URLs are specifically designed to model all
possible URI space, because both are necessary in order for HTTP to be
usable for name resolution and gateways for all URI, including URN.
