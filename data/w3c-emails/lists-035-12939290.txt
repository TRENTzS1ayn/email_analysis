Roy,
thanks for this.  So, the intention of the sepcification was that http
URIs may be used to denote any resource (including an abstract resource)  
- i.e. anything that has identity?

I have to say, that as fairly naive reader, your wording doesn't obviously
align with your intention (for me!).  I'm sure that this is the source of
the confusion.  Again, the RFC says

3.2.2 http URL

   The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP
   protocol. This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and
   semantics for http URLs.

   http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]

   If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics
   are that the identified resource is located at the server listening
   for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI
   for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2).
--- cut ---

Phrases like 'network resources' and 'the identified resource is located
at the server listening for TCP connections' certainly don't convey to me
the idea that the http URI can be used to denote 'anything that has
identity'.

FWIW, I would really like to see your intended meaning clarified (in
writing) somewhere - perhaps in http://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/ ?
