Perhaps the reason why 'people creating these new schemes always start out
by stating something which is patently false about the existing ones' is
because the current documentation is unclear?  In fact, it is worse than
unclear - to my mind, the documentation for the http URI scheme clearly
means something that you didn't intend it to mean! :-(

That is why I suggest that your intended meaning for the http URI scheme 
is clarified in writing somewhere.  The W3C URI clarification document
seems like an ideal place to do that?
