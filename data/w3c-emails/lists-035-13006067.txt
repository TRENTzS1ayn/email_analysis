Yeah, right, like the context of namespace URI implies the
opaque identifier of a global naming partition, not something
to be dereferenced...

If what you suggest is true, then we can toss out all URI
prefixes such as http: mailto: ftp: etc. because, after
all, their meaning will be implied by context, eh? I.e.
intead of having 

   ftp://foo.abc.com
   http:/foo.abc.com

I can just use

   uri://foo.abc.com

and whether I need HTTP or FTP access will be clear from context, eh?

Sorry. Nope.
