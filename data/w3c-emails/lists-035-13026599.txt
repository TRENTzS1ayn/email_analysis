SOAP Web Service endpoints can be named with http:* URIs, and communicated
with via XML representations shipped over HTTP. But you can't download the
service itself; that wouldn't make sense. When you think of HTTP as a way
of talking to some (possibly authoritative) service about URI-named
resources, this whole URI thing makes a bit more sense. If you think of it
as a glorified form of file-sharing (like NFS, Samba etc) URIs for
abstractions seem odd.
