I would argue that the HTTP URI in that case does not denote the
service, but a description of the service, if dereferencing
the URI provides the SOAP instance.

Of course, there's a gray zone there. Does a CGI HTTP URI denote
the service provided by the CGI application or the application
itself, or just one access portal to that application (or service).
Still, its a web-resource, and so it is reasonable to denote it
with an HTTP URI.

Exactly. HTTP URIs for abstractions seem odd. HTTP defines, like
you say, a global filesystem of sorts. HTTP URIs denote real
and accessible resources stored in that global filesystem.

To use an HTTP URI to denote an abstract concept, such as 
"LOVE" or an ontological term, or a non-web resource such
such as "The city of Paris" is quite odd. I fully agree.
