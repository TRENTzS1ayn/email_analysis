No. You missed my point. You seem to be arguing that a specific
URI scheme can not *itself* constrain its use to a subset of URI
applications, and I'm arguing that it can, and that the HTTP URI
specification *does*.

I don't disagree with any of the above.

But I assert that the HTTP URI scheme *does* define such a subset
in the language of the specification and inherited from the
semantics and purpose of the HTTP protocol.

I think that sums it up. I can go and cut and paste stuff from
the RFC's if you like, but not just now... gotta run and fetch
the kids...

That's only good if (a) you are registering a URN namespace, and
(b) your namespace is not a hierarchical path based URI

Nope. I'll be going the full URI route.

Great. I may ask you for a roadmap ;-)

In that we are agreed.
