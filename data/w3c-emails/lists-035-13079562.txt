It doesn't. SOAP doesn't have 'instances'; its a protocol layered over
HTTP for talking to services using SOAP-ese XML messages.

I didn't say HTTP is a global filesystem, I said that if you think of it
that way (a mistake, btw), you'll end up disliking the URI design.

I'm using...

http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Love
and
http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Paris

...and have rigged the Web to respond with RDF/XML representations of
those ontological categories should someone ask about them using HTTP GET.

Its a slippery slope from HTTP's innate content negotiation mechanism,
which provides us the ability to give an abstract intellectual work (eg.
an image) a Web name (URI) distinct from its various (content negotiable)
renderings. Why is the notion of an image (eg. the W3C logo) appropriately
less 'abstract' than the two notions you mention above?  Images and
concepts and services have representations that can be transmitted via
HTTP. One might make the case that a representation of an image can tell
you, in some bag-of-bytes, everything needed about that image. But that
distinction breaks down when you consider URIs for services, which usually
expose only partial representations.
