I'm not following. SOAP probably isn't the best example, as it has
some odd properties, but its use of URIs to identify endpoints
clearly identifies services; service descriptions (e.g., IDLs like
WSDL) have separate identifiers. Both SOAP endpoints and URIs that
point at service descriptions will, when dereferenced, return a
representation of the resource in a format that the client is
presumed to be able to understand.

Option two. The "CGI application" (which I'm interpreting as "a
bundle of code") might encompass one resource or many resources;
interactions with those resources might affect application state,
having follow-on effects to other resources exposed to the
application.

But what is 'non-web'? The best definition of the Web is 'an
information space', which begs the question; how can you exclude a
concept from a global information space? HTTP does not define the
shape of the Web, or vice versa.

Whenever you use an HTTP URI in a Web browser, you use it for two
things; identifying the resource uniquely in a global namespace, and
dereferencing it to get a representation. 

Why is it so odd that some people only want to use it as an
identifier, without going off and dereferencing it? If it weren't
allowed to use a HTTP URI without dereferencing it, how would you
talk about the services available at those URIs without dereferencing
them? The HTTP itself uses URIs in this fashion (e.g. as index keys
in caches).
