No, URNs are only those URI that start with a "urn" scheme.  What I said is
that HTTP URLs are identifiers, and hence names, and therefore capable of
being a symbolic replacement for any other identifier, including URNs.

I have been saying that for the past eight years.  That doesn't mean it is
a waste of their time, only that the solution to persistent naming isn't
obtained merely by changing the scheme name.
