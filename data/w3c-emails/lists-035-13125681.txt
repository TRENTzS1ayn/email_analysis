That's okay, it's a (mostly) free world.

Yes, you can.  It is just an identifier.  A variable.  A mathematical symbol
described by a sequence of characters in a syntax defined by the first
part of that string leading up to the colon character.

Nonsense.  Software doesn't *know* squat -- it has no intelligence, not
even AI.  It is merely used for various purposes.

It is the Web.

The only chaos I have seen is in the writings of more recent specifications
that ignore the research and experience of the Web developers in favor of
their own personal view of an ideal world.  When they implement something
that works and has the same expressive power as the Web itself, then I will
take their writings seriously.

That is explained in Tim's original Web design notes and 1993 papers
on the Web.  The notion that everyone is going to agree on the same
namespace, let alone the same syntax, just isn't practical, and with the
proper design it isn't necessary.  So why waste time trying to convince
everyone to use a single namespace?  Tim's recent argument isn't about
making everyone use "http" as a namespace -- it is about not wanting
everyone to create their own namespace just because they can.  Sure,
it is possible, but it creates additional work and complexity for
everyone else.
