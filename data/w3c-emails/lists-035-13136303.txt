Your understanding of logic is hopelessly flawed.  The http URI scheme
is an element that is commonly found within the HTTP protocol, and was
originally defined outside of that protocol specification.  The ONLY reason
it is defined within the HTTP specification now is because the authors
were far too busy, and tired of pointless discussions like this one, to
bother going through the standardization process in separate specifications.
