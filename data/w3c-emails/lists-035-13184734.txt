Yes indeed. But they also carry some baggage.

It took me a very long time to understand why some people insisted
that much on the distinction between names and locations. I finally
understood it when I talked to somebody from the library community
insisting on this distinction. He gave the example of books.

This helped me a lot: It became clear that in a library with books
(as in any other system primarily oriented on physical objects, and
in particular on such objects existing in multiple instances), the
distinction between names and locations was quite fundamental.

However, it became also very much clearer to me (I already thought
so implicitly before) that in a web context, centered on concepts
and digital resources, where copying and moving things around is
virtually instantaneous and extremely cheap, the distinction between
names and locations is not necessary at all, and usually confuses
more than it helps.
