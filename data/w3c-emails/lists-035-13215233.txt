Not so. Just because it is easier to make copies does not mean
that the relation of name to location looses its importance. Quite
the opposite! It means that there potentially could be far more
locations of the "same" thing to keep track of.

Furthermore, your argument only applies to digital objects, not
to abstract objects or concrete objects that are not digitizable.
