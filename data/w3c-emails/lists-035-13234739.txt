No, that's a URL to retrieve a definition of the abstract
concept 'BRILLIANCE' from a particular web location. The
fact that you have a clever redirect does not make the URL
any more suitable a representation of the abstract concept
than http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=brilliance.

Because it is an HTTP URL, if it *didn't* resolve to "something"
then you are violating the expectations and intuitions inferred
by its association with the HTTP protocol, which is for accessing
"things".

I.e.

   <rdf:Description
rdf:about="voc://patrick.stickler@nokia.com/concepts/brilliance">
      <foo:definitionOf
rdf:resource="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=brilliance"/>
   </rdf:Description>

could be one way I could point to a definition of
"BRILLIANCE" as *I* conceive it, though I may choose some
other definition, or multiple definitions, as I see fit.

(I'll be submitting an I-D for the the 'voc:' URP scheme shortly... and
if you don't know what a URP is, don't worry, I'll be submitting an I-D
that explains that too...  They should be under your tree by Xmas  ;-)
