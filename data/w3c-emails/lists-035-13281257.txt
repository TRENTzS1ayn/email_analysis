Why have any syntax, since it's so opaque, so meaningless?!

Why not then just use UUIDs instead of URIs for *everything*.

Yeah! What a great breakthrough! All we need are UUIDs! Fantastic.

We can then just describe their interpretation with RDF, or leave
it to the "context"!

We don't even have to worry about syntax!

Wonderful... problem solved!

Obviously, you missed my point. The URI scheme provides
clues to its intended interpretation, such that e.g. it
should be meaningful to an agent that implements a particular
protocol, and the remainder of the URI is structured in a
fashion to be parsed and manipulated by that agent in some
useful, and predictable manner, as defined by that protocol.

With all due respect, (most of) the web today works because 
an 'http' URI is interpreted according to the HTTP protocol, and a
'mailto:' URI is interpreted according to common mail
protocols (e.g. SMTP, etc.), etc. etc., and my hat is off to
the founding fathers and mothers of the web.

However, the "hot" issues of the day are due to the
fact that new extensions based on previous mechanisms
*don't* work reliably and there are
few clear practices, only hunches and hacks, such as using
HTTP URIs for namespaces and putting something like RDDL
there. Fine, but that's a hack. Not a solution. Because
you can't put RDDL at the end of *any* URI because not 
all URIs have interpretations which allow that.

Well, I was presuming that the founding architects of the web
appreciated the benefit of a functional taxonomy of URI schemes
but perhaps they weren't.
