AG::  Excellent and thoughtful post as ususal.

On the other hand, the appearance that all this data speed means that the
transport lag can be ignored is not to be trusted.

As regards applications of the Web of Services that is coming over the hill at
us, there is no such thing as a negligible lag in accessing data.  There is a
BIG community doing BIG computations and they alone generate a large market
for
staging functionality to get the fixed-name data to the variable place
where it
is needed as an articulated separately managed step in the process.  This is a
large enough an endemic enough problem such that the Global Grid Forum is
forming a working group to address this issue in particular.
