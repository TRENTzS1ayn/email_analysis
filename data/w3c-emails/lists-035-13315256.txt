Hmm... you're right. That's a bit of a faux pas. The spirit of the
contemporary view is that the distinction between the taxonomies is
melting away into something a little more grounded by ten years of Web
implementation.

Really, we need an awful lot more documents like uri-clarification
[1]. It was a fair start, and there are a lot of questions to be
addressed, but I don't think that it has gone any way to resolving
discussions such as this one before they start. I'm not even 100% sure
what the statuses are of the groups at the W3C and IETF charted to
deal with this.
