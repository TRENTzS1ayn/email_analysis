No, it's what I say it is.  How can you, or anybody else, tell me what
I'm naming?

The redirect communicates that I'm currently (it's a temporary
redirect) delegating the definition of my concept of brilliance to
dictionary.com.

Using an HTTP temporary redirect on a GET invocation means more or less
the same thing as what you have written there.  It's "just" another
syntax that also happens to be a protocol, that allows you to automate
the dissemination and manipulation of that information.

Without a protocol that does that, any other URI scheme is automatically
playing with a handicap.
