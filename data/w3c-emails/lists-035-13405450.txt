Fine, whatever.  Don't you have something better to do than to reopen

All arguments that I have made in the past.  Nevertheless, the people who
have the most right to decide what "URN" means have apparently made their
decision, and I will abide by it in order to reduce confusion.

The basic problem here is that your opinion should not get to decide
what people can do with their identifiers.   The specifications define
what the technology is capable of doing (or expressing), not what some
people think it should be limited to do.
