With all due respect, I think this shows a misunderstanding of the role of
XML namespaces in WebDAV. There are a lot of reasons for WebDAV to use XML
namespaces - it's not just a syntactic matter whether to write
DAV:multistatus or D:multistatus.

First of all, without namespace declaration, an element named
DAV:multistatus wouldn't be NS-wellformed. In addition,

- WebDAV messages can be extended with "arbitrary" new extension elements,
preferrably from other namespaces (just like other XML applications do),
- WebDAV has a resource property model where a property is identified by the
pair (namespace, element name).

So, having XML namespaces in WebDAV has really nothing to do with the syntax
for the prefix.

Of course I do agree that choosing "DAV:" as namespace name was a bad idea.

(Side remark: good old Microsoft is even using namespace names like "xml:").

Not according to the current grammar, right.

However, if you look at [1] you'll find that although TBL made his comments
about the DAV: URI scheme himself, he didn't catch the greater problem if
not being a URI at all. I think this says something about the *intent* of
RFC2396 :-)

Again, this is on the list of known and resolved issues.
