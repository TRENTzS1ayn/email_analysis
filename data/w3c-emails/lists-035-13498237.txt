By relaxing the rules (why does the scheme-specific part have to be
non-empty, besides common sense :-), (almost) nobody would be hurt. We can
still discourage or even forbid *new* URI schemes with empty scheme-specific
parts, but this wouldn't really affect anybody else.

However, changing RFC2518 breaks *all* WebDAV clients and servers.
Immediately.

It isn't broken.

Technically correct. But extremely expensive and likely to be ignored by all
major companies with existing code out there. So I don't think this is
practical.

If you insist that RFC2396 can't change and others insist that XNL
namespaces can't change (I bet there'll be many!), then there are two
possible outcomes:

- The issue is ignored just like it was before. This is now a bit harder now
that it's documented.
- RFC2518++ is changed accordingly, and *all* software would need to be
updated (basically throwing WebDAV back years).

Whose choice is it, actually?
