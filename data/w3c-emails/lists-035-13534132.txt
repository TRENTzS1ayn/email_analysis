I can't see why you'd believe that.  Namespaces are often URNs, for
example.

IMO, a URI scheme has identity, and so should be able to be identified
by a URI reference.

Perhaps a compromise here would be to treat "DAV:" as a relative URI
reference.  A 2518 revision could include the use of XML Base, or its
own base-declaring mechanism, allowing future DAV specifications and
processors to use URIs to evolve, while existing processors could be
seen to be assuming a base URI.  Thoughts?
