Try expressing two RDF statements using the above URI: one that 
describes the abstract concept "BRILLIANCE" and one that describes
the definition obtainable by a HTTP GET request.

You can't.

Right. The *definition* of your concept of brilliance. Not the
concept of brilliance itself. What if you wish to provide three
definitions and five examples of brilliance. Do all of those 
eight URIs all denote the abstract concept "BRILLIANCE"? They
may be expressions of it. They may be related to it. But they
do not denote *it*.

Sorry.

On the contrary, I consider a URI scheme that has its resolution
agency named explicitly in its structure to be *FAR* more handicapped
as a persistent, context independent identifier of a resource!

The reason why URNs are needed is because we need identifiers that
can be resolved in a context free manner. An HTTP URI is bound to
a specific *host* for resolution, and just because you might be
able to either (a) redirect to some other host or (b) resolve in
some other manner than HTTP does not lessen that "handicap".
