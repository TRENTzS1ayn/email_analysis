With all due respect (really)...

This "argument" happens to intersect with one the primary focus
areas of my work, and is an issue that I consider to be in 
great need of attention -- and if you had any idea what my work
load was and considered the time I am spending discussing these
issues in forums such as this, you would not make condescending
quips such as the above.

Forgive me for stepping on the omniscient toes of the founding
fathers of the internet. I'm sure you all got it right the first
time... It must surely be perfect and fully suitable to meet
all present and future needs, known or unknown...

And surely anyone who would presume to think differently is
clearly insane, ignorant, or just wanting to rock the boat
for fun...

Well, I for one am not clear on what that decision actually is,
and the presumed "clarification" certainly doesn't clarify what
that actual decision is.

And what if that decision, and others like it, are the very source 
of the confusion?

You're free to do as you like, as am I. 

At least I am encouraged that we seem to share the same goal of 
reduced confusion.

I would never be so presumptuous to think that my opinions would
necessarily decide anything (though it appears that there are others
who do hold such presumptions).

The crux of the issue is what those actual specifications define; and
not whether a given technology is *capable* of something but whether
it is *optimal* for something, and if not the latter, then what may
be a better option.
