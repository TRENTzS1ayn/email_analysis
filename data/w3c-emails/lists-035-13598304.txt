Right. Insofar as RDF is concerned, which provides for a
concatenative mapping from qname to URI, you could do the 
following:

   <dav:creationdate xmlns:dav="dav:"/>

Where "dav:" is both a URI denoting the URI scheme, and an xmlns
prefix. Which is which is 100% clear in the XML syntax.

This gives the (RDF) URI "dav:creationdate" as desired and
provides for consistency between URI and qname representation.

Eh?

Though this doesn't help much in a non-RDF context where a
given qname is interpreted as just "{namespace}name" rather 
than the concatenation "namespacename".

Cheers,

Patrick
