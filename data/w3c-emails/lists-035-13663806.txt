Not so. It is possible to describe things without knowing their URI. We
do it all the time. Here, you can describe the scheme indirectly, eg:

<rdf:RDF blah blah...>
<Scheme>
 <prefix>dav</prefix>
 <name>The DAV URI scheme</name>
 <seeAlso rdf:resource="http://www.webdav.org/"/>
 <blurb>A URI schema for ... </blurb>
</Scheme>
</rdf:RDF>

We can further tighten things by saying that the RDF property sketched
here, 'prefix', is a UniqueProperty (using DAML+OIL or another Web
ontology language). That tells us that an individual Scheme is picked out
by each value of 'prefix'.

BTW http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html is generated using a similar
technique; details at http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html#ctech
