I strongly agree with you Andy.

I've had the continual repeated impression that alot of folks
want their cake and be able to eat it too by using URLs for
dual purposes -- to denote some abstract or non-digital resource
and then also some information about the resource; and it
also strikes me as fundamentally wrong.

There are others I've encountered who may to a degree agree
that it is not quite kosher, but since it's so useful for
clever hacks and tricks, they do it anyway.

Yet there appears to be a pervasive attitude of "if I *can* do 
it, it's *OK* to do it that way" which totally misses the point
of whether it is *optimal* to do it that way and what might
be better alternatives, and the masses who don't have a clue
either way just follow the lead of the most visible characters
so we end up with a critical mass of "bad habits".

Pity...

But action is better than words in most scenarios, so in fairness
to the "status quo" I guess the best way to encourage change
is to show how to do things better and make the path of evolution
obvious. That's the path I plan to tread...

I look forward to seeing where we are one year from now ;-)
