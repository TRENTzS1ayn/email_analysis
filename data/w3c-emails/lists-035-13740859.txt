I admit I missed that because it's under "IANA" considerations :-)

The XML namespace recommendation doesn't specify a specific representation.

Yes, but XML namespace names are case-sensitive. So <multistatus
xmlns="DAV:"/> and <multistatus xmlns="dav:" /> are different things, and
the latter isn't in the "DAV:" XML namespace (assuming for now that the
notion of "DAV:" XML namespaces exists at all).

I understand why one would prefer to have a "small" change on somebody
else's spec, but from the feedback I've seen so far I don't think it's going
to happen.

I don't think it's moot.

Whether you like it or not, RFC2518 as it's published is broken because it
doesn't conform to what to other (earlier and more basic specifications)
say. It's a pity that this wasn't discovered earlier, but ignoring the issue
won't make it go away.
