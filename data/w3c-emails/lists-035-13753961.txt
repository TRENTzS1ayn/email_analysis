Patrick, you seem to be forgetting that we have been discussing these
very same issues since 1993.  Over 8 years.  Everything you have said so
far has been said in the past, some of it even by me, and yet all that
discussion has accomplished is a bunch of unimplemented namespaces, one
fairly vague URI spec (because I was *forced* to make it vague in order
to comply with the "rough consensus" of the WG), and a URI "clarification"
in which I did not participate, do not understand, and have no interest
in implementing.

Right now your endless questions are getting in the way of my other
projects, some of which have the potential to change the world every day.
That is what I enjoy doing, not answering questions about old specs.

I am happy that you are interested in this area of research.  However,
you have to give me something more than your opinion before I am going
to stand up and take notice.  Demonstrate that some idea works better
than what we have now.

Actually, as author of RFC 2396, I am not free to do what I like in
this regard.  You do realize that the uri mailing list is the official
working group mailing list for revisions to RFC 2396, right?  I have
no choice in some things, and I think that following the recommendations
of an IAB committee is one of those things I am compelled to do.
