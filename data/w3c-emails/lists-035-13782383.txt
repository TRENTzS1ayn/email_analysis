I'm aware of that.

My proposal was specifically:

   URI ::= scheme ":" 
   URI ::= "urn"  ":" <NID> ":"

The first case is not a valid URI for the scheme, but is a valid
URI denoting the scheme. The second case is not a valid URI for
the URN namespace, but is a valid URI denoting the URN namespace.
