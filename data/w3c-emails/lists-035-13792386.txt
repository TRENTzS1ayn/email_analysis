How about a URI scheme for URI schemes?  Something like:

   scheme:dav
   scheme:http
   scheme:urn:someNID

and, of course,

   scheme:scheme

This would let everybody refer to URI schemes in the same way, and doesn't
need any changes in grammar or interpretation for current standards.  The
disadvantage being that it introduces yet another scheme...
