That would be an advantage.

Quite so.

I also suspect that *alot* of applications already treat URI
scheme prefixes as unique identifiers (even if not fully valid
URIs) and so a change to (or perhaps merely an interpretation of) 
the current specs such as I proposed would be more backwards
compatible.
