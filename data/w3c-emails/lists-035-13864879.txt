I mentioned this.

I don't think they do.

"[Definition:] The attribute's value, a URI reference, is the namespace name
identifying the namespace. ..."

WebDAV could also define that the message bodies do not use namespaces, and
re-declare the namespace syntax so that "DAV:" is valid. However, I doubt
that anybody would want *that*. It would basically mean that on the long
run, an non-namespace aware XML processor is required, and that WebDAV
servers/clients would need to do namespace checking and mapping on their
own.

I think you just argued for changing the WebDAV namespace (or to deprecate
it and add an alternative one).
