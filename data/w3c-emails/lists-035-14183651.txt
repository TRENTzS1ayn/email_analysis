Er... no, that doesn't look right. I don't think I understand
what you wrote, in fact.

You can stop worring about whether, say,

http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
or
urn:pin:1
or
glorp:lsjfliw3jli

are a names or an addresses. You're free to use them as either.
You can observe, syntactically, that they're URIs (cf RFC2396).
You can also see, from inspection, that the second one
is a URN, since it starts with "urn:..." and that the other
two or not.

And you can go to the URI scheme registry
to find that the community has not yet agreed to start
using the glorp: URI scheme.

In the URI scheme registry, you can look
under "http:" to see that www.w3.org should
be looked up in DNS, and under
"urn:" to see that pin: should be looked
up in the URN namespace registry.

If you're writing specs, yes, you should stop thinking
about URLs.

You can keep thinking of URNs, but realize URN is
not some fuzzy concept; it means exactly: a
URI that starts with "urn:...", whose semantics is governed
by the specs you'll find registered in the URI scheme
registry under "urn:".

Umm... how about this:

because it makes all the distinctions that are necessary
to get the various jobs done. There are more distinctions
folks used to make (in the classical view) but these
distinctions are (a) controversial, and (b) not necessary
to Getting Stuff Done.

Hmm... I'm not sure what to make of this... I'll have
to study it some more.
