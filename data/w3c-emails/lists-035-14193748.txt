Incorrect due to an insufficient definition of 'retrieval'. The 
OID URN namespace says that there is no _authoritative_ retrieval
mechanism defined and indeed the document doubts if one could be
built. But that's simply one type of 'retrieval'. A local store of
DTDs using an OID URN as the key would be 'retrieval' and thus
a fragment would have meaning.

I.e. if you can come up with some set of state in which the fragment
has meaning by using the URI as a key in some database then the frament
has meaning. Fragments aren't part of the URI. They're part of the
thing the URI identifies. The idea of whether or not a fragment is
'valid' has everything to do with the thing identified and nothing
really at all to do with the URI itself...
