Fragments aren't part of the URI standard thus, a given scheme
shouldn't be talking about fragments. The use or non-use of fragments
belongs in an application definition (along with how it uses URIs), not
in a specific URI scheme definition.

Being involved in the discussions around what became 2396, I can pretty
comfortably say that Roy's assertion above is consistent with what
everyone involved considers the role and scope of fragments to be.
It was painful getting there but once we did we realized it made good sense.

2396 was attempting to say what URIs themselves were sans any application
context (be it hypermedia or directory services). The inclusion of the
URI References (and thus fragments) was an attempt to be clear about
one of the most common uses of URIs. The problem might be caused by
the definitions being used for the "web architecture". At the time 
the most common definition of the 'Web' 'the set of resources identified
by a URI'. If you're using a definition that assumes things like
URI References, caches, media types, etc then I can see where the
confusion would be...
