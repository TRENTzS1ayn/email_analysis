Hm, checklink relies on URI.pm, which actually implements RFC 1808:

[...]
   Similarly, parsers must avoid treating "." and ".." as special when
   they are not complete components of a relative path.

      /./g          = <URL:http://a/./g>
      /../g         = <URL:http://a/../g>
[...]

Note that I may create '..' paths, thus http://www.example.org/../ may
actually point to some other resource than http://www.example.org/ I
can't see anything in RFC 2396 that states such URIs are invalid, I'm
not sure if this is what I should read out of 'considered to be in
error'. How would I then create URIs to such resources? Using %2E%2E
wouldn't work either, would it?
