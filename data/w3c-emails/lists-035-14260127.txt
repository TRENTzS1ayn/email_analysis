Not in the context of machine states and programming languages, no. 
In a general-purpose ontological model for all of human knowledge, it 
does require a little more thought. Since (I have been told) a 
resource can be anything, I am not sure what kind of general notions 
of 'state' or 'corresponds' can be used in such a very general 
setting.

I meant in general. This passage is about resources in general, not just http.

Thanks for the feedback.
