Ehm, I don't see how that is true. A problem only would arise if 
the webmaster decided to use this URI to identify something 
else, which seems highly unlikely. If the webmaster simply 
decided that the 1999 should come first, both URIs would work 
equally well -- that is they would clearly identify a resource 
but that resource would not be easily accessible by say, typing 
the URI into a web browser.

I don't see how your citation would be any more fragile either way.

No, it identifies a Resource (STD 50), a conceptual mapping 
which corresponds do a different "entity" over time.

So you're saying that using duri does a bit of "resource 
resolution" -- that a duri URI points not to a resource at a 
certain point of time, but instead the entity that that resource 
corresponded to? This is an important distinction.
