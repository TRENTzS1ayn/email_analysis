My statement says that too many URI schemes is a bad thing,.

Trying again the explanation, it is because you have to program in a new URI
scheme,
you can't look it up.

That document is not a proposal to solve the problem I stated.
But its  a Good Thing.

It aims to solve another one, that Content-Types are not URIs.
I think it does a reasonable job, except of course that I don't like the
fact that it introduces a new scheme.   It doesn't have to - it
would work just fine with the an http:/something/ prefix.
I would prefer that there be some
commitment to a part of http: space so that IANA can provide
some definitive information about them.

http://content-type.org/application/xml

would be more useful to me, so long as we had a commitment
written in stone that content-type.org would exist forever wihtout
anyone paying fees etc.

But I would be happy with the <content-type: ... > URI scheme.

Well, I'm not sure which you think I think is Bad Thing.
