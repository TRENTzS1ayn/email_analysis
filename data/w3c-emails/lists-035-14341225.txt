I agree, but this seems very different from the mapping proposed by RFC
3023 [1] which defines a mapping from a (namespace) URI into a content
type based on an IANA registration and a new "+xml" syntax convention
for XML based content type names.

RFC 3023 suggests content types for several W3C defined languages
including SVG, RDF, MathML, and XSLT all of which are identified by
namespace URIs. This seems to go in the direct opposite direction by
forcing central registration of names that were designed not to be. Is
this the direction we want to go?
