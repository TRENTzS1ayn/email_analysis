That is what namespaces are for, of course - when you have a langauge
with namespaces.

Having an http:  URI doens't mean you *have* to retrieve a page every time
the URI
is encountered.  There are all kinds of ways you can know what it stands for
from having it programmed in to having a persistent cache (catalog).
But it *does* provide a way of IANA providing  *definitive* information
about that URI.
Such as binary grammars, and conversions between types, etc, [pointers to]
definitive
specs. Because when you use DNS to look up the URI owner's server and ask
that server for a representation of the resource, what you get, inhaving
been
authorized by the owner of the URI, is to that extent authoritative. And
that is useful.

For every field which has a extensible set of string values, it is
traditional to invoke
IANA  to deal with the problem.  This doesn't scale.  I see a purpose for
IANA
both historically and in the future as an accessible persistent store, and a
link with
the standards process which provides a set of specs which have a claim to
quality and interoperability.  But it should only be thought of as covering
those
resources which need to be common and shared globally. There should also
be room in the architecture for ones which are local or experimental, etc.
This is achieved by malking the IANA space a subset of URI space, a subset
whose
special place is special because of the way IANA is run.
