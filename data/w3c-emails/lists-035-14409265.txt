Tim,

Wow, this thread certainly came back to life!  :)  To paraphrase your mail
below, you prefer "http://contenttype.org/..." to "ContentType:....", but
that's not a showstopper.  Great, I think we agree on the most imporant
bit.

I guess I had read too much into your original "excess URI schemes"
message, and worried that the "ContentType:..." solution was considered
excess in your book.  It sounds like I had nothing to worry about.

Thanks for the clarification.

Rob
