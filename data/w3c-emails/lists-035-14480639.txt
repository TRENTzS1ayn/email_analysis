There's actually been quite a bit of activity in IETF
on spatial location designations of all sorts, beyond
the one reference I gave before:

BOF & pointer to its mail archives:
  http://www-nrc.nokia.com/ip-location/
Newly chartered IETF working group:
  http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/geopriv-charter.html
including Internet draft for initial requirements

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosen-geopriv-requirements-00.txt


The working group and discussions around it have had
quite a focus on the privacy issues surrounding protocols
that might trade geographic information about the devices
(and thus users) at the endpoints.

Note that the geopriv charter says:
  " the working group will select an already standardized format to
recommend
   for use in representing location per se"

so the assumption is that there are other (non-IETF)
standards that the IETF group will make reference too.
I wouldn't want to see the "geo" URN scheme choose a
different representation than the geopriv working group,
at least without some analysis and justification.
