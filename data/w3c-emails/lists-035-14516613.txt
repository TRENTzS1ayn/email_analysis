Hello,

You say on http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes that you'd like to hear of
even non-standard URI schemes, so here's one.  The "clsid:" scheme, as
described at http://www.w3.org/Addressing/clsid-scheme , seems to be used
by a few sites to embed things like Flash objects, etc.  It identifies the
"UUID" of an object, as defined in the expired draft at

http://www.opengroup.org/dce/info/draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt.

I know little about any of this; from my brief research it seems to be
mostly Microsoft-specific.  It is however used in the last example in
section 13.3.1 of the HTML 4.0 spec, about objects:

http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/struct/objects.html#h-13.3.1


Cheers,
James
