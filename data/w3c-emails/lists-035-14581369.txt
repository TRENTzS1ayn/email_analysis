Abstract

This paper addresses and attempts to clarify two issues pertaining to
URIs, and presents recommendations. Section 1 addresses how URI
space is partitioned and the relationship between URIs, URLs, and
URNs. Section 2 describes how URI schemes and URN namespace ids
are registered. Section 3 mentions additional unresolved issues not
considered by this paper and section 4 presents recommendations.
