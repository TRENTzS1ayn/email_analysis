Registered media types already have URIs.  For example, "application/xml" has;

Granted, types that aren't guaranteed to be registered (such as experimental, vendor, or personal tree) don't get URIs of that form.  But I don't 
believe creating new URI schemes is necessary or desirable, when an existing scheme such as "http" would suffice.
