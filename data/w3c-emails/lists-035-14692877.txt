Are you sure it suffices? The IANA is no longer at that site and that
URL will sease to function soon. If you want a permanent URI for that
concept take a look at these two documents:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-iana-urn-01.txt

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-urn-ietf-lang-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-urn-ietf-conneg-00.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-urn-ietf-rfc822-00.txt 

the last one being the one you want...
