I'm not familiar with the details of the relationship between IANA and
ISI, but I wouldn't expect it would be difficult to organize configuring
some HTTP redirects, if and when it's no longer appropriate for ISI to
be controlling those URLs.

That's your prerogative, but I personally find it quite handy to type
in those ISI URLs into my browser so that I can find out which RFC
registered them.

Why does there have to be any correct encoding?  The relationship between
"text/plain" and "text/plain; format=flowed" should be communicated out of
band of any URI naming policy.  For example, performing a GET on the
text/plain URI could return a document describing the parameters of that
type.  Oh wait, that already happens (modulo a redirect). 8-)
