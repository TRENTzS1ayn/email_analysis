There's nothing wrong with there being a well-known location for IANA 
URLs.  However, many mechanisms defined by the W3C rely on URIs as a means 
of expressing registry information (SMIL systemComponent is the one I'm 
primarily interested in, but I understand CC/PP has a similar concern).  In 
order to have interoperability between implementations, both 
implementations need to implement the *same* scheme.  Redirects are *not* 
acceptable.
