[Contingent on IANA endorsement what Mark Baker gave us] to refer to _exactly_
what IANA had to say _today_ about the text/plain media type, I believe a
valid
reference could be spelled 


<urn:tdb:20010925:http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/t
ext/plain>

For a reference which recovers what IANA had to say about that type
designation
as of when you use the reference, you could of course use simply

<<http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/text/plain>http:
//www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/text/plain>

... and this might return no recovered value for the resource some day.
