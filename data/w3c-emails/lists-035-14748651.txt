Wouldn't that depend on the type of redirect?

A 301 means a firm "The requested resource has been assigned a new
permanent URI [...]", whereas a 302 means a softer "The requested
resource resides temporarily under a different URI."

I suggest that a 301 redirect should mean exactly what you suggest
redirects should not mean.

Anyhow, I'm all for moving media type URLs under iana.org.  If this is
done soon, I think we can forgo needing redirects to be set up, as I'm
not aware of any deployed software that uses the ISI URLs.
