The great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.

At the end of the day, it would be great if this community could agree on 
*one* mapping between the two formats.  I'd get laughed out of the room if 
I suggested as a work item for our developer team to map the n-to-n 
possible ways a media type can be expressed as a URI as something we should 
implement in any of our products.

This infinitely flexible system may be just peachy in a dream world where 
implementers have infinite time to tinker around with all of the 
equivalencies, but at the end of the day, I'm really tired of people 
theorizing that a well-thought out media type <-> URI spec isn't necessary.

For those of you joining late (there were a couple of outdated email 
addresses in the "To:" line) the archive of this discussion is here:

...and I'm arguing in favor of the Eastlake proposal for doing URI<->Media 
Type mappings:
