I'll agree this is much better.  A couple of (solvable) problems with that 
format:

*  Ability to map that back into "text/plain", since most systems that deal 
with media types use this form as the internal representation.
*  Ability to express parameters ("text/plain; encoding=flowed")

Is that addressed in the IDs?
