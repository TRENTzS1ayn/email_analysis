But what if the IETF cedes control of this registry to some other
body?  Then that URN would break too.  How is this any different
than with an URL?

If, by proposing the use of an IETF URN, you're suggesting that the
IETF is a better authority than IANA, that's fine - I don't know,
maybe it is.  But then I'd suggest that using an http://www.ietf.org
URL would serve exactly the same purpose as that URN, be no more
brittle, *and* be resolvable with a currently deployed protocol.
Win/win, no?
