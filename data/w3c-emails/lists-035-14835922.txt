Er, actually, the last one provides a URI identifer for the "Content-type" 
amnd other message headers, but doesn't provide URIs for Content-type 
values -- this proposal is aimed at being able to convey message metadata 
in formats like RDF.  For an example of anticipated use, see 
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-message-rfc822-xml-02.txt.

However, this does illustrate the basic idea:  values in an existing 
registry or framework of definition can be mapped into URI space;  it would 
be easy enough to do this for basic Content-type values.

(However, I understand that there are some additional requirements that the 
cturi proposal aims to solve.  I don't see changing the URI scheme name to 
something that is part of an existing scheme would be an insuperable problem.)
