This is indeed the case with _all_ URIs. Equivalence of resources across 
schemes is iff the URIs are lexicographically equal. URIs themselves
express no other type of equivalence other than that since equivalence
is always application specific and more often than not is also context
specific. Unless you have some application specific knowledge talking
about equivalence of Resources is a very dangerous and, IMNSHO, simply
a Bad Thing To Do...
