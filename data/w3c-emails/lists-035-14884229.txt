The IETF can't delegate it. It would have to break every single rule
in not only its charter but MOUs with ISOC and ICANN. Plus it can't
be done by the actual rules inforced by the URN namespace registration
process itself. Once that URN above is assigned it can never be 'unassigned'
or 're-assigned'. To do so would be a very clear _error_.

Nope.... Different set of rules and policies. There is no policy in 
place mandating that hte IETF keep the 'ietf.org' domain-name. There
is a policy built into the URN approval process that mandates that
if the IETF abandons or re-uses the 'ietf' URN namespace that it
is an _error_ on the part of the IETF.

I.e. if the IETF were to change domain-names you'd just have to deal 
with it. Its there perogative to do so.  If the IETF decided to play 
silly willy with the URN namespace you could clearly and unambiguously 
call them on the carpet for it.
