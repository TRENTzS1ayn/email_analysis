Hmm.. that seems easy to fix... and I suggest that
the IETF community is getting a lot of value out of
being able to contact the IETF at http://www.ietf.org/ .

It's hard for me to imagine that the value of doing so would
ever even approach the cost.

If you were an astute language lawyer, yes. But I suggest
that the number of complaints generated if the IETF
were to stop servicing http://www.ietf.org/ would drarf
the number of complaints if the IETF re-assigned a URN.
By several orders of magnitude.
