I suggest that putting the year-of-issue in a URI
(e.g. http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml) carries
this signal more effectively than putting urn: at the beginning.

Hmm... the idea of having names issued by consensus is
an interesting one. Surely we could do that inside http
space, without deploying any new URI schemes, no?

Hmm... I wonder how these marketing people
would feel if the IT part of the company
changed all their phone numbers after they put them at the
bottom of a big press release.

404s hurt in tel: space just as much, if not more, than
404s in http: space.

This "apparently arbitrary" rule is not arbitrary. That
it is a fundamental element of web architecture is a reflection
of the fact that it matters in real life to real people
who spend real money.
