I've always thought it'd be a good idea for some long-standing 
organization (MIT? Library of Congress?) to accept domain 
endowments. i.e. I pay a large sum of money and they continue to 
lease my domain name year after year.

Well, ICANN has already authenticated me (and thousands of 
others) via email and surface mail for their ICANN@Large voting 
system. I assume the same codes could be reused.

Hmm, now where did I put my ICANN PIN...
