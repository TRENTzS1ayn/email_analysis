It might be 'real life' in the hypertext world but as we've already
found out it causes real interoperability problems when those
URIs escape their context....

It might be nice for you but it causes other applications no end of 
headache. Relative URIs should have always been defined as a semantic
of the HTML HREF tag and _never_ of URIs themselves. But those are
old arguments...

Which is the exact reason I use it and why I don't use HTTP schemes...

That's the nice thing about URIs. You use the scheme that works for
your application and I'll use the one that works for mine. Just as long as 
we don't try and start pushing application specific concepts into the 
whole URI space the world works just fine...
