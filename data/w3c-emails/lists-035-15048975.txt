Roy,

I think a difference in our viewpoints may be here:

I am interested in information that escapes the confines of its enclosing 
protocol;  then, I am seeking a way to "absolutize" the reference in a way 
that cuts any dependency on the protocol context.

Hence, when you say:

I agree to a point (i.e. about "*all* IANA field values").  But *some* such 
values, such as content-type, do have reasonable meaning outside a given 
context.
