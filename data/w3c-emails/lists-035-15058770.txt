Well, that's a reasonable viewpoint.  I'd point out that urn: isn't a new 
scheme, and already has a defined consensus process for allocation.  I tend 
to think that effective use of urns might, in the longer term, help to 
limit the profusion of URI schemes.

True.  But even a mature labelling scheme like telephone numbers, where the 
costs are widely-understood, gets changed from time-to-time (area code 
changes, companies moving premises, etc.).

Again, true.  But I think that users of the technology who don't need to 
understand the architecture will relate the cost issues to visible causes 
(like the cost of reprinting brochures).  The practice of periodically 
reorganizing company web sites is with us, and I think it isn't about to go 
away.

To me, it seems easier to let HTTP URLs be HTTP URLs.  Organizations like 
W3C choose provide additional stability for their URLs, but requiring all 
organizations will adopt such a view seems to me like an uphill struggle.
