Er... yeah... it's intended to be a permanent
allocation, but authentication credentials
can't last forever.

Suppose, 12 years into the use of ietf.org,
the domain gods get a domain transfer request...
some other contractor is to operate ietf.org.
How do they tell whether to transfer the
public trust to the new domain operator?

Do you mean "relies on being able to dereference/access
some stuff at www.w3.org" or "being confident
that nobody has re-used those addresses for some other
reason"?

To prevent misuse. It's nice if services
can remain running, but it's absolutely critical
that names burned into old software don't get reassigned.

Ah... then you agree it's potentially a good idea?
Yes, I'd like to see something more scalable too.
