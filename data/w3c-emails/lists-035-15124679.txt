Yup, that's fine.  Because different URN nids don't require different 
handling by software that handles them (unlike different URI schemes, which 
MAY require different handling).

 From TimBL's original posting in this thread:

Here, the different URN nids serve to indicate different name allocation 
authorities, which are significant at the point a particular URN is minted, 
but which thereafter can all be treated alike;  I believe a "very high 
shared knowledge of the properties of" URNs is already present, because 
they don't really have any significant properties other than being unique, 
persistent names.
