Right. How does that negate my assertion that URIs in and of themselves
don't discuss equivalence of Resources outside lexical equivalence of
the URIs that identify them?

and IMHO, yet another reason why HTTP semantics are not applicable across
all URI schemes. HTTP's concept of equivalence is IMHO, fairly infantile.
The equivalence semantics that something like RDF gives you are much
more interesting and useful. but again, even the semantics that RDF
gives you may not be useful for other applications such as directory 
services, network management, monitoring, rights management, etc...
