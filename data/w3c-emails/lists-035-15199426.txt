Right. If you disavow any specific knowledge of the properties
of any scheme you still have the inherit URI semantics (resolution
_not_ being one of them). But if you at least use the knowledge that
URNs have to adhere to a certain set of rules then you have a powerful
tool. Its up to you whether you use it or not...

Right. But some seem to be ignoring that a specific scheme (URN in this
discussion) has made limitations on that context so that certain
assumptions can be made by simple examination and having _no_ other
context at all....

It really sounds here like you assert that persistence of the identifier
has something to do with whether or not the server is still there or not.

If this were the case then there would be no reason to have RFC 2396
since everything is done in context. No. RFC 2396 and any document
that defines a new URI scheme gets to make requirements on _all_
contexts that use that URI scheme. If you reject them then you're
violating the specs of that scheme...

Again, you seem to place 'persistence' in terms of whether or not the
resource is available on some network. That IMHO is persistence of
the Resource. Not the persistence of the URI...
