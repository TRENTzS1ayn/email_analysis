No no, nothing like that.  Just pointing out that HTTP has its own, and
that it's general enough to be useful for a variety of resource types
including, IMO, media types.

I was being facetious.  Canonicalization is nasty work, as Donald knows.
My point was that I've seen no requirements for any notion of equivalence 
in the ContentType URI scheme, which would seem to me to be a starting
point for URI definition, not an afterthought.

Sorry, I didn't realize that was your assertion.  We agree about
that point.

Not "all", but "lots of", "most", etc..

So what *are* the equivalence requirements of ContentType?
