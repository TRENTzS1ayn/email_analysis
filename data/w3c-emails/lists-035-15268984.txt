The notion of retrieval is not in any way specific to the URI scheme --
there is a paragraph in RFC 2396 that says exactly that, regardless of
whether it is a locator or a name.  The scheme only defines a namespace.
And a URN can be used for retrieval and thus can be used with a fragment.
However, the fragment is NOT part of the URN -- it is a separate name.

The retrieval mechanism is defined by the application, in all cases,
regardless of URI scheme.

Yes.  So don't use a fragment in those cases.  There is no reason to change
the protocol element just because it might be used in an illogical fashion.
There are millions of other variations on the URI syntax which wouldn't make
sense in that situation either.

Someone else has requested an additional protocol element for "possibly
relative URI reference without fragment", which I imagine will be added to
the next revision just to make it easier for protocol authors to pick and
choose what parts of the BNF they want to reuse in other specs.  But I assume
that is not what you want for this case.

The syntax applies to names already -- I doubt that it can get any broader.
