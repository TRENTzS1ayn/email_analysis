I'm aware of this paragraph, but it doesn't say what you claim it says.
In particular, it doesn't say that retrieval is always meaningful for
a URI scheme.  It just says how the meaning of a fragment identifier
is determined *after* a URI + fragment identifier has been used for a
retrieval operation.  If it were possible to have a URN scheme for
which retrieval was not meaningful (and I still haven't seen any
official document that answers this one way or another) then the
above paragraph wouldn't apply to URI references using that scheme
(and my interpretation would be that such URI references are not
meaningful).

I'd prefer the word "applicability" to "feasibility" as the latter
suggests that retrieval might be meaningful but just not possible with
current tools.

In RDF schemas, resources can be abstract concepts, and their URIs are
names.
To use them, you just have to be able to refer to those names.  What is the
notion of retrieval here?  I don't think it's retrieving the definition of
the concepts because you don't have to do that to use them in an RDF
document, and besides, RDF Schema defines another mechanism for that:
rdfs:isDefinedBy.

Thanks for your comments.  So it sounds as if it *is* OK to define a URN
scheme that states specifically that retrieval is not meaningful.  In that
case, the URI reference syntax should not be used with URIs from that
scheme,
as they would be meaningless.  Would you agree with that?
