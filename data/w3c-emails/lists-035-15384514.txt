No, but the act of defining an identifier scheme could be seen to have
that responsibility.  It seems reasonable for a scheme to clearly define
its intended use (although many schemes may make no such constraints).

Thanks for that wonderfully clear and unambiguous statement of your
view of the principles behind URIs.  Does that represent the shared view
of the committee that created RFC2396, or is this your personal view?
(I'm not trying to suggest that you aren't an authority here, I'm just
trying to gauge whether or not I can consider the statements above
as definitive.)

I hadn't realised that RFC2396 was intended to say anything about what
applications *might* choose to do with URIs outside Web architecture,
but I see that is probably necessary so that URIs can be incorporated
into future techologies.
