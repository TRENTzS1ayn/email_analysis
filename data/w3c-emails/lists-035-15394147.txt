Nope.  When you select a link on the Web it results in a GET action.
When the user finishes composition, they perform a POST action.  Those
are two different actions using the same identifier information.  This
dates waaay back to the 1992 architecture discussions.  That's how the
semantics were defined to be consistent with the rest of the Web and to
prevent unsafe posts from masquerading as links.

I don't know where you get that idea.  libwww and libwww-perl implemented
it exactly as I said.
