Actually, I'm not proposing making a change, just finding out how
compatible the IETF notion of a URI is with the use of a URI scheme
to represent abstract names with no retrieval semantics.  The answer
seems to be that it's not compatible.  For the record though, I don't
see how such a change would "conflict with the Web".
