My view is this:

(1) it is not possible to have any URI scheme for which retrieval is not 
meaningful.

(2) it may be the case for any particular URI that retrieval is or is not 
meaningful, regardless of URI scheme.

Rationale for (1):  For any given URI-scheme, it is possible to create a 
retrieval mechanism, thus:  create a network-accessible database that maps 
URI values of the scheme into network resource addresses (in whatever form) 
which can be used for retrieval.  (I don't claim it's scalable or practical 
on an Internet scale, just possible.  The idea here is to demonstrate that 
the form, or scheme, of a URI cannot prevent use of the URI for retrieval 
given a suitable infrastructure.)

I think (2) is self-evident (given (1)).

For just this reason, I think "feasibility" is the right word here.
