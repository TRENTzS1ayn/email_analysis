If you look you'll see a non-normative reference
to RFC 2550. It isn't necessary to add a separator between
year and the rest of the date to allow the date/time to be
expressed to arbitrary precision.

I didn't want to make RFC 2550 a normative reference, however,
because it's in that "special" Informational RFC category.
