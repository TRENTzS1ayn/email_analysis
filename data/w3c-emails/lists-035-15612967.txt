Entertaining and informative :-)

Ok... but the syntax in RFC2550 does stray a little beyond 4 (decimal) digit
years in the duri/tdb draft.

I still think pivoting around a simple separator - which could be absent in
dates between 0000 and 9999 would be simpler and cleaner.

Anyway... I guess I'll sleep soundly whether or not the date syntax is
revised... (and my children and... )

Thanks,
