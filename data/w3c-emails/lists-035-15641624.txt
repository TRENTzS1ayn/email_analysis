My initial reaction to the draft [1] was 'use tel', but the arguments 
there [2] (Section 2.7.1) seem to support using different schemes for 
different types of endpoints (e.g., tel, fax, modem).

Besides that and the multiple resource issue, it looks in the ballpark; 
I plan to make some comments, and thought that people here might as well.
