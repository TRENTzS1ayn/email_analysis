I'm a bit surprised by this; I had though that it was agreed that mailto 
specifically does not specify an action, but only identifies a mailbox; 
it's up to the consumer of the URI to determine what to do with it when 
it's dereferenced.

Where does it say this? The abstract says

    This memo specifies a URI (Universal Resource Identifier) scheme
    "sms" for specifying a recipient (and optionally a gateway) for an
    SMS message.

I'd think that identifying messages is best left to mechanisms like 
mid's.

I'd agree with that; one should say 'the person who uses the mailbox 
foo@bar.com'; e.g.,

[ foaf:mbox <foo@bar.com> ]
