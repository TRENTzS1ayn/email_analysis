mailto allows you to specify a subject, body, etc. in the query 
component, which is defined by 2396 as: "...a string of information to 
be interpreted by the resource." Considering other uses of queries, this 
seems to fit in nicely.

http://www.example.com/foo?bar=baz can identify the resource foo with 
the argument bar=baz, and it also affects the message sent when 
dereferencing the URI. mailto:bob@example.net?Subject=Make+Money+Now can 
cause a message with that subject to be sent when dereferenced, but it 
can also be used to locate a message in the mailbox.

sms uses a parameter to specify a body, which seems broken. This is one 
of the things I'll be commenting about.
