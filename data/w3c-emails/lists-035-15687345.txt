This touches on something that's been on my mind for a while.

If a query is "a string of information to be interpreted by the 
resource," isn't it the case that a URI with a query refers to a 
resource, rather than just identifies one? E.g., 
<http://www.example.com/foo?bar=baz> is a reference to the resource 
<http://www.example.com/foo>.

I.e., shouldn't the definition of URI-Reference (rather than URI) 
include not only fragments, but also queries?
