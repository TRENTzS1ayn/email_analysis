I agree that this is an error in RFC 2732, and should be
folded in when we merge RFC 2732 with RFC 2396. We would
need two independent interoperable implementations of
RFC 2732 (with ipv6 addresses), though.

Gr?goire,

This indeed appears to be an oversight, thanks. Larry Masinter is
thinking about
combining these two RFCs in their next update so this needs to go on his
list. 

Larry, do you agree? If so this should be added to the RFC errata page.
