[I noticed this pair of messages, one from Roy on WWW-tag@w3.org, the other 
from Mark on uri@w3.org.  to avoid cross-posting, I've continued this on 
the URI list only.]

I think Mark's observation here rather underscores Roy's point.  The 
"resource" identified by a mailto: URI would appear to be, in Roy's words, 
"a composition window with the following pre-filled attributes" rather than 
a mailbox.
