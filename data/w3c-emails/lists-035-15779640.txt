 From 2368 [1]:

    A mailto URL designates an "internet resource", which is the mailbox
    specified in the address. When additional headers are supplied, the
    resource designated is the same address, but with an additional
    profile for accessing the resource.

It goes on to say that typical use is to compose/send a message, but I 
couldn't find language that constrains mailto from being used for other 
purposes.

This being the case, I'd question whether anything is being redefined. 
If anything, supporting the view that mailto identifies a message would 
require revising 2368.

A reasonable interpretation may be that mailto's dereference function is 
the composition of a message; that doesn't preclude its use for other 
identifying purposes (although I think my original question re: multiple 
resources is valid, when as per above mailto clearly identifies a 
mailbox as a resource).
