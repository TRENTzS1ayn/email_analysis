 From what I can tell, this is that draft with perhaps some small 
changes, and an added author.

I'd like to see telephone-based URIs use the form proposed [1] by TBL; 
it's a much better integration with URIs. Unfortunately, because tel and 
fax are already out there, I doubt this will happen.

Another issue that I've brought up with the author is their use of a 
parameter to communicate the body; it would be better to follow in 
mailto's footsteps here and use a query arg, IMHO.
