I don't see how they conflict.

no?

No? It identifies the group of mailboxes consisting
of bob@example.org and mary@example.com.

Sure it does: it keeps the architecture clean
and simple. If we're not interested in finding
a clean, simple set of architectural rules
that are consistent with what goes on in
the Web, what are we doing here?

For example, one of the nifty side-effects of
the way URIs work is: if you don't recognize
a scheme, you can proxy it to an HTTP server.
mailto:bob@example.org,mary@example.com works
just fine in that case; it's very straightforward
to redirect to a form for composing mail to that
group of mailboxes, or for searching for mail
to that group of mailboxes, or whatever.

I elaborated on this somewhat in:
