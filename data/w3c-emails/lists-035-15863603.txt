Hi Jeremy,

Hmmm....

I think that you're changing the semantics of URI references as defined in
RFC2396, particularly section 4.2, same document references. I think your
answers would be correct only for those cases where the in-scope base URI
and the URI from which the document were retrieved are the same.

Regards

Stuart
