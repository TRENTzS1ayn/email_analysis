Paul,

It seems you're having trouble with Jeremy's attachment. Below I've
extracted a text copy that may help you understand my reponse.

Part of the context of Jeremy's question is consideration of xml:base and
the answers
he offers, the heading of the first column and the comment in his
rationale...

...all suggest that RDF/XML proposes to 'apply' an in-scope xml:base in
resolving same document references.

Regards

Stuart
