Hi,

I glanced through this and an uncomfortable thought occurred to me.  I 
think it's fairly clear that given two duri's that differ only in their 
date element, they may or may not denote the same thing depending upon 
other factors.  Thus, given Joshua's employment record, one might be able 
to infer that
   urn:tdb:2001:http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa
   urn:tdb:2002:http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa
do or do not denote the same person.

But, and this is where I get uncomfortable, to perform such inference one 
needs to look _inside_ the URI syntax, which seems to fly in the face of 
universality/uniformity of URIs used in this way.  In RDF/N3-speak, 
something more like this would seem to be more appropriate:

   [a :Person] :describedBy [a :Description ;
                             :dateAvailable "2001" ;
                             :homePage 
<http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa> ] .

Now, given an employment record, it seems much more comfortable to do the 
inference to determine if that above describes the same person as this:

   [a :Person] :describedBy [a :Description ;
                             :dateAvailable "2002" ;
                             :homePage 
<http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa> ] .
