Sure.  And that's not necessarily an inference I'd want to hardwire into an 
inference engine core.  (And I'm sure this will cause me a few problems 
before I'm done with it all.)

Based on:
   :p1 a :Person; :homePage <http://www.NineByNine.org>
and
   :p2 a :Person; :homePage <http://www.ninebynine.org>
alone, I'd be hard pushed to conclude :p1 and :p2 both denote the same person.

And then there's:
   :p2 a :Person; :homePage <http://www.%6eineby%6eine.org>
where does one draw the line?

Now, if the web page contained embedded RDF something like:
   <> daml:equivalent <http://wWw.NiNeByNiNe.OrG>
I _think_ I could then conclude that the homepage three URIs were 
equivalent:  the ones used to retrieve the page both being equivalent to 
the one named in the page.  In this way, equivalence of :p1 and :p2 becomes 
inferrable through mediation of the retrieval mechanism, which legitimately 
interprets the URI structure.
