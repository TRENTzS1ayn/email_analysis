At this point, it looks like we are all using different phrases
(not even sentences) in various specs to support different views.

My view is that an RDF resource should be something of MIME type XML,
and anything of MIME type XML that does anything with XML Base has to
interpret things the same way.  I would consider this an architectural 
issue, so maybe it's time this issue should be sent to the TAG.  (Two
of the three authors of RFC 2396 are on the TAG.)

The latter reading is inadequate, an error.  It should be read as "this representation."  So the type is known, and with it the semantics of #fragment references.  Without recourse to _even_ the URI from which it was recovered.  As Paul suggested.  For hyperlinks with goTo semantics, where the absolute URI equivalent of the reference is unnecessary, it is moot and therefore not defined.  The best available absolute reference (nearest to equivalent) would be base-ified using the URI from which this representation was recovered, but that question has no need and no standing in the case of following hyperlinks in browsing the same "recovered representation."  There is no general answer, absent a universal document type (see next).

So for RDF to apply the semantic constraint that a #fragment reference is equivalent to a given absolute URI -- within a representation which belongs to a type which by its type definition is bound to the constraints of the RDF model -- is entirely within the purview of the specification of the RDF model and the languages in which it is represented.

This is also violated by having some references take anyURI and others limited to IDREF in the same document.  The RDF restriction to absolute-URI-reference senses for fragment-URI-reference signs does not violate RFC-2396, at least.  This is just that the RDF model only admits of 'absolute' references.  So references in any syntax binding of the RDF model will only contain 'absolute' URI-references.
