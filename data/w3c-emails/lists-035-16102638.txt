Thanks for the further explanation.

I'm still concerned that there may be an architectural issue
insofar as RDF says how to resolve a relative URI reference 
consisting of only a fragment identifier.  

If RDF needs to treat rdf:about attribute values specially 
for its own reasons, then I'd say that RDF doesn't have to
identify the rdf:about attribute's type as a URI reference.
RDF can call the rdf:about attribute's value a string and
define its semantics.  

But once you call it a URI reference, I would think you are 
required to "inherit" all the defined behavior for such, and 
I'm still unconvinced that RDF should be able to define special 
interpretation for same-document references.  If this is the
direction the RDF WG wants to do, I think it would be best to
take this to the TAG where there are many more experienced
minds to consider this.

Folks copy the file from the web to their hard drive so they can work on it in a plane, and the uri changes to something like file:c:\temp\....rdf and this is really useless for rdf users.  Or folks wish to include RDF in say a message protocol where  there is no base uri of the document.

If the RFC 2396 processor has produced an absolute uri reference, it need do nothing.  If however, it is a same document reference, then, just as a browser will handle same document references specially, so does RDF.  It transforms the same document reference into an absolute URI according to an algorithm defined by the RDF specs.  The mimetype of an rdf document will be text/xml+rdf.  As far as xml base and rfc 2396 are concerned, this is application code over which they have no say.
