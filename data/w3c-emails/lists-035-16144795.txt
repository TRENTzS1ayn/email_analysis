Subject: Suspected error in RFC 2732


Hello,

As suggested on the RFC Errata page
<http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.html>
I report what I suspect to be an error in RFC 2732 which updates RFC
2396.

I suspect that 'uric_no_slash' set of characters has been forgotten
in the list of changes made to the URI generic syntax by RFC 2732.

Here is my line of argument:

Since:

    1. The set 'uric_no_slash' stands for "same as 'uric' BUT without
slash";

    2. The set 'uric' is defined as:

        uric          = reserved | unreserved | escaped

    3. Slash ("/") is part of 'reserved' set;

    4. Set of 'reserved' characters is modified in RFC 2732.

As a result, point (3) of section 3. in RFC 2732 should be:

   (3) Add "[" and "]" to both the set of 'reserved' characters and 
   the 'uric_no_slash' set:

      reserved      = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                      "$" | "," | "[" | "]"
      uric_no_slash = unreserved | escaped | ";" | "?" | ":" | "@" |
                      "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | "," | "[" | "]"

   and remove them from the 'unwise' set:

      unwise        = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "`"


Best regards
