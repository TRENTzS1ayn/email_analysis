Dear URI experts,

I have just submitted draft-w3c-i18n-iri-00.txt to the Internet Drafts
editor. This draft replaces draft-masinter-url-i18n-08.txt. It should be
published in a few hours/days. In the mean time it is available at
http://www.w3.org/International/2002/draft-w3c-i18n-iri-00.txt.

Based on discussions at the W3C Technical Plenary in February, and in
particular on input from Larry Masinter, we have made some changes in
the responsibilities for the Internationalized Resource Identifiers
(IRI) draft, as follows:

- The W3C I18N WG is taking on responsibility for carefully
   reviewing the current draft and bringing it to maturity for
   submission to the IESG.

- Larry is glad to step down as a co-editor, and Michel Suignard
   has volunteered to become a new co-editor. Many thanks to Larry
   for his work as co-author of many earlier versions of this document.

This has resulted in the name change. The document will still be handled
as an individual submission from the point of view of the IETF. We hope
to take this document to IETF/W3C Last Call in May, after some more work.

Please review draft-w3c-i18n-iri-00.txt and send comments to
w3c-i18n-comments@w3.org (publicly archived at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-i18n-comments/).


Regards,    Martin.
