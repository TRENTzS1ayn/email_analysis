A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: 'duri' and 'tdb': URN namespaces based on
dated URIs
Author(s): L. Masinter
Filename: draft-masinter-dated-uri-03.txt
Pages: 20
Date: 25-Apr-02

This document defines two namespaces of URNs, based on using a
timestamp with an (encoded) URI.  The results are namespaces in which
names are readily assigned, offer the persistence of reference that
is required by URNs, but do not require a stable authority to assign
the name.  The first namespace ('duri') is used to refer to URI-
identified resources as they appeared at a particular time.  The
second namespace ('tdb') is useful as a way of creating URNs that
refer to physical objects or even abstractions that are not
themselves networked resources.
The definition of these namespaces may reduce the need to define new
URN namespaces merely for the purpose of creating stable identifiers.

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.
