Larry,

I think this echoes a comment Al Gilman made, though I'll suggest a simpler 
solution.

I think the definition:
[[
    The meaning of a duri is "the resource (or fragment) that was
    identified by the <encoded-URI> (after hex decoding) at the very
    first instant of the date(time) given".

    For example, 'urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org' is a persistent
    identifier to 'http://www.ietf.org' as of the very first moment of
    the year 2001.  A duri may not be a resource locator in a practical
    sense, because the time of location has passed.  However, is an
    acceptable resource identifier, and fulfills all of the requirements
    for URNs [7].
]]

has some surprising consequences.  Imagine I publish a daily web journal, 
at http://dailynews.example.org/.  Intuitively, I think that

   urn:duri:20010429:http://dailynews.example.org/

should refer to the issue that was published some time on 29-April.  But 
according to your definition, it refers to a 28-April issue.

My suggested change is
[[
    The meaning of a duri is "the resource (or fragment) that was
    identified by the <encoded-URI> (after hex decoding) at the very
    last instant of the date(time) given".
...^^^^
