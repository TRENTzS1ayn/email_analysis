hello.

i have updated the internet draft specifying fragment identifiers for
text/plain resources. the draft's abstract reads:

"This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/plain resources.
These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to parts of a text
resource, identified by character count or range, line count or range,
or a regular expression. These identification methods can be combined to
identify more than one sub-resource of a text/plain resource."

you can find the draft in text and html form in the usual internet draft
archives (maybe after a one or two day delay) and at the following
locations:

http://dret.net/netdret/docs/draft-wilde-text-fragment-01.txt
http://dret.net/netdret/docs/draft-wilde-text-fragment-01.html

for a list of open issues regarding the draft, please refer to section 1 
of the draft. a change log describing the changes from previous versions 
can be found in section 7 of the draft.

any comments are very welcome.

cheers,
