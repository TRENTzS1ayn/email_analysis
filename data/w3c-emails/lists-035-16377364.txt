hello roy.

thanks for your comments.

pretty old, this one...

i agree that parser reuse is a good thing. and this is why i chose the 
scheme syntax, which has been introduced by xpointer (and is very likely 
to be accepted as a w3c recommendation) and which is currently being 
worked on in draft-borden-frag-00. however, i am not religious about 
this, and i could also live with the admittedly simpler syntax you proposed.

personally, i like the "traditional syntax" roy is voting for better 
than the "scheme-based syntax", but apart from escaping issues (which 
can be solved in both cases) it is mainly a matter of taste. and of 
guidelines, of course, iff draft-borden-frag-00 becomes the way how 
fragment iudentifiers will look in the future, then we should go with 
that option. any opinions?

cheers,
