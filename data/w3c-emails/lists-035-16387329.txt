I'd like to have a BCP RFC documenting the recent practise for new
fragment identification mechanisms like XPointer or as proposed in
XFrames to use some functional notations in the fragment identifier
just like

  document#xpointer(...)
  document#frames(...)
  document#xmlns(...)%20element(...)
  ...

'nntp' is less common, because most software allows the 'news' scheme to
refer to NNTP servers, just like

  news://nntp.example.org/

followed by either a message id or a news group name. 'news' is rather
common, though, but mostly on Usenet for obvious reasons.
