hello.

the problem here is that there is no such thing as a best current 
practice (at least that's my impression). xpointer and 
draft-borden-frag-00  use parantheses, while others are opposed to this 
syntax and prefer a simpler way of designing fragment identifiers (for 
example, see roy fielding's comment in the previous thread about 
"updated internet draft: 'URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/plain 
Media Type'" http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Aug/0004.html)

now, the question i have is: since there is no established current best 
practice, what should i do with my draft about text/plain fragment 
identifiers? should i wait until there is an established way of 
designing fragment identifiers (how long will this take)? should i 
choose roy's good old days syntax? or the more recent xpointer-syntax? 
any comments are very welcome, since i would like to make a choice and 
then stick with it.

cheers,
