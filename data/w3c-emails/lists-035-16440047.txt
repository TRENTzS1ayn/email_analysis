I would have thought that a _virtual_ file system would hide the unTar
application.

And that the VFS implementation of a file: URL would be ambiguous as to
where the unTar took place anyway.  The file path would drill right through
the level at which the directory was encoded for archiving without noticing,
and the remote archive server would either unTar to return the level addressed
in the file: URI or return a tuple of a tar archive of a directory
corresponding to an initial substring of the file: path and the residual path
that still had to be traversed after the recipient unTarred the archive.

Check out the various threads of work visible in the remote file access
activity in the Global Grid Forum,  Closest to Gnome is probably the work of
Micah Beck at Tennessee.
