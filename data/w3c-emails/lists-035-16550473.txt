> The XRI TC Comes to OASIS
> 
> A Call for Participation has been issued for the new OASIS Extensible
Resource Identifier Technical Committee (XRI TC). The purpose of this
committee is to define a URI (Uniform Resource Identifiers aka URL) scheme
and a corresponding URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace that can be used
to identify resources and share data across domains, enterprises, and
applications in a distributed directory.
