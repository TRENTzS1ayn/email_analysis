Hi again,
  Now that the documents have been published the IANA has setup the
nameservers and corresponding  mailing lists. Here are the subscription
instructions:

To subscribe to the urn.arpa submission list send mail to majordomo@urn.arpa
with no subject and the following as the body:

subscribe register

For the uri.arpa submission list, do the same thing but send it to
majordomo@uri.arpa.

Each list has a web archive:

http://www.iana.org/list-archives/register-uri/
http://www.iana.org/list-archives/register-urn/

After a few days for folks to get subscribed I expect registrants to begin
posting their NAPTR insertion requests....
