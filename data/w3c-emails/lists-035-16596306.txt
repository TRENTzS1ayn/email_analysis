I don't have much advice to offer; I think you've found what
documentation there is, and it's not much.

But I'd like to thank you for your thoughtfulness; a lot of people
just squat in URI scheme space without notifying anybody, as far
as I can tell.

I try to maintain an informal index of schemes...
  http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes
but I find it disheartening. It seems that I find a handful
of unregistered schemes every day. I feel obliged to note
the schemes here in uri@w3.org and invite the developers
to register their schemes, but I don't often get around to it.
Help with that sort of thing is much appreciated.

Hmm... here's a bit of advice: whatever you end up doing, please
write a one-page internet draft about it.
