Cross posting to uri mailing list. It seems to belong there...

Maybe the authors of 2396 can supply a clarification on this.

I agree that 2396 could be read in such a way that %25 stems from a
local character set and does not need to indicate the escaped char '%'.

However, I read 2396 in another way, namely, that the *intention* of
the authors was that lcoal characters with equivalences in US-ASCII need
to be %-encoded using US-ASCII octets. That would mean the % is
always encoded as %25 and that there is not other character which can
use %25 as encoding.

How can a server safely decode URIs otherwise (for example the query 
parameters
in http URIs)?
