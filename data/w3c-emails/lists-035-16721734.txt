This seems to contradict to RFC 2396, sections 2.1 and 3.
3, in particular, says:

   The URI syntax does not require that the scheme-specific-part have
   any general structure or set of semantics which is common among all
   URI.  

I read that to mean that http://www.bar.org/ and http://www.BAR.org/
may be equivalent where file://123abcdef and file://123ABCDEF might
not be, and that a reference to the definition of the http and file
URI schemes would be required to determine which semantics need be
applied.

In other words, the URI spec seems to say that semantic equivalence is
scheme specific and string comparison alone is not enough.
