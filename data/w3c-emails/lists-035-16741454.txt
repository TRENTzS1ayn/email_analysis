That's what I thought originally.  For namespace URIs, there's
potentially metadata about the namespace URI (RDDL, DDDS) which I'd like
to keep readily available as part of the bundle of information
representing a node. 

MOE is moving from a model with lots of copies of the same namespace URI
string to a model with very few copies of the same namespace URI
objects.  The URIs themselves are immutable, but the objects (will
eventually) cache metadata.
