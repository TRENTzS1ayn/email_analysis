An individual may reasonably prefer to emphasis the "be strict in what you
emit" side of the equation over the "be broad in what you accept" side.  

But URIs are not only emitted by the "owners" of sub-name-spaces in the overall
URI space.  URIs are to be used in third-party references as well, and here it
is not safe to assume we can attain enough come-lately canonicalization of the
spellings to keep consumers from having to process on the basis of established
equivalence patterns such as case insensitivity.

As a body convened, as the brain trust of a community where URIs are emitted
autonomously by many many actors, we don't have the choice to recommend one or
the other of these sides of the DRUMS principle.  We are simply not doing our
job if we fail to recommend both.

Classes in processing environments can support consumers of URIs just as much
as emitters.  Constructing a class which embeds some well-known
case-insensitivity equivalences is a standards-consistent thing to do and is
not to be dismissed out of hand.  Whether or not to do it depends on the costs
and benefits in the processing environment at hand.  That is not something we
need to, or could readily, agree on.
