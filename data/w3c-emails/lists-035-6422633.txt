You tell an awful story of a public trust being given to a commercial
entity and commercially exploited.    But because we (the community) have
badly managed this thing there is no reason to double the problem.
Let us do our utmost not to wring our hands over NSI's control but
to ensure as speedily and effectively that it be done well under ICANN.

Now this perverts the argument.  NSI may have "control" over the IETF in
that
it can charge IETF $100 for the use of the name "ietf.org".   NSI coulld
in principle (though at risk of a bloody revolution) try deleting ietf.org
if the IETF didn't pay, or just from malice or incompetence. But these are
unlikely scenarios. But otherwise, NSI has
no control over what IETF does with that space.
The IETF defines what document is identified by
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1234.txt

The IETF can, without any recourse to NSI or ICANN, set up (say) a MIME
type registry by defining (say)

http://www.w3.org/mime-types/application/xml

 to be a document defining the MIME type application/xml

This uses the DNS root in a very minor way, giving all control
of content to the IETF.  It has the advantage of using a
space which is everywhere dereferencable using a well known
protocol whose evolution is under IETF control.

You can of course define Content-type: to take as a parameter a URL relative
to http://www.w3.org/mime-types/, which leaves it as a first class object
(anyone can play with one) with a short form for those types which have
passed muster at the IETF.

I wouldn't suggest DNS names by themselves, but http space is much more
appropriate.
specially when poulated with XML, it allows much more flexible control

Here you confuse the control NSI has in registering the "ietf.org" name with
the control the IETF has with its contents.  This is a bit like saying that
the state of Massachusetts controls my car.  I used their space to register
it, but I control its contents and direction!

The balance between experimentation and standardization is a crucial
part of our world.  The methods we have used to strike a compromise
up till now have involved "x-" and either "ignore what you don't understand"
or "panic at what you don't understand". Neither of these is strong enough
for the future. We must have private experiments (or local use)
and standards, and have both well defined. For this, the languages must
be first class objects, so we have free expression coupled with an
explict system of review and endorsement.

Each group then sets up a standards process for its area of interest.
One should recognise, however, that developers of a spec which
references a list of specs should not always assume that their own
process will be the only one which will
W3C's XML references a set of namepsaces. There is no assumption
that all namepsaces to achieve standards status must pass though the W3C.
To make such an assumption would put a bottleneck on development.
So, a namepsce is a identified by a URI.  This doesn't stop us setting
up, later, a "better namespaces bureau" which endorses namespaces which
have gone though some general standards track.

There is an imputation of "semantics" on other URIs which is a political
statement not a technical one, an derrogation of other URIs to leave
a niche for URNs.  In so doing, the set of identifiers is split into
two, and hence the web is split into two.

Well, no, when you make a syntax deliberately different
just to make a point you also make a technically messy system.

It is not an "engine" in as much as an insitutional commitment by the
party owning the URI - with any URI, http:  or some "URN" scheme.

You cannot make stability out of syntax.

The rules can be applied to URIs just as well.  You cannot enfore uniqueness
wiith syntax either.

Let those who would tackle these problems do so for their own
web sites, establishing a persistence policy and a contractual
commitments which allow URIs to be trsuted as persistent.

Trying to sum up my concerns about the whole URN development:

1. It is based on a lack of society to currently to support the
  facilities for persistence (including soft redirection) in HTTP.
2. The lack of URN dereferencing protocol may lead to a reinvention of HTTP,
  with consequent unnecessary and serious complication of the web;
3. The suggestion that URNs will solve the persistence problem is
 causing serious archive maintainers to ignore their duty of persistence
 while "waiting for URNs", and thus making the problem much worse.
4. The actual registry of URN names is in fact more or less at the
  "/etc/hosts" stage, and has yet to reinvent the hierarchical structure of
  DNS and the social structrue of ICANN
 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt
5. In this "waiting", web sites fail to learn to use HTTP redirects properly
 (eg http://www.isi.edu/div7/iana/)  and browsers fail to distinguish a
  "found" lookup and a "moved" redirection, making understanding of the
semantics
  of HTTP in the community worse.
