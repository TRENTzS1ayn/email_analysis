               I apologize for the intrusion.  If this is something that you may not be 
Interested in, then I will never send you another e-mail.

I am associated with an international debt free US company that has launched a new technology based division.  Our company is strategically aligned with high profile companies, such as: Netscape, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Qwest and IBM. We are working to make technology simple and available to every home. 

We are currently conducting a search to identify individuals, like yourself, who may be interested in an E-Commerce business venture.  Individuals can partake in this business venture with our company on either a part-time or full-time basis. 

The major skills that we are looking for are: good communications skills, teaching, coaching, leadership and facilitating abilities.  We are not looking for salespeople; we are looking for leaders!  We have a terrific Support Group that will also help you to take your current skills to a much higher level.

With the tremendous growth of the Internet and E-Commerce, now is the time to consider starting your own business.  As E-Commerce grows from the $10 billion business it is today to over $1 trillion in the next 3 years, why not grab a piece of this lucrative business area for yourself!

We currently have a Development Team traveling to major cities to interview successful candidates to join our tremendous company.  For more information, I can be reached by e-mail.  If you wish to speak to me directly, please send me your telephone number and I will promptly call you to provide more details on this exciting and rewarding opportunity. 

Best regards,

Mark Janowak
