Hello Dan,

I think you confused something. Leaving out the extension
is not the same as using a directory.

For example, you can have
   mydocument.html
and
   mydocument.pdf
as files, and serve them both for
   .../mydocument
choosing the right one depending on content negotiation.


Regards,   Martin.
