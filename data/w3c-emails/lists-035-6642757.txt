God help us, but there now seem to be two URI lists.  This seems not only
redundent but potentially destructive.

The W3C seems exactly the right place for these discussions to be carried
forward and archived.  Could we agree to annoint that list as The Place
(tm), or is there actually reason to divide the topic space?
