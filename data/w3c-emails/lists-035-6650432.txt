Where the mailing list is run doesn't matter at all for the IESG. So, 
it is neither better, nor worse to run it at W3C.

Regarding two lists, you might mix up the URN-discussions list and 
the URI discussion list. Both lists were hosted at Bunyip, but thy 
are still different. They are both belonging (or was regarding the 
URI mailing list) to IETF working groups.
