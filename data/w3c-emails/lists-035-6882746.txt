Let's face it.  The set of resources which are infinitely stable is
uninterestingly small.  The practical requirement is to be able to share
assertions characterizing the stability of a resource.  Any assertion of
stability extending into the future is an estimate, subject to change at a
later date.  This in itself means that scheme syntax is an unfortunate way
to discover the stability of a resource.  One doesn't want to have to
migrate a resource between schemes just because of an erratum.  There are a
variety of ways to associate such assertions with a resource.  Catalog
services are one way, embedded references to a configuration management
(effectivity) database is another.  Yet another is "expires" information
distributed as attached metadata (Headers) with the recovered instance of
the resource.  It makes more sense to encode this as instance particulars
than by some structural distinction in the URI scheme. 

Stability is of interest in creating replication policies and operating
cache/replica services.  It is also of interest in terms of the internals
of a resource such as "for how long is this price quote good?" which is
unlikely to be reflected in the URI of the quote page.

The gross features of the scheme should be reserved for information that is
more frequently of immediate concern to the end-user of the URI.  The
performance characteristics of URI schemes do not line up well will with
the performance requirements that go with stability or effectivity
information.

"How long is this information good?" is a question which is more often
going to be asked after reading the information itself, as opposed to
before reading.
