This is the latest compromise within the IPNG working group
(which defined the syntax for IPv6 addresses) and the attempt
to embed IPv6 addresses within URLs. Note that it proposes
amending the URI draft standard to allow "[]" in a URL for the
reserved purpose of enclosing an IPv6 URL.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the IPNG Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Preferred Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's
Author(s): B. Hinden, B. Carpenter, L. Masinter
Filename: draft-ietf-ipngwg-url-literal-03.txt
Pages: 4
Date: 16-Sep-99

This document defines the preferred format for literal IPv6 Addresses
in URL's for implementation in World Wide Web browsers.  This format
has been implemented in the IPv6 versions of several widely deployed
browsers including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.
It is also intended to be used in the IPv6 version of the service
location protocol.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipngwg-url-literal-03.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
