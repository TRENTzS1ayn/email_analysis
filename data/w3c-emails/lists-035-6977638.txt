I don't think the IESG 'last call' was forwarded to this list;
draft revision -03 differs from -02 primarily by responding
to my 'last call' comment in being explicit about updating
RFC 2396.


attached mail follows:

The IESG has received a request from the IPNG Working Group to consider
Preferred Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's
<draft-ietf-ipngwg-url-literal-02.txt> as a Proposed Standard.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by September 28, 1999.
