Some comments:

- Preferred format: It should be explained what exactly this means.
  Usually, there is no need for more than one format.

- "It defines a syntax for IPv6
   addresses and allows the use of "[" within a URI explicitly for this
   reserved purpose."
  I guess ']' should be mentioned here, too.

- [] are moved to reserved. Does this mean that in other parts
  of the URI (reference), they can also be used that way?
  There are proposals to use [] e.g. in the fragment identifier
  syntax for XML http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr. There may be
  several legacy issues here.


Regards,   Martin.
