Here is a conference relevant to the URI list.
Despite the title, the program seems to be mostly about metadata.
The subtitle says it better.

"<names, numbers and networks> Washington DC Conference"
Washington DC Conference

(http://www.indecs.org/news/washington.htm)

Metadata, Intellectual Property and E-Commerce - the Way Ahead   

Overview 

This special one-day event is a follow up to the July conference in
London (http://www.indecs.org/news/conference.htm#7-8 July) where
technical issues were under discussion. The Washington Conference aims
to communicate the work of <indecs> to US delegates. And it will
announce significant developments that have taken place since the London
conference.

Presentations focus on an intended launch of a permanent international
consortium to oversee the development of content identifiers and
associated metadata. These link to information about the proposed
<indecs> standards. Details will include some of the Requests for
Proposals to be issued by the consortium in the future. All initiatives
are intended to support electronic commerce in intellectual property.

Leading speakers from different content and technology sectors have
agreed to take part. Keynote speeches will be delivered by Cary H.
Sherman, Senior Vice-President and General Counsel of the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Dr. Leonardo Chiariglione of
Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni (CSELT), the convenor of the
MPEG standardisation process. Other industry speakers will explain how
these metadata and related developments will enable and promote
e-commerce and resource management in intellectual property.

Although of particular interest to commercial organisations, the
conference is also highly relevant to libraries, archives, museums and
other cultural bodies which have to deal with the identification and
management of intellectual property for any reason.
