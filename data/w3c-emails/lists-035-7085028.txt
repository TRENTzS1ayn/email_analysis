Agreed.  We were a little careless in our terminology (as others also
pointed out), and I just haven't gotten around to revising the drafts.

I don't have a problem with URL-schemes that have URN-like semantics,
since there are enough of them already (cid, news, etc.). I think the
wording (saying that lid URLs are URNs) probably needs to change, since
it just adds confusion.
