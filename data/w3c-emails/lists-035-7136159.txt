Philipp,

Yes, I did forward the current "tv:" spec to the IESG shortly after my last
posting.  So they are working on it.

If we have some consensus around "lid:" as well, I'll certainly forward that
too.

Dan,

i think that at least the "tv:" scheme seems to be ready to be
forwarded to the IESG for adoption - what do you think ? There
was not much discussion last time you did an update, so maybe it's
time to wrap this up.
