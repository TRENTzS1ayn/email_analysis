    Where is the latest specification for the "tv:" scheme?  I'm new to =
    this
    list, so apologize if this is documented elsewhere.  What I have seen =
    on w3
    was just a draft of a proposal with some unfinished areas such as tying =
    in
    to ATSC, DVB, etc SI specifications.  Scientific-Atlanta is using our =
    own
    version of a "tv:" like URL scheme so we'd like to contribute to the
    specification and abide by the standard.
