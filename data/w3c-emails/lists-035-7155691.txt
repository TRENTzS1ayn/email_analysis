Where is the latest specification for the "tv:" scheme?  I'm new to this 
list, so apologize if this is documented elsewhere.  What I have seen on w3 
was just a draft of a proposal with some unfinished areas such as tying in 
to ATSC, DVB, etc SI specifications.  Scientific-Atlanta is using our own 
version of a "tv:" like URL scheme so we'd like to contribute to the 
specification and abide by the standard.

thanks
Dean

Dan,

i think that at least the "tv:" scheme seems to be ready to be
forwarded to the IESG for adoption - what do you think ? There
was not much discussion last time you did an update, so maybe it's
time to wrap this up.
