Yay, Ray!

Yes, this list needs to chew on this question.

First step is to set aside the question "Which is right, a) or b)" and
substitute the question:  

With regard to the question "compare and contrast: URI, URL, URN,"  what
are the points of general agreement and where are the distinctions which
generate more disagreement?

There are three U-words associated with URIs, in descending order of
agreement rating:

Uniform -- Use RFC xxxx syntax to avoid collisions
Universal -- Attempt to get "all" resources to share collision-free namespace
Unique -- Honor system, but pretty good results so far (lack of actual
spoofing attacks, etc.)

Next letter is R.  There is reasonable agreement that the URI discipline,
does little and intends to do little to define what a resource can be that
has a URI.  Note this works against the 'universal' goal above, because if
you don't know where to stop pushing for conformance, you never know how
well you are doing.

Third letter is I, for Identifier.

This is where the DC "encoding scheme" question hits.

What does Dublin Core need, operationally, in terms of 'identification' in
order to ensure effective operation?  It is possible that the incumbent
theory or class definition for "encoding scheme" is too strong or
restrictive, relative to what is actually required.

Cautionary Note: In terms of validating requirements for the performance of
identifiers, it is necessary to include the fallback to multi-trait
identification from single-trait identification in applications.

The Storage Resource Broker project at SDSC eventually abandoned the idea
of an identifier (i.e. a one-trait sufficient key) as persistent
identification for objects, and operates on the basis of a tuple or pattern
of traits as a sufficient-for-identification key.  This may be the general
answer in the large.  Identifiers are shortcuts and they usually work; to
be sure, refine the identification expression [a.k.a. query] until a unique
referent is returned.


Theory Note:  URIs form a namespace.  However, it is a namespace which is
intentionally weak in consistency of encoding.  A rather weak supertype
within the class of names.  This is why a declarative theory of names (what
propositions hold on what subspaces) is likely to be at least helpful if
not necessary in resolving this question.  [The declarative theory can, in
turn assert that the only reliable semantics are operational...]

Process Note:  Has there been any resolution to the alleged issue between
BICI and URI?
