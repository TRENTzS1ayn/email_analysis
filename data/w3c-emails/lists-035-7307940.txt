According to 2396 and my personal experience its legal. From the ABNF:

absoluteURI   = scheme ":" ( hier_part | opaque_part )
hier_part     = ( net_path | abs_path ) [ "?" query ]
abs_path      = "/"  path_segments
path_segments = segment *( "/" segment )
segment       = *pchar *( ";" param )
pchar         = unreserved | escaped |
                      ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

Which means that pchar says that an unencoded ':' is fine in
the path segment...

Yep. I've seen that used before. The PDI URN space uses it...

From my reading, yes...

BTW, now that there is a URN registration process would it be to much
trouble to have this one registered? It just needs a short RFC on what
the space is and how its managed. See RFC 2611....
