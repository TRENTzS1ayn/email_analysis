Hi Michael, thanks for your fast reply. I'm glad to hear that you think
we'll be able to use colons in our URLs without escaping them, which in
turn allows us to cleanly embed our URNs into URLs for HTML and other
single-URL and URN unaware apps (Web browsers, in particular!).

Leslie has also suggested that we register the Web3D URN, which I'll do
this month. Do you think it makes sense to include the URN embedded in
URL examples (such as those below), or just the URN syntax/usage in our
registration RFC?

Best regards,
Aaron
