Dear URN / URI list members,
I'd appreciate very much your comments and advise for the purpose of this
attachment.
This is already a "draft of a draft", so please excuse me for some possible
naive errors already on it...

Many thanks in advance!
Regards,
Jos? Borbinha

PS: I did A LOT of plagiarism from RFC 2648 - "A URN Namespace for IETF
Documents"..., for which I didn't get the permission from its author, Ryan
Moats. I've been trying to contact him, but it looks that his email has
problems. I've been receiving from his mail server:
"550 <jayhawk@att.com>... User unknown ????"
Any help with Ryan's contact will be also welcome...
