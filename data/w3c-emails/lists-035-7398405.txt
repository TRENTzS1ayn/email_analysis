Howdy,

This is perhaps a good time to point out that there is a maximum
length of URIs.  Whether it's de jure (can't find the reference just
this minute) or de facto, URIs of longer than 255 characters will cause 
problems.  Which sort of argues for the URN:OID proposal from Michael 
Mealling, of the 3 you have outlined, since (apart from anything else) 
the ones with "human readable" components seem capable of being quite 
expansive.
