Hi Martin...

No problem; I've been calling this the "URL+URN combo" informally for
lack of imagination on my part:

 
http://www.web3dmedia.com/UniversalMedia/URNs_in_URLs/Colons_in_URIs_Legal_(rfc2396).txt

It's the combination of a URL and URN, which I'm now comfortable
recommending to Web3D and MPEG based on feedback from you and Michael
Mealling when I asked if this was legal per rfc2396. We needed a way to
place URNs inside of URLs, which seems straightforward enough based on
the document above.

Regards,

Aaron
