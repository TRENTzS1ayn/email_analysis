Since you ask about chinese language domain names,
I thought you might be interested in
(but most on this list may have known already ?):

http://www.idns.org
http://www.idns.org/ietf
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-oscarsson-i18ndns-00.txt

which are ietf related initiatives to get 
i18n-domain names standardised.

Am I right to infer that the W3C work here at the Interest Group
sits on top of the idns layer and therefore
is very much dependent on the ietf effort moving forward ?
(at least the internationalistion part of the URI activity here)
