Martin, I think your suggestion is very reasonable, but I don't think it's
the standard way most webservers are configured today.  In Apache, turning
on Multiviews functionality seems to enable what we're looking for:

If this is a good way to implement Cool (read: permanent) URLs (and it
appears to be), than I think Tim's document should recommend MultiViews (and
equivalent) by name.  Most web content hosters do not support this feature
today, and customers won't be able to demand it unless they can ask for it
by name.

Of course, since content negotiation is not yet widely supported in
browsers, this will most likely serve HTML and GIFs, but it still achieves
much better URL permanence than /some/dir/foo.html.

Hello Dan,

I think you confused something. Leaving out the extension
is not the same as using a directory.

For example, you can have
   mydocument.html
and
   mydocument.pdf
as files, and serve them both for
   .../mydocument
choosing the right one depending on content negotiation.


Regards,   Martin.
