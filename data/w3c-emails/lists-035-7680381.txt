Which means that an internal general entity doesn't care what
the Base is since it doesn't define by identifying but by
explicit value, right?

Why do internal entities care what the Base is?

I would suggest an alternate: external entities require an absoluteURI
as their system identifier... but I know how popular that probably is...

IMHO, nothing. It should be considered a parsing error. 
Situations like this (at least to me) seem artificial and
dangerous. To have a spec like XMLBase tear itself apart trying
to fix something like this instead of declaring it a syntax
error is the wrong thing to do.

My suggestion of external entities requiring absoluteURIs 
sounds much cleaner and less error prone. If people are
worrying about 'document portability' then might I suggest
they look at location (network node) independent URIs.

We didn't consider that case because it really wasn't an issue
for URIs but for applications that are defining complex
documents. I.e. its not URI problem, its an XML problem. 
If XML wants to define something where Bases are
defined on a tag by tag basis then fine. If it then wants
to allow nested documents then XML must figure out
whether or not definitions pass into such nested blocks.

2396 doesn't and should never define a document model (IMHO
it should have never defined relative URIs and fragments but
I lost that debate).

If it did then that's probably a mistake in 2396...

I think its a mistake to read 2396 as though it has some type of
document model in mind. No one ever thought in those terms and,
at least in my mind, the mention of documents and such were
for pedagogical reasons only. If I remember correctly the 
use of the term 'entity' in 2396 is in no way related to how 
XML or SGML use the term. By 'entity' we simply meant "some generic
thing in the metaphysical sense", not some syntactic element somewhere.

You got 'em. I doubt if they were what you wanted though...
