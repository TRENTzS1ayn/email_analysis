Not to my way of thinking.  The idea of "encapsulated entity" in
section 5.1.2 of RFC 2396 is not really parallel to external
entities--if anything, it is more similar to internal entities.

XML external entities are separate resources with their own
URI by which they are retrieved, and some (most?) resources that
are, at times, processed as XML external entities can, in fact, 
be read/parsed/treated as an XML document entity themselves at
other times.
