There seems to have been some confusion about internal entities.
The main reason I mentioned them in my original mail is that
they are mentioned in the core sentence in question.
But of course some base can apply to internal entities, e.g.
in the following case:

<!ENTITY  entityName  "&lt;a href='link.xml'&gt;That's the 
question.&lt;/a&gt;">

(hope I got the escaping right) or in the following case:

<!ENTITY  entityName  "link.xml">

It's pretty much straightforward that the base uri (xml:base or other)
should extend into external entities, except for the case of internal
entities defined in external entities :-(.

Regards,    Martin.
