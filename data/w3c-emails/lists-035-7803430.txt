[Larry responded]

I disagree. RFC 2396 does not define 'equality' rules for
URIs because there are NO context-independent equality rules.

HTTP is a context, and the equality rules defined in RFC 2616 (HTTP)
only apply for the purposes of use within HTTP, e.g., for deciding whether
two cached entries refer to the 'same' resource.

There was never any intention that the equivalence rules in RFC 2616
would automatically apply to any other context for URIs.

Larry
