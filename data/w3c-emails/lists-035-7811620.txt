There are really two questions here:

* What is the basic URI comparison rule that any URI
  parser can use regardless of URI scheme etc.? This
  is the context-independent equality rule

* What are the comparison rules for various components
  of a URI like the authority, the scheme, etc.? These
  are the context-dependent equality rules

The former is case-sensitive (or octet by octet) comparison, the latter
are specific rules for dealing with URI hierarchy, escaping of characters
etc.

Note that none of the rules are in any way defined by semantics associated
with HTTP but rather semantics and properties associated with URI syntax
directly (hierarchy, escaping) or the URI spaces the URIs belong to (case
insensitivity of DNS names etc.) This is also reflected in all URI parsers
that I know of as they in fact implement these rules without being tied to
HTTP in any way.

Because there is no link between the equality rules and HTTP, there is no
difference between when HTTP wants to compare URIs and other
specifications want to compare URIs and it therefore doesn't make sense to
define different rules for comparison when the comparison in fact doesn't
depend on the context (HTTP, or other specs).
