(reply to message on URI@w3.org, suggest the discussion of I18N of
domain names continue on idn@ops.ietf.org).

URI internationalization and DNS internationalization should be related,
but it's not clear which way to think about the dependency.

The examples given in "Today's Situation" at
 http://www.idns.org/ietf/IETF46.James/IDNS-James.Seng_files/frame.htm

give two examples where the problem is I18N of other parts of
the "URL" than the domain name (e.g. duerst@w3.org instead of
d?erst@w3.org.)

However, the IDN group is focused on the domain name only.

It's interesting that it works! The question is whether it should.
