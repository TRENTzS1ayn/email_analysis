IURIs are definitely assumed to be normalized. I just sent out an anouncement
of an I-D I put together, to help the IETF adopt normalization.

Well, that depends on which platform you are on, what languages you want
to care about, and so on. Normalization is designed so that in most
cases, you don't actually have to do something.

I suggest that you create a good bunch of test cases, and check them
for normalization e.g. with http://www.w3.org/International/charlint/,
or that you tell us more about the circumstances of your work.
But if this is about normalization, maybe it would be better to
move the discussion to the lists I have indicated in the normalization
I-D.
