Better even:
http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/idn-charter.html
http://www.imc.org/idn/ (the mailing list archive)

This mailing list is hosted by the W3C (because the older host had
to give up and because of course the Web needs URIs). However,
there is currently no formal W3C URI or Addressing Activity nor
a formal W3C Interest Group for URIs.

Also, IURIs don't sit on top of idns. Ideally, they will be
closely coordinated, but there other examples (see e.g.
IMAP URIs,  RFC 2192) where for various reasons, the URI
encoding of non-ASCII characters and the encoding in the
actual protocol are different.
