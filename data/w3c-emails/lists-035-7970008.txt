I would like to make the readers of this mailing list aware of the
fact that

XML Base (XBase)

http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase

is currently in Last Call (up to March 2000).

This defines something similar to the HTML base element for
XML. An attribute xml:base can be added to any element to
changed the base for links in a scoped way.

Any comments are apreciated and should be directly sent to
www-xml-linking-comments@w3.org.


Regards,   Martin.
