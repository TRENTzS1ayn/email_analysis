I'll be happy to be enlightened by someone more DC-mainstream;  pending that,
here's my explanation (in the context of the current discussion):  Say that a DC
metadata element needs to identify a resource, for example, say it's the
'relation' element, where you indicate both a relationship (e.g. 'replaces') and
what resource the resource-under-description bears this relationship to. You have
to identify the resource, so you need a resource identifier. Quote from DC:

(begin quote)
-------------------------------
Qualifiers for 'Relation':

   Element Refinements:
        Is Version Of
      Has Version
      Is Replaced By
      Replaces
      Is Required By
      Requires
      Is Part Of
      Has Part
      Is Referenced By
      References
      Is Format Of
      Has Format

   Encoding Scheme:
      URI
------------------------------
(end quote)

So for example say you want to identify the resource by "isbn", this presumes that
there will be a URI scheme for 'isbn'.  So DC uses the term "encoding scheme" in
this context to mean simply that the resource identifier will be sufficiently
self-identifying that you can tell what kind of identifer it is. And we presume
that the URI encoding scheme is sufficient for this purpose.

I'm not sure I should  respond to this assertion, on this (public) list,
so I'll save it for the AC meeting.

Sorry, I wasnt' clear. I'm not suggesting that anyone at all thinks that
persistent (vs. not persistent) is not an important distinction.  I'm suggesting
that some people don't think that this distinction is embodied in the URL vs.URN
distinction.

This certainly reflects my view.

I would be happy (or at least happier) if there were a document that listed the
relevant RFCs (and permitted the reader to determine by inference that a given RFC
is  irrelevant, out-of-date, still experimental, etc.) and told you which RFC to
look at to solve a given problem.  But it should be an *authoritative* document
(not just someone's private web page, or some *informal* W3C page).

And no, it should not be updated for new URI schemes, and yes, it is not good to
try to say "everything" in a single document.

Our views differ here.  Your's seems to be: determine which shemes are going to be
the winners, then register them;  the reason for the intertia is that we haven't
quite figured out which. Our  view is: there are many potential schemes; we won't
know which are going to be winners without some shakedown process, including
registering some that ultimately won't survive, so let's get started registering
schemes, see which are deployed, which become popular, and which ones vendors
support -- the reason for the intertia is the confusion over how to register the
schemes.

Ok, I'll look at it again.

I'm sure you know as much as I do about this. The IETF can't simply write an RFC
registering ISBN as a URI scheme because of the proprietary aspects of ISBN, even
though there is an RFC that describes this hypothetical scheme. It is up to the
ISBN Agency to decide that they want ISBN registered, and (according to Leslie
dagle, in response to my original posting to the DC list) they're exploring it.
Problem is, they seem to have been "exploring" it for a very long time.  I don't
know what the legal/business consideration are.

Thanks for your comments on this, Martin.     --Ray
