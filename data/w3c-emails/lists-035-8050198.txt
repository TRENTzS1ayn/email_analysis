Howdy,

Please indulge me as I reply to a bunch of the messages in this
thread in one message -- I had mail failure earlier in the week,
and am just catching up.

An interesting characterization of current views on the issue; my
personal thought is that, probably as a result of the (in the end)
irreconcilable difference of opinion as to whether one wants/can
have a distinction between addresses and names, the situation
evolved from a) into c), where 

c) URN is well-defined: there is a URI scheme, URN:, which
   does aim to fulfill many of the goals laid out in the
   original URI documentation.  It is not the only
   scheme that does -- persistence, etc, may well be
   characteristics sought/provided by others.  

Thus, hdl: is _not_ a URN, although it can be one or both of:

1. a URI scheme that provides many (perhaps all) of the
   characteristics originally required for hypothetical URNs,
   and

2. a URN: namespace (i.e., carried in URNs).

In my experiences talking with various communities that have
differing needs of identifiers, it has become clear that "applicability"
documents are an issue.  However, I don't think that's in the
purview of the IETF (or probably the W3C, although I'm less familiar
with its scope) to produce -- the IETF can produce a document that,
for example, lays out the types of subdelegation possible for
resolution of URNs, but only repository management specialists,
hardware/software developers, and other interested communities
can determine if the characteristics provided fulfill _their_ 
definitions of persistence, etc.  I'm not entirely sure how to bridge
the gap.

I really believe this should be a pointer to the IANA registry:

http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/url-schemes

It is, after all, their job to keep this up to date.

There will, presently, be a similar page for URN namespaces.

So,

Have a look at the IANA registry, and see what you think is missing.

Personally, I think the data is there, but the information isn't getting
out to the desired audience, presumably (at least in part) because
they aren't familiar with IETF/IANA/W3C documentation & processes.
My concern with this is that I'm not sure they should have to have
this familiarity -- just haven't found the way around it yet.

Leslie.
