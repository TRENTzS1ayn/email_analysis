Both the "one" and the "both", of "one or both", trouble me.

For the "one" scenario: thus the handle folks (CNRI) need to decide whether to
register hdl: as a URI scheme or a URN namespace.  Assuming that hdl fulfils
the characteristics of a URN, on what basis do they make this choice?  And
let's say they decide to register it as a URN namespace, and then another
company develops a scheme that similarly meets the URN characteristics but
registers it as a URI scheme. Won't this cause confusion?

For the "both" scenario: I'm afraid I don't understand how it could be
registered as both; or, I suppose I understand *how* it could, but not *why*.
