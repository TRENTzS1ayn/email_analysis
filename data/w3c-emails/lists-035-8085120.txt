Since Ray is obviously concerned, I'd suggest we invite him to
participate.

I just mean that http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html is
messy, is missing important information, is hard to read, and that
if http://www.w3.org/Addressing/ were clearer, then maybe Ray wouldn't
say "the meaning of "URI" is clearly the subject of pervasive confusion."

Sorry, you're right. It came after all of the listings of 5 years
of history of events in the architectural domain, under the heading
of "Research Notebook", so I missed it. I kind of expected something
about URIs to be part of the Architecture of the web, and not just
a Research topic.

Please don't tell me that you have fallen into the common practice
of confusing "popular" with "good".

I mean that the diagram shows that there might be part of the URN
namespace that doesn't fit within the URL syntactic space.

Yes, of course. The problem is the leap from encouraging a behavior
to designing systems that only work if the behavior is universal.
It would be great if URLs didn't change, and of course you should
encourage it. It's unfortunate, though, that using URLs for namespace
identifiers and other permanent architectural elements _requires_
URLs that don't change.

I don't mind the guidelines at all, they're great. It's just not
robust to have the architecture somehow rely on them always being
followed.

I'm not at all trying to minimize the utility of this list! I think
it's great! I just think that we should have a little more effort
in getting it into shape, being careful about the status of things,
getting some clarity on the elements that are marked with "???", and
distributing the editorial authority over the contents.

I don't just mean adding new URL schemes, I mean being more systematic
about annotating the schemes that are there, being clearer about their
status, implementation, compliance with various standards and guidelines,
or utility.  I'm willing to spend some effort on this, but I'd like
some other folks to join in, and make sure that there was general agreement
(or at least to document those things for which there's some disagreement.)

I was thinking we would follow the normal procedure for W3C working
groups, complete with member involvement and invited experts. The
only distinction is that this would be a relatively low level activity.
