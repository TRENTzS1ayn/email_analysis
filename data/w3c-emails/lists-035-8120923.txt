I'm not sure what you mean by "disarray" but the vast majority
of the W3C web site is "personal opinion without critical review."

Yes, there is; the link text is
Naming and Addressing (URIs)

Are we looking at the same page? The one I'm looking at has
last revised $Date: 2000/04/13 20:33:14 $ by $Author: hoschka $

No? Why not? By google's unbiased metrics
(cf http://www.google.com/why_use.html), it's the
2nd most relevant page in the Web to the query "URL introduction"

http://www.google.com/search?q=URL+introduction&num=10&meta=hl%3Den%26lr%3D

It is a fact that each URN, for example,
urn:abc:def
fits within the URL syntactic space. I don't understand what you
mean by "continued confusion". Please explain in detail.

We're completely aware that companies change their domain names;
but we maintain that it's cost-effective to maintain the old addresses
rather than to break the incoming links.

There are likely to be reasonable exceptions, but the Web
could hardly suffer from a few more webmasters keeping
this guideline rather than breaking incoming links
for no good reason.

Again, like most of the W3C web site, it's maintained
in an ad-hoc fashion, yes. But it's useful to me and
at least a few other people, and I have never seen
anything elsewhere in the Web that gives this
information, so I keep it around.

There's a standing invitation:

"If you know of any that aren't here, please tell me via the relevant
forums."

By all means, if you have contributions to the page,
send them here (to uri@w3.org).

Well... given that we do this maintenance already, more or
less, I'm interested in the possibility of more involvement from
the W3C membership; I haven't managed to make a good case for it yet.
A quarterly teleconference is an interesting idea, but I don't
see obvious criteria for membership; do you have something in
mind?
