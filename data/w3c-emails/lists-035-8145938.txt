No, it presumes that there will be an URI for each item that can
be identified by an isbn number.

As for status of RFCs, there is an RFC or some list that's
continually updated to document this. Of course, this is
the 'official' status, which is sometimes different from
the actual status.

No, not exactly. Before you start using a scheme, PLEASE register it!
Don't use unregistered schemes.

No, the main reason is that there is no police that hands
out fines if you use an unregistered scheme, and that many
people think that somebody else could do the work.

Would be interesting to know more. I'm not a lawyer, but below are a
few guesses.

Is the problem that the string 'ISBN' is protected e.g. as a trade mark?
Trademark law doesn't forbid you to speak about things that have trade
marks.

I'm also sure that many library systems use ISBNs internally in some form,
and pass them over the network. Defining an URI for them is just an extension
of this practice, to a 'somewhat larger' network. It would be strange
if the ISBN agency could forbid (or would want to forbid) the use of
ISBN numbers on computers or networks.

The IETF has similar examples of third-party registrations, for MIME types.
If a third party needs an identifier for a format produced by a product,
they can have it registered. There is no assumption of ownership by
this registration. If the product vendor later gets aware of the registration,
they can take it over. Something similar could be done for ISBN, the
registration will only say that it identifies whatever the ISBN agency
decides it does.

It may get more complicated when discussing what isbn: or urn:isbn is
supposed to return, but as far as I understand, at least for the
registrations and for DC, it would be enough to say that it identifies
the relevant book as the resource, but doesn't (at least for the moment)
lead to an entity.
