I've taken the liberty of changing the subject line (from "Re: [Fwd: Re:

No, that's not what I meant.  Forget about handles, suppose two groups
independently develop potential schemes (with different names, so there isn't a
name collision to worry about), and both qualify as URN namespaces.  Each group
may arbitrarily decide to register its scheme either as a URI scheme or as a URN
namespace. My question was, on what basis do they make that decision; is it
completely arbitrary?  I gather (from your message) that you don't necessarily
think it's completely arbitrary, that there will be characteristics of a scheme
that will help guide that determination, for example handle has a complete
resolution protocol which would argue for a URI scheme while a less
well-developed system might want to avail itself of some of the URN resolution
infrastructure, which would argue for a URN namespace.  Is this on the right
track? This is helpful (if it's accurate) but I think this sort of discussion
needs to be formally documented and some guidelines developed.
