Interesting.

Why is it more efficient? Of course, if the above servers are
run as simple proxies that just transform and forward the
request, it gets slower, but it should also be possible to
do a more coupled implementation that should not be slower.

Please note that the DNS lookup overhead inherent in the HTTP protocol
is also incurred for an urn solution, if DNS is used to find the
resolver for the URN.

Why is there more than one? To share the load? It could be distributed
rather easily on the dns level.
