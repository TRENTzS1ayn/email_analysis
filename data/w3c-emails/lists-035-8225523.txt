Hello Sam,

Many thanks for your info. Some comments below:

This is the same for all URI schemes.

Why is the syntax more efficient? It's shorter than the others,
but is that so important?

How does syntax offer security? You say that each syntax is
related to a different interface, but that's not sure. For
example, if I had to implement hdl: quickly, I'd probably
just convert it to the http:// proxy syntax and hand it
off to a http resolver, and so on.

If we assume this is used 'forever', how much sense does it make
to work on deploying the others? Being able to hand out URIs
that work for everybody seems pretty much the most important
thing, doesn't it.

Same with HTTP/1.1.

If done correctly, you only get that overhead for the first request;
for bulks of requests, it's negligible.

This is the editing side, if I understand correctly. The Web has
'editing' methods in HTTP PUT and POST. However, the general tendency
is to separate access and editing even for http, and it's therefore
not a problem if this is done for handles, too.

The above points are all advantages when the protocol is in
high and wide use. But the Web and HTTP show that efficiency
is not that important overall. For an occasional use in a browser,
the actual advantages are not that important, but the work to
implement all the protocol features is a serious barrier to
adoption.

This seems to suggest the following:

- Continue to use the handle proxy, and make sure it works
   as efficiently as possible, and take all the necessary
   steps to make sure that this address is established and
   guaranteed permanently.
- Use the http: proxy address as the 'handle uri', in all
   relevant (Web-related) places.
- Work on special tools for updating/bulk access/... that
   can be deployed easily.
- Make sure special tools understand the handle proxy address
   and may be able to use a special protocol instead of http
   when they see it.

Regards,   Martin.
