In case you were wondering what about this
reference to the W3C URI activity...

  "I know I will be assailed from all sides for saying
  that so i will now  retreat to the W3C URI activity which
  is meant to address some of these issues. "

We have started a short-term interest group, basically
to write a charter for a more long-term interest group.
Norm Walsh and I are co-chairs.

I just updated:

  Universal Resource Identifier (URI) Activity Statement
  http://www.w3.org/Addressing/Activity
  $Date: 2000/11/15 18:50:45 $

to reflect this.

The short-term discussion is member-confidential,
with invited participants representing, for example,
the IETF applications area.

I'm pretty sure, due to the necessity of collaborating
with various IETF WGs etc., that any longer-term forum
that we set up will have public proceedings.
