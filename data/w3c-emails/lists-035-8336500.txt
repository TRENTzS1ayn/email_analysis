>This document seeks to standardize this practice by creating an IANA
>maintained registry of XML elements so that document authors and
>implementors have a well maintained and authoritative location for their
>XML elements. As part of this standard, the IANA will both house the public
>representation of the document and assign it a Uniform Resource Name that
>can be used as the URI in any URI based identification components of XML.
