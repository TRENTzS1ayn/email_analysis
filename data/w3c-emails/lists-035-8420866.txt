Okay,

in other words, from the standards view, every browser submitting URLs not using
UTF-8 as encoding and every server interpreting %HH escapes otherwise than being
UTF-8 is violating standards? (Because Latin-1 in URLs only was an idea in
RFC1630 which everybody implemented but never got proposed standard.)

Because those two approaches are incompatible, I'm curious which implementation
is wrong. :-)

Xu?n.
