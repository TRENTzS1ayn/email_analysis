You're misreading the standards.  RFC 1630 is informational.  Moreover, it
begins with this blatant IESG note:

    Note that the work contained in this memo does not describe an
    Internet standard.  An Internet standard for general Resource
    Identifiers is under development within the IETF.

Simply put, RFC 2396 is that standard that was under development.

RFC 2616 references RFC 1738 in the same sentence that it updates RFC 1630.
At <http://www.normos.org/en/summaries/ietf/rfc/rfc2396.html>, you can see
that RFC 2396 updates 1738.

RFC 2616 should normatively reference RFC 2396 instead of 1630, but it went
to last call before 2396 was published.  RFC 2396 perhaps also should have
explicitly obsoleted RFC 1630, but this tends not to happen in the IETF
because informational RFCs are not standards and so don't need to be
obsoleted.  For more detail, see
<http://www.normos.org/en/summaries/ietf/rfc/rfc2854.html>.

Well, RFC1630 (a bit outdated, but many applications seem to obey this RFC)
defines:

<quote>
CONVENTIONAL URI ENCODING SCHEME

       Where the local naming scheme uses ASCII characters which are not
       allowed in the URI, these may be represented in the URL by a
       percent sign "%" immediately followed by two hexadecimal digits
       (0-9, A-F) giving the ISO Latin 1 code for that character.
       Character codes other than those allowed by the syntax shall not
       be used unencoded in a URI.
</quote>

Here, "ISO Latin 1" is clearly stated to be the character encoding of
choice.

RFC1945 refers to RFC1630, so at least for HTTP/1.0 "ISO Latin 1" is the
standard
encoding.
RFC2068 refers to RFC1630
RFC2616 refers to RFC1630, so even current HTTP/1.1 _defines_ encoded bytes
from %80
to %FF to be of "ISO Latin 1"

(at least for my understanding).

This is the RFC|standards side of the problem. Changing the definition of
the meaning
of %HH escapes breaks HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1

The reality seems to be following: Every User Agent encodes using its local
char-to-byte mapping, and newer ones encode it using the encoding of the web
page
which contains the URI to be encoded. In most cases, as long as we are in
the same
country, the same encoding is used. There already might be ambiguities due
to
different encodings used in parallel in the CJK region, but those
ambiguities won't
get more unambigous if there would be a third or fourth possible
interpretation of
%HH bytes.

I should generalize, it should retry with this encoding it would try to use
if there
was no %uHHHH escaping.

Because URIs have no way to define the used charset in one step except per
global
definition of URIs. But if a client uses formerly free namespace, it can
know wether
the namespace is accepted or not. A client which uses the same namespace for
different meaning never knows wether the new or old meaning is interpreted
and never
knows wether its data is interpreted correctly. Only the human user probably
could
sometimes, but not always check the results the server interpreted (e.g. by
a
resulting web page). A human intervention, which is not possible in all
case, is a
magnitude worse than an additional round trip.

It is guaranteed by RFC1630. RFC1630 consequently refers to "names" and
"characters",
but never "bytes" or "octets".

Do you have examples?

"UTF-8 over %HH" might produce less confusion on the technical
implementation side,
but it produces more confusion on the data side (because data is accepted,
but
corrupted). Judging between digital confusion and error messages on the one
hand and
data corruption and ambiguity on the other hand, I'd always opt for the
former
possibility. "Syntax errors" always can be recovered with an error rate of
0% by
updating the software which formerly did not understand the syntax,
corrupted,
ambigous data in large databases never can be recovered without large human
intervention, and even then there might be a error rate of more than 0%.

Probably you might want to argue that sending "GET /test%uABCDtest.html
HTTP/1.1"
might crash several servers, but this is independent of wether %uHHHH is
widely used
or not, because crashing is always a bug.

Mainly (this is the current practical problem), but not only (there will be
other
problems which do not involve the query part of an URL, all other parts are
also
candidates for being represented by Unicode characters).

Is there a guarantee (is it a standard) that every browser encodes URLs with
UTF-8
when it receives UTF-8 encoded web pages?

This is one vague option. Unlike many web sites, for several reasons, I
follow a
stateless approach for user interaction, so I do not have any cookies,
internal
"session" objects or the like. That's why I cannot store and lookup browser
information in session-specific data, I have to determine the browsers
capabilites
(e.g. "Does it accept utf-8?", "Which URL encoding does the browser use for
this URL
or POST data?") for ever request. Now if I send the web page as UTF-8, the
server
still does not know that %HH escapes should be interpreted as UTF-8. Is it
the right
way to always use "uricharset=utf-8" in the query part of the URL to tell
the URL
decoder engine to use utf-8 as decoding charset? If so, it probably solves
form
problems, but not problems like file names, domain names, ... . Decoding
"http://host:port/dir/file?foo=b%da%bfr&uricharset=utf-8" described as above
is
possible, but is not very feasible, because the charset parameter can be at
the end
of the query part, decoding everything before this parameter cannot be done
on the
fly.

I would have to change every form to correctly supply the "uricharset"
parameter. To
change every form in the world is much more work than to change every server
or
client in the world. People who do not have the ability to create dynamic
content
will be forced to create and maintain two web pages for every page, just to
tell the
browser which charset to use in forms. Imagine two forms in the web page,
the one
referencing a server assuming UTF-8, the other one referencing a server
which assumes
Latin-1. This won't be possible. If there is no better solutions, every URL
reference
(like the FORM-Tag) should have an attribute to define how to encode.

Imagine there are two pages (as you proposed), one for Latin-1 and one for
UTF-8. At
some point, a web site must decide to which page it should point to. Nearly
all
implementations would work as follows: Access the Latin-1 page, some
ECMA-Script
decides to access the UTF-8 page. You see, two pages are loaded. Because the
pages
are maybe about 10KB big, the time between first access and final page reply
is
larger than the time between a rejected %uHHHH request.

An alternative to changing all forms could be the use of information within
the
Referrer-Header-Field. But Referrers are controversal discussed (security
considerations), and the most practical variant, to add a query parameter
"useuricharset=utf-8", is not possible for POST requests, because all the
parameters
are in the POST body, not in the URL.

I do not know an easy and fast algorithm which can distinguish "weird
garbage" from
"not so weird but user-intended garbarge". The day I introduce algorithms
for
heuristic decision where it is not necessary into a working application is
the day
where I introduce a bug.

The possibility for such character combinations to appear is truely low, but
it turns

out that we are not done yet. To produce an actual case of confusion, not
only do
these letter combinations have to appear, but there have to be two resource

This is not true, because often people are allowed to enter anything into
forms.
Because there is a "grant always" on the server side, corrupted data like
mis-spelled
names may be the result.

To summarize:
- Guessing is no option, because it is ambigous.
- Referrers are no option, because browsers are not required to send
referrers, POST
requests do not generate sufficient referrers and URLs copied from a
newspaper cannot
contain referrers.
- Simply assuming utf-8 is not an option, because many browsers send in
Latin-1 and
other encodings and assuming UTF-8 violates RFC1630 (and therefore HTTP/1.0
and
HTTP/1.1).
- Sending UTF-8 pages and then assuming UTF-8 URLs is theoretically not
allowed,
there is no standard which specifies this behaviour. (Is there one?)
- What is with x-www-form-urlencoded POST data? Will such data also be
encoded by
UTF-8 when the defining form is written in UTF-8?
-> Assuming UTF-8 URLs is more than risky

My theoretical conclusion:
Redefining used namespace by violating current standards and practice is
magnitudes
worse than extending to formerly unused namespace. The latter may result in
errors
during adaption time, the former may result in data corruption during
adaption time.
Please don't allow that. Please either find a way to specify the used URL
charset or
_extend_ the URL namespace. N.B.: For IPv6, the URL namespace also was
extended,
characters '[' and ']' are now valid. What consequences will this have to
URL
handling web infrastructure? ;-)

My practical conclusion:
I'll have to explore the limited possibility of the UTF-8-response ->
UTF-8-request
for URLs, slow down my URL decoder to 50% (I will have to parse twice),
create a
browser black- and white-list (which browsers support UTF-8-URLs, which
don't),
change all my forms to contain charset parameters, test URL-encoding on
POST-data and
to probably use more applets for input in future than now, because when
using
applets, I can decide what and how to encode. Seen for all serious web site
developers working with forms, this work is a magnitude more than updating
the web
server. (Of course, the web server already should internally work with
unicode.)
