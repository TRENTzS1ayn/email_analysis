Just to be clear here:

URIs can and are used to identify physical objects. RFC 2396 very
explicitly states:

         A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar
         examples include an electronic document, an image, a service
         (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a
         collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network
         "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
         books in a library can also be considered resources.

Thus I can easily envision a service whereby if you resolve an ISBN URN
you actually get the book on your doorstep in under an hour via Kozmo.com's
local delivery service. Its a slightly longer latency than we're used to
but it works just the same.

Now, WRT to the second half of his question: is it appropriate to use
an http URL to do that? IMHO, it is technically allowed by 2396 but the 
semantics surrounding what http has come to mean to the average user has 
made it problematic to use it as such. I would be very hesitant to use
it to identify physical objects but would use something like a URN or
a new URI scheme to do so (we're using the PIN URN to name people and
organizations).
