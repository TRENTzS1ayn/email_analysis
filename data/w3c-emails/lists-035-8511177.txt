I disagree. I may want to talk about my iBook, which is most definitely a
specific instance of an item, and a very real one. (And whose Internet
address is ibook.swartzfam.com.) But I could also want to talk about all
iBooks, as a class. Both are definitely worth referring to. Are you saying
that such references are beyond the scope of URIs?

This is an interesting point. Is there a concept of a pointer, to
distinguish between the address "http://apple.com/ibook/" (perhaps this
could be done using the data: scheme?) the actual page currently at
http://apple.com/ibook/ and the class of objects described at
http://apple.com/ibook/ (namely iBooks)?
