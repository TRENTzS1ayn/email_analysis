Do you think this would be a worthwhile scheme to specify/propose? Something
like <object:http://apple.com/ibook/> meaning iBook or
<object:http://swartzfam.com/aaron/> meaning me.

As opposed to <data:http://apple.com/ibook/> meaning the actual URL
"http://apple.com/ibook/".

How does one go about proposing such URI schemes? I don't seem to see
anything about it in RFC 2396.

Thanks,
