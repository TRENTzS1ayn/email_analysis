Be very careful here guys. One of you is talking about URLs and one is
talking about the general class of all URIs...

Not within the scope of URIs and their Resources, no. This is a topic that
has come up recently and has always been an interesting source of rat holes.
URIs identify Resources. If you want to specify other semantics such as
the container, the thing in the container, the class of containers, etc
then you need some relationship grammar similar to RDF that can make
these type of assertions. But please note that this is simply one
application that makes use of URIs. There are other applications that
use URIs all day long without ever getting into these complex assertions.
