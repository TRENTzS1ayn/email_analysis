I wouldn't go about doing it that way. URIs identify, its best to use
them just for that. What you're doing here is coming up with a standard
identifier relationship grammar which is something that a few of us
have talked about before. 
See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2000Sep/0020.html
for some rather lucid ideas from Dan LaLiberte on the subject.
