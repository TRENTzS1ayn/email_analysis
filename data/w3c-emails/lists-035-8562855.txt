Dan,

I am intrigued as to why you feel that a URI-reference with fragment 
identifier can be more soundly associated with the denotation of a definite 
description than a URI.  Can you elucidate a little?

(i.e. what is the identifying or other denotational property of a fragment 
identifier that is not possessed by a full URI?)
