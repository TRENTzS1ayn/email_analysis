Simon, I'm worried that your view is colored by not being aware of
how people are actually using URIs outside of XML based applications.
That list (plus others registered by the IANA) that Leslie posted 
is a good example of URIs that are being widely used in places that
have no relationship to XML at all (or even web browsers for that matter). 
Are you explicitly ignoring them or are you just not aware of them?
