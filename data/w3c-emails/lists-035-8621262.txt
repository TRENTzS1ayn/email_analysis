Did I mention that the URI core community consistently interprets any
questioning of its mission as ignorance of basic facts, another factor
which doesn't endear it to non-URI-loving developers?  Condescension isn't
exactly a well-known successful marketing strategy.

I'm well-aware of the schemes Leslie listed.  Several of them are in fact
'contenders for the side of a bus', and many of them are commonly used in
the 'guy on the street' understanding of URIs.

A lot of people fall off the bus, however, once it's no longer possible to
make the connection between the URI and the thing identified.  HTTP, FTP,
and email all provide infrastructures for that.  URIs generically don't,
and I've yet to see a straightforward explanation of why that is so exciting.

Perhaps I'm merely ignorant or blinding myself to the facts, of course.
