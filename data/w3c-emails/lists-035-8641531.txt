I was being condescending. I was being serious. Take a look at what ENUM
and CNRP are doing with URIs. A CNRP URI would probably be completely
inappropriate for identifying/naming an XML component....

Sure. So what's wrong with them?

It's not exciting because it was never intended to be so. Its kind of boring
actually. URIs by themselves were never intended to solve problems like
that. We don't build big huge infrastructures. We come up with itty bitty
pieces and let communities take thsoe and build them into something useful
to them.

I'm curious though, what's your preferred solution? I disagree that there's
a problem but I'm curious what your solution to your problem might look like?
