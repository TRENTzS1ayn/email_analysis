You'd be suprised.....

Yep. I hope this is what the URI activity will end up doing. My concern
here is there are two 'camps'. There are those who think that
you should never use specific subsets of URIs. I really disagree with
this since there are times when the thing you are trying to do (name
an XML namespace, identify message bodies in SMTP messages) can
only allow a certain scheme(s) of URI to be used. I think this
can be argued in the URI activity pretty well but it might be
painful. 

Touching 2396 is really painful (although a good bit of concensus has come
out lately). I think the path should be a new document that isn't 
intended to be a standards document where we hash this stuff out "in
plain English". IMHO, hte biggest problem we'll have here is the
idea that Dan has that you can and should do everything with the
http scheme (IMNSHO, this is silly).

Umm... this sounds like the DDDS infrastructure to me. I may be
projecting but have you read:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-urn-ddds-02.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-urn-uri-res-ddds-01.txt
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-urn-dns-ddds-database-01.txt

That's the solution we came up with for that specific problem. Once you
know the authoritative way to find out metadata about the URI you
then use something like RESCAP to ask for little snippets of standardized
RDF that can tell you fairly complicated things about the URI, the thing 
it identifies, or the relationship between th two.

One thing I think we will need in the future is a compact way of
passing those snippets around. Maybe its a special URI scheme or
something wholly seperate, I don't know. I've always thought that
including one URI in another was a hack but if you do it explicitly
and according to set rules it could make sense....

I'll be the first to admit that we market like shit. IMHO the main
reason is that only now are people starting to realize they need 
more than just an identifier. We knew that back then but no one cared
because they were more interested in getting their porn off of an FTP server.
Now they care but they're wanting a solution and we're just now getting
them educated on the discussions we already had.

Can you give me some specific scenarios?
