You may not even have a faint clue what the URI means, since there are so
many potential schemes for URIs.  That tends to make it rather difficult to
make any claims about the Resource.  

(In the case of http, it isn't even clear what statements can be made about
a given http URI, though the scheme is certainly familiar.)

A means of retrieving supporting metadata would at least provide a
possibility of getting some information, if not an assurance.
