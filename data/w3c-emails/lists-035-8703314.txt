IMHO, an application that defines an element that can take _any_ URI scheme
as a value needs to specify how it handles this problem or if it cares that
it is a problem. In lots of specs that use URIs this was never done and it 
has come back to bite us. There are several cases where I would preferred
that the application specify a limited set of URIs that were applicable.

Yep....

RESCAP is supposed to be solving that issue....
