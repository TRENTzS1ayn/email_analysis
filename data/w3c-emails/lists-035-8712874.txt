Surprisingly, I have to disagree with you on that point. I actually do agree
with what you are saying.

Exactly. Unfortunately however, since, as you say, URLs are the most
familiar and best implemented URI mechanism, they are being abused for
classifying physical objects, which is an unfortunate turn of events.

This is why I think some sort of URI-based identifier would be useful, to
allow people to use URLs but with a clear indication of their meaning.

People want to identify these things, unless you give them a way to, the URL
mechanism will continue to be abused.
