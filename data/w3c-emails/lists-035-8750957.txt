Correct. It _can_ be used to find out some minimal types of information
about novel or unsupported URIs but even then its won't allow an application
to completely duplicate that URIs features. For example, the URI Resolution
application could tell you things about a URI but, unless you have access
to the NNTP protocol to be able to make use of the 'news:' URI scheme,
it won't do you much good beyond telling you that you do indeed need
the NNTP library in order to get any namespace specific functionality out of it.
