Howdy,

A few reasons, including the fact that informational RFCs "don't
count" (except to marketroids who view all RFCs as standards, when
convenient).

I disagree that having a metadocument is inappropriate -- we need
one reference point for URIs, and as long as we continue to develop
the space by independant documentation (which does seem to be the
best way to to do it), the simplest, easiest to keep-up-to-date
path is a metaspec.
