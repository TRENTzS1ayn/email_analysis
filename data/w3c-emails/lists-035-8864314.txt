The IETF has a standards process for many reasons, but one of the main
ones is so that people are less likely to be confused over what is
and is not considered standardized.  A metastandard consisting of
various bits that are not at the same level of standardization
defeats that purpose.

That sounds informational to me.  I reference informational RFCs
all the time, so I don't see the problem.
