Then RDF needs to define what is an allowed Resource. You don't artificially
constrain the entire formal system of allowable URIs simply because one
application can't cope with that entire system. 

In the same way that the XML Namespaces document _attempted_ to constrain
the types of URIs and/or Resources it allowed as namespace names, RDF
needs to constrain what it consideres a Resource in order to satisfy
its requirements. Now you could talk me into some language to that effect
in Leslie's document such that it says explicitly that some applications
MAY further constrain the concepts of URIs and/or Resources and that
the reader is strongly urged to consult the specifications for their
applications for any such constriants.

That's a problem with the tool and as such you need to put a warning 
on it saying "Don't use this with these things". I.e hammers aren't supposed
to be used with screws and screwdrivers aren't used to hammer nails.
You don't force everyone to use screws and screwdrivers and say that
hammers and nails are verbotten....
