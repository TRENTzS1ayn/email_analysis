I think we can do this simply because we now have some knowledge and
experience under our collective belts. If we constrain that entire
document to just that then its very doable. LDAP is doing the same thing
right now with going through the literally dozens of LDAP RFCs and 
making a statement about what is 'core' and what isn't.

I think Leslie has it right, possibly with that additional comment
about applicatiions being allowed to further contrain the definitions
of what they consider Resource or URIs and that the reader should 
consult those as well.
