RFC 2396 also goes on to say:

          The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of
          entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that
          mapping at any particular instance in time.  [...]

Which I find to be helpful.  I think an accompanying definition of "entity" 
would have been helpful.

I submit that the purpose of these documents is not only to state what the 
tools need to know, but also what human users/designers need to know.  I 
think there have been many discussions that would have been easier with a 
clear, common understanding of the properties of resources and their 
relationship to URIs.
