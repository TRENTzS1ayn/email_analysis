Well, at least it's good to see that URIs as currently defined produce a
similar empty and unsatisfying feeling in some quarters of the RDF
community as well as in some quarters of the XML community.

I'll repeat my suggestion from earlier: either clarify RFC 2396 and give it
some meat - on the difficult questions like what a resource is, what an
identifier is, and how to compare resources and identifiers - or just call
it syntax for identifiers and leave it at that.

I'm happy to see this latest draft as a guide to URIs, but I don't think it
rates status other than informational.
