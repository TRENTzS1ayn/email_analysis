I'm suggesting that the URI community stop hiding behind 'a resource is
anything you can identify' and start talking about what resources are.

Abstract concepts don't have to be that airy.  Nouns aren't, for instance,
and the noun to which 'New York' refers changes every second of every day.

The definition below starts off well, but quickly sublimates into invisible
gas.

>(e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a

A lot of the problems raised on the xml-uri list seem to have to with the
fact that a resource 'can be anything that has identity' makes it very
difficult to separate the identifier from the resource in usage where only
the URI is available.

If I describe the namespace URI "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", am I
describing the entity body (a resource, I think) stored at that address?
Am I describing a 'namespace', something which exists purely in the
abstract?  Am I describing (as I think would be intended) XHTML itself?
We've had very different answers on xml-uri, and I'm not convinced that the
flaws are on the XML side of the equation.

The URI opens possibilities, but it provides no way to choose among those
possibilities.  This isn't a problem peculiar to Namespaces in XML, either.
 It arises any time you need to describe a resource or a URI, since the two
are effectively blurred by the practices enshrined in RFC 2396.

On a more mechanical level, I think the xml-uri discussions have made it
clear that rules for comparing URIs are broken at worst, contested at best.
 Providing a baseline comparison that could be used across schemes - even
at the cost of false negatives - would have made all of this much easier.
