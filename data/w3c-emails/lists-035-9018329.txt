Why? A lot of us in other application arenas are perfectly happy with that
definition and would prefer to keep it that way. Anything more constraining
starts to put unnecessary controls on what someone can do with a URI
and thats something we very explicitly _don't_ want to do.
Take a look at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cnrp-uri-02.txt
for an example of how others view what URIs are capable of.

The abstract concept of 'number' is pretty airy. The concrete case of
'positive integers' is fairly well constrained. The concept of URIs
should be viewed in the same level of the concept of 'number' and the
general case of 'number theory'. If your application needs the equivalent
of 'positive integers' then say so. Why do you insist on the rest of
us having to constrain ourselves to that new, more constrained definition?

I'm well aware of the issues that some of the applications you care about
have with the general case of URIs and I sympathize. I share your
views that the case of the 'http' scheme being a 'generalized namespace' 
is vastly distorted and in many cases dangerous (just my personal opinion)
due to its perceived uses and lack of rigorousness about its language.

In that case my suggested solution to you is to not attempt to redefine
the entire space of URIs to adhere to your needs. Instead _design_ a 
new scheme that does. That's why we kept the entire generalized concept
of URIs 'airy'. Its so that you can come along and design a scheme that
does exactly what you want without having to inherit a lot of semantics
that are incompatible with your application. Then further specify 
that the application only works with a certain subset of the URI space.

IMHO, I think such a scheme would have a lot of practical uses outside
your application. I also think that URNs might possibly satisfy them but
I'd have to sit down and have an extended conversation just to find out....
