Whether applications update their behavior or not is one of those
continuing problems of software design, not something that should be used
to avoid correcting mistakes.

Uniform processing for URIs would have saved a lot of us a hell of a lot of
trouble, and still could.

Leaving the spec as vague as possible may be exciting to some folks, and
may avoid some categories of political irritation, but isn't useful to a
large group of people faced with the task of figuring out exactly how these
identifiers are supposed to work.  

A spec that says "any way you want" isn't very much of a spec, is it?

RFC 2396 isn't very far from that, I'm afraid.
