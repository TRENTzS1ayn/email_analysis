I was unclear.  I meant only new applications would adopt the constraints.

But now that you mention it,...

Why can't some preexisting applications get additional constraints, if 
it is not too much work to "impose" on them.    It may be that the 
constraints already apply because the authors of the applications 
never thought to do otherwise; but declaring the constraints explicitly 
will help other applications interoperate.
Or additional constraints can be added to applications in 
backward compatible ways regarding the protocols, such as HTTP 1.1 vs 1.0.
