The specification is not vague.  It specifies exactly what is intended
by resource.  URI is a syntax for a resource identifier.  The URI does
not define the resource -- some person/author/community does.  When you
GET on a URI, you retrieve a representation of that resource at the
time that the response was generated.

There are literally millions of other things that could be said about
resources and about URI, but none of them could make the definition any
less incompassing without ignoring some aspect of resource space that
someone else depends upon.  Furthermore, since HTTP depends on the
entire scope, it isn't going to be limited any further.

RFC 2396 defines everything you need to interoperate with real URI-based
systems.  It doesn't have all the information that is in my dissertation,
but it is sufficient to develop any application I have ever seen,
including anything related to XML, RDF, and namespaces.

The answer to your question is: if the existing definition of resource
is insufficient for your application, then your application is not designed
to handle the full scope of what a resource may be.  Either live with
that limitation or fix your application.
