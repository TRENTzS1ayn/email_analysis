'Exactly what is intended by resource' still comes off as vague, to put it
extremely politely.

There's a difference between ignoring aspects of resource space and
providing a basic set of rules that allow generic URI comparison and
processing.

Is there a URI for your dissertation?

Unfortunately, working in XML, I have little control over which URIs I work
with; it's not simply a matter of my choice or even my application.
