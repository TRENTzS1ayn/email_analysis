Having sat back and watched for a while... there are at least 3 valid 
threads that I see:

. is there a general statement that can be made about
  what a URI refers to (like the 'C' pointer confusion) --
  is it the box, the contents of the box, the location 
  where the box is if it in fact exists?

. are there useful mechanisms for expressing relationships
  between resources, or between identifiers?  (a really
  crude attempt at distilling Dan Laliberte's thoughtful 
  comments).

. irrespective of whether the resource is the box, its
  contents, or whatever, what are the services that
  can make use of the identifier/work on the resource
  (beyond the traditional, bald, "get").

I think these are all valid and important issues in need of discussion.
But, at least the last 2 are outside the realm of the URI
specification itself (as it stands today, and many of us believe
it's best handled outside the identifier spec), and I don't see
any specific proposals of text that could be added to the URI
doc I circulated last week.

Leslie.
