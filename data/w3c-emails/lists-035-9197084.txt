This is a very good summary from someone who's just contributed a very good
summary of URI information in general...

We're not at the point where 'specific proposals of text' make sense.
Until the URI community recognizes that these points NEED to be addressed,
attempts to address them are just going to bounce off the usual
indifference.  

I can't fix RFC 2396 myself, or even with the help of a core group of
people who agree it needs fixing - reopening that document's answers is
going to require consensus that reopening the questions is worthwhile.

In short, there's little sense in proposing solutions to problems that key
groups of people continue to deny exist at all.  Right now, I'm more
concerned with establishing that the problem exists than in solving it.  

I suspect that the solutions for 1 and 2 wouldn't be that difficult to
create, but I'll admit happily that 3 is a really tough problem - and
perhaps the one most worth solving.
