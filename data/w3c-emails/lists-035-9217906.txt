Sure. But neither can we force the non-XML users of the URI specs to 
have to assume XMLs semantics and solutions. Yes XML is a rather important
piece of technology but it isn't the only consumer of these specifications.

Yep. And IMNSHO, its XML that needs to be fixed, not URIs...

Which is one of the problems I had with the XML Namespaces spec. Heck, the
document itself attempted to do this but was either forbidden to or
did it poorly...

What do you see as the solutions? That this is problem for XML to fix or that 
the identifier infrastructure that XML chose to use needs changing?

Yep....

Moste definitly. This is one of the larger issues in the whole XML Namespaces
debate of the past few years. One camp sees this whole infrastructure as
a bad thing and assumes that XML Namespaces are just syntactic tag
differentiation while another sees namespaces as the basis for future 
extension toward this 'normative reference' infrastructure.

The solution I favored was to allow "any old URI" but be explicit about
what your using it for and why (basically Dan Laliberte's suggested solution).
Does that mean that XML 1.0 has issues? Yes. That's why we put version 
numbers on things. ;-)

There is a large (much larger than XML) installed base of software and
standards that depend on URIs having this freedom of choice. If we
attempt to change URIs to solve the problems of just _one_ of its consumers
then the pushback from the likes of LDAP, SMTP, ACAP, DAV, SIP, ENUM,
CALSCH, CNRP, BXXP, IMPP, FAX, IOTP, IMAP, etc is going to be
significant...

Nice assesement of the issues, BTW...
