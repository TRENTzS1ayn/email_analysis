Returning to an earlier message...

Yes.

But which should come first?  Infrastructure or a sound underlying 
philosophy (and accompanying architecture)?

I think these ideas can be extended to several layers of equivalence; e.g.
    string-equivalence
    scheme-equivalence
    resource-equivalence
    entity-equivalence

And, in general, one of these equivalences does not imply any other 
equivalence.  (There are cherished exceptions, such as 
string-equivalence=>resource-equivalence, but I'm not sure if they are 
important.)

Does this help?  It seems to me to be just stating transitivity of equivalence.

Interesting point.  I don't believe the isomorphism denies the reality you 
describe, just doesn't fully reflect it.  (By which I mean that I think a 
self-consistent model can be build that accommodates the reality by 
introducing some new steps.)

I'd say it doesn't (in general).  If there are different URIs and one has 
no Internet representation, there's no general way for an application to 
determine if they're equivalent or not at any higher level.

Hmmm... I think this could be a dangerous territory.  (c.f. TimBL's 
comments about opacity of URIs, except when dereferencing to retrieve a 
resource entity:  http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.)

Yes!  But my intuition is that RDF is not, of itself, a solution here, but 
another application seeking a solution.  Once we fully know and understand 
these relationships then RDF might be used to express and model them.
