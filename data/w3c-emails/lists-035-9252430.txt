Al,

A very nicely laid out statement of XML's pickle.

Agreed.

My questions (and I have not been following the XML development
discussions, so please bear with me) are:

Can you distinguish between these normative/non-normative references
within XML (either through the tags, or specific contexts)?

Are you really trying to say "I know this reference indicates
an object that contains valid XML", or are you expressing a relationship
between the current document and the one referenced?  For example, "it 
was valid XML last time I checked".  I.e., getting back to what Dan 
Laliberte was mentioning.

Saying "no" to this is not a lack of willingness to understand the
problem XML is facing, nor is it an assertion that no other 
applications have encountered the same issue.  It's just that URIs
have been defined & used by a multitude of applications (and lower
layer services) that will not support changes/restrictions in
the definition of URIs.

What's less possible:  adding syntax to an XML reference to indicate
whether it is "normative", or changing the way references MUST
(or SHOULD) be handled, to check some alternate service as to the
particulars of the referenced object?  I.e., leave the identifier
as just an identifier, but add semantics to handling it, as a
step before traditional resolution?  ("Look before you leap").  What
such a service might be is, of course, an open question.  

Leslie.
