Thru various hooks, esp HTTP proxying...

     It is likewise
     recommended that, where a protocol allows for retrieval by URL,
that the
     client software have provision for being configured to use specific
     gateway locators for indirect access through new naming schemes. 
     -- RFC 1630 URIs in WWW June 1994 
from http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#hack-schemes

Unfortunately, in NS4.x, this only works for urn: , not
for all absolute URIs that follow the right syntax.
For details, see
  http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/telagent/#ns-parse-bug

I reported the goofy parsing of URI schemes such as irc: and tel:
as a bug (#2110) and it's fixed in mozilla. I hear there's
something related called protozilla, but I don't know the details.

Internet explorer also has support for URI scheme extensiblity.
see #hack-schemes above for details.

Konqueror had some minor bugs; I reported those, and I think
they're being fixed.

In general, the clients are getting better.

It's just a local proxy mechanism. There are designs for
new ubiquitous services for URN resolution, but (a) they're
not widely deployed, and (b) the well-designed ones
work for all URIs... just as well to make http: URIs
more robust as to make urn:'s work.
