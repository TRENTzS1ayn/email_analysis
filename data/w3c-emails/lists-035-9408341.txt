Hi,

I tripped across http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html
recently.  Wanted to mention a couple of quickies:

The jdbc naming scheme is linked to the Sun documentation for the
jdbc class that doesn't seem to even mention the URL scheme.
A quick search on google reveals what the jdbc url should look
like, but doesn't show up any authoritative documentation.

In GnuCash, we've started using a jdbc-like URL of the form:

postgres://some.hostname.com:portno/dbname?option=value&user=username&passwd 
=pwd

I beleive that the way we use this syntax is identical to its jdbc
equivalent:

jdbc:postgres://some.hostname.com:portno/dbname?option=value&user=username&p 
asswd=pwd

except that it is understood that the former uses the native postgres
format for the wire protocol, whereas the latter uses the jdbc wire
protocol.

I don't know if this usage is too trite to mention, but I thought I'd
mention it anyway ... (BTW, we are now actually using a half-dozen
private URL schemes in order to control the display an layout of the
financial reports.  I won't describe them here, as they are still
evolving.)
