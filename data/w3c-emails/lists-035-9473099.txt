Creating a specific URI scheme to do what can be done by any existing
URI scheme (namely, allow an authority to define a unique name) is a
total waste of time.  If you are going to do so using an arbitrarily
non-hierarchical syntax, then you should use the URN syntax: at least
then you will be arbitrary in the same way as the others.  If you don't
want an arbitrary syntax, then follow the recommendations in the specs
and define it using the generic hierarchical syntax of URI rather than
a syntax that is specific to yet another non-deployable identifier.
