Temporal uniquenss means no reassignment, correct?

Why humans? Humans tend to do #1 very badly....

A persistent identifier should contain the 'category' of the document?
If the 'category' of the document changes does that mean the identifier
changes? Hmm... I don't the term categorise used elsewhere. What
categorization method are you refering to?

Beyond a domain registrar and/or an email mailbox? Or are you 
concerned about the minting of each individual identifier? I.e. you
need to have a sub-space delegated to you instead of continually
having to ask someone else for one?

Does a document get a new name if it moves to a new organization?

Why does it need to be explicit?

That's a simple policy change. OIDs would make it fairly easy to say
that anyone with a domain-name now has an OID as well. The only
problem is does the OID move with the domain-name when someone doesn't
pay their bill?

Very incorrect. URNs are never required to be resolvable. The OID and UUID
namespaces not allow resolution simply because there is no such thing as 
a global OID or UUID database. There is a process for discoverying whether 
or not a given URN namespace is resolvable. But even then, that isn't required.

That's an historical artifact that only happens in one browser (older
verions of Netscape. And even then they only ask the HTTP proxy).
No browser should attmpt to resolve all URNs unless it has specific
software that can tell it whether or not that makes sense....

In our experience, if it looks like http URL then people are going to treat
it like one. I.e. they're going to look at that '1' as a directory and
treat it as such (i.e. does tag://foo.com/../1:../foo.html make sense?)

Mind if I ask where this requirement comes from? Why does the 
minting entity have to be conveniently identified?

 Hmm... what do you do about the fact that you are using the '/' character
and that implies the hierarchy equivalence rules of the common syntax
stuff in 2396?
