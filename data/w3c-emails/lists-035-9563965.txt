Huh? You don't register a new URN namespace for each entity wanting to
assign a new subset of your tree. You simple define the characteristics
of the namespace and register that. How you assign below that is your
business and you only do it once. I.e. you could easily take the
entire 'tag' proposal and simply stick 'urn:' in front of it and be
done with it. From what I see the 'tag:' document you have would
make a pretty nifty URN namespace pretty much as is. You'd just need
to stick the registration template in RFC 2611 in an appendix...

If I did that I would be in error. URNs are not required to be resolved
to be used. There is a 100% optional resolution mechanism that aplies
to _all_ URIs that you could use to resolve a URN if you wanted to but
that 100% depends on whether or not you application wants to or not.

And isn't what we intended with URNs either. The OID URN namespace
is fundamentally unresolvable outside some very constrained local 
context because there is not such thing as a global OID database.
There are _many_ cases where you use identifiers to do just that: simply
identify. Requiring resolution to be useful is wasteful of network
resources and something that is explicitly not a part of URNs.

URNs made that exact same determination many years ago....
