The intention is that an entity can mint tags on a date d when it was 
unassigned, if it became the assignee of the authority name 
_immediately_  after the continuous period of unassignment in which d 
falls. I still think that that is good as a logical definition. The 
question is whther there are good enough practical criteria for using it. 
Are you questioning whether there can be evidence that the name was 
unassigned immediately after the first entity ceased to be the assignee? 
The someone who picked it up on 2-7 would have to have evidence that it was 
unassigned. We're positing that such evidence may become available.

At whois.org there is something called a 'deleted domain search'. I suspect 
that someone, somewhere, has all the requisite information to make 
'unassignment on date d' a verifiable predicate.

Thanks,
