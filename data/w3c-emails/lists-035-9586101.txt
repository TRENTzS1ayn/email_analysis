You're right that #1 is iffy-er than the others. I'd envisage more that an 
entity has a local web site or an account with 'myTags.com', which 
dispenses new tags to them and their software -- optionally with some 
choice from the user .

We say "should be able to contain a hint about how to categorise the 
document". That's not the same thing. And it's only an example.

Yes.

No. -- see 'tag-dispensing website' above.

Not by default. Again, the wording about having human information in the 
tags is that that should be an option, not that anyone should rely upon it.

It doesn't but we think it's useful to have that option.

Tags only have to be unique. As long as there are adequate criteria for 
assignment and unassignment, those operating according to our proposal can 
be confident of minting unique tags.

There are two things: 'resolvable' and 'default namespace'. For the first, 
we're only talking about conventions. Any identifier is resolvable in any 
namespace, trivially -- it just might not be bound there. It seemed to me 
that the default assumption with URNs was 'it's worth a try to resolve it'.

On the second point, you say 'there is a process for discovering whether or 
not a given URN namespace is resolvable'. That's philosophically opposed to 
my view. I think you mean: ''there is a process for discovering whether or 
not there is a resolver for a given URN namespace'. That means, a 
deterministic algorithm that maps from the name space to 'the' resolver(s). 
There is no 'the resolver' in my world -- there is a plurality of resolvers 
that may be discovered in all sorts of ways and one couldn't possibly have 
an algorithm for enumerating them -- it would be like having an algorithm 
to enumerate web sites.

I wanted to work inside the URN scheme, I really did. But it was misgivings 
such as the ones I've just tried to express that made me give up on that. 
Perhaps I should reconsider but I'm not yet convinced.

Is there a document that states a policy for URNs on something like 
'criteria for attempting resolution'?

We're open to alternative suggestions for the specific delimiters that we 
should use. But logically I believe the date belongs with the authority 
name inside the colons.

See the above (doesn't have to be).

Maybe we've erred by using the '/'. I'll look into what we can use instead.

Thanks for your feedback,
