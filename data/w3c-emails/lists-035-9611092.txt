In particular, tag could register urn:tag: (or whatever) and decree
that that space is to be used for what is currently known as "tag:"
URIs. In development, one could use "urn:x-tag:". As Michael points
out, there is no specific problem with using URNs for this particular
application - they are unique, non-reassignable, and they need not
resolve to any particular entity. I just don't see why one should use
up an entire URI scheme on this when the particular semantics are
already covered by an exisiting URI scheme.
