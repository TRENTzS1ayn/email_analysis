I guess I'm either missing the point or not effectively making my point 
about the resolution assumptions behind URNs -- location-independent vs 
contextual -- but in my mind that still eliminates URNs, despite the 
advantages that using the URN namespace would have.

The literature on URNs is littered with 'location independent'. So what am 
I missing, exactly?

Thanks,

Tim.
