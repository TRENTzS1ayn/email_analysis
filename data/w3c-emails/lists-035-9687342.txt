I think there's a mismatch on the definition of 'location independent'. 
Location independent in those documents simply mean that there is no
requirement that the identifier by resolved against some specific network
service that also is part of the name. Any identifier can be resolved
contextually since contextual resolution is a function of who you ask
questions about the identifier, not the identifier itself. And since
RFC 2141 doesn't even define resolution you can resolve it based on
any context you trust becase you are the one defining what 'resolution'
means for your application....
