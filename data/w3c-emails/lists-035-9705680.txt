Here some relevant parts from RFC 2396:-

[[[
      reserved    = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                    "$" | ","
[...]
   URI that are hierarchical in nature use the slash "/" character for
   separating hierarchical components.
]]]

Note that an authority part should be preceded by a "//", so if you're
using the DNS and a date, that should be preceded with a double slash.

[[[
   The authority component is preceded by a double slash "//" and is
   terminated by the next slash "/", question-mark "?", or by the end
of
   the URI.
]]]

As for ";" and ",", ";" specifies a list of parameters:-

[[[
   Each path segment may include a
   sequence of parameters, indicated by the semicolon ";" character.
]]]

I believe that the "," simply (e.g.) separates a list of parameters
from other URI data, although I can't find this on first inspection in
the RFC.

I'd suggest something like:-

      tag://hpl.hp.com;date=1/tst.1234567890
      tag://exploratorium.edu;date=1/pi.99
      tag://sandro@w3c.org;date=1/my-dog
      tag://myIDs.com;date=1/TimKindberg/doc.101
      tag://champignon.net;date=1/
      tag://champignon.net;date=1-3-22/99
      tag://champignon.net;date=2-4/100
