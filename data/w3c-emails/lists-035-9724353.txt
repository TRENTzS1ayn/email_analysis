As long as your URI scheme and ours do not have the same name, there
is no conflict.   If they do have the same name, we have bigger
problems that differing semantics on unassigned periods!

The reason for the "unassigned period" rule is simple: people who get
a never-before-used domain, are going to want to use the date
qualifier of "1", not "1-4-27".  Some of them are going to want it a
lot, and I'll bet you some of them will decide to use "1" no matter
what we say, since they are pretty darn sure there's really nothing
wrong with it.  Prohibiting a useful and harmless behavior is bad
design.  What we can and should do is explain the potential danger and
help people avoid it.
