Thanks for all your thoughtful comments, Michael.   One thing I want

What's the advantage of having URNs be syntactically distinct from
non-URN URIs?  It made sense in the days when more people thought URLs
and URNs were really different beasts, but now that we seem to
understand differently -- as you say the infrastructure really applies
to URIs in general -- who (which peice of software) needs to know if a
particular URI has URN semantics.

I'm fine with "tag:" being a URN scheme if I see some practical use for
those extra four characters.

Or...  Hmm.  I don't want tags to have ANY semantics.  You're saying
URNs are presistent and location independent -- that urn:x always
denotes the same object regardless of the time and place of
interpretation, right?  Hrm.  What if we want a term
(tag:sandro@w3.org/1-4-27/you) which, when used in a message, denotes
the recipient of the message.  The term denotes a different recipient
if the same message is transmitted again, to someone else.  That can
be a tag URI.  Can it be a URN?  

(There's a weirdness here between denoting the recipient and denoting
the concept of denoting the recipient.   I'm trying to do the former;
URNs could clearly do the latter, which might be sufficient for all
applications.)
