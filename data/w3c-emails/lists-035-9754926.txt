The function of "//" according to RFC 2396 is that anything that
follows it is an authority component [1], up to the next "/" or "?".
That it can be used for relative links within the same scheme is
irrelevant to the semantics of the URI itself. A domain name/email
address and a date is clearly an authority component, so why not use
the proper syntactic identifier for it as set out in the URI RFC?

As for "date=", I agree that it doesn't give you much/anything. That
was just a whim :-)

>     tag:sandro@w3.org;1/foo

";" separates parameters, so the last one makes the most sense to me.
Just a personal opinion though, I guess.

3.2. Authority Component

   Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming
   authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the
   URI is governed by that authority.  This authority component is
   typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific
   registry of naming authorities.

      authority     = server | reg_name

   The authority component is preceded by a double slash "//" and is
   terminated by the next slash "/", question-mark "?", or by the end
of
   the URI.  Within the authority component, the characters ";", ":",
   "@", "?", and "/" are reserved.

also of interest:-

   An authority component is not required for a URI scheme to make
   use of relative references.
