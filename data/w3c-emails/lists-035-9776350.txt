Its persistently bound to the Resource it identifies. That Resource
may be a dynamically changing object like CNN or a report that contains
whatever the current weather is. URIs identify abstract concepts that
may (or may not) have some physical or network representation. In this
case the abstract concept is whatever the weather is at any given time.
The Resource can have a time component. Heck, the Resource can even
cease to exist, but the URN is still bound to the Resource even if it
doesn't exist anymore...

Yes. But it can do both...

You're confusing the identifier with the thing you are identifying and,
in the case where the thing you are identifying is a container, with
the thing that is in the container. All three can have their own
seperate identifier if that's what you need...

It is a real issue since it comes up very often. The first hurdle we
have to get over is that there is some kind of limitation to what
URIs or URNs can identify. There isn't. Any URI can be bound to anything
in the conceivable universe, which includes the concepts of nothingness
and also the identifier itself. I can assign a URI to ever single character
in an email message, and then assign one to each word grouping, to each
paragraph, to the whole thing, to the idea of the message, to the sender,
the recipient, the recipients pet poodle, etc.

And URIs don't adhere to Newtonian Mechanics. They're to simple. They simple
identify and there is no limitation to what they can identify and why.
Or, to actually use your notation, @@C is a URI because you are simply
saying that @@C is a new variable that represents that function (there's
a mathematical term for that but I can't remember it). Thus saying @@C +
@@D would be adding two equations. This is what URIs do inherently. They're
simply variable names. There are certain classes of these variable names
that you can do things with on the Internet and find out what they
currently identify but that's not required in order to just use it the
way you are here...

Nope. What is persistent is that you can always call use @@X and we'll
always understand that you always mean x(t), not that x(t) is persistent.
The persistence semantic of URNs has everything to do with the identifier
and absolutely nothing to do with the persistence of the thing its identifying.

Yes it is. Again, persistence with respect to URNs has nothing to do with
the Resource and everything to do with the identifier....

Again, you can assign a URI to any conceivable part of that process. Its
just a variable....
