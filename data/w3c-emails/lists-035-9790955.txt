You're preaching to the choir saying "URIs can identify anything."

The question is what can URIs do that URNs can not.  Since URNs
supposedly have additional guarantees/constraints, there must be some 
difference.  But you seem to be arguing that URNs can identify
anything, too.

If you can have a URN for "the news at the time you read it," as you
say, then you can certainly have a URN for "the stuff available via
HTTP port 80 at cnn.com, at the time you ask."   So that means HTTP
URLs are also URNs.
