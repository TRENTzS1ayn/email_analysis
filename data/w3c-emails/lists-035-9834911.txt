Sean,

As Sandro has thanked Michael (which I second), I'd also like to thank you 
for your thoughtful comments.

Now we can go back to diagreeing....:)

We _really_ don't want tag URIs to be taken for URLs. Compare:

tag://champignon.net;9/fred
and
http://champignon.net:9/fred

That's too close to comfort for me, and it wouldn't get much better if I 
put in a more reasonable port number than '9'. So I have to ask: does RFC 
2396 mandate the use of the '//' and '/' ? It doesn't seem to me that it does:

"a subset of URI do share a common syntax for
    representing hierarchical relationships within the namespace.  This
    "generic URI" syntax consists of a sequence of four main components:

       <scheme>://<authority><path>?<query>..."

The 'authority' part of such a URI is supposed to be a server (emphatically 
not so in our case) or a 'registry' -- and we're never told what semantics 
that is supposed to have. Is 'champignon.net;1' a 'registry' under some 
reasonable interpretation? No -- a registry is where you store stuff, and 
nothing is stored at champignon.net;1 (except, conceptually, a list of all 
tags minted so far -- so the assignees don't accidentally 're-mint' a tag).

Formally, tags seem to me to have more in common with URNs than with those 
'generic URIs': they're designed to be of the form 
tag:nameSpace:specificID, where nameSpace happens to be constructed from an 
existing notion of an authority.

So I'm for tag:champignon.net;1:tims-thing.

Tim.
