Actually, I was incorrect here: it does not at all constrain what an
authority component may consist of, only suggest a couple of
possibilities (cf. 3.2.1/3.2.2). The actual definition for the
authority component (the bit following the "//" and up to the next
instance of "/", "?" or the end of the URI) is given by 3.2:-

[[[
   Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming
   authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the
   URI is governed by that authority.  This authority component is
   typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific
   registry of naming authorities.

Note the use of the word "typically"; it does not have to be so.
