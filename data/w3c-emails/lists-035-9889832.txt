Sandro and I debated the name: I'd already named it 'tag' when it was 
pointed out to me that he had a similar idea with tann. I think Sandro and 
I are both comfortable with tag now -- speaking for myself, for the sort of 
reasons you adduce (I'm a bit of a phenomicalist myself :-)).

We can't legislate against lack of understanding but we can try to avoid 
it, especially if it costs us little or nothing to do so.

Yes (to the last two -- I haven't agreed to your syntax!)

'Conceptual registry' doesn't do it for me. Does anyone know of such URI 
schemes that contain 'real registry' identifiers in their authority 
components -- just for the sake of comparison?
