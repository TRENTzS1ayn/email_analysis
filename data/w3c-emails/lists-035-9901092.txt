Sean,

I'm confused by your proposal in that you seem to advocate an email 
exchange per _tag_. That's highly undesirable and against the 'negligible 
minting cost' requirement in our proposal, when it is at most needed per 
_authority_ -- and I'm not sure it's always needed for that. A minting 
entity doesn't need to register its specific identifiers anywhere -- except 
locally, so that it keeps track of which tags it has minted already. As I 
mentioned before, some freeware for doing this as a local web site would be 
really nice.

(While I think of it: we might find it useful for minting entities to 
publish the syntax of their specific identifiers somewhere well known, for 
software that wants to check their tags' syntax in detail.)

It seems to me that I should be able to mint, e.g., 
tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com;1:blah today, without consultation with anyone else. 
That, of course, is the point. The problem is when a dispute arises: I mint 
tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com;1:blah (which, actually, I have the right to do) but 
someone else says they owned timothy@hpl.hp.com at that date. Whom can I 
appeal to?

It seems to me that something like your idea could be made to work for 
settling that dispute (is this what you intended?):

I sent an email containing tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com;1 to www-uri-tag@w3.org 
on 2001/1/. That registry sent me a signed statement saying 'the possessor 
of value v has the right to mint tags of authority timothy@hpl.hp.com;1', 
where v is an effectively unguessable one-off value that was returned 
encrypted in the same email, so that only I can read it. Now I have a 
capability (in the security sense) for that authority: if I can satisfy 
www-uri-tag@w3.org that I possess v (which I can easily do), it can affirm 
my right to the authority.

I can fill in the security details but I'm sure you get the main thought.

Or did I misunderstand what you were saying?

Tim.
