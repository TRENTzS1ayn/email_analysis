True, but I did note it. For namespaces, one could use www-uri-tag-ns
and just send an email with a blank subject, i.e. register everything
under tag://myemail@me.com;1-4-28/ as being under "my" control, the
person with the authority code that satisfies the W3C's mail server
(or whatever particular security system is used).

Yes it is.

That's the basic jist of it; there are many ways in which the security
aspect of this could be satisfied, but it seems to me that:-

1) Not all people own a domain, but it is incredibly easy to secure a
free email address
2) Hence, people will wish to use email addresses as tags, which they
are permitted to do so
3) It is very difficult to prove that you owned a certain email
address on a given date unless a) someone can testify at the server
side that this email address was delegated to you (which is rarely
ever possible in the case of free email servers), or b) a mail is sent
to some archived list controlled by a non-partial organization.
4) The W3C could act as a non-partial organization, it has both the
power to set up the mailing list, and hopefully the compuslsion to do
so
5) The mechanics of such a system could be made public so that others
may implement it also - this is not a centralized database, merely
something that one can cite as evidence if conflicts occur, and
possbily as a memory aid so that people can keep a track of which tags
they have already used up

It's just an idea :-)
