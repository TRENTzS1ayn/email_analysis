RFC 2396 defines parameters in segments of hierarchical uris.
For my own uri class hierarchy I'm having a syntactically
correct implementation, passing all tests defined in 2396,
however I am at loss to how give users of my API access to
this information. This of courses touches on semantic issues
regarding these parameters:

http://host/seg1/seg2;param
and
http://host/seg1/seg2?param

are not equal, I assume. Can/should/must both refer to the
same resource?

How do

http://host/seg1/seg2;param
and
http://host/seg1;param/seg2
and
http://host/seg1/seg2

relate to each other (if at all)?

Or, asking the other way around: What is the difference
between the following two uris:

http://host/seg1;param/seg2
and
http://host/seg1%3bparam/seg2

Is there a generic uri view on these examples or is it
merely an issue for HTTP (or whatever other hierarchical
scheme is used) to resolve?

Best Regards, Stefan
