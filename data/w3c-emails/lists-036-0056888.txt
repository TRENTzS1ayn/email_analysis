Just so we squish these when they come up, that URN is invalid. 
URN's are specifically disallowed form having '.' in their namespace ID.
The only allowed characters are A-Z, a-z and '-'. You are strongly
discouraged from using NIDs that even appear to look like domain-names.
IMHO, urn:example:topic:bla would be better....
