The notion of the "null pointer" is a common but not
universal programming language convention for something
you put inside a pointer variable that isn't really
a pointer.

While there is no corresponding convention for URIs,
I don't think "about:blank" really fills the role, since
it seems to be used for 'a blank HTML page', similar to
what you might get with "data:,".

You could, of course, define a variable which either held
a URI or was 'uninitialized', and define some string that
you took to mean 'uninitialized', but that definition would
be outside of the context of the definition of URIs themselves.
