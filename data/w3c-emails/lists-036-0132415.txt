Right, and it has to be that way (despite the fact that some popular
browsers don't do this correctly) or you can't have both xml:base and
intra document links in the same document work.

Correct.

I'd suggest that you shouldn't be calling resolveURI at all in the case
that the relative URI reference is merely a fragment identifier.  There
is nothing to resolve.
