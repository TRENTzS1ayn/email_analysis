'Document URI' is your term and not defined in the standard notions.

This is the URI by/with/from which you recovered a representation which
asserts
a BASE at:

and my base URI is
><<http://example.org/base.xml>http://example.org/base.xml> and I want to
resolve to

You want to refer to ...

the only URI reference that I can

The _minimum_ URL-reference you can...

#fragment>. Is this correct?

The latter is correct.

Other, longer URI-references work, too, starting with
"/base.xml#fragment".? So
it's not the only URI-reference you can use.? 

And '.' doesn't work for _ibid_ for documents, just for path segments.  And in
the case you have painted here where the historical URI and base URI are
different, 'ibid' would be ambiguous.  So the lexically shorter form is bound
to the more local resolution, as is fitting.
