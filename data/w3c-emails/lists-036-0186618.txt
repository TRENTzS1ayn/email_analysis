Yes.

I based my implementation on the example algorithm in Section 5.2. Despite
being titled "Resolving Relative References to Absolute Form", it does cover
non-relative URI references (see step 3). Step 2 covers the case where the
URI reference is the empty string or just a fragment identifier. In that
case, it states the the reference is a "reference to the current document
and we are done".

Hmm. Looking at this paragraph again, I now think that it might be slightly
flawed. It says "and we are done". It doesn't mention that the fragment
identifier, if present, should be appended to the URI of the current
document.

I'm fairly certain that my implementation will produce the correct result as
would the model that you suggest above. It passes all of the tests in
Appendix C. I'm actually working on an RDF parser (in XSLT) so am not
fetching any resources but I do need to convert all URI references to their
absolute form and would like that encapsulated into a single function.

I really appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.
