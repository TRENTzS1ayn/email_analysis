Hi,

I'm doing some standards work which needs to specify links to various 
resources, ranging from email addresses and websites to postal addresses 
and telephone numbers. It seems to me that using URIs for all of these 
should be possible and I've found RFCs for most of what I need apart from 
the following, so I was wondering if anyone can provide any further 
information on these:

GSM Short Messaging Service
I've found a draft proposal at 
http:www1.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/draft-antti-gsm-sms-url-04.txt but it 
doesn't seem to have got any further. I was also considering the 
possibility of encoding body content in the SMS URL as used in the mailto 
scheme (e.g. <sms:+44777123456?body=Some%20text.>)

Postal addresses
I found a discussion on this mailing list from March 2001 containing a 
proposal from Sean B. Palmer and I was wondering if this was taken any 
further.

Thanks for your help,

Tristan
