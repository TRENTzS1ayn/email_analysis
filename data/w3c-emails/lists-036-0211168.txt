I would steer clear of specifying the body because it might be
interpreted to mean that resolving that identifier should send the
message.  Identifiers should identify, not take action.

Also, in the work we do at my company, we've found the HTTP URI scheme
quite appropriate for identifying SMS end points.  For example,

http://mycarrier.example.org/subscriber/222333444/sms

where HTTP POST can be used to send messages to that subscriber.
