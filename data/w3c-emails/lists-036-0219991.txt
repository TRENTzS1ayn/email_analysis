But your use of HTTP URLs requires one to go through the carrier's
site in order to send the message -- precluding the ability for
third party Internet-to-Wireless/SMS agencies, possibly even a
private, company or person specific server for relaying SMS messages
to/from the internet.

This is one of the shortcomings of HTTP URLs as "do-everything" URIs.
One is not able to separate the identity of the resource itself from
the agency expected to resolve that resource.

C.f. http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00.html,
in particular section 3. (note, this ID is not yet submitted to the RFC
editor, but will be very shortly...)
