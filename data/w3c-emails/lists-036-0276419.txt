>> What is the merit of this over the 'data:' scheme?

It's actually interesting (IMO) to note that a 'data:' URI
is in fact a URV (and hence URP) as it is never dereferenced,
but provides a complete, self-contained representation of
a resource. It is a WYSIWIG URI.

Thus the URV classification of 'data:' is far more accurate
regarding its semantics and application than the current URL
classification.
 
Cheers,

Patrick
