Right.

That's not true.  We've had this discussion before, and I've pointed
out that your assertion above is about the *resource*, i.e. the car.
If a particular representation of the car was created by somebody else,
then that should be reflected in a different URI, and the relationship
between http://foo.com/freds_car/ and this other URI should be
authoritatively established with HTTP's Content-Location header.

e.g.

GET http://foo.com/freds_car/ HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.com
Accept: image/gif

response headers;

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/jpg
Content-Location: http://foo.com/freds_car/image?format=jpg

Then you could make assertions about that particular representation;

 <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://foo.com/freds_car/image?format=jpg">
   <dc:creator>Jane</dc:creator>
 </rdf:Description>
