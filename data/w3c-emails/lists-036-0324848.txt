I agree that if separate URIs are used to denote the non-digital
resource and digital representations/expressions of that resource
that what you say is true (though the argument that I was contesting
about "multipurposed" URIs seems to be a common one).

However, using a URL to denote a non-digital resource is IMO just
plain bad practice. The point of the 'http:' URI scheme (and forgive
me for telling all you other folks what that is, even those of
you involved in writing the RFCs ;-) is to provide a URI that is
meaningful to HTTP resolution, and HTTP resolution is intended
to provide access to digital resources.

The problem is that folks needing to talk about non-digital resources
have been so 'http:' URL saturated that they started using them
out of habit, or (fairly enough) not having much else to use, and
then IMO folks started trying to re-define what URLs are for in
order to justify this (mis)use.

The distinction between URIs denoting accessible digital resources
and URIs denoting either abstract concepts or non-digital resources
is IMO crucial for the future of the SW. Again, it may not be
crucial for the Web, but it is for the SW.

A content header is not a digital-resource, it is part of the
interchange protocol which describes to the recieving application
what the content is -- how can you describe empty content?

And this approach presumes that all that can be known about
such a resource can be expressed in the content header. And it
requires the explicit definition of "non-dereferencable" status
for *every* such URI rather than globally for all instances of
a particular URI scheme, or ideally for a URI class such as URP.

Far better to be able to know that one has a URP and thereby
know that the URI is non-dereferencable than have to define for
*every* URP in existence an explicit header response. Yikes!
What a massive overhead!

This content header approach feels to me like a hack. Sorry.

Regards,

Patrick
