Well I'm not going into that again, but at least we've boiled

It's an assertion, like any other on the Semantic Web, except in RFC 822
format rather than RDF.

Anyhow, my general attitude towards your drafts are that it's a good
idea to be able to know things about resources and the relationships
between them.  You appear to want to put at least some of this
information into the URI scheme (e.g. HRNs, where the existence of one
resource implies the existence of other resources), whereas I would
prefer that *all* of these relationships were made explicit with the
mechanisms provided by the Semantic Web, and that the identifiers
themselves remain entirely opaque.
