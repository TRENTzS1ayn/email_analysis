That's true, but it doesn't mean that the only way to communicate that
sort of information is with a new URI scheme.  The most general model
would be to assume an opaque URI scheme, and then build up from there,
no?

What should one do when they need to make these same kinds of assertions
about an existing URI scheme that doesn't already support them (perhaps
because it's opaque)?  For example, what if the owner of example.org
wants to assert that http://example.org/foo/bar implies the existence of
http://example.org/foo and http://example.org/?
