But it does. Although it is rather implicit IMO in the definition
of hierarchical URIs, the individual path components are distinct
and hence can be referenced individually.

Note that that does *not* mean that subpaths correlate to URIs,
and this is the case also with 'hrn:' and 'voc:', only that one
can deduce that such subpaths might be valid URIs and in the case
of 'hrn:' and 'voc:' *if* they correlate to resources, there is
a defined superordinate/subordinate relation.

Obviously, though, it is difficult to rebake a cake, and if you
put the wrong ingredients into it...  cest la vie...  ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
