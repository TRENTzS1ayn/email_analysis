They can be referenced, but so can any local path.  That's not the same
as asserting that they actually identify a resource.

Hierarchical naming does not in general imply the existence of resources
elsewhere in that same hierarchy.  If you think you've found some text
to the contrary, I'd appreciate a pointer though, as I've been looking
into the opacity qualities of RFC 2396 recently.

The point here being that this assertion should be able to be made about
any URI, not just ones using a particular URI scheme.  So the most
general model for this would be entirely opaque URIs, and explicit
assertions made about them.

Sorry, I don't follow.

That sounds like it would be funny, if I understood the context.
