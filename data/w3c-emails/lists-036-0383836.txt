I agree. And never stated that such was the case.

Meaning exactly your argument above, that just because a hierarchical
URI can be parsed into discrete subpaths doesn't mean that any of
the subpaths denote a resource -- but if they do, there is additional
semantics that can be inferred for an 'hrn:' and 'voc:' subpath that
cannot be inferred for an 'http:' subpath (or any other hierarchical
scheme I am aware of).

Thus, there is functionality defined for 'hrn:'s and 'voc:'s that
is not present in 'http:'s, all else being equal (which it isn't ;-)

Meaning that if needed semantics are not defined for a given
URI scheme from the get go, you can't (at least not easily)
go back and add it. That's why alot of thought went into the
recipes for 'hrn:' and 'voc:' ;-)

(though they may still end up tasting bad to some folks ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
