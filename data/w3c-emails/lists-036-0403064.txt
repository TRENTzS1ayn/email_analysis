I agree that the SW and RDF will play a major role in describing
URI schemes and specific URI-denoted resources, but that is neither
here nor there, IMO, with regards to what semantics are defined
for all instances (URIs) of a given URI scheme, or for all instances
(URI Schemes) of a given URI Class versus the semantics or other
knowledge defined for a specific URI -- or rather the resource
denoted by that URI.

It's an issue of scalability.

To say that URI Schemes are to be as semantically anemic as
possible and just make statements about the particular URIs
is going to introduce an untenable and unnecessary overhead
on the SW.

If there is consistent, uniform intersection of semantics for
all instances of a URI scheme, then define that semantics within
the scope of the URI Scheme definition -- and in fact I assert
that that is precisely why we have URI Schemes.

Cheers,

Patrick
