No. I'm saying that attempting to assert something like that as 
universal isn't very productive...

Fine. Specify a new URI scheme and say those are its semantics. But
don't call it a URN since that name is already taken for a different
scheme.

'uri:'?

There is a method specified in RFC 2717 for how to get a new URI scheme.
The document uses the term 'URL' but that's a historical artifact and
not indicative that it excludes particular schemes.

Don't be. It wasn't fun. But please don't ignore it....

Fine. I don't agree with some of yours. The question is: how are
we going to get along?

Nope... Sorry. I have to use the terminology that we've been using
for the past several years that a lot of us have finally agreed upon.
If you want to introduce new terms that are specific to your application
then fine. But please don't re-use old ones. Its to confusing and raises
to many hackles....

Nope. These groups have spent _considerable_ amount of time coming to the 
contemporary conclusion. Most importantly the IETF has been trying to
deprecate the use of the term 'URL' ever since '93. 

> And when I assert that 'hrn:' is a URN scheme, that assertion is valid,

For you it might be. But you're asserting _vastly_ different definitions
for your terms than most here would...

Ok, then we weren't clear. I think what the group meant to say is that
talking about URI classes _in general_ is a useless endeavor and _in general_
shouldn't be done....

Fine. But don't start out by attempting to redefine how URIs work. Do that
redefinition in RDF using RDF's rule. Its kind of like me redefining
now RDF works so I can do what I want to do. It might work for me but
it causes all sorts of interoperability problems...
