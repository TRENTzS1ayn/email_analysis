That _is_ one of the requirements of URNs. They were _never_ required
to be resolvable in the first place. Many of the currently registered
URNs will never have a resolution method because non will exist.
So the lament that "nobody seems to really know how they're going to be
made resolvable" is missing most of the point of URNs to begin with.
But maybe that was our fault as well...

But there is an infrastructure being deployed right now for resolving
them if you want to (if its possible that is... I doubt if anyone will ever
try and create a UUID resolution infrastructure.)
