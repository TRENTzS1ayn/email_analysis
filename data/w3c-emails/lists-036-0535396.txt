Exactly. It should be clearly stated that there should either be
a URI scheme or a 'urn:' Namespace, but not both, otherwise one
must equate all pairs of URIs from either.

Well, resolution of URNs has always been contextual. Work is finally
reaching maturity on a global, distributed mapping table that would
bind URNs to URLs and would allow any client, anywhere to retrieve
resources by URN as easily as URLs using a system similar (actually
based on) the DNS system. But one can always provide localized
resolution solutions.

Nokia uses URNs to identify all managed digital resources, and
retrieval is based on configuration for a given site or client, as
to which registry or archive the resource is accesable. This system
has been in use now for a couple of years, and so when folks say
that all URNs must be urn:s, I have to laugh.

We still need URNs. We need a way to name things without having
to worry about where those things might be stored or managed.
Such as the name of a book or image or soundtrack, which may
in fact get stored in many locations for various reasons, but
is still the very same "thing".

I see three parts to URN usage:

1. Minting of the URN, which must be globally and temporally unique.
2. Describing the resource in terms of the URN (optional really) such
   as ownership, encoding, language, etc.
3. Mapping the URN to a URL or other means of retrieval, for a given
   environment (which may be global)

Most URN schemes (ISBN, DOI, etc.) force you to pay for all three
services, when one may not need all of them -- and most such schemes
put a focus on high persistence, security, and quality which, while
very important for large publishers, are not as critical for most
folks and also price such services way beyond the reach of most
folks (just price a few DOIs and ISBNs, very expensive).

So my goals with the 'hrn:' URN scheme is to provide a reliable and
cheap way for folks to mint URNs and then address the description
and mapping issues seperately.

There already are several description solutions available, including
open source such as the Open Archives Initiative. And since it is
not too hard or expensive to get Web or FTP space, the mapping
and retrieval is also easy to arrange -- especially if the description
solution is used to define the mapping, by simply including a
property such as 'location' which is a URL.

So, whether or not the global resolution solutions planned for URNs
happen or not, we can still use URNs very effectively and they are
very much needed.

Cheers,

Patrick
