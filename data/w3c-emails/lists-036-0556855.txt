A very good point. Let me try to answer it in two halves:

1. A URI which is originally intended to denote a retrievable
   resource: if that resource later has no web-accessible
   representation or expression, that doesn't change the quality
   of that resource. The name of a person who lived does
   not suddenly become invalid once they die nor equivalent
   to the name of a fictitious person. Likewise, one may
   loose all copies of some resource, but that doesn't mean
   that the resource was abstract, or should be treated now
   as abstract, just because it is no longer retrievable.

   Do URLs then denote abstract resources when offline? ;-)

2. A URI which is originally intended to denote a non-retrievable
   resource: firstly, if the resource is abstract, or non-digital,
   then one would hardly expect it to suddently become
   retrievable in a digital context such as the web. One would
   only be able to retrieve secondary knowledge or representations
   of those non-retrievable resources, not the resources themselves.

   Taking a scifi view, if later one is able to digitize physical
   entities (beam me up, Scotty) then perhaps we have to rethink
   this, but I guess we have a little bit of time to philosophise
   around that one ;-)


The key is the inherent, intended quality of retrievability
or non-retrievability ascribed to the resource denoted by the
URI, not whether the resource is or is not retrievable at some
point in time or in some given context.

Maybe that answers your question, maybe not, but that's my stab
at it at the end of a long day...

Cheers,

Patrick
