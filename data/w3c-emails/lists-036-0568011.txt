As one of the people who devised tags -- 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kindberg-tag-uri-01.txt -- I'm 
having trouble understanding Patrick's hrn: design and his comments below.

One of the rationales for tag: has always been to separate minting from 
binding and make minting convenient for humans, so we seem to share that. 
An important aspect of minting, obviously, is a guarantee of uniqueness. 
Email addresses and domain names belong to at most one entity at a time and 
are thererfore suitable 'seeds' for uniqueness -- hence we use them in 
tags. But they're not uniquely assigned over time. Therefore we qualify 
them with a date on which they're assigned:

tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com,2002-01-21:ikaika, which is a name that I have just 
assigned for my dog, is guaranteed to be unique now and forever, because I 
own that email address on today's date. No-one -- in particular, a 
timothy@hpl.hp.com at HP in the year 2034 -- is allowed to mint a tag for 
any date other than one on which they own the email address/domain name, so 
they can never legitimately choose the same name.

In contrast, the person who holds abc.com in 2034 might 're-mint' 
hrn://abc.com/288918293/3/en/global/docbook. At least, there may be no 
records of what previous owners of abc.com have minted, so the new minter 
can't be sure.

As for the hierarchical nature of hrns -- sure, hierarchies are nice. But 
why mandate a syntax to that extent for the 'local' part of the identifier? 
It's nobody else's business; it just has to be unique.

By the way, tag: is in the RFC editor's queue. It's also somewhere in the 
urn nid registration process.

Tim.
