Actually, the "guarantee" of uniqueness is only as good as the 
minting authorities make it... the spec doesn't require you to use 
today's date in the URI, only some date when you were in control of 
the given address -- in 2034, ABC would be able to continue to issue 
tag:abc.com,2001 URIs if they wished (whether or not they still owned 
that domain name in 2034, given that they owned it in 2001), and they 
might reuse one due to forgetfulness or because URI issuing was 
placed in the charge of some knucklehead marketing type who says "I 
don't *care* if we used that same URI 20 years ago for something 
else... nobody remembers that ancient history, and I like how it 
looks, so I want to use it now, and I'm the boss!"

Even when people use today's date in tag: URIs, some might be 
sufficiently absent-minded to use the same one twice within the same 
day, or have the issuance be done by a discoordinated organization 
where one hand doesn't know what the other is doing and different 
people keep stepping on one another's toes.

Thus, no standards document is truly going to guarantee uniqueness of 
URIs... it's up to the people who issue and use them.

I'd like to know just "what's the deal" with these dual URN namespace 
/ URI scheme registrations.  If they're approved this way, which form 
are the users and developers supposed to use, the urn:foo: one or the 
foo: one?  Does it depend on whether the user anticipates that the 
resource will, some day, be possibly resolvable on the Internet?  It 
seems like these dual-nature URI schemes will result in there being 
multiple URIs for the same resource as the urn: part gets added and 
dropped capriciously.
