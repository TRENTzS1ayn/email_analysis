I fully appreciate the benefit of guarunteed global and temporal
uniqueness (hence support for UUIDs), but I feel that there are
other means of anchoring names in time, not just by date, such
as version numbers, and there is nothing to prevent you from including
a date in an 'hrn:' root, similar to 'tag:' -- it simply isn't
manditory.

While the goal of persistence is one that all URN schemes should
embrace, there are different degrees of persistence and different
degrees of uniqueness, and given the intended use of 'hrn:'s felt
it reasonable (if not proper) to leave it up to the minting
authority to decide what degree of persistence is optimal.

I'm not sure I follow you -- though per my unsure understanding,
you would like to leave everything beyond the authority portion
opaque?

Well, there's no restriction about having "local" syntax for
partitioning of any sort, and you can have any valid URI string
(sans '/' characters) in your local part, with just one level
of naming.

Having a standardized representation for hierarchy, though,
is very useful for scoping identifier models which define the
identity of resources in terms of superordinate context.

E.g. work/expression/realization/instance is a common hierarchy
in the library/literature fields.

We use a similar hierarchical, scoping identity model for
modular digital resources here at Nokia.

I am well aware of that, and wish the 'tag:' URI scheme
well. In fact, I referenced it specifically in my I-D
http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00.txt

I will admit, however, that the intended purpose and utility
of the 'tag:' and 'hrn:' URN schemes do overlap, and one
advantage of the 'hrn:' scheme (having of course a biased
view) is that the semantics of the 'hrn:' scheme expect an
instance of that scheme to denote a retrievable digital
resource whereas the 'tag:' URN/URT scheme may be used for
either digital or non-digital resources, which introduces
problems for software applications needing to decide what
to do with one.
