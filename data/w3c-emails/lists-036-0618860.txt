But 'version numbers' don't necessarily cross organisations whereas dates 
do. Our view is that you have to mandate some type of framework for the 
coherence of the name space.

That's what we do.

But my point is: why frame or constrain where there is no global need to do 
so? We should agree on as little as possible (Occam's Razor for naming 
schemes).

I'm happy to let such communities develop their own standards but it's none 
of my business.

One of our intended use models is indeed that people can attach tags to 
physical entities but the point of doing so is for users to retrieve 
digital resources from them 
(http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2001/HPL-2001-95.html). So I don't see 
the difference.

Cheers, Tim.
