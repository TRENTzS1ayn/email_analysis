But "mandates" in general seldom succeed. You must support the
practices and traditions of the minting authorities.

It is up to the minting authority to determine what is needed,
and in my experience, it is seldom that the current practice
does not suffice.

Forcing all organizations worldwide to change the way they
construct identifiers (apart from educating them on the issues
relating to globally and temporally unique idenfiers in a
web context and showing them how they can best achieve that)
is not going to work.

Most large organizations have very well established methods for
achieving unique names within the scope of that organization, and
the 'hrn:' scheme is a way for them to capture those methods in
a URI without having to re-engineer those methods or processes
(unless they choose to).

But why should the rest of the world also live with that
restriction. Many folks *need* hierarchical identifiers.

Where on earth do you get the idea that there is no need to
do so. Just because you don't need to, or just because
everybody doesn't need to, does not mean it is not a widespread
need.

Then why are you commenting on the 'hrn:' scheme?

It is a standard for global naming for communities which
desire hierarchical URNs.

If you don't care about hierarchical URNs, then you
shouldn't care about the 'hrn:' URN scheme. No?

I don't follow. How do you retrieve a digital resource
"from" a non-digital resource?

Do you mean e.g. a book which may both be printed and available
in digital form?

In such a case, we have several "entities", we have the abstract
work, and an expression of that work (e.g. in a given language),
and for that expression, two manifestations, one which is physical
and one which is digital. Only the last, the digital manifestation,
would be a URN denoted resource, leading from the definition of
a URN as an indirect point of access for a digital (web) resource.
