To: URN<urn-ietf@lists.netsol.com>, URI<uri@w3.org>



The following analogy, or rather an expansion of it, came
to me during a related discussion on the RDF Core WG list
regarding "what is a resource"...

That's an interesting way to look at it, and in fact, a
useful analogy for the difference between URL/URN/URP
is that a URL is a function, a URN is a pointer to a
function (possibly null) and a URP is a constant.
