? tag doesn't deny them that: whatever follows the <authority,date> may be 
hierarchical.

I was talking about the tag scheme. But I'm also entitled to point out what 
I believe to be deficiencies in other proposals. I thought that that what 
this forum was for.

You read the identifier with a sensor (e.g. a camera, barcode reader, ...) 
and send the identifier to a resolver, which looks it up and returns the 
URLs of one or more corresponding resources.

book with many other types of digital resource, depending upon the 
application. Tag has nothing to say about the allowed types of binding.
