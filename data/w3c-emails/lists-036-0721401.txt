I fully understand the motivation and benefit of the tag date qualification,
I just don't see that it has to be manditory. I think I gave sufficient
examples to justify that view.

And if a minting authority is truly concerned with absolute temporal
uniqueness, they can either include date components in their hrn or
use the UUID form.

You seem to argue that because date qualification is not manditory,
it's not possible, or that hrn's can't achieve temporal uniqueness
without it.

It seems to me that the deciding criteria whether one registers
a URN scheme as a top level URI scheme or a 'urn:' NID is whether
one plans to use DDDS for global, transparent resolution.

If so, then the NID makes sense. If not, then I see no reason
to bother with NID and go with URI registration (though the
latter is rather scary and laborious).

Whether DDDS can be used or extended to support arbitrary URN
schemes will be an interesting exercise.
