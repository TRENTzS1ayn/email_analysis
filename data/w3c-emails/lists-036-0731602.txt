But since tag: is not a hierarchical URI scheme, one cannot use
existing APIs and libraries that are able to recognize and parse
hierarchical URIs. You then have to roll your own for the tag
scheme, and any other scheme that "allows" you to have proprietary
hierarchical syntax.

Absolutely. Though on this point you appeared
to be arguing
that a general, hierarchical URI scheme was not
needed.

I don't see how the entry method has anything to do
with the nature or interpretation of the identifier.

It appears that we are not talking about the same thing.

You seem to be using the URI to retrieve metadata about
the resource, not the resource. As with barcode or other
entry methods, I don't see how that has anything to do
with the nature of the URI itself.
