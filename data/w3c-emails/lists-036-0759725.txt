I have some sympathy with the idea that we should have specified tags to be 
of the form, for example, tag:timothy@hpl.hp.com/2002/01/23/whatever....

... for the sake of syntactic uniformity -- while keeping all the other 
properties of tags. But it wouldn't buy us anything else because tags are 
only ever compared or resolved in their entirety. And I still don't agree 
with you about the mandatory status of dates, for the same reasons as before.

Hmmm. I answered your question exactly but now I'm to be upbraided because 
it wasn't the question you meant :).

I'm philosophically opposed to the notion that there is such a thing as 
"the" resource. There are names; there are naming contexts that map names 
to other names or to resources; and there are resources (addressible 
functions). "The" resource that you speak of can only mean "the resource 
that this name maps to in this context".

So which context are you talking about -- the one that gives you or your 
community the type or status of answer you want? Or the one that the 
minting authority wants to associate with the identifier? I agree that I 
would like my client to be able to determine the minting authority's 
resolver for a name that it minted, in case I wanted its resource. There 
are several ways of achieving that, essentially by agreement to a 'root' 
context that maps naming authorities to resolver addresses. But the minting 
authority's context is just another naming context.

Cheers,

Tim.
