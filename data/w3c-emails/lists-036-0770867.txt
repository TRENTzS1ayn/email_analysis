I am working on a paper that outlines the URI schemes based
on their potential applications, and hope to have that
done by the end of February (unfortunately, I have to fit
it in and around alot of other, higher priority work).

But when it gets near final draft stage, I'll post it here
for folks to rip up (er, comment on ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
