What the Future Holds

The W3C/IETF URI Planning Interest Group has turned out to have as much
of a coordination role as a planning role. It promotes consistency
between W3C and IETF specifications and the IANA registry, etc. We plan
to recharter the group to continue this coordination role, with public
proceedings."

We have drafted a charter. Before it goes into effect,
we're interested in any comments from participants
in this forum.
