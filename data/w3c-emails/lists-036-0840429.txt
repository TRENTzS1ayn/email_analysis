So what exactly is the resource in a web site that's language-
negotiated (e.g. set your browser's preference to have
Japanese and French higher than English, and browse through
the Apache documentation).

The resource is e.g. 'documentation of module FOO' independent
of language. It is NOT some sequence of characters/bytes,
because there is no single entity to uniquely and consistently
represent this resource. Resolving the resource doesn't
give you something you can call 'the resource', it's just
one possible variant. The resource only exists in our
imagination.

How does that fit into your model?
