Greetings, everyone.

I joined this list a couple of days ago, but have not seen any
activity.

I also searched the w3c site for any (public) archives, but could not
find any.

I hate posting to a new list until I've had time to align my style
with its 'culture', but, since nothing seems to be happening ....

Is the right place for discussions related to
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duerst-iri-00.txt
?
