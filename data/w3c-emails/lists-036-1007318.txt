These look like interesting possible additions to the URI specification.

URI Resolution: 
  The process of determining the access mechanism and 
  appropriate parameters necessary to dereference a 
  URI. e.g. in the case of an HTTP URI, this process 
  resolves the URI into an IP address, a port number, 
  a host name (possibly optional) and a request URI.

  Resolution may require several iterations.

URI Dereference: 
  The process of using the access mechanism and 
  parameters generated by URI resolution to create, 
  inspect or modify resource state.

URI Retrieval: 
  The use of URI dereference to retrieve 
  representations of resource state.
