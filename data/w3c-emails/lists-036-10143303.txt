That's the basic idea; niso-info: and idf-doi:.  This would allow for
the gnome folks (who are apparently already using info: as well,
according to a previous note) to use gnome-info: without collision,
but wouldn't require any more complex decoration.

Obviously, you still have the "two NISOs" problem, but that seems to
be something that can be managed without adding extra complexity to
avoid it.
