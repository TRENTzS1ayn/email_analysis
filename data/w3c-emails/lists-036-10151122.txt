I still stand by the advice that NISO should just
help organizations register their URN namespaces
(rather than creating a new registry) and that
DOI should use "urn:doi" since DOIs fit perfectly
as a URN namespace.

As far as organization names go, I wonder if it is
appropriate to suggest to IANA a heuristic:

If http://www.google.com/search?q=<orgname>
yields a web page of the organization asking for
the URI scheme, then the organization can have
<orgname> as its prefix.

Under this heuristic, the US National Information
Standards Organization rises above the National
Irish Safety Organization for "niso", but, since
the International DOI Foundation doesn't rise above
the International Diabetes Federation, perhaps
"doi-1" would be better than "idf-doi" (if IDF
insists on a private-URI rather than a registered
URN).

IANA would be free to choose whatever heuristics
they wanted, as far as judging the appropriateness
of a short ASCII string as an organization abbreviation,
but the above is what I use myself.
