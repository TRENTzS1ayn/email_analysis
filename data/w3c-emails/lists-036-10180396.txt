Hi Ted,

I like your idea as originally floated:
- IANA assigns an 'orgname' (preferred source being an
  existing 'vnd.orgname' arc in the MIME registry).
- First come, first served for 'orgname'.

I do not like Larry Masinter's apparent suggestion
(perhaps I'm misreading??) that we should break
the existing rules in RFC 2717, which are that new 
top-level trees (non-IETF) MUST be unique and MUST be 
followed by a hyphen-dash before the remainder of the 
URI scheme name.

Cheers,
- Ira

That's the basic idea; niso-info: and idf-doi:.  This would allow for
the gnome folks (who are apparently already using info: as well,
according to a previous note) to use gnome-info: without collision,
but wouldn't require any more complex decoration.

Obviously, you still have the "two NISOs" problem, but that seems to
be something that can be managed without adding extra complexity to
avoid it.

Ted Hardi
