Yes, but we can't assume that the last domain is a TLD.

Yes, it says that in the text describing the rule:

    The production for host is ambiguous because it does not completely
    distinguish between an IPv4address and a hostname.  Again, the
    "first-match-wins" algorithm applies: If host matches the production
    for IPv4address, then it should be considered an IPv4 address literal
    and not a hostname.

All of our attempts to disambiguate within the grammar itself did
not work because, without a trailing ".", there is no way to know
which is the TLD.
