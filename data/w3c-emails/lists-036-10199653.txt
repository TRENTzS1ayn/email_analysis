there's no document I am aware of that explicitly precludes "numeric" TLDs.
RFC 1123, section 2.1 says "... at least the highest-level component label will
be alphabetic" but that's probably due to the fact that additional TLDs
were not yet on the table. I'd see that as descriptive instead of normative.
However, as a consequence, hostnames that look like IP addresses are
(obviously) not allowed, and operational wisdom will hopefully continue to
help this assumtion be true.

Again, the "." is not part of the domain name. It's a user interface issue,
as is using non-FQDNs. In the context of UR*, the "U" doesn't really make
sense for non-FQDNs.
