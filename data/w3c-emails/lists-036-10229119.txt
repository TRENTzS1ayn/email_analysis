Sorry if I wasn't clear.

Yes, I like this.

Not entirely. 'orgname' should be an appropriate name
for the organization. We don't want DNS-like wars
for who owns the sex-xxx: URI scheme prefix. So
IANA gets to reject applications or suggest alternatives
without appeal. I imagined a heuristic IANA could use,
but I suppose codifying it would do more harm than good.

I think you were misreading. I don't propose breaking
RFC 2717.
