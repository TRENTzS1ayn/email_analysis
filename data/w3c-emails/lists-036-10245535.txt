+4.

The whole alternative tree scenario IMO would only lead to a fractured
federation of URI namespaces with the faceted namespaces being marked out as
having junk status. Perhaps we need to return to the real question of why
anybody would want to deploy identifiers under the URI naming architecture.
What are the reasons/benefits for wanting to join? That seems to me to be
key.

A couple of issues and observations:
 
1) I don't think that the basic division between ietf-tree and non-ietf tree
is correct. IETF is just one standard organization among many others (e.g.
oasis, itu, ieee, w3c, etc). Why should IANA treat IETF differently from
other standard organizations? If uri-schemes proposed by other organizations
has to use the "orgname-schemename", then uri-schems from IETF should also
use "ietf-scheme". 

2) If the "orgname-" in the uri-scheme is primarily used to avoid namespace
collision, then the same principle should also apply for urn namespace. Thus
the "urn:publicid" should really be "urn:ietf-publicid". I haven't seen
anyone bring this up. 
 
3) The current "heavyweight, slow process" of uri registration is not
because of the complexity of the proposed scheme itself, but due to the
debate between URI or URN namespace. Because of some of our "URI experts"
are URN advocates and they want their product to be successful, it
complicates the whole process. Given that their opinions are heard, it would
be better to have those people stay out of the decision making so that more
objective decision can be made.
 
4) It seems that IETF is acting more and more towards a governing body on
what is the right technology to use and how people should use it. This only
works if the ones that making the decision are not biased and can always
make the right decision. I don't think we can trust anyone with such
characteristics. A better approach is to have our experts advise users of
pro's and con's of each of their choices, but leave the decision making to
the users themselves. 
 
 
regards,
Ed
