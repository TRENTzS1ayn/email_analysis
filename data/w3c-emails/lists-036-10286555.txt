That really sets us back a few months. Sorry, but we've been told over and
over (and over) again that it's to avoid collision (so that there can be a
'niso-info' scheme and, for example, a 'gnome-info' scheme).

Now if the theory is again that it's to distinguish IETF from non-IETF
schemes, I'm afraid I'm going to have to start complaining all over again.
