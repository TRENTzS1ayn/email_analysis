Here is my observation of the current situation:

If "doi" and "info" are to register under "urn", then they are part of ietf and no questions will be asked. 

If "doi" and "info" insist to register under "uri", then they become non-ietf and has to go under "orgname-".


So it's more like:

"Any individual or organization may propose an ietf tree URI scheme, just as any individual or organization may propose an IETF tree MIME type". But if the scheme is about naming, it has to be under "urn". Otherwise it is "non-ietf" and is subject to special treatment.

It is important to realize that URN is just one of many ways of naming things on the Internet, just like http is just one of many ways to get contents on the web. IETF, particularly IESG, should not be acting as the policeman that enforces every naming scheme to be under URN, just as W3C never said we have to use nothing but http for web applications.

The fact that IESG (or the ones that take part in its decision making) favors one technology over any other ones makes it inappropriate to have IETF to take sole control of the URI root tree.

But don't you need to consider how to control the URN namespace from being polluted? If the purpose of "orgname-..." is to regulate the URI namespace registration, don't they apply to URN namespace as well? If we don't have to worry about URN namespace getting polluted, why should we worry about URI namespace?

I think it's perfect fine for URN advocates to recommend their favorite technology. After all, that's what they believe will benefit the community and why they spent time and energy to develop it. 

But the IETF decision process has to be fare and open. It should allow different approaches of doing things, as long as they don't break existing practices. IESG should not be making decisions behind doors where only URN opinions are heard, and they shouldn't label people as non-IETF because they don't choose the URN technology.

But what happens when IESG is faced with two or more competing technologies? Does the IESG always have to endorse one technology over any other ones? What if IESG only consists of people that favor one technology but the other? How can we ensure its decisions are unbiased, not to mention their correctness? 

If IETF is truly open, it should allow competing technologies to be proposed within the IETF scope and let the user community decides what is the right one to use. For URI/URN registration, IESG may recommend URN registration, but shouldn't forbid other choices selected by the user community. If "doi" people think URI namespace better fit their needs, then let them develop their application using it.

I agree with you that having some ad hoc review process will be a good thing. I think people on this board (especially you) have made great contributions. Personally I admire those efforts very much.

As for the criterias of the review process, my opinions are that 1) the review should concentrate more on the purpose of the URI namespace, and its intended service community. If the service behind a newly proposed URI scheme appears to be a bogus or it's only intended for some private community, then it should not be listed on the public listing. 2) The review process should not put too much emphasis on technical details as depicted in RFC2718. RFC2718 should be taken as (good) guidelines on how to make a URI scheme work, but not as the criteria for URI qualification. 3) People reviewing new URI scheme should allow time for the URI scheme to develop, to become mutual and functional. On the other hand, if a URI schemes failed to become functional for certain period of time (five years?), then it should be taken off from the public listing.
