Rather than create yet another URI scheme, particularly one which is not
meaningful to HTTP and the presently defined web architecture, why not
set up the equivalent using http: URIs, and a (distributively) managed
domain name space?

C.f. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2003Jul/0005.html

E.g.

http://ddc.some.root.domain/22/eng/004.678

http://lccn.some.root.domain/2002022641

etc. where 'some.root.domain' is the root domain of the organization
granting sub-namespaces specific to particular naming schemes/organizations
such as DDC, LCCN, etc.

Then, if the owners/managers of those particular naming schemes wish to
publish representations and/or descriptions of the particular resources,
they can, and that information is then available to both Web and Semantic
Web agents.

Why define and manage the URI space outside the scope of the core Web
and SW machinery?
