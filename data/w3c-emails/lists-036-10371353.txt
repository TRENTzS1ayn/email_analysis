Hi Patrick:

I have to query the question you put above. IMO the "info" URI scheme fits
full square within the core Web and SW machinery as articulated in the
latest Web Architecture Draft:

Architecture of the World Wide Web
W3C Working Draft 27 June 2003

http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/

The domain of URI is more extensive than HTTP alone. I would assert that the
actual domain of URI is the Web.

Regards,
Tony
