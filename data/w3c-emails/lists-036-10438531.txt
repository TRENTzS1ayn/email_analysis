Take a look at the latest Release 1.0:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1340/309registries (Online Registries; The DNS and
Beyond) 

For an overview on DOI: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june03/paskin/06paskin.html

Currently if its a storm it's in at least ten million tea cups...there are
over 10m DOIs

Hmm. Interesting. A new acronym (to me). I have never heard of this DOI, but

then again, I'm stuck on an island off the West coast of Scotland. Perhaps 
that's it.....perhaps not. I googled DOI and up came two links to doi.org 
(self-promotion), one other link that said something about doi in use, which

didn't work, and seven other links that had nothing to do with digital 
objects, but rather the Idaho department of insurance, etc.

Is this the next big thing and I've missed something, or is this a storm in
a 
tea cup?

Regards,
sean
