Let me try to articulate one of the unspoken reasons in favor of the 
"info:" scheme with respect to the "http://some.root.domain/" 
approach.

I think there is no argument that  the http-some-domain approach has 
the great technical advantage over info that it has a built-in 
mechanism for retrieving resources and descriptions. What this list 
may not immediately recognize is that this technical advantage can, 
in many situations, be a great political disadvantage.

In general, technological barriers are easily surmounted by 
technologist, but political barriers can be genuinely hard. By that I 
mean that getting people to agree on things (peacefully) is not 
easily arrived at by technological means.

The technical ability to dereference an http URI results in a grant 
of power to the owner of some-domain by anyone who uses some-domain 
URI's. The practical effect is that real people, real organizations, 
and real communities are less willing to go along with the use of 
some-domain uri's to reference resources. Regardless of how much the 
owner of some-domain is trusted,  there is a natural reluctance to 
delegate the power to de-reference. Potential users might try to 
impose specific dereferencing policies  on the some-domain owner (for 
example by legal means) that might be objectionable to other users of 
the some-domain authority.

The info scheme explicitly has no dereferencing capability. The lack 
of this ability makes it easier to get people and organizations to 
agree to use these uri's, and is in fact its signal advantage.

At the same time, there is absolutely nothing to stop the 
proliferation of "info" dereferencing services. Given that hundreds 
of libraries have already installed OpenURL "dereferencing services" 
(such as our product, 1Cate (http://www.openly.com/1cate/) and others 
such as SFX, LinkFinderPlus, O-link, LinkSource, Sirsi Resolver, 
etc., etc.) which will rapidly add support for  info uri's packaged 
in http urls, it seems likely that means for obtaining semantic web 
descriptions for info uri over http will be quickly supplied by 
market forces.

To sum up, with regard to the info scheme, less is more.
