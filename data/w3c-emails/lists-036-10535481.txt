I think a general rule of thumb should be that any URI scheme
proposal that defines a meta-scheme, such that removal of that
scheme in favor of separate schemes for its underlying names
does not change the validity of the identifiers, should be rejected
out-of-hand because uber-schemes are a waste of bytes on the wire
and a political pain in the ass.
