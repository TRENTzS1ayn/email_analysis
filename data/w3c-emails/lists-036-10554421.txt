I can appreciate the political/social issues you describe.

At the very least, I would hope to see a URIQA server (or comparable)
hosted at whatever Web server might be set up to serve information
about info URI registrants and their terms. I.e., if one cannot
have

   MGET http://ddc.some.root.domain/... HTTP/1.1

at least it would be a great service to the SW to have

   GET http://some.root.domain/URIQA?uri=info:ddc/... HTTP/1.1

So that precise descriptions of these important resources can
be easily obtained by SW agents.

Cheers,

Patrick
