It seems to me that if the effort is taken to define the http: URI
equivalences, that it's then *less* work to just *use* the http: URIs
and simply not have to muck about with mappings.

So while the mapping approach is an interesting idea, it seems
to highlight IMO the needlessness of yet another specialized URI
scheme.
