I'm sorry, but I don't think your criticisms are valid for
the approach I am advocating.

Nothing is being dumbed down. The namespaces available are
essentially unlimited.

I don't hold an "everything http:" view, *but* if we are talking
about the Web and SW (not just URIs or RDF) then using a URI
scheme that is *meaningful* to the web architecture in terms
of some kind of resolution protocol seems quite reasonable to
expect.
