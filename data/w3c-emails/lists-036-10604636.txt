I don't see why all of the above cannot be addressed using
http: URIs. The management/authority characteristics can
be captured along various lines: by dns ownership, by
server-internal management structure, and the issue of
who gets to say what some URI means can be equally well
addressed within an http: URI context as in a URN context,
with the added benefit in the latter case of having the
infrastructure in place to resolve those http: URIs if
and as required.
