I don't follow your argument.  Just delete the scheme
and then check if the remainder, modulo a minor syntax
change like adding a ":", is sufficient to identify what
the scheme claims to identify with global scope.  If it
does and that holds true for all identifiers within that
scheme, then the scheme itself is meaningless and should
be discarded.

See, it's a good one.

Outside of error-correction techniques, redundant bytes are
always a waste.

No, many systems of enormous value are political pains in the ass,
they just take longer to standardize than they would have otherwise.

I agree that would be consistent with the URN specs.  Note, however,
that had my rule of thumb been applied to "urn", we would have avoided
a significant pain in the ass.

I think meaning, authority, and operational definitions are
intertwined in the real world, so any effort to separate URIs
into one category or another will simply result in unexpected
complications as soon as they are actually used.  However,
within the context of a world in which the "urn" scheme is
still considered a good thing, I suppose they are correct.
There certainly isn't any reason to have both "urn" and "info".
