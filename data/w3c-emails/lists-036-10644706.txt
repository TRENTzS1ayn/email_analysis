Start here:

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes

and then follow indirect references as necessary.

Note that genuine URI schemes (as opposed to soi-disant wannabes) don't 
reach the point of "has faded as draft", as they're required to be 
published in RFCs.

There is also an *informal* account of many proposed URI schemes accessible 
via at:
   http://esw.w3.org/topic/UriSchemes
