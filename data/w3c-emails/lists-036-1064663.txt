Al,

I don't think the purpose of including these definitions would be to give 
complete instructions for URI handling in all situations, but to help all 
readers (and writers) of URI-related documents to be in broad agreement 
about the terms they use.

I don't think that harms the definition as given.

Ditto.

OK, I suggest:
[[
URI Retrieval:
   The use of URI dereference to obtain
   representations of resource state.
]]

I think retrieval is a common enough case to deserve special mention.

Tainted?  The web is predicated on network communication, no?
