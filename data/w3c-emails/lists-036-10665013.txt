This characterization of the problem is far
too mild.  Consider the resource whose URI is
http://www.tagyerit.com/images/adopted/shakespeare.jpg .
You can't do a direct GET on this any more, but it's
still available (for now) in the Google cache at
http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:IbW4adfRGVkC:www.tagyerit.com/images/adopted/shakespeare.jpg

If you retrieve this resource, you will get a sequence of bits labeled
image/jpeg.  But what is the resource?  Is it Shakespeare?  Is it a
(generic) picture of Shakespeare?  Is it this *particular* image of
Shakespeare?  Or is it something else altogether?  Nobody can say,
probably not even the person who posted the picture to the Web.

A fine thing indeed.  How would you formally characterize the relationship
of the above URI to Shakespeare?
