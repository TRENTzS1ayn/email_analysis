I equally assert that there are "definitely" many applications/domains (not 
to mention minting principals, i.e. users) for which extra registration is 
not needed.

In tag we specifically eschew extra namespace registration, because we want 
a low barrier to entry for identifier-minting.  Jo User already registered 
when she got herself an email address or domain name and she shouldn't have 
to go through more of that to identify her stuff.

It's not clear that anyone other than big players -- who can afford 
heavyweight legal defence -- would benefit from "more" registration. 
Moreover, it's likely that e.g. HP would be able to defend tag:hp.com,2003: 
legally just as well as they could hp.com.  So what would they need extra 
registration for?
