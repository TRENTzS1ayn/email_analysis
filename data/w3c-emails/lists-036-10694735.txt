Insofar as a cache reflects what was/could be retrievable from
a particular web authority, I don't see that the above case needs
any special interpretation. One could fairly presume an implicit
equivalence relation between the denotation of cache URIs and
the original URI. I.e.

<http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:IbW4adfRGVkC:www.tagyerit.com/images/
adopted/shakespeare.jpg>
   owl:sameIndividualAs
      <http://www.tagyerit.com/images/adopted/shakespeare.jpg> .

But the ambiguity of what resource is actually denoted by either
URI (regardless of the nature of the representation itself) remains.

Well, if the above URI actually does denote Shakespeare (rather than
a portrait of Shakespeare, etc.) then it really is a matter of
vocabulary. If a more commonly used URI denoting Shakespeare exists,
you could make an owl:sameIndividualAs assertion, but in the end,
a URI is a URI is a URI and its actual denotation is meta-knowledge
that is (at least presently) defined by social means, not formal.

Still, if the server www.tagyerit.com was URIQA enlightened, then
one could hope for a description of the resource denoted by the
URI in question, stating that it denotes a historical person, who's
name is William Shakespeare, who was a poet/playwright, was born
on a given date, in a given place, died on a give date, etc. etc.
with statements relating the person to his works, yada yada yada.

Perhaps a google cache (in the future) would also contain the
formal concise bounded description of the resource denoted by the
URI, in addition to one or more representations that are/were
accessible via that URI.
