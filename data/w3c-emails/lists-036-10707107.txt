Easy...  It's a URI that at one point led to a bunch of bytes that,
when displayed in the appropriate image viewer, resembled some
artist's conception of what Shakespeare looked like.  At present, it
leads to a 404 Not Found page that has no obvious connection with the
Bard.  It's not "the URI of Shakespeare", or even (any more) "a URI
to an image of Shakespeare"; any connection that URI might have to
the playwright is in the minds of those who may have used or linked
to it, not anything inherent in the URI itself.

If somebody were to get approval for a URI scheme designed
specifically to create URIs for particular persons, playwrights,
etc., then one might be able to say of a URI in that scheme that it
is actually "the URI of Shakespeare", or more properly "a URI of
Shakespeare" because of the possibility of there being more than one
such thing... (maybe he's both
"person:1564-04-23/England/Stratford-On-Avon/Shakespeare/William" and
"playwright:british:16th-century:shakespeare").
