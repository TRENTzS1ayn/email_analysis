And the whole notion of a non-IETF tree is predicated on
an assumption that it's good to let a thousand URI schemes
bloom.

I'm not sure about that at all. I'm starting to think
that URI schemes are somewhat like currencies. A few
of them is good, but a zillion of them is counter-productive.

      * New URI schemes are the only thing you can't FollowYourNose to
        look them up."
