(begin pro-tag argument) 

Agreed, but if we had tags, anyone could make the equivalent of info:
or info:isbn: or whatever.  That is, I could hereby define
   tag:sandro@hawke.org,2003:isbn: 
as the prefix for ISBN URIs like info.  And it would work just as
well, wouldn't it?   

Tag has a weakness releative to info: in that it doesnt naturally push
people to use the same URI for the same ISBN, so some outreach or
marketing would be needed to say "Please folks, everywhere, you should
all use the prefix "tag:sandro@hawke.org,2003:isbn:" when you want a
URI to name something which has an ISBN.  And maybe I'd register
isbn2.org to make it seem more neutral and be a little shorter, like
     tag:isbn2.org,2004:0-13-103805-2
even though that wouldn't affect the semantics.

This works for ISBNs as well as staff id numbers at every little
employer in the world, or my numbering system for identifying all my
pets -- why should some of these go to NISO and others be shut out?
Just use tags.

(pro-http argument)

So it seems easier to you to get the info: scheme approved and
deployed than to deploy a web server?  If people were instead
encouraged to use

   http://niso.org/2003/isbn/0-13-103805-2

then NISO could provide whatever information it thought was helpful to
people who ended up doing an HTTP GET on it.   If it wanted to
mainting a proper ISBN database, it could provide information about
the book at that address; otherwise it could just point to some ISBN
resources and let people figure it out themselves.

So yes, some thought and organizational committment would be required,
but isn't that true anyway?  What other problems are there with this
HTTP approach?

In my slang, "stuck in INFO land" means having invested a lot in using
info: URIs.   (which I'm suggesting isn't a good idea)

I see some differences, but I think my argument applies to both of
them, so I applied it to both.  Just use http:.  If that doesn't work
because you don't trust the DNS, then use tag:.  What do you want from
info: (or doi:) that you can't get from http: and tag: ?

Heh.  :-) I think the ideas matter more than the people behind them,
for things like this.  It's only when the technical arguments stop
making sense that I start to care about the the personal motivations
in the background.
