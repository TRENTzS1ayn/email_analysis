So, as I understand it, 'info:' is just like 'urn:' except for:

- For 'info:xxx:', NISO hands out the 'xxx'
- There is no requirement for permanence or reference stability.

This latter is I suppose why you wouldn't want to do 'urn:info:xxx:' 
which otherwise would work just fine.

Is that oversimplifying?

Eric Hellman outlined, quite clearly, the notion that the absence of a 
built-in dereference mechanism is an advantage for political reasons. 
While his sentences parse and I have to acknowledge that empirically, 
it's possible for a human to believe this, the whole notion that an 
identifier is better because non-dereferenceable just comes from a 
different planet thatn the one I live on.

Like Roy says, let the market decide.

I think, though, that if the URN fans and the doi: and info: and tag: 
people all got together in a room and came out with a reduced number of 
URI schemes, they and the community would be winners.
