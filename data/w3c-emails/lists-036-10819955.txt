Well, you can do that with http as well. 

Linkbaton.com does something like that.   Try
        http://my.linkbaton.com/isbn/0-13-103805-2
and if you haven't configured linkbaton with your preferences to do
otherwise, you end up at the amazon page for that book, with a little
control window at the top for for access to other bookstores entries
on that book.

You end up trusting linkbaton.com to stay around vs. trusting people
to have the right software installed on their computer.  Hm.

Also, is there anything that says 
       http://niso.org/2003/isbn/0-13-103805-2
can't be intercepted by a proxy and suitably adorned?  I'm not sure
about that....
