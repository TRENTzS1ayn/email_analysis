But if, instead, a non-HTTP URI is used as the "canonical" means of
referring to books by ISBN (as, in fact, the "urn:isbn" namespace has
actually been registered and has an RFC defining it, as I recall),
then the end user has more flexibility in deciding what information
he/she wishes to retrieve on it.  When typed into a browser or
followed as a hyperlink, a "http" URI will always cause the resource
set up by the "owner" of that URI to be retrieved (or failed to be
retrieved in the case of 404 or DNS errors), while another scheme is
capable of user-driven configurability with regard to how to treat an
attempt to dereference it (or would be if browsers were sufficiently
advanced to give this capability, as I'd hope they'd be if such URIs
were in wide use).  I'd be able to set my browser to go to a page
related to that ISBN at niso.org, or amazon.com, or some other site
of my own choosing, or make a database query, or bring up a local
file from my own system, or whatever else I chose.
