OK, I'm guilty of not checking the cached URI before spouting off...
:)

So, I guess, if one wanted to refer specifically to the rabbit named
"Shakespeare", in contrast to the playwright of that name or any
other persons or animals answering to it, they'd need some other URI
scheme, like
"lifeform:/Animalia/Craniata/Mammalia/Lagomorpha/Leporidae/Oryctolagus
/cuniculus/US/MA/Amherst/2003/Shakespeare".
