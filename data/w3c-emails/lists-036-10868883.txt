Hi Sandro 

please forgive me if i take the "long road" here.

I heard you say that tag: might be not a good idea becouse it puts metadata inside an 
uri (a date for example or the email) .. and yet it is to me clear how legit that use is, 
you're just pointing to a concept and you need a point in time to refert to that concept, its 
not metadata its just .. a part pointer.. you must accept that we live in a universe where 
time is a fundamental concept...

... and yet you claim it is sensible to put a dns based, organization based, structure on 
top of something so clealy defined and independant as isbn? I don't get it. It appears so 
out of focus. Of course it would practically work, who argues that..  but honestly who is it 
going to use tag:giovanni@wup.it:isbn2:24524524 to indicate a isbn object (your 
argument against using tags)?? and even if someone do.. all you have to do is trow in a  
"owl:IsReallyTheSameStuffAs info:isbn" .. statement in your database and let the 
inference enjine take care of all the different ways people called shakespere. Sweet.  
(that's how i am going to handle it anyway.. i cant hope that people will agree on which 
uri to use for shakespere.. just trow in owl equivalence statements when needed to 
make the DB usable)
