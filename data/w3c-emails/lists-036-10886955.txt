Ira, you left out the important part of RFC 2277 where
it talks about scope.

   Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many of
   them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak out of
   the local context at times. RFC 1958 [RFC 1958] recommends US-ASCII
   for all globally visible names.

   This document does not mandate a policy on name internationalization,
   but requires that all protocols describe whether names are
   internationalized or US-ASCII.

In the context of RFC 2277, URIs are "names". I don't think any
waiver is necessary. Rather, there is separate work
(http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/ ) to define a new
protocol element (IRI) that is internationalized.
