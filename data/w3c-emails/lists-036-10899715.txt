I assume (despite the above) that the people behind "info:" include one 
or more who are capable of level-headed adult discourse.  I think it 
would be helpful to address the observation, made by one looking from 
outside, that there seem to be substantial areas of overlap between 
several of the proposed and existing URI schemes.  I suspect that I will 
not be the only one wondering about this. Let us consider the case, as a 
thought-experiment, where the IETF confers its blessing on each and 
every one of these schemes.  In this case, it would be tremendously 
helpful if there were a short taxonomic guide for newcomers to aid in 
selecting schemes for the URIs they might be in a position to mint.

In fact, if it were up to me I wouldn't let this whole thing go a step 
further until such a thing existed.  It would be interesting if there 
were significant classes of resources for which more than one competing 
URI scheme claimed to be the appropriate choice.  I'd probably be OK 
with that, within reason.
