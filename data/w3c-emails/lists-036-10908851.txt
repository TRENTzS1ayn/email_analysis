Actually, there is a proposal: 
http://www.projectliberty.org/specs/draft-lib-arch-metadata-v1.0-08.pdf 
which uses the DNS and DDDS (http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3401.txt), which 
solves this in part.  In particular URIs whose naming authority part is 
domain-based and a special case for the URN scheme. While the approached 
defined was intended to solve more specific issues, it can be made more 
generalized. It is scheme and protocol independant.  Whether you choose 
to use HTTP, SMTP, FTP or whatever.  It also allows for multiple 
representations of metadata, so you describe the URI in multiple 
formats.  It would, IMO, be an error to assume that for a given 
resource, you may only gt *one* metadata document.
