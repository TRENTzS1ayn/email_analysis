And this is IMO the big mistake that is being made. To presume that
users will never want to obtain information about the things denoted
by those URIs is wrong.

*I* expect to be a user of such URIs, and I certainly want to be
able to access authoritative information via those URIs, and not
by having to deploy a completely needless parallel infrastructure
when HTTP will work just fine.

But they *have*! It's called HTTP!

You seem to be arguing in circles here. The reason for creating
a non-resolvable URI scheme is because resolvable URIs for certain
things do not exist?...

Why not just invest the same effort into defining http: URIs for
all those things and then you'd both have the URIs you need *and*
they would be dereferencable -- and by using the web authority
component of the http: URIs, you can delegate resolution responsibility
to each registrant.

You have the opportunity here to essentially have you cake and eat it.

Cheers,

Patrick
