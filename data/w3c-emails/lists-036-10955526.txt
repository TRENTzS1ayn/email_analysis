Such 3rd party support is also provided by URIQA, but without losing
the fundamental ability to obtain authoritative information based on
the URI alone without having to know *where* to look for that
authoritative information.

A given info: URI, by itself, cannot tell you where to look for its
authoritative interpretation. That IMO is a fatal shortcoming within
the context of the Web and SW.

(if you never plan for info: URIs to be used in such a context,
then pretty much everything I say on this topic is irrelevant).

Cheers,
