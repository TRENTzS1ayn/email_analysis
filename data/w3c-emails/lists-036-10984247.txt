It solves it in theory. But until/unless DDDS is as ubiquitous as
HTTP, it does not count as a solution.

And as I've pointed out, there is no need for DNS+DDDS. One can
accomplish all of the goals set forth for URNs using HTTP.

Fine. So it is more talented than HTTP alone (maybe) but are those
extra features really needed so much that it warrants the deployment
of a parallel global resolution infrastructure?

If you mean allowing content negotiation in order to get those
authoritative descriptions is different encodings (RDF, N3, XTM,
etc.) sure. No problem with HTTP + URIQA.
