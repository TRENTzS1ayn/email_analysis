Well, given the situation that SW agents are not quite as
intelligent as most humans, it would be hard to expect
SW agents to be able to deduce that, and even humans may
still be left arguing about such conclusions.

The goal of technologies such as URIQA, based on the use
of HTTP meaningful URIs, is to be able to publish formal
descriptions, in RDF, which say what resources are denoted
by such URIs, in a way that has a precise mathematical
(and thus provable) form of expression. One may still
disagree with the published assertions, but at least it
will be clear what they mean (at least as far as what
the RDF MT can tell us).

Patrick
