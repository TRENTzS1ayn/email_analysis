I find I agree with Roy on this.

I read what he said as noting that it is *possible* to treat any identifier 
as dereferencable, not that to do so would always be desirable.  As such, I 
regard his comment not as describing a model but explaining a possibility, 
which in turn suggests (to me) that a model that depends on hard-and-fast 
distinctions between identifiers and locators doesn't always stand up.
