Except that I'd prefer different wording: it's not that those URIs aren't 
dereferencable, but that there is no authoritative resolution/dereferencing 
mechanism for them.  (I think "dereference" = "resolve".)

E.g. lambda: tag --> google("intitle:" + tag ) is a dereferencing function 
for tags that yields the page with that tag in its title.

But it's not an authoritative resolution/dereferencing mechanism.

Cheers,

Tim.
