| I think
| it would be helpful to address the observation, made by one looking
| from outside, that there seem to be substantial areas of overlap
| between several of the proposed and existing URI schemes.  I suspect
| that I will not be the only one wondering about this. Let us consider
| the case, as a thought-experiment, where the IETF confers its blessing
| on each and every one of these schemes.  In this case, it would be
| tremendously helpful if there were a short taxonomic guide for
| newcomers to aid in selecting schemes for the URIs they might be in a
| position to mint.
|
| In fact, if it were up to me I wouldn't let this whole thing go a step
| further until such a thing existed.

+1.

In addition, such a classification would perhaps aid in the
discussions. It might, at least, put some of our disagreements in
sharper relief.

| It would be interesting if there
| were significant classes of resources for which more than one
| competing URI scheme claimed to be the appropriate choice.  I'd
| probably be OK with that, within reason.

Given that some would no doubt claim http: covers the whole row or
column that it occupies in the table, some overlap is guaranteed.

I've long held the view that there is an important distinction to be
made between names and addresses, but I also find in recent years that
I've simply been using http: URIs for both. I'm not yet sure if this
is the result of exhaustion, sloppiness, or change of heart on my
part.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
