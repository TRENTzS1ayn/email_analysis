For resources retrieved via HTTP, my preference would be for a header
like See-Also or Description, which contains a URI reference indicating
a resource providing a machine-readable description of the requested
resource.

While it's possible to interpret HTTP URIs in inconsistent ways, there's
no requirement that you have to. As an example, let's say
<http://example.com/joe> denotes Joe Example. When you dereference you
might get a picture or a web page or some RDF, depending on how the
request is phrased. In all cases, the actual response would include a
Content-Location header telling you that the picture, say, can be found
at <http://example.org/joe.jpg>. Thus, there is no confusion between Joe
and his picture, bio, and FOAF file.
