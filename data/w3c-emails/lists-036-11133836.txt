I was complaining about "supplies representations" as a particular
kind of mode of "dereferencing".  When you "dereference" a "telnet:"
URI,
you actually interact with a service. It's a stretch to call it
"retrieving representations".  When you "dereference" a "mailto:" URI,
you wind up sending mail to a mailbox. What is the "representation"
that gets "retrieved".

Before deciding whether it is *possible* to consider all identifiers
as dereferencable, you'll have to define "dereferencable" in a way
that doesn't leave the statement empty and yet covers all of the
ways of interacting with URIs.

But the comment says "any URI", not just "some URIs". The model
either admits this assertion (for any URI, of being dereferencable
by supplying representations) or it does not.

I'm not sure where this came from. I certainly don't believe that
there can be hard-and-fast distinctions between identifiers and
locators. I do think there can be general guidelines for naming
and designing new schemes.
