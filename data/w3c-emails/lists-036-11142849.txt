Again, i agree.

Yes, because one day HTTP gets replaced with FOOP, and you would not 
want the metadata to instantly disappear as a result.  Rather just fold 
the (more flexible) and deployed DDDS from HTTP clients to FOOP 
clients.  DDDS is not realy a  _new_  parallel resolution architecture, 
it is simply a reuse of an otherwise under-used resource record in the 
existing DNS.

Also, if i have an existing URI for a person (eg mailto:me@here.foo), 
that i can remember, DDDS allows metadata for that usecase, but HTTP 
could not, without well-know rules.

No, i was really meaning using different vocabularies.
