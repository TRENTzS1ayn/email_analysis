Hi Larry,

You're right of course.  URI (as names) are NOT subject to RFC 2277.

I was unfortunately conflating them with (any other) _textual_
human-readable protocol elements, which certainly ARE subject
to RFC 2277.

Thanks for straightening me out.

By the way, shouldn't RFC 2396bis (URI) at least informatively
reference the IRI work?

Cheers,

Ira, you left out the important part of RFC 2277 where
it talks about scope.

   Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many of
   them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak out of
   the local context at times. RFC 1958 [RFC 1958] recommends US-ASCII
   for all globally visible names.

   This document does not mandate a policy on name internationalization,
   but requires that all protocols describe whether names are
   internationalized or US-ASCII.

In the context of RFC 2277, URIs are "names". I don't think any
waiver is necessary. Rather, there is separate work
(http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/ ) to define a new
protocol element (IRI) that is internationalized.
