There are two shortcomings to this approach: (1) it requires two
server requests to obtain metadata about a resource, making SW
agents who will be operating almost exclusively on metadata,
"second class web citizens"; and (2) it does not define any
constraints on what might be obtainable at that special metadata
URI. It may very well denote a schema defining thousands of
resources, yet the SW only needs to know about one of them.

One of the key components (if not *the* key component) of URIQA
is the definition of the concise bounded resource description.
It's other key feature is the ability to obtain such a concise
bounded resource description, by the URI alone, in a single
server request. Both are IMO critical to the efficient operation
of the SW.

Exactly.

Representations of resources are, themselves, resources and should
have distinct URIs. Certainly, in the case of a digital resource,
it may (and typically will) have a representation that is a bit-equal
copy of itself -- and in such a case, what is returned by a GET
request can be considered to be the actual resource denoted by the
request URI -- but that is a special case. The HTTP specs already
say that servers should indicate the distinct URI of representations
returned when they don't correspond to the resource denoted by the
request URI. Now, granted, the editors may have been thinking from
a slightly different perspective, but it's interesting to see how
well that meshes with the REST approach.

Cheers,
