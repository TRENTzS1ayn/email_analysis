URI List members who have opinions on the 
proposed info scheme should be aware that the 
trial use phase for NISO's OpenURL standard is 
coming to a close soon (Nov 1). the info scheme 
was developed in response to public comments on 
the first draft-for-public-comment, which used a 
non-URI naming scheme for the resources now 
handled under "info"

NISO's rules require the standardization 
committee to carefully consider and respond to 
comments on the draft standard.
