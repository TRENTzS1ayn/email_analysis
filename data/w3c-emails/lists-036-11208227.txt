I'm not sure about the utility of this discussion, but what the heck...

I partly agree with what you say here, but I don't think that makes Roy wrong.

I think there are many different ways of specifying "dereferencing" of a 
URI, and to the extent that when followed they all faithfully explain 
observable behaviours then they're all legitimate.  Some may be more 
useful, but that doesn't make the others wrong.

So when we talk about dereferencing a mailto: URI, I can explain that in 
terms of being supplied with a representation, and then doing something 
with that representation (which latter bit I don't think was part of what 
Roy said).  I'd suggest *an* explanation of clicking on a mailto: URI is 
that the user agent is supplied with a representation of a function that 
sends a message, and then executes it.  What representation?  I don't say, 
any more than http: says whether web pages are served as HTML or XHTML or 
something else.  Where does the representation come from?  Again, I don't 
say;  where does the representation of that described by a data: URI come from?

I don't claim that this is *the* way to define dereferencing, or the most 
useful way.  But I do think it is as coherent as other descriptions that 
might be offered.

Maybe we might agree that "supplies representations" is not a *complete* 
description of dereferencing?  (Even for web pages, they still must be 
displayed for the expected behaviour to be observed.)
