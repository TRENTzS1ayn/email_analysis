That draft ended up becoming RFC 3553 (BCP 73) which recommends someting
like this structure:

urn:ietf:params:media-types:application:vnd.kde.kword

The only thing that needs to be done is a short document published
asking the IANA to assign these and the exact form it would take. At
some point Graham and I were working on it but real life got in the
way...

Given the simplicity of the document I suspect it could be done within a
month or so....

Is the form urn:ietf:params:media-types:<type>:<subtype> sufficient?
