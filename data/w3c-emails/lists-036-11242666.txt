A combination of http techology and info human-resources might be
best.  How about using niso.org like I suggested [1], and writing an
informational RFC about it?  That puts everyone else writing RFCs on
notice about the existence of good URIs for these things, and doesn't
require real marketing dollars.   Or just announce it here, and word
will probably start to get around....

Of course, I'm not quite sure what NISO's role would be.
niso.org/isbn vs isbn.org...?  I dunno.  I guess they could be
maintaining a nice directory of this stuff.  And they could run a
redirector to help delegate authority and simultaneously help avoid
the car/document issue.
