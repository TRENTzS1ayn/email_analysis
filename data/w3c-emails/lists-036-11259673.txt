Hi Eric,
Note that the requirements for the URN NID process are set
out in RFC 3406 and that they do not require that the documentation
be a standards track document.  It requires review by a specific
mailing list (urn-nid@apps.ietf.org) and review by the IESG.   The
term "IETF consensus" has been seen as ambiguous on this, but
this case is very clear, as RFC 3406 sets out the steps admirably
well.
The IETF tree of the URI scheme registration mechanisms are
set out in RFC 2717, and Larry Masinter is currently working on an
update to the document to define registration procedures for other
trees.  There are two key issues for me in scheme registrations: 
can the registration adequately inform the reader where to turn
for information on protocol processing based on the scheme, and
can the registration adequately indicate who has change control
over those procedures?  Like many others, I don't see a great deal
of point for the proliferation of schemes, unless the protocol processing
indicated by the schemes is different.  For "pure" identifiers, not
intended to trigger protocol processing (be it dereferencing or something
else), I can see the need for a small handful of schemes, based on
expectations of permanence or minting algorithms suited to different
environments.  But a thousand flowers in that arena will only give us
hay fever, in my opinion.
regards,
Ted Hardie
