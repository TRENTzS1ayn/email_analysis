I don't know about widely used, but a single and stable name is
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/plain.  Because
text/plain is defined by the original RFC, dereferencing that URI
will not get you the definition, but analogues such as
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/pdf
and http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/image/png actually
do work.  In addition, with an appropriate base URI, you can actually
interpret text/plain as a relative URI.

Dan Connolly isn't authoritative, but IANA is, so a reference to a
stable part of the IANA site is as close to authoritative as you are
going to get in this space.
