So let me see if I have this right.

rfc 3553 says that IANA will assign namespaces for mime types, 
character sets, etc., but IANA has not done so because Michael 
Mealing and Graham Klyne have not written up how it should be done, 
apparently because  "real life" intruded.

  One hopes that such "real life" is more in the vein of "spend time 
with family" than "make powerpoint for antitrust lawyer".

anybody have suggestions for iso  codes?

Eric
