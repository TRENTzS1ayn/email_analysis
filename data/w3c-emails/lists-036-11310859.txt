As a proponent of this approach, any blame failure to progress it must be 
placed at least partially at my door, not "the IETF".  IETF is a volunteer 
organization without its own technical staff to do technical design work.

So, mea culpa.  My excuses are that
(a) I was waiting for some other work to come to fruition [1], which was 
finally published a few months ago.  (Hmmm:  the IESG tracker thinks it's 
still in the RFC editor's queue.)
(b) I am no longer in the same job, and have been occupied by many other 
things, so progressing this has not been high on my agenda.
(c) In the specific case of content types, it's not clear to me whether 
this URN route or the more comprehensive draft by Eastlake [2] would be the 
way to go.  I believe it would not be appropriate to have two different 
overlapping URI schemes if at all avoidable.  Accordingly, I have not 
actually prepared a draft to place content types into the framework of [1], 
not am I aware that anyone else has done so.

(Currently, I have work-in-progress drafts for CONNEG tags, language tags 
and RFC822 message headers for this framework, all of which I believe to be 
expired as Internet drafts.  I may reheat these when [1] is finally published.)

[2] Internet draft:  draft-eastlake-cturi-05.txt, now expired.  But Google 
will find some (maybe older versions) on the web.
