I fully agree with Julian. I just have seen some other such examples
in the jabber protocol at the IETF BOF, and have pointed this out
as a mistake.

I propose that we add something like this to the XML guidelines
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hollenbeck-ietf-xml-guidelines-05. 
txt), just before 4.8.1:

"Although there are some examples where this has been done in the
past, specifications MUST NOT create new URI schemes to define namespaces."

Regards,     Martin.
