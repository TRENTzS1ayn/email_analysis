I've been thinking about this.

It seems impossible to have a name without some degree of 
persistence, but some names can be very useful without the highest 
possible degree of persistence.

for example

x-info:ticker:nyse:TWX
could be made more persistent by adding a year, but the version 
without a year is accessible to more applications because a 
comprehensive database of tickers used over the years is not easy to 
come by. The freedom to trade off persistence for practicality can be 
useful.
