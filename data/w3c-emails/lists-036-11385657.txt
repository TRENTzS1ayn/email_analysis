for example

x-info:ticker:nyse:TWX

(the persistence issue aside, for the moment)

Here is a prime example of why an http: URI
would be a far more useful means of denotation
than an info: URI.

If the above were rather, e.g.

http://ticker.info.niso.org/nyse/TWX

Then web users could (potentially) obtain
a representation of the current state of the TWX
ticker simply by dereferencing it (with probable
redirection from ticker.info.niso.org to a NYSE
server) without any change to the present,
globally deployed web infrastructure.

That doesn't mean the URI *has* to resolve to
anything, but deciding whether it does, and if
so, to what, is not affected by the URI itself. 
And if decided at first to provide no representations,
a change to that decision has no impact on either
its denotation or its non-resolvable usage to date.

Likewise, SW agents could (potentially) obtain
(by means of a standardised solution such as URIQA)
an authoritative, formal, RDF description of the
denoted resource, which could include the state
of the ticker expressed precisely, suitable for
inference engines to e.g. deduce whether one
should buy or sell ;-)

But "hiding" the denoted resource behind an info:
URI (even if it can eventually be "found" via ad hoc
resolution schemes)  is hindering, not helping, the 
web and SW.
