Hi Ted:

When you have a URI such as <info:example-id:77788899> which identifies the
information asset "77788899" in the public namespace "example-id" and is
referenced on the Web using the "info" URI scheme, you can then do many
things.

A couple of examples should suffice:

1. The information asset can now be referenced within an RDF graph. For
example, 

@prefix dc:  <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .

<info:example-id/77788899> dc:creator "Ted Hardie".

2. The information asset can now be referenced within a ContextObject as
defined in the OpenURL Framework [1] (The OpenURL Framework is a standard
framework - being standardized through ANSI/NISO - that provides an
extensible mechanism for defining data structures for context-sensitive
linking.) For example, on a simple OpenURL one might have (whitespace and no
URL-encoding for clarity)

http://openurl.example.com/resolver?
      & url_ver = Z39.88-2003
& rft_id = info:example-id/77788899
& req_id = mailto:t.hammond@elsevier.com
& ...

Note that this could alternately be serialized as an XML document. Other
serializations are also possible. For example, a 'mod_context' RSS module
has already been published on the rss-dev list for review.

[Background. The "info" URI scheme has its origins in the OpenURL Framework.
Initially the Framework defined a 3-tiered naming architecture (URI/ORI/XRI)
but following public comments received a unified approach was adopted
whereby the new "info" URI scheme would allow all public information assets
to be referenced within the global URI naming architecture. Because of its
much wider applicability to Web applications of all kinds it was decided to
make the "info" URI scheme independent of the OpenURL Framework.]

So this is a contrast with urn: schemes, which do make a claim about
peristence.

One of the questions that comes up in reading info: is what that bridge
does--it does not provide a mechanism for dereferencing, and it does not
provide a common minting algorithm or set semantics.  You say below
that it "projects identity" and above that it allows them to be "represented
'on the Web'".  It's very hard to know whether this mechanism is the
right mechanism (or a valuable mechanism) without being clearer what
use is made of these.

If I see info:example-id:77788899, what do I do then that is 'on the Web'?

Thanks for taking the time to discuss this,
Ted
