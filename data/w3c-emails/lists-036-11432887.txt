There I must respectfully beg to differ. I assert that there is utility
beyond dereference. And that utility puts that resource (as referenced by
that URI) full square onto the Web. An admission to entry.

Would that all namespace authorities be minded to deliver such definitions.
(Yes, really!) Unfortunately I don't see that as happening any time soon
now. So, if there's no authoritative metadata, then getting the identifiers
onto the Web (via a URI) is IMO a pretty darn good start.
