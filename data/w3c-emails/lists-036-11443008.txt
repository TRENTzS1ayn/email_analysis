Our experience with  an http based dereferencing system for isbn, 
ticker, and journal articles (linkbaton) showed us that in the real 
world, web site producers are seldom willing to give up control over 
uri resolution, even if you pay them to do so.

However, they have been rather more willing to adopt a identifier 
resolution architecture that looks like:

http://customers.own.resolver/?id=x-info:ticker:nyse:TWX

with a default of no link or

http://producers.default.resolver/?id=x-info:ticker:nyse:TWX

so based on the observed behavior of the uri "market", the absence of 
inherent dereference is a selling point to large market segments. You 
can be a pessimist and say that this will cripple everything, or you 
can be an optimist and say, gee, maybe we can actually get this whole 
semantic web thing flying even on one wing.
