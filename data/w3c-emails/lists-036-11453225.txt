hello.

i was wondering what to do with the two drafts about an sms uri scheme
that i suggested a couple of weeks ago. as far as i know, they have been 
announced on uri-review@ietf.org and uri@w3.org, but so far i didn't get 
any feedback. should i wait a bit longer, and if so, how long? i am asking 
because i want to push the drafts, and i am not 100% sure about the 
procedure and what to do when. i simply want to avoid any possible delay 
because i should have done something and wasn't aware of it.

thanks and kind regards,
