Well, it seems we will simply have to disagree on that point.

You missed a crucial point I was trying to make in an earlier
post. Just because one uses an http: URI does *not* mean that they
must provide for resolution of that URI to representations or
description. But it gives them the possibility to do so, in the
future, if/when it is desireable and/or possible.

Yes, having *any* URI denotation for these key terms will be useful,
in the short term; but in the long term, I think that the adoption
of info: URIs for these terms will cause more grief than benefit,
particularly when folks realize that they really need/want to use
those URIs to get at information about the denoted resources and
have to start creating ad-hoc solutions to do so.

If http: URIs are used from the start, there is no immediate requirement
to provide dereferencability, but if/when the need/desire arises,
it's trivial to provide it. All the bits of the infrastructure are
there and waiting to be used.
