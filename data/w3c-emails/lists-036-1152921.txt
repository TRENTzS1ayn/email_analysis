I have set up a public cvs module for tracking the editing of
the URI spec and an associated test suite.

    http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/ietf-uri/

has all of the current stuff, including a validating xml version
of RFC 2396.  Anonymous cvs access is described in

    http://www.apache.org/foundation/cvs.html

I'll put together an issues list and welcome files and then put
it up on my website somewhere, followed by editing the spec itself.
So far, the only changes I have made (under the rev-2000
subdirectory) have been to update the front matter and improve XML
validation and XSLT translation of the document.
