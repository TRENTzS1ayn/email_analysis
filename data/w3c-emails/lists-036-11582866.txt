No. It simply means the Resource identified by that identifier isn't
persistent. Let's say that meta data record is deleted but then restored
at a latter date once an archive is setup. Does that mean the identifier
somehow winked out of existence but then came back 'alive' when some
representation of that resource connected itself back up to the network?
No. The identifier is always bound to what it was bound to originally
regardless of whether or not some network accessible representation of
that resource is available on any network or still exists in any
physical form. For example, I might assign an identifier to Abraham
Lincoln. Just because he's no longer around in any corporeal form
doesn't mean the identifier assigned to him is invalid or somehow
disappears....
