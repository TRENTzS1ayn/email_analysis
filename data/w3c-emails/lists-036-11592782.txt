Construe, construe!  There is no requirement that URN namespaces have
persistence of identifiers AS THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE.  urn:newsml: identifiers,
for example, are primarily intended for location independence and uniqueness:
persistence may or may not be important (notoriously, yesterday's newspaper
wraps today's fish).

The URN namespace process is a whole lot simpler and involves less effort
than the full URI scheme process.

In that case you could register an URN namespace urn:niso: and then do
your own allocation within that space.

In fact, this is an IETF mailing list, hosted by the W3C as a courtesy to
the IETF.  There are several other IETF mailing lists not hosted by the
IETF for various historical reasons.

Welcome to the IETF, by the way, and you are now a member of it.

Why, in that case assisting your member constituents to register URN namespaces
would be a most praiseworthy activity.

About as autovivified as the product of Mrs. Shelley's imagination, I fear.
Anyone can *use* a URI scheme, and no one will come around and cast you
into durance vile if it's not registered.  This does not make such uses
a Good Thing, no indeed.

And what are these basic requirements, and why are the solutions not
workable, pray tell?
