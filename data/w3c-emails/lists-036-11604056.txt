Indeed it is!

(1) It provides evidence that IANA, as a representative
of the Internet Community, still cares
enough about a consensus around this MIME type
to answer HTTP queries about it.

(2) The IETF endorses (as Best Current Practice) the
use of this URI for this purpose:

[[
2.5.  Location of Registered Media Type List

   Media type registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP
   directory "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/"
]] -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt *


(3) It provides operational support to avoid
collisions. If the left hand of IANA got disconnected
from the right hand and tried to use "text/html" as a
name for some other MIME type, about hot-dogs markup language,
say, they'd run into the existing use of "text/html"
if they tried to publish the hot dog markup language
definition.

(4) it explains what text/html means by reference
to RFC 2854.

Now it would be great if the link to RFC 2854 were
machine-readable. An HTML ref would contribute
google-kharma. An rdfs:isDefinedBy relationship
would be cool, but I'm not quite sure how yet.

But even the plain text reference published
in an HTTP 200 response makes the http URI
better than a URN in these three ways.

You asked for a single, stable, widely-used name.

The most widely used name for this media
type is "text/html". If you were happy with that,
you wouldn't be asking in uri@w3.org, so I presume
you're after a name in URI space. I'm somewhat
curious what you want that for, especially since
you don't seem to require network lookup.
But as I point out above, the IETF recommends
the ftp://... name.

It's evidently not very widely used; google
reports 6 links to it. I'm curious why you want
it to be widely-used. I suppose one reason is that
wide use contributes to stability, at least
in the case of HTTP URIs, where people are likely
to complain if the server(s) stop doing what they've
come to expect.

Relying on ISI is questionable, when it comes to
stability.

The area directors are drafting new media type registration document
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-freed-mime-p4-03.txt
and they seem to be correcting that problem, as well
as the problem that FTP doesn't allow for redirection,
to smooth any future moves, nor format negotiation,
to smooth evolution of data formats.

[[
   Media type registrations are listed by the IANA at:

     http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html

]]

The .html could go, for my purposes. I suppose I should
tell them that; the document is in last call.

This change in address as a consequence of change in media
type registration rules is cause to wonder about future
stability. That's why Mark Baker and I wrote an Internet
Draft suggesting stability as an IANA policy...

Quite. :)

The URI infrastructure did provide a URI. You expect the URI
infrastructure to get people to use it? I don't see why.

There's a lot of stuff around HTTP URIs that can contribute
to use... google kharma and the like. None of that
exists for URNs nor info: URIs.

rfc2048 enjoys some level of endorsement; it's an IETF BCP.

This is sorta close...
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets

if/when they make it available in HTML or RDF or
some such, perhaps you'll be able to use...
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets#iso8879

http://www.iana.org/root-whois/mx.htm

(again: better to lose the .htm)

If you care that it's published by ISO rather than IANA,
I'd have to search around some more. ISO likes to charge
for access to their information, so I'm not sure they're
willing to play the game yet.

It seems to me that the cost of finding these things is
manageable. And if they're really wanted/needed, the cost of
finding them in http space is likely to go down over
time.

Amen.

I think you're jumping to conclusions too early.

That's natural at the start of this consensus process, no?

NISO is welcome to play along. But I think the IETF isn't doing
so badly, really.

Surely that applies to all these choices, no?

Hmm... The URN nid registration process seems pretty efficient,
from what I can tell. I take the lack of lots of URN NID
registrations as evidence that they're not really needed,
not that they're cost-prohibitive.

And consequently, hardly any benefits. No google,
no operational support for conflict management.

I suggest NISO run a registry in http space.

The URI scheme registry is very valuable real-estate.
Putting something there and keeping it there costs
the whole IETF/Internet community. I don't see why the
whole community should bear this burden when
NISO can do its thing within the existing framework.
