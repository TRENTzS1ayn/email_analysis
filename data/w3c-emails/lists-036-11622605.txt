To add an argument against that approach:

I think it would be more valuable and less work if NISO
were to help its constituants register (and resolve) URN
namespaces than it would for NISO to maintain its own
registry. More valuable to NISO constituents and more
valuable to the Internet community, more valuable to users
of the registered names.

One value comes from the transparency of the process:
the policy and process for registering URN schemes are
more transparent than those for NISO schemes. The URN
scheme registry is more visible than the NISO scheme
registry. 

A second value comes from integration: it is more
valuable to have one widely-used registration system
than two.

A second argument against the approach:

If you ignore my first argument, and attempt to
register "info" as a URN namespace, I would argue
that "info" should instead be renamed "us-niso", to
distinguish the namespace authority from the Norske
Idrettsut?veres Sentralorganisasjon and the National
Irish Safety Organisation (both of which show up
when I Google on NISO).
