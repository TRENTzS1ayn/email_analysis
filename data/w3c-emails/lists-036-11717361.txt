I suggest NISO run a registry in http space.

The URI scheme registry is very valuable real-estate.
Putting something there and keeping it there costs
the whole IETF/Internet community. I don't see why the
whole community should bear this burden when
NISO can do its thing within the existing framework.

    It also seems to me that the proponents of the info: scheme
    are in "denial" about the general public desire for
    resolvability. I wonder if any surveys have been conducted
    which actually reflect a disinterest by the *users* of
    these oft-mentioned term sets.
