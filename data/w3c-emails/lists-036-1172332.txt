I agree. Pointing out the relationships in the new URI spec
is a good idea, but the two specs should stay separate
(in particular also because the IRI spec is further
along the path than the URI update).

Well, rather than the 'IRI group' (which is actually
the W3C Internationalization WG), this should be
considered by the HTTP folks.

For the moment, I think using the same list is okay.
If we get a real WG, we can create a new list. I guess
W3C may be able to host it.
