To add an argument against that approach:

I think it would be more valuable and less work if NISO
were to help its constituants register (and resolve) URN
namespaces than it would for NISO to maintain its own
registry. More valuable to NISO constituents and more
valuable to the Internet community, more valuable to users
of the registered names.

    It would be even more valuable and even less work if NISO
    were to help its constituents register http: URI namespaces
    (where there is no need to help them with resolution), than
    it would for NISO to maintain its own registry, or bother
    with additional resolution mechanisms needed for URNs.

    That would represent even greater value to NISO constituents,
    and much more value to the Web and SW communities, and IMO
    the greatest value of all to users of the registered names.
