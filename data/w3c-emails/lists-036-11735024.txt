Once upon a time there was a notion of multiple URLs (different schemes)
providing access to a given resource, because there are multiple ways to
access the resource. There might even be an 'ftp' URL for a bibliographic
record corresponding to an lccn, along with an http URL.  Now are these
locators or identifiers? I don't care.  The info URI for that lccn would (a)
not be a locator, and (b) be the cannonical identifier. (Whether its
"info:lccn......" or "urn:info:lccn ......")
