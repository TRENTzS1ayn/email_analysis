Sorry Patrick but the proponents of the info scheme are not in denial about
any such thing.  They neither claim to have a disinterest, nor assert the
existence of  disinterest, in resolvability.  They merely claim and assert
an (orthogonal) interest in identifiers that do not carry the burden of a
resolvability requirment.
