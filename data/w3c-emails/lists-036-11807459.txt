I think that the distinction of being a name or an address is not a 
property of any particular label-token, but a consequence of how it is 
used.  I think it's fairly clear that any (unambiguous) address *can be 
used* as a name.  I also think that, given an appropriate infrastructure, 
any name can be used as an address.  Whatever the standards community may 
decree, users will not feel constrained not to use the labels we provide -- 
URIs -- in any way that seems convenient to their purpose.

So while naming and addressing may be separate problems, I don't think we 
can insist that they use disjoint sets of tokens.
