Which is always the case for an IETF WG.

I think we need to replace this sentence with something explaining
the tendency to move towards UTF-8 (which is almost the same, but clearly
different from 'it's always UTF-8').

Well, first, there is a saying 'if it looks like UTF-8, it is UTF-8'.

For details, see

  [Duer97]        Duerst, M., "The Properties and Promises of UTF-8",
                     Proc. 11th International Unicode Conference, San Jose
                     , September 1997, <http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/mml/
                     mduerst/papers/PDF/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf>.

Second, it would be weird to use a special marker for the 'usual case'
and leave all the other cases unmarked.
