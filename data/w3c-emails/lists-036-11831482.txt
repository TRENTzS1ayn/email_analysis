I think the foundation work was John Shoch: "Internetwork naming,
addressing
and routing.", Proceedings, COMPCON, IEEE Computer Society, Fall 1979.
I can't find an earlier reference. The architectural concept of
separating
naming, addressing and routing as separate network functions has been
a strong foundation for the Internet.  It does seem that we're using
the words with slightly different meanings, but the distinctions hold
and are important in most of the Internet architecture.

Just because it is possible to use a name as an address and vice
versa doesn't mean that it is a good idea, or that IETF or W3C
should adopt a policy of not distinguishing between the two
or encouraging registration of namespaces where the primary
definitional role isn't clear.

This isn't a constraint on USERS (who can attempt to do whatever
they like with their URIs) but can easily be a constraint on those
who wish to get their namespaces inscribed in IANAs hallowed rolls.

Let us imagine a policy where namespaces that have (interesting, useful)
operational definitions get to be registered as URI schemes, namespaces
that have a definition which establishes a (possibly delegated)
naming authority / registration mechanism get to be registered as
URN namespaces...

... and namespaces that have neither get to be debated endlessly
on uri@w3.org, until the definers give up or else fit their schemes
into one of the two camps.
