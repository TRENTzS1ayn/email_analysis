I'm concerned about the way this conversation is going at the moment,
and I'd like us all to step back from the fray a bit.  We all recognize
the value of the overall URI framework, and I believe we all are
working to ensure that it continues to develop.  Let's not be confused
by differences in strategy into believing that we have different goals.

thanks,
Ted Hardie
