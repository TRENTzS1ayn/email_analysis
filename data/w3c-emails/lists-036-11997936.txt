If it's actually a directory, most likely the correct URI is

file:///e:/h/

with the trailing slash at the end.  People get really sloppy about
leaving out the trailing slash of directory URIs because most Web
servers are "nice" about it and redirect the slashless forms to the
version with the slash, but in fact the use of the wrong form can
produce serious mistakes in interpreting relative URIs, as seen here.
