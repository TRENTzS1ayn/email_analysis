I agree with Al's comment.

Some more comments :

1. What's the syntax for translating UNC paths ?
\\hostname\share\file.pdf -->
file://hostname/share/file.pdf

2. What about Macintosh drives ? They don't have ":" as a drive letter
separator.
So should it look like file:///MacHD1/folder/file.pdf ?

3. Directories:
<quote cite=
"ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-rfc1738bis-00.txt">

Some systems allow URLs to point to directories. In this case, there
is usually (but not always) a terminating "/" character, such as
in:

   file://usr/local/bin/

</quote>

I think this comment's place is not only for the file scheme.
It also should mention that not putting the terminating "/" in case of a
folder may influence on the result of relative URL resolving.

The example should be file:///usr/local/bin/ (3 slashes), unless you mean
the usr is the hostname.

4. OS with a single root drive
There is a difference between OS that has a single root drive and OS that
doesn't have it.

For example file:///usr/local/bin/ has a well defined meaning in Unix OS but
it is not defined in Windows or Mac, since there is no root drive in these
OS.
Maybe we can suggest that the System disk / drive will be regarded as the
root drive for Windows or Mac.
