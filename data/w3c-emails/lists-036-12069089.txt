Further to my 2 September note to the list (Subject: DOI and the non-IETF
tree) I'd like to request that "DOI" be added to the "Informal list of URIs
maintained by http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html, which states "This
is (an attempt at) an exhaustive list of URI schemes. We try to list them
all, whether they're standard or not".

Pending the outcome of a resubmission of the DOI as URI either within or
outside the IETF tree as noted in the Sept 2 note, I'd like to ask that
"DOI" be reserved on that list for this scheme, "Digital Object Identifier".
An appropriate link to documentation will be made on resubmission of the
draft.
