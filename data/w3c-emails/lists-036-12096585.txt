I don't either.  It's been quite a while since I looked at the OpenURL 
materials, but at the time it seemed like a sensible attempt to work out 
a standard for querystrings that anybody could use.  While obviously 
it's designed with HTTP URIs in mind, clearly nobody is suggesting that 
the use of the standard become compulsory.  Those who assign URIs to 
resources can choose to use this or not, and I don't think there are any 
architectural problems raised.  -Tim
