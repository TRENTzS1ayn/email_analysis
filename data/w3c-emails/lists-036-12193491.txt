 From http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes.html:

[[[ This is (an attempt at) an exhaustive list of URI schemes. We try 
to list them all, whether they're standard or not. If you know of any 
that aren't here, please tell us via uri@w3.org. ]]]

The page already lists several unregistered / pre-registered schemes.

Cheers,
