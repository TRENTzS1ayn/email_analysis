I'd be real nervous about automatically concluding that a querystring is 
OopenURL compliant based on syntax in the querystring.  Sorry, I haven't 
read this stuff in a while so if there is a 100%-unambiguous way of 
ascertaining whether a URI's syntax is intended to be OpenURL-governed, 
that would be a really good thing.

I thought one of the nice things about this kind of general framework is 
precisely that it doesn't inherently constrain the kinds of things you 
can use it for.

Heh, you're not the only group wrestling with that one.  It's generally 
the case that with URIs the only way to find out if there's a 
representation is to ask for one.  And just because there isn't one 
there today doesn't mean there won't be one available tomorrow.

I would have been happier with a name that reflected the reality that 
this is mostly aimed at standardizing syntax & semantics in the query 
string, but whatever.
