Re: http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-rfc1738bis-00.txt

Section 2.1: Common Internet Scheme Syntax

I suggest removing this, completely, since this
material is redundant with 2396bis.

Section 2.2: ftp URL scheme.

This is worth keeping, but might
be better as a separate document, and asking
ftpext to review it. ftpext looks moribund,
though.

section 2.3 Gopher
I think we should drop this; people can read about it
in the (historical) RFC 1738 if they want.

section 2.4 news and nttp
Since there's a separate internet draft on
the subject, we should just revive that
and leave it out of this document.

Section 2.5 telnet
I suppose this needs to be updated to
remove the user:password part of the spec,
since it isn't usually implemented anyway.

section 2.6 wais
This should be dropped, as with gopher.

section 2.7 file
I like the discussion we've been having on
file, and I think it's useful. Probably
updating 'file:' is the most useful
thing this RFC can do.

section 2.8 prospero
drop.

Section 3: security considerations
I think there are separate security considerations
for 'ftp' and 'file' and 'telnet'.
