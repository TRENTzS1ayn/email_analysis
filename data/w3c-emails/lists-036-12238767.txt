I think that you're saying that you don't like the
'vnd-' tree because you think the scope recommended
in it is broad enough.

I think it's simple to change the scope statement.
RFC 2048, when talking about the 'vnd' tree for MIME
types, merely says:

   The vendor tree is used for media types associated with commercially
   available products.  "Vendor" or "producer" are construed as
   equivalent and very broadly in this context.

   A registration may be placed in the vendor tree by anyone who has
   need to interchange files associated with the particular product.
   However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or
   organization producing the software or file format.  Changes to the
   specification will be made at their request, as discussed in
   subsequent sections.
....

   While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in
   the vendor tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review
   is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
   specifications. Registrations in the vendor tree may be submitted
   directly to the IANA.


If the wording in the 'vndurl' draft is changed to be more
neutral about the context of use, would that eliminate
this particular objection to the use of vnd-doi?
