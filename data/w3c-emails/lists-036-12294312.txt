Re: Many-to-One vs  One-to-One

I think the question is ill-formed; it assumes that
the space of resources has a well defined equality
relationship.

Before you can ask if there are two URIs U1 and U2 such
that U1 != U2 but 
ResourceIdentifiedBy(U1) == ResourceIdentifiedBy(U2)

you have to know what '==' means for resources. But
there is no well-defined equality for resources, so
the question doesn't make sense.


many-to-one and one-to-one only apply to spaces with
well-defined (and, for that matter, unique) equality
relationships.
