The formal semantics for RDF talks about there being a *set* of resources.

To define a set, there needs to be some notion of equality, or sameness, 
which I would assume to be the notion used in talking about one-to-one or 
many-to-one.

Of course, this line is applicable only to a semantic web viewpoint, I 
guess others might vary.  Do we mean for resources to be set theoretic in 
nature?
