The mid: (message-ID) and cid: (content-ID) protocols for referring to mail
messages and parts thereof, respectively, have never had any wire protocols
tied to them, since the scheme-specific part is just a foobar@bazquux.example.net
string, not usable for retrieval.

Because the IETF may wish to define a scheme called doi in the future.
(They get the short names because they were there first.)  Qualifying the
scheme name makes sense for the same reason that qualifying host names does.
In the beginning, all Arpanet hosts had simple names maintained in a HOSTS.TXT
file, but that doesn't scale -- too many people wanted to give their hosts
simple names, and so the DNS hierarchy was born.

In the sense that the ftp: URI scheme is defined by a document under IETF
change control, namely RFC 1738.
