Hi Larry,
Some responses inline.

Other folks on the uri mailing list may want to comment on this; 
there was a distinction
at one point in history between how some folks understood URLs and other forms
of URIs that maps at least broadly to the view above.  That 
understanding evolved
over time, and the current understanding is captured in RFC 3305, 
which describes
the two views as "classical" and "contemporary".

I think the idea that it is built into the scheme name is essentially 
because there is no other part
of the identifier's structure that it really could be built into 
without interfering with
the functionality of that part of the structure.  To expand your 
question a bit--what is
the point of building the information into the identifier at all?  My 
personal view is that
it makes it easier to be sure that the protocol processing about to 
be applied to the
identifier is correct.  By associating the scheme name with the 
registry, you help
ensure that the implementors can be confident looking to the registry 
(or registration
tree) for data on the protocol processing.  The registry could run 
the registration
system as a flat namespace, but we've had a fair of amount history tell us that
increases the likelihood of conflict and that the mechanisms for 
resolving those
conflicts get ugly fast.

If we have a registry like:

org-orgname-schemename:

We can punt the question of who owns orgname to someone else pretty easily.  If
we have it as org-schemename and two different orgs conflict over schemename,
we're in charge of the resolution.  We may not be good at that, it 
may take a good
bit of time and effort that we could better spend on things we're better at.

There may be less of a reason to distinguish between:

org-orgname-schemename:

and

sdo-sdoname-schemename:

or

vnd-vendorname-schemename.

I hope we can have a productive further discussion on this point.

The IETF has change control over the documents which it publishes.  Where those
documents are protocol specifications, since it can change the 
documents, it can
change its published view of the protocol specification.  Any adherence to the
view published by the IETF is voluntary.
