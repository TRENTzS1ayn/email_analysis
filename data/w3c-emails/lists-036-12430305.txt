That is the risk: that we as the IETF actually act like that.

For the man in the street, there is a benefit if widely used schemes
get plain names without a series prefix.  When IETF benefits the
man in the street, IETF benefits.

DOI sounds like a second run at defining URNs that seems to have
acquired a following and demonstrated interoperable practice.

That may merit a plain-Jane name.
