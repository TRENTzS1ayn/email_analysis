Larry,

   I'll state it again, for the billionth time. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT
TO USE THE DDDS FOR URN RESOLOUTION. None of the currently registered
URN namespaces use it. URNs were designed to be usable by many different
resolution mechanisms. 

If you insist on bringing this up again I'm going to have to assume
you're either deaf or a liar.

That is just one very limited way of using a URN. And frankly, none of
the currently registered URNs use them that way. So again, either your
not paying attention or you are being intentionally obtuse (also called
FUD).

The URN approach? The URN is just a namespace. There are several
resolution mechanisms to choose from. DDDS is just one of several.

No. Never has. I.e. there is urn:isbn:0-596-00027-8 and there can be 
http://isbn.org/?isbn=0-596-00027-8. There is even a spec for using
ISBNs within the nbn URN namespace.  Although I can't see why you would
want both a URN namespace and a URI scheme for the same thing. Unless
you want to create an escape hatch for yourself so you can tell everyone
that "No, we just registered the URN namespace so we could get the URI
scheme, we never intend on using the URN version".

Larry, stop the FUD. Its gotten way to transparent.....
