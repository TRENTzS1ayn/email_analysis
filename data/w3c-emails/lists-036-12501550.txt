Ah... so in fact, the whole thing relies on HTTP and DNS after all,
and the name http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35057062 is sufficient
for your purposes. I don't see any reason why these things
need any other name in URI space; whatever policy guarantees
are associated with a new doi: URI schema (or even a
urn:doi: namespace) have already been associated with
http://dx.doi.org/... . And I see lots of costs to having the world
support more than one name for them.

"Authors of specifications SHOULD avoid introducing new URI schemes when
existing schemes can be used to meet the goals of the specifications."

"To help parties know when they are referring to the same resource, it
follows that URI producers should be conservative about the number of
different URIs they produce for the same resource."
