Not at all.  The IETF will never use a name with a hyphen in it, so any
hypothetical "doi" will not conflict with "org.foo-doi" or "vnd.ms-doi".

No, only all unhyphenated names.  Just as "thomas.loc.gov" belongs to the LoC,
but "thomas.reuters.com" belongs to Reuters, but the bare name "thomas" 
is not available for anyone.  In this case, the IETF gets the first-mover
advantage of being allowed to use bare names like "http" instead of "ietf-http",
but that's small potatoes.  The essential point is that people assigning
scheme names don't step on each other.

In that case there's probably a case for IETF registration.
