The criteria the IETF uses for defining new schemes in the IETF tree
are set out in RFC 2717.  From the Introduction:

    A registration process is needed to ensure that the names of all such
    new schemes are guaranteed not to collide.  Further, the registration
    process ensures that URL schemes intended for wide spread, public use
    are developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public manner.

That is, avoidance of collision is a major motivating factor for
having a registration scheme.   I would personally find it unlikely
that the IETF would approve a scheme that seemed likely to
conflict.  It is likely that the IETF will try to get folks to register
their schemes as early as possible under some tree, so that the
discovery of potential conflict can occur before the deployment.
That was why I asked Larry to take up the non-IETF tree document
and move it forward.

I think some of the comments made to date have helped scope that
work, and I encourage them to continue, but the goal remains
avoiding collisions and identifying the token holder for change
processing where that is not the IETF.

 From the IETF perspective, these identifiers are for protocol processing,
and we can get the processors to pay attention to the strings.  If
the strings org-idf-doi: and org-isakmpc-doi: are both called DOI by
their respective communities of use, the protocol processor can
tell the difference even if a human wandering into the room has to
ask whether we discussing domains of interpretation for key management
or documents and their metadata.
