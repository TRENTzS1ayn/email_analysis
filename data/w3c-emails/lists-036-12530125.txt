I don't want to take up too much list space with this, but I do feel 
that I have to respond to a few points:

o I wonder if I'm being confused with someone else. I joined CNRI in 
the fall of 1996 and my knowledge of the development of URN is all 
second hand and not particularly detailed.

o DOI and handle are not synonymous. The DOI per se does come out of 
the handle system namespace and the default resolution mechanism is the 
handle system, but DOI has its own set of requirements, metadata rules, 
etc. and if it wished could at some point use some other resolution 
mechanisms. The reverse is also true -- there are applications of the 
handle system other than DOI. The most recent notable effort is the 
DSpace project out of MIT/HP.

o I can't speak for others, but I am not being disingenuous. I can 
assure you that the DOI community and the various handle system users 
are not alone in wondering which way to go with the various url/urn/uri 
questions. In terms of the handle system, we are on what we consider to 
be a logical path and in front of any kind of IETF id registration is 
the complete specification of the system itself in the form of 
informational RFCs. You may have received different impressions over 
the years from other people at CNRI, but any course changes were due to 
our own indecision, not to any grand Machiavelian schemes.
