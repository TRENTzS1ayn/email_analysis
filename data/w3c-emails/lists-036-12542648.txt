Looking back at my history some of the original discussions in '94 were
with Bill Arms. But I visited CNRI once and had numerous discussions at 
IETF meetings where we discussed all of this with you and Sam. One of
the topics that I thought we had cleared up was that the DDDS method of
resolution is not, has never been, and will never be a required method
of resolution for URNs. Specifically, RFC 2141 never mentions any
particular resolution mechanism and indeed never mentions any
requirement that there ever be one.

In that case, 'urn:doi' makes so much exact perfect sense that it
requires extremely tortuous logic to come up with any objections at all.

Many of us were promised, on several occasions, by both Sam and yourself
that a URN registration document would be forthcoming. Each time you had
objections you were shown that those objections were incorrect and that
indeed, a URN namespace would be the best slot for DOIs. With the
exception of that age old "http is the only scheme anyone ever needs"
issue, there has always been consensus that DOIs (actually, anything
that uses the Handle namespace) should have always been a URN namespace.
Indeed URNs were designed specifically for handles from the very
beginning.

I've reviewed all of the objections raised by CNRI and the Foundation
and invariably they're either wrong or they take a mild suggestion found
in the RFC 2141 document and turn it into some uber-MUST. In my
experience when someone interprets documents in such a tortuous and
illogical manner it usually means there are other motivations. I would
like to be proven wrong but so far I haven't....

We could put this entire thread and issue to bed with one simple
document that would probably take less than a month to run through the
process. What is so damning about a URN namespace that is forcing you
guys to postpone incorporating DOIs and Handles into the infrastructure?
What could be worth this much typing?
