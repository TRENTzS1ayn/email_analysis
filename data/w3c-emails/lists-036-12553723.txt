Hi Michael,

We have discussed registering the "urn:hdl:" namespace several times both
here at CNRI and at the ietf meetings. It is especially intended for the
application at the Library of Congress. The consensus is that we are going
to work on it, and it's merely a matter of time. I, for one, had some
deadline to catch and have to work tonight. Won't know when I would find the
time to work on the urn draft. Maybe the ietf meeting:-)?.

This said, we do have several issues that need to be addressed before we
register any URN namespace. I was planning to discuss them with you when I
find the time to work on the urn draft, but it seems this is a good time to
make them clear (especially since you mentioned me in your email):

1) The Handle System is a secured global name service for digital objects
(different from DNS which is for network address translation). There may be
many applications of the handle system. Each of them may register its own
URI/URN namespace (the same is true for DNS, as evidenced in
"telnet:<dns-name>" and "ftp:<dns-name>" URL schemes). Before we register
"urn:hdl:", we have to make sure that we won't be denied from registering
the "hdl:" URI scheme. The later may be used for some totally different
applications. We have discussed this issue at the IETF meeting, but I was
told that this may not be allowed by IESG. Could someone clarify this issue
here?

2) Registering "urn:hdl:" has nothing to do with "doi:" URI. These are two
different kinds of applications. The former is for a specific application
(for LOC) that want to use "urn:hdl:" as a pure namespace. The later is a
much more complicated application. "doi:" URIs are intended to reference
actionable DOI identifiers and its services. It may have parameters and
query components (or even segments) involved in its syntax. Do we know if
any of these is applicable to URN (syntax)? If they do, what about
persistency? RFC2141 doesn't have the answer for this.

3) Personally I think URN is an excellent concept. But I can't understand
the usefulness in enforcing the "urn:" prefix. From user's point of view,
what exactly we can gain by using "urn:doi:" that we cannot by using "doi:"
URI? Consider that "doi:" is already used in journal paper reference, will
it justify the effort to make the transition? I think this will help DOI
community in making a better decision.

4) We understand that URN doesn't mandate any bootstrapping mechanism like
DDDS. Then what is the mechanism for RDS? If we allow different mechanisms
to be used, how do we guarantee the integrity of it?

5) From engineering point of view, when we design a system, we want to have
it based on something that really works. DOI is a working system that is
currently in use. It has to define its namespace on something that's working
or is surely going to work. For URN to be acceptable, there are still work
need to be done, before we can convince people that it's really going to
work. There are many IETF standards that doesn't end up working. Can we say
with confidence that (when) URN is going to work? For example, do we have an
estimate as to when Microsoft will recognize the "urn:" scheme? What will be
the RDS mechanism that they use?


Again, I hope that you won't think I'm against the URN work. Instead, I
think it has the potential to be useful. But given the current circumstance,
I am not convinced yet that URN is suitable for DOI (and I'm not the one
making the decision for that). I hope that, by sharing my doubts with you
here, we can all get a better understanding of the situation and help people
make a better decision.


Best regards,
Sam
