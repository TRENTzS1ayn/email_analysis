Hello Larry,

                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
Interesting hybrid... trying to decide which way you were jumping on this
one :-)

I like the idea of a univerally applied principle such as you suggest. Could
you expand a little on "'naming authority assignment' schemes". I think I
know what you are getting at... but I'm trying to see why, for example, the
http URI scheme wouldn't fall on the URN namespace side of this distinction
- it establishes URI assignment authorities  that then control the
assignment of URI within some sub-space. Maybe URI assignment authorities
don't fall within the locus of what you mean by a 'naming authority'.

It's a while since I looked at DOI (and wondered why http://purl.org or urn:
style URI wouldn't do). IIRC there is a delegation scheme within DOI so that
sub-spaces within DOI space get further assigned to 'digital object'
publishers.

I like where I think you are going, but I think it hinges on what is meant
by  "'naming authority assignment' schemes".

Regards

Stuart
