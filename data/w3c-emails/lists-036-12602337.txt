I thought this was one of the shortcomings of HTTP, that one
cannot know based on the representations one might GET what
exactly is denoted by the http: URI.

The HTTP protocol seems only to be telling you how to obtain
representations of whatever is denoted by the URI, not how to
obtain the actual semantics/denotation of the URI.
