Isn't that one of those vexing questions that has generated large volumes of
traffic on the uri and www-tag lists?

I can see that the HTTP and FTP schemes (and others) do so in a very
operational sense (as you observe below) that describes how to process the
URI to retrieve representations (of something [maybe]) - or more generically
how to make use of it in a particular context.

A large number of the early URI scheme registrations speak of URIs being
used to 'designate'. Then there are other terms floating around that may
have subtle differences and similarities of meaning, like 'denote',
'indicate' and 'identify'. 

So... I'm not sure that any of the URI scheme registrations I've looked
actually "what resource the URI identifies." 

Folks also quibble about whether is some sense or other its possible to
determine the sort of thing a URI identifies - and indeed whether can even
be said to identify a single thing.... agggghhhh I can see the thread
explosion coming round for another cycle....

I can see that operationally many schemes describe how a scheme URI is used
to access a resource... but whether that constitutes a determination of what
resource the URI identifies is unclear (to me). It may be satisfatory for
some. In some sense the resource is then whatever you perceive it to be as a
result of the experience of interacting with it. Different individuals may
reach different, reasonable, conclusions about what resource is being
'identified'.

I guess this all collapses into a rathole if one is talking solely in the
operational sense of determining the resource that the URI identifies - that
seems a very pragmatic view (good), which has successfully avoided answering
the question of what the URI identifies...

I think this is getting close... but I have had to think about this...

RFC2616 defines the syntax and semantics of the HTTP URI scheme wrt to
operational use of HTTP scheme URI with the HTTP protocol. As I understand
it this is not a closed definition and other uses are allowed... but
unspecified. However, in circumstances an HTTP scheme URI is used to access
a resource, I can think of no-circumstances in which the access protocol is
not HTTP... can you? ie. the use of the HTTP protocol is implicit when
dereferencing an HTTP URI.

For these schemes/namespaces (I don't know if this is true of all of them)
there is no single define way of deferencing an identifier that is implicit
in the identifier. The specification of does not link the identifier to the
use of any particular operational mechanism for resolving access to the
referenced resource.

I think this would reinforce the notion that different URI schemes imply
different access mechanisms AND that with the exception of the URN scheme,
the intended access mechanism is implicit in the definition of the scheme.

How do we square the gatewaying of other URI schemes over HTTP as an access
mechanism? Maybe its that there is a native or intrinsic access mechanism
defined with the scheme, but that does not preculde other means of access
being used.

Interesting... you drafted tdb: and duri: as URN namespaces... and I think
that fits with the above notions of definitional and heuristic operational
protocols. Section 5.4 of .../duri.html seems at best heuristic... and I see
little (maybe nothing) in the way of an operational way of dereferencing
duri/tdb identifiers. So I think you made the right call in the draft... 

I haven't looked at "hash" URIs.

I think it could work... although maybe we should see if we can categorise a
few more examples before really patting ourselves on the back.

I think that would perhaps require a test to see if several *independent*
people could apply them to a set of test cases and make substantially the
same deterimination. Application to a number of existing schemes/namespaces
might reveal some anomallies which would have to be grandfathered simply
because oe installed based.

I think it would be hard (politically) to apply new criteria to work in
progress.
