That document says:
"This Internet-Draft will expire on October 23, 2002."
Does that mean that the "duri" and "tdb" URNs are an abandoned
effort, given the lack of a non-expired draft pertaining to them?

Incidentally, when we're discussing that draft, maybe we should call
it urn:tdb:20021023:http://larry.masinter.net/duri.html instead of
just http://larry.masinter.net/duri.html, since after all we're
discussing the document itself, not its URI!  :)
