I have removed it for the next rev.

All URNs are clickable -- they are just less likely to result in a
useful retrieval, at least until a resolution mechanism is deployed.

There are no successful alternative trees at this time and I would
personally forbid the use of 'x-' prefixes if that were possible.

I have added more text to explain it better (hopefully I won't get 
shot).

Done.

Done (I was trying to avoid section number change, but I agree it is
better to get it right).

To make it easier to follow. *shrug*  Why else would we have that 
section?

Done.

Done.

No, it doesn't need to be registered to become a scheme.

The next page of the specification?  It should continue -- the automated
formatting leaves something to be desired, but I see no problems with
the files.
