Sorry Larry, I must have missed the point you were making in the extract
below. I don't recall URIs being scoped as 'protocol elements intended for
communication' in RFC 2396. (Can't actually find that 'communication'
wording.) In fact, RFC 2396 is only concerned with the /syntax/ of URIs.

I also note that in RFC 2026, Section 1.1 we have the following:

   "The Internet Standards Process described in this document is
   concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are
   used in or by the Internet, *whether or not they are part of the
   TCP/IP protocol suite*."  [My emphasis - */*]  

Now I am left wondering just where URI is actually scoped for purpose. Would
appreciate any pointers to such a mission statement for URI.

Seems to me that we need to scope URI adequately, before worrying about how
new schemes are quartered under the URI allocation.

Thanks,
Tony
