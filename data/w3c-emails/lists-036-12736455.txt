Are you sure?

[I speak as a fool.]

Under the old regime, if a hyper-document contains a reference by means
of a fully-qualified URI-reference, that is to say an absolute URI and
a #fragment clause, the referential semantics would appear to have been
changed by the current language.

In RFC 2396, if the reference contains an absolute URI then the reference is
never compared with the BASE and the reference is interpreted as to the
resource identified in the URI without regard for the fact that the current
DOM is a representation of that resource.  Caching and retrieval behavior
is undefined.  Whether the User Agent navigates to another node in the 
currently
constructed DOM or retrieves the resource afresh from wherever across the net,
either is regarded as conforming to the referential semantics of the reference.

In the present draft this behavior is tightened so that all references are
compared to the incumbent BASE for the current DOM and no refresh is performed
if the reference can be satisfied from the current DOM.  This constitutes a
tightening of the referential semantics for the case where the URI-reference
is fully qualified (contains an absolute URI) which happens to agree with the
BASE.

So yes, the behavior is the same as before for #foo references.  But the
specified behavior and therefore the referential semantics has changed for
the case of absoluteURI#foo references.  The referential semantics does not
only include which resource is referred to.  It matters in this case whether
the reference is to any representation of the resource or locally to the
representation making the reference.

Admittedly, the specification has been changed in this case to agree with a
widely-implemented narrowing of the formerly-acceptable behavior, but this
is a change in what the specification asserts by way of referential semantics.

The semantic change is to extend #foo semantics to BASE#foo URI-references.
