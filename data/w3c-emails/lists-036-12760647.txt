Fair enough.  So the special interpretation of "#foo" in the resource
denoted by "http://www.example.com/blargh" is extended to "blargh#foo"
and "http://www.example.com/blargh#foo" as well.

But it seems to me that (for good or ill) this also means that if a
base URI is available, say "http://www.example.com/stat/blargh", then
"#foo" now means "http://www.example.com/stat/blargh#foo".

Is this a correct reading of 2396 bis?
