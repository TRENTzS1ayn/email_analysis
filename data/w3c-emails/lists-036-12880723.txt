Nor is 'point' defined in geometry.

The URI spec is much more concrete than geometry
in that the characters are enumerated explicitly.
http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#collected-abnf

i.e. you want to know what a character is? 'a' is
a character, as is 'b' and so on, and there aren't
any others.

While I don't think this is necessary, I don't suppose
it would hurt. But suggesting that the editor "should at
least make an attempt to define..." is, as far as I can tell, less
effective than offering suggested text. I would guess
that Roy has attempted to draft text that makes everybody
happy some hundreds of times (hmm... thousands, if you
count the HTTP spec too); I wouldn't be surprise
if he scans messages for suggested text and deletes
those that don't have any summarily.
