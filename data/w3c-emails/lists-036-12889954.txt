I seem to have struck a nerve. I thought I was humbly deferring to the experts
to choose the ideal wording to address certain issues, and to decide whether I
am overestimating the importance of the issues I am raising -- that is, if
anyone thinks that I even know what I'm talking about at all.

I feel that I can invest time in explaining the nature of an issue and why I
feel it warrants an edit, and I can invest time in making explicit suggestions
of edits (essentially making the edits myself). As a very new and temporary
party to the discussion, with no credentials and no formal role other than
interested observer (unless RFC 2396bis is more of a community effort than I
am led to believe), it seems reasonable to concentrate more on the former
investment than the latter, until directed otherwise. If there are posting
guidelines that I have missed, please send the URL my way.

In the meantime, I hereby revoke my suggestion that "character" be explicitly
defined. Your message made me realize that it would probably be inappropriate
to make such a definition, since URIs are canonically defined in ABNF terms,
and therefore inherit ABNF's implicit "definition" (declaration, rather) of
character.

I do still feel that opportunities to correct widely-held misperceptions about
character & encoding-related concepts & terminology should not be squandered,
if retention of said misconceptions makes the spec more difficult to
understand or detracts from its usefulness and implementability. But whatever.
Never mind.
