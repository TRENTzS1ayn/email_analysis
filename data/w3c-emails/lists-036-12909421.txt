Did it seem that way? Maybe I have grown a nerve around
"you should...", not to mention requests for definitions
of primitive terms like 'character' and 'resource'.

Sorry about that.

If I didn't think you had something to contribute, I probably
wouldn't have answered at all. ;-)

It is most certainly a community effort.

"1. What Is the IETF?
The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized group of
people who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet
technologies.

There is no membership in the IETF. [...] The closest thing there is to
being an IETF member is being on the IETF or Working Group mailing lists
(see Section 1.3)."

I thought it would be easy to find a message from Roy saying
"the best way to contribute is to send suggested text"
but a few minutes of searching turned up nothing like that.
Maybe I'm imagining it.

Glad you agree.

Yes, well, I think lots of people would like to clear that sort
of thing up. But finding the right words isn't easy.
