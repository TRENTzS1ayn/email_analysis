Reviewing the issues list, I discover this issue:

 041-encodingSection 2 on encoding causes too much confusion
 http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#041-encoding

So in some sense, the question has been asked and answered.
If, after reviewing the history of the issue, you can see
something that wasn't considered, or some way to improve
the text, please let us know.
