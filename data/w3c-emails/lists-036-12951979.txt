Please keep in mind that the URI technology predates UTF-8 by at
least 5 years, and the IETF policies on identifying charset in use
are even later than that.  As such, they do not apply.  We are
way beyond the design phase.

The hardest part of editing a spec towards standard status is
recognizing what can be tweaked without breaking all of the deployed
implementations that justify it being a standard.  New ideas need
to be proposed as separate specifications and deployed to the
point where they attain equal status with the standard.

That doesn't mean change is impossible -- it is simply slow and not
always correct (some of the changes I made for RFC 2396 simply did
not work out in practice and were not universally deployed).

BTW, I have 56 stored requests for changes to the next draft, so
please accept my apologies if I don't respond to all of the
commentary.  I read them all, but suggestions that include text
get first dibs because they are simply easier to enact or respond
to directly.
