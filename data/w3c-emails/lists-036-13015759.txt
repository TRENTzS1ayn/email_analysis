Thanks for the swift reply.

Yes, scenario #1 would be fulfilled by a null TO field before the "?". It would force the MMS composer to require the filling in of the To: field prior to sending, which, in the case of a mobile phone, would most likely make use of the embedded address book application.

As regards #2, as long as the draft is sufficiently clear about what the intended use cases are for mms:, then there isn't a problem. [IMHO - I don't think mobile phone implementations would pick it up.]

Subject: Re: IETF Draft on mmsto:


1. If you want a "mailto" in which the content is specified but the 
destination is not specified, you would write:
mailto:?subject=foo
Therefore, if you wanted an MMS message created, rather than an email 
message created, you would write:
mmsto:?subject=foo
So, if this what you want, I can make that use case clearer in the text.

2. I fully share your concern about "mms:".  The "mms:" URI scheme is 
there to support services that do not want user interaction.  For 
example, a game that wants to send an MMS back to the game server in 
order to activate a new level.   This is just one example, but one that 
is real in the SMS world today.  I also have someone who called me about 
how to use "mms:" on the MM4 interface -- where one MMS relay/proxy 
identifies another MMS relay/proxy.  So, I think its still valid.  At 
issue is if the "mms:" is used by a rogue application or rogue 
content.... which is something I should make clear in the security 
consideration.

Thanks,
Ted
