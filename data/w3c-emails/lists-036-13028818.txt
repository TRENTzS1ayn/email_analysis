The purpose of the "mmsto:" URI is so that a browser (or some other 
client) knows to process the link using the MMS composer application.

Actually, nope.  The purpose of the "mmsto" URI scheme is to identify a 
_message_ that may be sent to an MMS recipient -- thats why the "mmsto:" 
URI scheme allows for optional header values.

In the I-D, I talk about identifying the device via several mechanisms 
RFC 3601 & RFC 2822 being two of them.

(Yes, I know what 2368 says, but I think that with _current practice_, 
"mailto:" has come to mean the message going over the wire rather than 
the mailbox since any browser or email client I use these days allows me 
to compose prior to sending or to cancel altogether)

Looks like we will have to disagree about the role of "mmsto" as I am 
modeling it after "mailto".

See my response to Bennett.  Hopefully that clears it up.  The "mms" URI 
scheme is used for applications to send MMS message to other 
applications -- likely without direct user interaction.  In essence, the 
"mms" URI scheme should behave like the "http" URI scheme ala this quote 
from RFC 2368:

    In current practice, resolving URLs such as those in the "http"
    scheme causes an immediate interaction between client software and a
    host running an interactive server.

This is the behaviour I would expect when processing an "mms" URI.  But 
again, since it allows for you to attache content, I can't help but 
think it is referring to the message more than the actual recipient.
