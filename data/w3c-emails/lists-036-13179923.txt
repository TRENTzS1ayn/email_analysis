Umm, no.  Aside from being difficult to understand due to the trailing
qualifier, it is factually incorrect.  URI comparison has nothing
to do with retrieval.  False negatives are false regardless of purpose.
The purpose being discussed before that is the goal for which the
cost/benefit trade-off is balanced, which could be different for each
of a hundred different types of retrieval.
