Notwithstanding worries about the phrase
"when used for purposes of retrieval."
without any such qualifier the sentence is false.

For example, if a URI http:/example.org/namespace is used as an XML 
Namespace the similar URIs HTTP:/example.org/namespace or
http:/example.org:80/namespace are not names for the same XML namespace.

Thus techniques on the comparison ladder other than byte-for-byte 
comparison do not work for comparing namespace URIs when used for the 
purpose of naming namespaces. This counterexample (and others, for example 
from RDF), indicates that the sentence is false.

I believe I discussed Graham's proposed modification with him, and I felt 
that it attempts to allude to these issues without making too big a deal of 
it. Some change is necessary.
