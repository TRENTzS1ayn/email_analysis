Hmm... I think that the goal of "strictly avoiding false positives" is 
indeed correctly stated.  To the extent that if there are practices 
that would result in software that "climbs the ladder" in good faith 
getting one, then those by definition are bad practices.  Today I'll 
dig up the latest draft and review

and try to think of an improvement.  False positives on URI comparison 
would be very damaging to webcrawlers and caches and so on and should 
really be avoided. -Tim
