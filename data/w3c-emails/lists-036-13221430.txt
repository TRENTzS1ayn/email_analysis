If I am following this discussion, we seem to be in violent 
agreement. Graham and Jeremy and I are concerned that URIref 
normalization may introduce name equivalences where RDF is expecting 
distinct names.  This would be very damaging, a potential disaster: a 
large part of the expected functionality of RDF and especially OWL is 
in determining that two names refer to one entity, and unpredictable 
normalization will wreck this kind of reasoning.

But that sounds like a 'false positive' (?), so it seems that we are 
all in agreement that it is important to avoid this situation, ie one 
where an application is expecting that two URI references are 
distinct, but a URI normalization process is licenced to convert one 
of them into the other 'silently', without giving notice.

I am not sure how this cashes out in actual words, but if we can all 
agree on the general point then perhaps the word-crafting will go 
more easily.
