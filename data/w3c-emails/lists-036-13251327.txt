Yep, I missed that -- I wish the collected ABNF could just be generated
from the XSLT.

You are missing the whole point of having it.  The text describing
the syntax says their are five possible matching rules for a path,
only one of which will be matched in any URI reference.  That is
why path is a top node and not used by the URI syntax itself.
It also explains why those rules are not ambiguous, and hence
why reducing them to one production is not desirable.  Nevertheless,
a non-validating grammar will combine all of those into one
component that is called path.
