Yes they are.  The processing algorithm does not need to consider them
to be the same name, but XML cannot change the meaning of a URI.

They work just fine for comparing namespaces.  What they don't work for
is testing compliance with W3C recommendations, for which only the
simplest form of comparison is recognized.  XML Namespaces accepts the
presence of false negatives without any harm to the processing model.
Additional normalization of the namespace URI will not be incorrect;
it just won't be very useful, since the purpose of namespace names
is to avoid name collisions, not ensure name consistency.
