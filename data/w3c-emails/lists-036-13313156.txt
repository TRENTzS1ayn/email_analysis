Somehow, I fail to feel much distress that XML namespace-processing 
software is specified as stopping at the bottom rung of the 
URI-comparison ladder, thus leaving the door open for lots of false 
negatives.  While Paul is correct that http://www.w3.org/ and 
http://www.W3.org/ will not compare equal, and Roy is correct that per 
RFC2396bis they are for all practical purposes equivalent, well so 
what?  The only sane way to understand the Namespaces rec is as an 
injunction not to foolishly use non-significant spelling variations in 
bandying about namespace names, because you can't count on any help 
from the software. -Tim
