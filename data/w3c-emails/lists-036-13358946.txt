I believe there is already text discouraging the use of URIs in non-normal 
form (i.e. for which this divergence matters).
The change proposed by Graham and rejected by Roy was trying to clarify 
that the comparison ladder while important for all is only strictly 
built-in when doing retrieval, and not when naming namespaces or 
considering the OWL document

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/">
    <owl:sameAs rdf:resource="http://example.org:80"/>
</rdf:Description>
