The current draft of RFC 2396bis is, thankfully, quite consistent about
qualifying its use of the word 'encoding' so that it's always clear what kind
of encoding is being talked about (character encoding, percent-encoding, etc.)
... at least up until section 6. 

I suggest that in section 6.2.2, the mention of "encoding normalization" be
changed to "percent-encoding normalization", and the title of section 6.2.2.2
likewise become "Percent-Encoding Normalization".

Furthermore, the only place where "percent-encoding" is not hyphenated is in
the title of section 2.1, so consider adding the hyphen there. (2.1's title is
hyphenated in the index, even.)

Thanks
