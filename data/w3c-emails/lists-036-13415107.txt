The latest version of the draft for this has been posted:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-black-snmp-uri-04.txt

Here's the change log since the -02 version:

-03: Updated to reference rfc2396bis draft instead of RFC 2396. 
   Context and engine syntax changed to comply with rfc2396bis 
   authority component restrictions.  Minor text editing. 
-04: Remove "0x" engine prefix.  Add discussion of relative 
   URI impacts of embedded //.  Add oid groups to support 
   MIB object instances that need to be accessed together. 
   Always discard SNMP "no data" response exceptions.  More edits.

Please take a look at this, as the -05 version is likely
to be sent to the IESG for approval.

Thanks,
--David
