I have just submitted draft 05, which can also be obtained via
the issues list at

    http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/issues.html

It is time to stick a fork in this revision.  Unless a significant
flaw is encountered, I have no intentions of submitting another draft
prior to IESG review -- editorial issues, if any, can be handled by
the RFC editor or dealt with the next time we need to revise.

We need to spend the next two weeks gathering test cases and
implementation reports, prior to submission to the IESG.  Larry,
do we have a suitable template for describing implementations?


Cheers,
