This goes back to my earlier email on "intra-document" URI references.  
I thought I finally understood Roy's explanation, but I guess I never did.

I kept saying that a "fragment identifier only" relative URI
reference should reference the current resource regardless
of the base URI, and Roy kept giving answers that I didn't 
understand until John Cowan finally convinced me Roy's words
were a different way of saying the equivalent thing.

But my (and Amaya's and Opera's) understanding of RFC 2396 is
that #s should resolve to {testpage URI}#s, so if Roy's rewrite
of RFC 2396bis now has #s resolving to http://a/b/c/d;p?q#s
when the #s relative URI reference lives in another resource,
then I still think this is a change in semantics to RFC 2396,
and one that breaks things (such as the several examples I
gave in the earlier thread).
