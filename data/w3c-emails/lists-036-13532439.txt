And, as I said earlier, the URI reference resolves to
"http://a/b/c/d;p?q#s" for both specifications.  The requirement
for same-document references applies ONLY to the action of
retrieval, which is a different test case, and again for both
specifications the correct action is to treat the reference
as within the current document.  The only way to test that is
to actually select the link (for a browser application).
