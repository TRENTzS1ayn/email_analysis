Sorry, yes, I guess so. It's difficult to retrospectively
analyze where I got misled, but apart from my sleepiness,
I can see two points:
- The "examples in spec" table, where in particular 'report'
   isn't clear, it might have looked like a report of verifying
   the examples, rather than a link to the test page. Integrating
   the content in that table into the main test case table would
   probably help.
- The text in the actual link: Replace file name with description,
   such as "Test page".

Regards,     Martin.
