The spec currently says
"The ABNF requires five separate rules to disambiguate these cases,
only one of which will match a given URI reference."

I think the "in" in your explanation would help quite a bit;
the spec would then read:
"The ABNF requires five separate rules to disambiguate these cases,
only one of which will match in a given URI reference."

I'm confident that this "in" can be "smuggled in" during the
RFC editor fixup period.
