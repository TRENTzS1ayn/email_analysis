Section 2.5 was added to address this confusion.  It is the same
issue that Mike Brown was discussing.  While I understand folks
desire to have a standard give answers to common implementation
questions, it is inappropriate for the standard to define what
is the right implementation when no such definition is needed
for interoperability.

The specific text that you supplied is not always true.
While %31 is equivalent to "1", there is no requirement that
data octets be represented in the URI syntax using the characters
corresponding to their US-ASCII value -- they could just as easily
be encoded in HEX first.  That is up to the URI producer.
