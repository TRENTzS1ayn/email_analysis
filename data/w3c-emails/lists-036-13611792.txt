In the process of revisiting my implementation, I've extracted all of my 
test cases (which include those in the spec, and many more) into an 
external description using RDF [1], and developed a new test harness to be 
driven by the test descriptions rather than by hand-coded test cases.  I 
think it would be possible (and not too hard) to generate test code for a 
variety of different platforms from the RDF data.

At this time, I still have to revise my code to bring it in line with the 
final decision on handling of leading dot segments.  Otherwise, all tests 
are passed OK [2].
