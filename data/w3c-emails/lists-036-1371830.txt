Thanks for the comments. If I understood you correctly, this
means:

1. Parameters are a syntactic construct in RFC 2396 which allows
   extensions to path segments of hierarchical uris. There is no
   predefined semantics to segment parameters.
2. Parameters are opaque to the "receiver" of an uri. For comparision,
   and especially for resolving uris, parameters are treated as part
   of the path segment.
3. An authority for the uri, what you call "service", is free to
   use parameters however it likes in matching uris to resources and
   vice versa. (follows from opacity)
4. Queries are different from parameters as:
    - queries on base uris do not take part in resolving references
      when the reference has a non-empty path.
    - queries can be setup by a client (HTML forms)

Does anyone know of a server which makes use of parameters? Does
for example Apache make any assumptions about parameters in path
segments?

Background: I investigate parameters for possible use in WebDAV
servers. A parameter could help solve the problem of adressing
the source of a resource without introducing completely separate
uri spaces for resources. Getting the source of an asp/jsp page
has the problem that GET on http://somehost/welcome.asp is
something completely different.
Now GET on http://somehost/welcome.asp;source could retrieve the
source code of asp without requiring extra headers in the request;
nor introducing a new hierarchy in somehost;
nor polluting the namespace of the top-level collection of
somehost, as the resource welcome.asp%3bsource can still be there;
nor colliding with query parameters to welcome.asp.

Seems like I discovered gold.
