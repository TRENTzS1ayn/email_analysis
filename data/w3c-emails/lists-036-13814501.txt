That appears to be a misprint; it ought to be
file:///user/local/bin/, with an empty authority component.

Though, I've never understood why it wasn't valid to have file: URIs
with no authority component at all, if they refer to the localhost,
and just have the scheme followed by the path, like:

file:/user/local/bin/

which would be clearly distinguished from URIs with an authority
component because there is no double slash.
