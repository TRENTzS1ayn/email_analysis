Right.

It depends on the resolver.  "http" treats them as opaque.

It depends on the resolver.  "http" treats them as opaque.

It depends on the resolver.  "http" treats them as opaque.  Most HTTP
servers separate the query information from the path before determining
the handler for the resource identified by the host and path.

The Apache httpd by default does not make any distinction, but each Apache
module is capable of making a distinction on either a per-resource or
per-hierarchy basis.

Yes, that is one of the reasons they exist.  However, there is no global
parameter meaning in URI space.  What that means is that each server has
to tell the client what URI(s) to use in order to access the source, which is
why the dav:source property exists.  Whether that URL is an added parameter
to the dynamic URI, a separate hierarchical space on the same server, or
a separate server altogether (as is common is staging environments) is
completely specifiable by the resource owner's server and thus doesn't
require any special convention in the URI syntax.
