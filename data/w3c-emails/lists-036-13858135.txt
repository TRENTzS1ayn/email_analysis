Hi,

I think an area where rfc1738bis *should* say something is in the area 
of mapping non-ASCII (or reserved ASCII) characters in path segment.

For instance, what are file URLs for the following Windows file names?

1) "c:/Dokumente und Einstellungen"
2) "c:/a#b"
3) "c:/?"

I guess everybody agrees on the answers for 1) and 2) (hex-escape the 
reserved character), however things are less clear for example 3) 
(non-ASCII). IMHO, RFC1738bis should recommend to use 
UTF-8-encoding-then-hex-escaping).

Note that similar considerations apply to other schemes in rfc1738bis 
(ftp) or other schemes currently proposed (smb).

Regards, Julian
