A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: URI Scheme for SNMP
Author(s): D. Black, K. McCloghrie
Filename: draft-black-snmp-uri-02.txt
Pages: 11
Date: 2004-2-5

SNMP and the Internet-Standard Management Framework are widely 
      used for management of communication devices, creating needs to 
      specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object 
      instances) from non-SNMP management environments.  For example, 
      when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management 
      interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP 
      access), there is a need for a uniform way to indicate how to 
      contact the device for management. URLs fit this need well, as 
      they allow a single text string to indicate a management access 
      communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols.  
      This document defines a simple URI scheme so that SNMP can be 
      designated as the protocol used for management.  This scheme also 
      allows URI specification of individual MIB object instances.

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
