DNS specifies a design for a very general distributed lookup system, not 
just host names, so it's not appropriate to look to that for the 
appropriate range of allowed characters.

I understand the appropriate specifications are RFC 952, as modified by RFC 
1123:

[[
    1. A "name" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text string up
    to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus
    sign (-), and period (.).  Note that periods are only allowed when
    they serve to delimit components of "domain style names". (See
    RFC-921, "Domain Name System Implementation Schedule", for
    background).  No blank or space characters are permitted as part of a
    name. No distinction is made between upper and lower case.  The first
    character must be an alpha character.  The last character must not be
    a minus sign or period.  [...]
]]
-- RFC 952

[[
    2.1  Host Names and Numbers

       The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in RFC-952
       [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
       restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a
       letter or a digit.  Host software MUST support this more liberal
       syntax.

       Host software MUST handle host names of up to 63 characters and
       SHOULD handle host names of up to 255 characters.
]]
-- RFC 1123

Accordingly, I think your proposal is inappropriate.  I also believe the 
current RFC2396bis document is broadly consistent with the above-cited 
specifications.

(There is a possible exception that I read RFC952/1123 to say that the 
*total* allowed length of a domain name must be at least 63 characters, so 
the per-domainlabel limit of 63 characters in the URI spec seems a little 
odd (though not strictly incorrect).

(The I18N issues will appropriately be addressed by IRIs, another 
work-in-progress spec.)
