That particular change didn't change the status of the test case mentioned 
(i.e. with a trailing '.')  -- I noticed that my earlier implementation, 
based on didn't accept that.

But rather than discuss such minutiae, the point of my post was simply to 
draw attention to the change, which surprised me, so that folks would have 
a chance to say whether or not that's what they expected.

My test suite can be seen at:

(At this time, my code is being rewritten and doesn't pass all of the 
normalization tests.)
