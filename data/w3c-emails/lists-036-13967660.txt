Hello Graham,

I just checked Stephen's URI, http://stephen_pollei.home.comcast.net/,
on a list of browsers (Netscape, IE, Opera, Amaya, Tango, Mozilla, all
on Win2000). I'm glad to do some more testing on other machines or
to get results from others.

All the above browsers return Stephen's home page without problems.
If the URI spec doesn't allow the above URI, but the vastest majority
of implementations do, then it seems that there is clearly something
that needs fixing. It might be the browsers, or it might be the spec.
Probably fixing the spec is easier.

Regards,   Martin.
