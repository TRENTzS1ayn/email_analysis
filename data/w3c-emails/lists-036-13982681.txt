Correct. RFC 2396 did allow it, but 2396bis does no longer. The proposed
snmp URI scheme looks almost like a hierarchical uri, but as you noted 
it
differs significantly.

I'm in no way fluent on SNMP, but it would seem prudent to either go the
"opaque way" and use another character than '/' for separating 
components,
or go the "hierarchical" way and shift the engine/context parts into the
path part of the uri.

One simple way could be the usage of query parameter or always treat
the first two path segments as engine/context identifier with a defined
constant for default values.
