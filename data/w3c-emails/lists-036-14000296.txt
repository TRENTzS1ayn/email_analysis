Hello,

So the browsers, or the resolvers they use, are too liberal. An '_' is not
allowed in a hostname. To access the document you need to translate said
name into an IP address, i.e. into an A or AAAA record (it doesnt' matter
that in this particular case there's also a CNAME involved).
Ergo "stephen_pollei.home.comcast.net" is a hostname and should follow
the syntax rules for hostnames.

There's nothing to fix. Non-ASCII characters may "work" in many cases, too,
but simply declaring them OK doesn't solve the problem.
