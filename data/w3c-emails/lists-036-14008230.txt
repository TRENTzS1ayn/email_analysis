It is noted in the "draft-black-snmp-uri-02.txt" that
 "The encoding rules specified in [RFC 2396] and [RFC 2732] apply to SNMP
URIs, ....".

Is this draft valid as long as it refers to the RFC2396?
(It is assumed that the RFC2396bis will have different
 RFC number in the future, not overwrite the current RFC2396.)

Should the draft reflect the RFC2396bis syntax instead of RFC2396 otherwise?
