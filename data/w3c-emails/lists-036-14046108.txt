I have removed the descriptions.

Someone requested that it be removed.  I have added a sentence that 
makes
it clear that the term URI should be used in the future.

I don't think that adds value, since the sentence is already phrased
in the negative: "access to the resource is neither guaranteed nor
implied".  That is true regardless of the nature of the resource.

Okay, though I consider any verb to be an operation and I would hope
that any denoting that takes place is on the resource and not something
else that is transient.

Okay.

No, that sentence is only talking about representation metadata (e.g.,
content-type).  If that were about the resource, then content 
negotiation
would be impossible.  I have added a sentence on resource metadata to
make this clearer.

Done, but I have decided to follow John Klensin's comments and move the
unsafe mark characters to the reserved set, thereby clarifying all of
this stuff.
