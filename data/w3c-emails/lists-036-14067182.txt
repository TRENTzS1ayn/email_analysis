A delimiter marks the beginning or end of a unit of data.  A separator
separates two units of data.  In CSV, for instance, a line containing
a single comma represents two empty units of data.  A separator is
therefore a bidirectional delimiter.

rfc2396bis uses the term delimiter correctly.  Some of them are being
used as separators, but they also delimiters.
