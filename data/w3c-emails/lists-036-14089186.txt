Generally speaking, I have fixed all of the problems you noted in
sections 1 and 2, with the exceptions being

> 1.2.2: Please add examples for "resolution", "dereference", and
>        "retrieval".

I don't have any such examples in text form.

> 1.2.3: The URI syntax is organized ... decreasing order from left to 
> right.

I am not talking here about the internal composition of data
within the components, but rather their relation to each other.

A careful read of RFC 2119 will reveal why.  Their purpose is to
define specific interoperability requirements for Internet hosts.
Most of the time, specifications misuse them for simple requirements.

However, I have moved to a more straightforward use of must and
should, rather than recommended, as I rewrite sections.

Because they did not serve to clarify the situation.  The distinction
you make between those words don't mean anything to people who haven't
carefully studied the definitions and dealt with the issues that are
better described by RFC 2978.  The examples were better, so I used those
where appropriate.
