Roy,

Thanks.  I think this is very good progress, and I look forward to reading 
the new draft.   A few comments...

(1) If specifying what must be specified in specific URI definitions is 
"the role of RFC 2718 and BCP 35 (RFC 2717)...", which may be quite 
reasonable, I think those docs should be crossreferenced in 2396bis.  A 
sentence like "There are specific requirements that these per-scheme 
characteristics be defined for the schemes, see [RFC2718bis, RFC2717bis]" 
may be a forward pointer but is not normative, since it provides references 
for additional reading about a related topic, rather than information 
needed to understand/implement 2396bis.

(2) The IPv6 syntax issue.  RFC 2821 does not provide a variant/ different 
IPv6 syntax (although changes by the IPv6 folks may require some slight 
retuning in 2821bis).  What it does is to specify that, if the addressing 
scheme isn't IPv4, then the scheme must be tagged with what it is, rather 
than deduced by heuristics on the address syntax chosen.  Think of it as a 
wrapper around whatever the IPv6 folks specify, rather than a different 
syntax.  On that basis, I think you can do exactly the same thing and that 
a "no heuristics" or at least "no heuristics if there is any possible 
alternative" principle will generally serve URIs and the web well. If, due 
to other pressures and considerations, you need to permit IPv6 addresses 
without any qualification, it seems to me that it would be useful to 
identify an identified/tagged form, make it normative, and then define the 
IPv6 address form without the tag as a permitted abbreviated syntax 
variation.  That at least puts the right future stake in the ground.  That 
stake is necessary if we see URIs outliving the Internet as we know it, and 
some of the other W3C-derived architecture documents and public 
presentations clearly anticipate that.

regards,
   john
