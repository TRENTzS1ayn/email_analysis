I agree that these parameters are part of the path segment,
but they're really hierarchical path components (that
can be defaulted via omission) rather than parameters.

There appear to be good uses for relative URI references
in the same engine and context, so the first choice makes
more sense.  I assume it's ok to define ';' as a separator
rather than as something that introduces context so that
one gets
snmp://host/context=123/oid
rather than 
snmp://host/;context=123/oid
FWIW, the existing draft uses ':' for this separation (as
to a first approximation engine:context::host:port), and
we (draft authors) may just stick with that.

Thanks,
