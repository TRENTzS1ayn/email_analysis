It still appears in both gen-delims and sub-delims:
  gen-delims    = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
  sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
                / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
at http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html, which I
assume is the latest draft.

The only place gen-delims appears is in reserved.
sub-delims appears in userinfo (which previously had ":"),
reg-name (where I think it does not hurt), and pchar
(where it's also added literally, but it seems that I can
only see the version before the fix discussed above).
The best solution seems to remove it from gen-delims.

Because of userinfo, which always included ":", it should not
just be removed from sub-delims without at least adding it
back in to userinfo literally.
