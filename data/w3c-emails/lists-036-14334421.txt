Hmm, I like that less than the current bullet -- your suggestion
makes the first bullet a statement rather than a consideration.

I've described that in more detail in my changes yesterday... oops,
I forgot to commit those to cvs.  They are live now.

The new text should be reflected in the webarch document as well.

Fixed.

Fixed.

IANA, though I used the wrong name -- they are Well Known Ports.
