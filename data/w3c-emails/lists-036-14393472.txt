Hello Adam,

Many thanks for your comments.

I don't think the current RFC2396bis draft says that you can't use
ACE. If you use ACE, it will just work.

And I think a) is a bit too short, it should read
       a) be able to encode the authority characters as %hh and rely on
          gethostbyname or a layer (just) above it to do the conversion, or

In practice, things are a little bit more complicated, but that actually
makes this choice a little bit easier.

When implementing IRIs on something like a browser, what I have
seen (or done myself) so far is that it is much easier to implement
the UTF-8 and %-escape steps in one place, and the IDN -> punycode
step much lower in the stack.

The IRI draft (if and when I get around to do the edits this afternoon)
will change to convert everything to %-escapes, but it will contain
a note that points out that for backwards compatibility, in particular
for proxy and similar scenarios where IRI -> URI mapping and DNS
resolution are strictly separated (and under the condition that
the scheme is known to be DNS-based), implementations MAY convert
directly to punycode.

So in theory, this is a black-and-white distinction, but in practice,
it's not.

Sorry, wrong. From http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt:

 >>>>
3.2. Authority Component

    Many URI schemes include a top hierarchical element for a naming
    authority, such that the namespace defined by the remainder of the
    URI is governed by that authority.  This authority component is
    typically defined by an Internet-based server or a scheme-specific
    registry of naming authorities.

       authority     = server | reg_name
 >>>>

And while in San Francisco, the general understanding was that
registry-based naming authorities that use DNS hostnames have
been the only such URIs in deployment, in the meantime, this
understanding has been crumbled in the meantime. In addition,
it was considered highly unadvisable to bet the future of
URIs and IRIs on the DNS.

It works on IE, Opera, and Amaya. And it's not really an issue, because
nobody would actually use that except for testing. For %-escapes
derived from IDNs, it's very easy to make IRIs, IDNs, and this
%-escaping all work without problems. Please remember: a browser
that doesn't support IDNs just doesn't.

I suggest to change this to:

The reg-name syntax allows for percent-encoded octets, in order to
enable internationalized domain names to be provided in URIs in
an uniform way;

So Stephen's host, with an underscore, just doesn't exist, or what?
Even if every browser actually gets there? Is the tail wagging the
dog here, or what do you think is going on?
