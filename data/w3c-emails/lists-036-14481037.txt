Done.

But it has nothing to do with the rest of that sentence, which
is talking about the range of methods presented in 6.2.

Done.

Done.

I just removed the qualifiers.

Done (with some bits moved to prior paragraph).

That part is a case issue, so I moved it above with a reference below.

I don't see that, so I probably already fixed it.

Okay.

Fixed already.
