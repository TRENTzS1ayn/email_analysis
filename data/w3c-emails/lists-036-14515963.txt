This is not directly related to URIs, but how does the escaping/punying 
of
hostnames affect the HTTP host header? As an implementor of HTTP client
code, I wonder in which format I have to send the header value.

At the moment I would just use the hostname as it appears in the URI. 
In order
for that to work, both the resolver and the HTTP server code would have
to work the same way for the request to go through. It's probably best 
to
leave the equality check of different hostname spellings up to the 
server. But
until all servers are upgraded, is there anything the client can do?

Best regards, Stefan
