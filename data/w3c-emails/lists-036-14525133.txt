Dropped due to editorial preference.

I can't reference a bare URI due to RFC rules.  The two RFCs that
govern that process are already referenced.

Done.

Done.

Done.

Done already.

Something like that has been done already.

Done.

Now "allowed in a segment"

It looks better in the HTML version.

I moved the note back to the relative resolution section.

I rewrote this last week.

That is the whole point of the paragraph.

I think adding that would lead to more discussion than it is worth.
