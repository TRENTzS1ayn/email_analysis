Hello Stefan,

The 'Host:' request header in HTTP has a quite general syntax.
What actual implementations currently do is to send ACE
(punycode). They have that available anyway because they
need it for DNS lookup; at least that was the case in the
implementation I have done. Updating the HTTP protocol to
clarify such issues (or hopefully, to change this to use
UTF-8) would be nice, but I don't think it's the most
urgent thing to do.

Regards,   Martin.
