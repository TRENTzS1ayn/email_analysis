I noticed this too, and feel similarly (but not very strongly).  I would 
expect the "localhost" convention to be scheme-specific rather than 
applicable to all URIs.

But there is a related question to which I think the answer should be clear:

Is it ever OK to rewrite
   scheme:///foo
as
   scheme:/foo
?

I think, and this was reinforced by the documented "localhost" convention, 
that the answer is "no".

I'm less convinced of this point.  If it does work for all DNS-based 
schemes (or Internet hostname based schemes), I think that's a feature of 
Internet host naming, not of URIs.
