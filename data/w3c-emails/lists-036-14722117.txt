I think that's exactly what it means--if the password is "anonymous"
or "" then it may be shown.  I don't know the rationale for this
recommendation, but the intended meaning seems clear to me.  If it
appears ambiguous to some, maybe it should be rephrased to leave no room
for doubt:

    Applications should not render as clear text any data after the
    first colon (":") character found within a userinfo sub-component
    unless the data after the colon is the string "anonymous" or the
    empty string (indicating no password).
