Hello Adam,

I still plan to look at your previous emails,
but here an answer on this one.

It's currently not, in particular in the 'scheme' component.

And it's not really IRIs that should need percent-encoding,
although you need it in some cases, if characters are not
encoded as UTF-8 in the corresponding URI.

What do you mean by 'fail gracefully'? The IRI would just not be
resolved? Or anything else? And why would that have to be checked
before use? Why could it not simply be the result of actual use?

Well, yes. But that's just a result of how things are implemented,
not a problem in the specification, I guess.

Again, why check before use? Of course if the IRI or URI is actually
used, there will naturally be some things that don't work out.
But why should we e.g. check that a domain name doesn't contain
a $, when it's just as easy to let this try and resolve and
not be found? For IDNA, a very strict check was important because
there is a justified fear that some registrants will step over
the boundary of what's allowed in terms of characters. But in
general, that's not that much of an issue.

We already made an exception for domain names. I don't want to
make any other exceptions. The goal is not a hodgepodge of
scheme-specific conventions, but to take advantage of the
fact that many URI schemes already are based on UTF-8,
many others allow UTF-8 to be used (in many parts at least)
and UTF-8 is also the recommendation for new schemes.

Schemes and parts that are not based on UTF-8 just have to
live with the fact that they cannot use the benefits of IRIs,
or upgrade themselves.

Why should i- be prepended? New schemes can be designed
so that they fit together well with IRIs (if the relevant
BCP guidelines are used, that will be the case automatically).
