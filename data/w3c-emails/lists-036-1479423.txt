This one never dies, does it?

In a similar conversation I'm having elsewhere, I pointed to some work
Rohit Khare did 3 years ago; a presentation[1] given to TWIST '99, and
an article[2] written for his "Seventh Heaven" column he had in IEEE
Internet Computing.

I think these do a fine job at explaining how a single identifier can
be both a name and a locator when used in different contexts.

(I have no intention of having a conversation about this, just wanted
to point out those resources)
