Hi Eric!

I didn't notice the change as SIP was being developed, but somewhere along 
the line the SIP URI scheme (RFC 2543) seems to have slipped from following 
the generic pattern, used by http and others (with the "authority" 
component introduced by "//"), to a pattern that looks more like 
mailto:.  Given that it incorporates things like usernames and passwords, 
that seems like an unfortunate slippage, but I suppose it's to late to fix 
that now.
