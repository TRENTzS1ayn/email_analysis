I can't confirm these... I plugged them into
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/uripath.py
  v 1.15 2004/01/28 22:22:10

and it says, basically, "don't do that!"

Some details below...

AssertionError: Base may not contain hash:
'http://example.com/path?query#frag'

ValueError: Base <foo:a> has no slash after colon - with relative 'b/c'.

ValueError: Base <foo:a> has no slash after colon - with relative
'../b/c'.
