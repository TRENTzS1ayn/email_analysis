Further to my earlier message [1], I've discussed the issue of URI 
normalization with some colleagues and we'd like to propose the following 
small change of wording with respect to [2].

...

Section 6.1, para 2, final sentence:

The suggested change is to this sentence:
[[
Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives 
while strictly avoiding false positives.
]]

To be:
[[
Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives 
while strictly avoiding false positives when used for purposes of retrieval.
]]

Rationale:

This reinforces the earlier comment that "URI comparison is performed in 
respect to some particular purpose" [section 6 intro], and I think provides 
the necessary get-out for those purposes other than retrieval for which the 
normalization processes described can result in false URI-equivalence (i.e. 
in circumstances where existing applications may legitimately deliver 
differing results).
