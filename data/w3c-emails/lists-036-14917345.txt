Roy et. al, 

RFC2396bis [1] Section 3.5 para 4 states: "As such, interpretation of the
fragment identifier during a retrieval action is performed solely by the
user agent; the fragment identifier is not passed to other systems during
the process of retrieval."

Is the focus of this sentence on retrieval deliberate - ie. the spec has
nothing to say about whether or not fragment identifiers are passed to other
systems during operations other than retrieval?

I'd have expected this prohibition to have been more universal.

Thanks,

Stuart
