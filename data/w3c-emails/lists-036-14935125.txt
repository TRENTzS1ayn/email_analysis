Martin -

Thanks for the review.  I've got some questions in-line.

In theory, any special prefix suffers the same problem.  "annc" takes away from the namespace the same as "special-annc".

In practice, it is in fact the way SIP is used that makes the namespace issue a non-problem.  The "reserved" users are typically at a device or proxy.  They are not exposed externally, as discussed in Section 6 of the draft.

That is an excellent suggestion which will go into the next draft.

Absolutely correct -- I'll fix this one, too, refering to RFC3066.

Thank you very much for your review of the draft!
