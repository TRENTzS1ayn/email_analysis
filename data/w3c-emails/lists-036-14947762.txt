It's dangerous to assume that names of any kind will never leak out.
One idea would be to prefix them with "sip" and follow them with "master".
People are already used to the idea that names ending in "master" have
special meaning: postmaster, newsmaster, webmaster.

"annc" looks much more like a plausible username (for "Ann C.") than
sipanncmaster does.
