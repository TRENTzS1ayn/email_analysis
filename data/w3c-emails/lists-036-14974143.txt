I think that the important bit is that the fragment identifier
is not used in the scheme-specific processing of the URI. 

Whether or not you pass the fragment to "another system" upon dereference
may depend on your entire dereference mechanism (e.g., you _could_
pass the fragment along as a hint if you had a pipeline that was
deciding which embedded images to pre-fetch in the next step of
the pipeline).
