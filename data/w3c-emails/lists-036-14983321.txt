This seems out of scope for a generic syntax specification. I see no
reason why it should prohibe to define a protocol that is capable of
redirecting references to doc1#foo to doc2#bar or convert a reference
to doc#xpointer(id("abstract")/range-to(id("acks"))) into a protocol
specific fragment request for, after all, the identified fragment.
