Broadly yes, although was trying avoid an HTTP bias. The quoted text express
the constraint in a protocol independent fashion - to retrieval operation.

I'm trying to understand why it is so important to state such a constraint
wrt to retrieval and whether or not, maybe on the basis of minimal
constraint, it was intentionally stated only for retrieval or whether it
should be more universally applied.

Thanks,

Stuart
