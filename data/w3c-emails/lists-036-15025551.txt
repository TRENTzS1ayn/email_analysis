Well, after thinking about this a bit, I've changed my mind.

I think fragment identifiers are only defined for use with retrieval,
because the semantics of the fragment are (supposed to be, at least)
defined by the media type of the retrieved result. With other operations,
there is no clear media type.

Using fragment identifiers for other purposes, with PUT,
POST, or any other operation, shouldn't be defined in the
IETF 'Standard'. Maybe someone wants to propose some other
semantics for fragment identifiers with operations other
than retrieval, but I don't think this document is the right
place to include those extensions.
