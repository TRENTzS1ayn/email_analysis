That makes sense. 

However, at least with HTTP other operations, PUT and POST,  do have
potential to return response messages that carry representations with a
media type - (in which case I guess one could argue that they are also a
form of retrieval and hence covered - hmmm).

Yes... I think staying silent about non-retrival frag id semantics is likely
best. 

[Which implies the status-quo wrt the RFC2396bis draft - apologies for the
disturbance].
