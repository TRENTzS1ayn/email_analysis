Not at all.  doesn't represent status quo, only "status contemplated
in Roy's reply."  The status quo is still in a should-fix state.

RDF has established use patterns that require passing the #fragment
part to "other systems."

[conceptual analysis]

A resource may be considered to represent a view of the state of the universe.

In that view extraction, the fragment part must not affect the 'select'
semantics but may beneficially affect the 'present' semantics where the
'view' operation is factored into 'select' and 'present.'

So, the #fragment part MUST NOT affect the information contained in the
representation in response to a recovery request.  The User Agent MAY strip
the #fragment part and apply it post-recovery without loss of information.

But "MUST NOT" pass to "other systems" is unjustified and detrimental.
It should be fixed.  If we want to warn people off of abuse-encouraging
variants, we need to check out appropriate uses and draw the line
appropriately before we go there.

Has there been abuse?  Is there a public discussion of it somewhere?

In standard browsers, the fragment ID does affect the initial scroll and
focus properties of the view in the viewport.  In assistive middleware such
as the SWAP system, it would be appropriate for the system to add-in a
synthetic synopsis from the top of the page to the (#fragment-indicated)
point where reading starts as a third-party annotation.
