Unresolved problems have a nasty habit of hanging around ;-)

But what if you need the name of both a non-location resource and it's
location in the same context?

If the same name can denote a location resource in one context and a
non-location resource in some other context, fine. But the SW is
one single context and we need a formal distinction between the two.

If some folks don't need that formal distinction, fine, but that doesn't
mean that those of us who do need such a formal distinction shouldn't
seek solutions.

Thanks for the pointers.
