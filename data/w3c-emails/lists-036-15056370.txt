I wonder what this means with respect to the INFO URI scheme which defines a
fragment component as a regular part of the syntax,

info-URI = info-scheme ":" info-identifier [ "#" fragment ] 

while at the same time asserting that INFO URIs are non-dereferenceable (and
hence there are no representations and no associated media types). In
discussing the use of fragment components in the INFO I-D we use language
which is closely aligned with that used in 2396bis (sect 3.5) to assert
that:

The (unescaped) values for the "fragment" component identify
secondary 
      information assets with respect to the primary information asset 
      which is referenced by the "info-identifier".

It would seem that the historical use of fragment components has been to
provide an addressing mechanism into a resource representation following a
retrieval operation, as commonly used in HTTP requests. But in a pure
information context there may well be non-dereferenceable URIs such as INFO
which still have a clear need to articulate secondary resources with respect
to primary resources. So I do query what the role of media type is in these
contexts.
