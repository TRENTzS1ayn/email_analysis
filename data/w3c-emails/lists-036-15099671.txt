On balance, I find I prefer Roy's wording, though you raise a plausible 
issue of possible confusion concerning "client-side indirect referencing" 
and the use of hyperlinks for indirect referencing.  I think "client-side 
indirect referencing" is intended to refer to something looser and broader 
than what is associated with a hyperlink.  I also note that Roy's phrasing 
is qualified with the phrase "identify those aspects of an *existing 
resource*" (my emphasis), which seems to exclude the hyperlink redirection.

In particular, I find that your phrase "... in a context established by the 
resource identified by ..." doesn't really add any new clarity to the issue.

I also think that "A fragment's interpretation is in many schemes allowed 
to depend on the media type [RFC2046] ..." is plain misleading, as it 
suggests that fragment interpretation is some how related to the URI scheme 
(which I think is wrong).

If this is really a problem, I suggest a much more modest change:
[[
    Fragment identifiers have a special role in information systems as the
    primary form of client-side indirect referencing, allowing an author
    to specifically identify those aspects of an existing resource that
    are only indirectly provided by the resource owner.  ...
]]

to:
[[
    Fragment identifiers have a special role in information systems as the
    primary form of client-side indirect referencing, allowing an author
    to specifically identify those secondary aspects of an existing resource
    that are only indirectly provided by the resource owner.  ...
]]
(insertion of "secondary" before "aspects";  this is intended to echo 
earlier use of the term "secondary resource", and I think more clearly 
distinguishes from the case of using a hyperlink.)
