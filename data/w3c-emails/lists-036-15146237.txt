[[
The significance of the fragment identifier is a function of the MIME type 
of the object

This means that the fragment id is opaque for the rest of the client code...
]]
and:
[[
The fragment ID spec for a new MIME type should  be part of the MIME type 
registration process.
]]
-- http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html

To my mind, this excludes the signficance of a fragment depending on 
the  URI scheme, except indirectly to the extent that the URI scheme might 
constrain the MIME type.
