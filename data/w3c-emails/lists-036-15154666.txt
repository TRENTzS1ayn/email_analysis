Might it be impertinent to suggest that these document represent a legacy
view on the function of fragment identifiers in URIs? 

The INFO case may be instructive wrt the roll of media types since there are
no representations that can be retrieved and hence, apparently, no media
type that can be associated with the fragment identifier (unless there be
some null media type).
