What did Larry say?

He said that you can't identify client and server in the future,
so don't key rules to those roles.

He did offer that one might rephrase the rule as keyed to the
scheme-specific processing.  But that was simply to avoid the
above problem.  He wasn't introducing any evidence of
abuse, that is to say instances where violation of this rule
had been exploited to do something bad.

Larry's statement is IMHO grounded in HTTP and HTML.  I didn't regard it as
a position taken after a careful review of the model and functioning of the
'info' scheme.

'Abuse' requires actual damage, not simply the violation of a clause in a
draft spec.

Hopefully Larry will find time to comment again.

On the other hand, there may be a perfectly good binding in URI syntax for
the 'info' model that uses path segments or ?query-part name-value selectors
rather than #fragments for what the current proposal uses #fragments for.
