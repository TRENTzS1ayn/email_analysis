You guys are gonna have to educate me. If (as you seem to be asserting) one 
can plug in any old retrieval mechanism for a self-declared 
non-dereferenceable scheme (such as INFO), then presumably one could do the 
same wrt any other scheme - e.g. construct an FTP retrieval mechanism 
against an HTTP URI, or a Handle retrieval mechanism, or whatever. Am I 
missing something here or don't things begin to fall apart if just any ad 
hoc retrieval mechanisms are recognized client side? What is the point then 
of a URI scheme if clients can override any given protocol and do as they 
want? Isn't that just a smidgen close to anarchy?

ps/
BTW - Isn't it marvelous that absolutlely /no/ browsers can recognize a 
generic URI string, even now some ten years after? :~) All of 'em just 
manage to scrape through with a few hard-wired schemes (the 'GETables') 
which they deign to recognize. Quite surprised that even now the 
standards-compliant-wannabe clients simply cannot recognize a URI string in 
context. What does that say about the state of the Web?
