Yes, that has always been true.  It was the original purpose of HTTP
proxies, in fact, and the way that most www libraries work.

The URI scheme does not denote a protocol.  It never has.  It defines
a mechanism of name assignment.  One of the easiest and most useful
ways to assign names is via information systems that use network
protocols.

It says that browser developers don't read design specs, or simply
don't care enough about URI extensibility as opposed to bugwards
compatibility.  The open source applications don't seem to have any
of the problems you describe.
