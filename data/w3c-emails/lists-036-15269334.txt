Hi Roy:

Not sure wat you mean by 'open source applications' here. I've never seen a 
browser yet that understood what a generic URI is, be it mozilla, firefox, 
etc.

(Of course, I realize that client s/ware extends beyond the limited remit of 
browsers but those are the principal apps by which most folks interact with 
the web, And if they don't get it, then will anyone? Not sure how much 
support for generic URI there is in s/ware libraries either.)

Tony
