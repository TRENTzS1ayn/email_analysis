hello.

since i have received so little feedback about the two drafts regarding an 
sms uri scheme (http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil01g and 
http://dret.net/netdret/publications#wil02a) i am trying again to get some 
feedback. feedback would be welcome about two issues:

- is the uri scheme ok as it is proposed in the drafts. since i haven't 
heard any criticism in a while, i would assume that either the people who 
should criticize the scheme are not reading these lists, or the scheme as 
proposed is technically acceptable.

- the major problem obviously is the question of how to call the scheme. 
the scheme naming issue seems to be a slowly moving activity. in my humble 
opinion, the reason why this even affects the "sms" drafts is that in the 
u.s. the popularity of sms messages is not nearly as high as it is in the 
rest of the world. i would be interested to find out who really thinks that 
"oma-sms" or "itu-sms" would be reasonable ways to name the scheme. btw, is 
there talk about renaming the tel and fax schemes to "itu-tel" and 
"itu-fax" ... ? i think that it is not appropriate to apply all the 
objections against scheme name misuse to the proposed sms scheme, since sms 
(in the non-u.s. parts of the world) messaging is as ubiquitous as phone 
and fax usage.

please let me know if you have any opinion about these issues. and if 
anybody had any suggestions how i could restart the ietf machinery to 
actually process the drafts, i would be most grateful.

thanks and cheers,
