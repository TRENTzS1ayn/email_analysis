I've reread
http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ietf-uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html?rev=1.64#same-document
but it seems that my studying the text (and JohnC's studying of it)
isn't necessarily sufficient to answer my question which is as follows.

In RFC 2396, it makes clear that:

      If the path component is empty and the scheme, authority, and
      query components are undefined, then it is a reference to the
      current document and we are done. 

Given either the following document at http://www.example.org/doc.xml:

<doc xml:base="http://www.example.com/stat/blargh">
  <para href="#foo">xxx</para>
  <para id="foo">yyy</para>
</doc>

or the following document at http://www.example.org/doc.html:

<html>
<head>
<title>t</title>
<base href="http://www.example.com/stat/blargh">
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="#foo">xxx</a></p>
<p><a name="foo">yyy</a></p>
</body>
</html>

the href in either case points to the element in the same document
containing yyy.

Some readings of 2396bis interpret it to be saying that the href above
points to http://www.example.com/stat/doc.xml#foo (or, in the html case,
http://www.example.com/stat/doc.html#foo) which does not necessarily 
exist and is certainly not my intended target.

Is this significant change in meaning (and behavior for a variety of 
deployed tools) the intended interpretation of 2396bis?
