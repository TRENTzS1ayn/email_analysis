Only the form: "http(s)://username:password@server/resource.ext"  is
being removed; basic auth is untouched.

If I understand this article correctly, it sounds like MS IE will remove
support for Basic Authentication.  While we all agree that cleartext
passwords are evil, this sounds to me like it will create a major
compatibility problem at sites that use Basic.  And note that it covers
Basic over SSL, too, where the passwords would *not* be cleartext.
