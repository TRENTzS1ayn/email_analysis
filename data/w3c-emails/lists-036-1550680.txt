Sorry. I don't buy that. A cache is a context holding proxies for
a locations. And
in that context, the URI still denotes a location, but you are bypassing
the direct retrieval from that location with the proxy location provided
by the cache.

The semantics of the URI is still a location. That "opaque string" is
the name of a location -- actually, a sub-location in the context of
the cache. What your cache is doing is mapping a remote location (with
content) to a local proxy location (with content):

   URL   -> cache/URL

And the resolution process first performs the same mapping to a local
proxy location for retrieval before trying the remote location.

But the URL remains the name of a location. A filename is
just the name of a location. It doesn't name the content. Some filenames
do double duty, and have mnemmonic qualities that reflect the nature
of their content. But filenames are first and foremost the names of
locations (containers) in the filesystem.

Cheers,

Patrick
