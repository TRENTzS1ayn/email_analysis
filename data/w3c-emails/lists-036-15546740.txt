For your information, the submission mail contained the following
paragraph:

>The draft has a know dependency on the updated version of the URI spec,
>RFC 2396, currently draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis-05.txt. This dependence
>is noted in the draft itself for the RFC Editor. I'm submitting
>draft-duerst-iri now because draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis is
>extremely close to completion, and any currently open issues
>will not affect draft-duerst-iri in substance. I'm confident
>that you will choose the right stage (e.g. IETF Last Call or
>RFC Editor) to synchronize these two drafts.


Regards,    Martin.
