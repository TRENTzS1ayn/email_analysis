By "rubbing your noses", I assume you mean alerting folks to a
discrepancy between assumptions and what has actually been written
within the specification.  If folks commenting on the specification
would actually read it, and not just read the commentary of others
in response to specific sections, then I think there would be less
concern over definitional issues.  I understand that changes over
the course of multiple drafts will get lost in the noise, which is
why I pointed it out.

None of the current or past input has been ignored.  Some of the current
or past input has been factually incorrect and therefore not 
incorporated
in the draft.  Sorry, but "Al's opinion" is no more a measure of 
consensus
than "Roy's opinion", and running code always trumps opinion.  The only
time there is a real disagreement is when two different sets of code
do two different things and the authors can't agree which one is buggy.
At that point I ask them which one they would prefer, and they are
usually quite reasonable and agree to a single course of action, which
in turn is recorded in the draft.

If there is editorial disagreement about the meaning of a sentence
(not the meaning of a technology), then I generally use my own judgment
unless there is clear consensus in some other direction or my opinion
is overridden by the other authors.

mean != identify.  What I'd like to do is leave enough informational
text in the document so that people understand the technology that
they are implementing.  The reason is to reduce the number of crackpot
schemes that have been proposed to "fix" some imagined limitation
of existing URI schemes, and more of that type of advice will be
added to the next draft because RFC 2718 was informational and thus
impossible to obsolete.

What?  It explicitly disclaims any such uniform semantic model
within this document.  I cannot comprehend how you could read it any
differently.

The definition already includes indefinite references, if what
you mean by that is the identifiers are late-binding.  The fact that
they are processed as a temporal-dependent mapping over a given data
set does not change the fact that the identifier does identify that
mapping, not the results from applying that mapping at some point
in time.  The same applies to all "http" URIs that support the GET
method with information-bearing results, regardless of how the URI
was composed.  That is why Larry proposed the "duri" scheme -- to
provide a mechanism for obtaining already-bound identifiers from
late-binding identifiers.

That is consistent with what is already written in the draft.
The identifier distinguishes that query from all other potential
queries, and hence from many resources to one.  The resource is
not the query result.

Yes, again this is consistent with the draft.

Right, which is consistent with what the draft already says.

The definition provided in the draft does not say anything about
proper association or identity, aside from explicitly disclaiming
that it does say such things.  Isolating one choice, wherein that
choice might be "query results for some query", "coordinates on
this other map", or "that described by this other resource",
is the ONLY purpose for having identifiers.

   "An identifier embodies the information required to distinguish
    what is being identified from all other things within its scope
    of identification."

Please note that "all other things within its scope of identification"
is not in the least constraining or specific to any one type of URI,
nor does it assume definite or indefinite identification.

That is the meaning of the word identify for the sake of this document,
which is explicitly defined in that section because people keep assuming
that there is only one definition of identify in the English language
and that the document somehow disagreed with it.  My response to those
comments is to provide the definition that clarifies what the document
says so that there is no longer any room for ambiguity.

Is it possible that you simply misread the section?  I cannot understand
what it is that you are disagreeing with.  My only guess is that you
are assuming that URIs identify the results obtained from a specific
GET request, but that doesn't make any sense because we both know that
resource representations vary over time.  Indefinite URIs identify one
indefinite resource (the mapping), not an unknown set of definite
resources.
