Yikes, I wrote a gross mis-interpretation of my favorite definition!
Just the opposite of what I've been arguing for years!  At least I
flatly contradicted myself later in that note.  Sorry for my attention
lapse.

It's the association that matters, and there are a million non-web ways
to demonstrate the association.  Roy, thanks for your patient explanation.
