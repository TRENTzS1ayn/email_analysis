To me, only using slashes implies different semantics as opposed to
fragment-ids. Consider a library classification translated into several
languages. Representing this as an info:-URI could lead to (using the bogus
WorldWideWebClassification) info:wwwc/somenotation. Sometimes, however, it
makes sense to indicate the language of the classification schedule used,
e.g. if some particular translation goes deeper into detail. If, for
instance, the Vatican translated the wwwc into Latin and decided to add
classification entries for St. Peter's and the Sixtinian Chapel (situated
beneath the Vatican), they would put together 'qwer' for the Vatican, 't'
for St. Peter's and 'y' for the Sixtinian Chapel ending up with the notation
'qwerty', or info:wwwc/qwerty. Since this is a non-standard notation
existing (so far) only in the Latin translation, a librarian wishing to
verify ist use must know where to find it. The aspect 'language' is in this
case secondary to the notation itself, so the use of a fragment identifier
makes sense, thus info:wwwc/qwerty#la would be the way to go. As work goes
on and this notation is adopted by other translations, we could have
info:wwwc/qwerty#se, info:wwwc/qwerty#tw, or info:wwwc/qwerty#de, all three
being sub-aspects of the *actual* notation info:wwwc/qwerty.
Martin's suggestion to use slashes instead would produce
info:wwwc/qwerty/la, or info:wwwc/qwerty/se which (at least to me) has
different semantics. Here, the language component is not a different aspect
of the *same resource* but instead one step further down in the hierarchy
denoting a *different resource*. Or am I wrong?

I'd say it depends on what and how necessary <this> is. If it's "hit my toe
with a large hammer", the doctor is right. If it's "breath" or "walk", I'm
not so sure...

Thanks
