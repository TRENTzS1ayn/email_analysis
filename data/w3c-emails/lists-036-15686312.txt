One would expect a broswer to understand a generic URI string /in context/. 
E.g. a browser could see something like

  <a href="this-is:a-uri-string"/>

and recognize (al teast) that this was a valid URI, albeit it may have no 
clue how to dereference it. But it could at least take some kind of action 
(popup window, or changing the presentation semantics of the link) rather 
than imply that this is in any way defective (unregistered, 
undereferenceable, etc).

And of course it should also recognize that

  <a href="this-is*not:a-uri-string"/>
