I have little to add to Roy's response.

Just that it's not anarchy because the given scheme, when based on a 
network protocol, still indicates the definitive way to access the 
resource.  If one uses another protocol, then it should return the same or 
compatible information, or else it's lying (or outside the Web)

In the case of my example, it means that *any* retrieval mechanism 
constructed must return something compatible with the defined referent of 
the (say, info:) URI, so it's not quite open season.

Well, to adopt a slightly different take to Roy's, I'd say that a browser 
is specifically concerned with retrieval (and rendering) of resource 
representations, so it's maybe forgivable if it doesn't grok schemes that 
it doesn't know how to retrieve.  (Though one might argue that any browser 
should be able to send a generic URI to a proxy, which might grok more.)
