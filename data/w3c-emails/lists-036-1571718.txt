Exactly ;-)

And the same kind of confusion arises when folks use e.g. mailto: URIs
to denote people and http: URIs containing only the web authority portion
to denote companies, etc.

Folks clicking around in browsers may be able to live with a certain
degree of confusion of that sort, but SW agents trying to infer things
about the world will be woefully handicapped by such "sloppy knowledge".

I didn't say the semantics of every *URI* is always a location,
I said that an 'http:' URL always is (or should be) the name of a
location. There's a bit of a difference, I think, between the
two claims ;-)

Cheers,
