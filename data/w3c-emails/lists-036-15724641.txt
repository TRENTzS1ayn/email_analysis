Yes, the grammar issue was noted by Ray Merkert on Feb 17th.

Note that the text already says a more forceful equivalent
in section 3.3:

                                              If a URI contains an
    authority component, then the initial path segment must be empty
    (i.e., the path must begin with a slash ("/") character or be
    entirely empty).

Is that not sufficient?
