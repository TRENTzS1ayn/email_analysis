I already responded to that question, but I just noticed that a more
succinct response is possible.  Section 4.1 of the current draft says:

    The ABNF of URI-reference, along with the "first-match-wins"
    disambiguation rule, is sufficient to define a validating parser for
    the generic syntax.

It would be very nice if that were true, but it's not.  A validating
parser based on the ABNF and the first-match-wins rules will find that
foo://example.net:0x3FF/ is valid, with path = "x3FF/" (and indeed, Rob
Cameron built such a parser, and that's what it reported).  But the
additional rule in the prose of section 3.3 implies that this URI is
invalid.

Should we try to make the quoted statement true?
