rfc2396bis-04 says:

"For the sake of uniformity, future scheme
specifications should define an empty authority as being equivalent
to "localhost", and URI producers and normalizers should use
"localhost" instead of an empty authority."

 From an internationalization viewpoint, it is highly preferable
to make the empty authority the normal form (can be typed and read
by everybody), rather than the string 'localhost'. Please change
it here and in section 6.
