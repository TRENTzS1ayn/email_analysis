There should be, schedules permitting, a non-normative reference
to IRI in rfc2396bis. The way I understand the workings of the
IETF and the RFC editor, this can be done as follows:

- Add an entry [RFCXXXX] in the non-normative references, pointing
   to the newest IRI I-D.
- Add a sentence referencing this at an appropriate place. For example,
   add "For a definition of identifiers that can accommodate non-ASCII
   characters directly and are compatible with URIs, please see
   [RFCXXXX]." at the end of section 1.2.1.
- Add a section entitled "Instructions to RFC Editor", saying:
   - If when publishing this document, the IRI draft has reached
     the RFC editor, then change reference RFCXXXX to the corresponding
     number.
   - If when publishing this document, the IRI draft has not
     reached the RFC editor, then remove the reference RFCXXXX,
     and the sentence that mentions it.
   - Remove this section before publication.

Regards,    Martin.
