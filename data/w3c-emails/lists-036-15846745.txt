I'm concerned that I have been quoted out-of-context.  My original message 
containing that quote is at:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2004Feb/0148.html

Specifically, the quoted phrase was prefixed with:
   "In such an environment, "
(referring to an environment in which "a given URI has no retrievable 
representation")

On reflection, I'd change the "at all" to "especially", and note that the 
comment should be interpreted in light of:
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/#pr-describe-resource
