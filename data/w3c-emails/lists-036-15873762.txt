Examples would be useful. I would expect that those 'secondary' 
resources could just
as well have been denoted using URIs without fragids, and their 
relationship (if any)
to the primary resources denoted by the base URIs expressed more 
effectively in RDF.

I never proposed such a thing. You apparently have misunderstood me.

But this is precisely my problem with URIrefs with fragids. It forces 
one to interpret
such URIs in terms of representation retrieval -- rather than as 
independent nodes
in an information space.

URIrefs with fragids are "second class" web URIs because they force one 
into
the domain of "document retrieval" simply to interpret them.
