I don't in any way disagree with what you write below or Larry's
comment.

I also don't see how it contradicts my statement that fragids
force one into the domain of document retrieval since no matter
how you model it, you cannot get from a URIref with fragid to
a representation of the secondary resource without *first*
obtaining a representation of the primary resource.
