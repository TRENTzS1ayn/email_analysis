That's all fine and good, but I think it is important to distinguish
between semantics inherent in the identifier itself and semantics
of some application/use of the identifier.

I.e. some resolution mechanism may take the name of a non-location
resource and obtain the names of locations related in some manner
to that resource -- likely hosting representations of the resource.
But that doesn't mean the name of the non-location resource suddenly
becomes the name of a location.

Resolution mechanisms such as DDDS do not turn names of non-location
resources (URNs) into names of location resources (URLs).
Rather, they embody a multi-stage process by which a non-location
name is first mapped to a location name, and that location is
accessed in some fashion specific to the resolution mechanism,
such as retrieving a representation of the resource residing
at that location.

But the URN doesn't really become the name of a location, even
if it allows us to use it in the same manner as a URL.
