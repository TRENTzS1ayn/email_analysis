Er, you may not be able to *get ... to* a representation (of the secondary 
resource), but you can still refer to, or make statements about, that which 
would be represented by such.  This is just what RDF does.  Retrieval is 
not mandatory.

In the context of the URI spec, I think that to insist on retrieval is to 
invite confusion, and maybe worse.
