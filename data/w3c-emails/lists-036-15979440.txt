No.  What the syntax allows and what a specific scheme uses are two
different things.  There is nothing wrong with a scheme that only
uses a subset of the available syntax, provided it avoids the
reserved characters that would indicate otherwise.  Moving reg-name
under host has the appropriate impact of reserving the ":" and "@"
characters for a specific purpose, but no effect on any URI that
might have been defined to use the old reg_name (which also reserved
those characters).  The result is simply less ambiguous to parse.

The "info" scheme proposal misuses almost every single aspect of URI
syntax, philosophy, technology, and accepted best practice.  There is
no need for it to exist at all.  Yes, it would be better to use either
the generic authority syntax or the URN authority syntax for new URI
schemes that make use of delegated naming authorities.
