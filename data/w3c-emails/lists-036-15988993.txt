Well, gee Roy. You might like to help us out some by expanding on some 
of these claims.They are a little expansive.

We are very much trying to be consistent with URI syntax, philosophy 
and technology and are carefully tracking latest changes in -bis. (I 
won't claim 'accepted best practice' because this is a new URI scheme 
which does not have comparable antecedents.) We have received no 
feedback on the list since submitting the -01 revision last December, 
so it is difficult to know if we have introduced elements that are 
inconsistent with URI practice. It is certainly not our intention to 
'misue'.

But somehow there is felt to be a clear need which is what is driving 
this application.

There are problems with both of these approaches which have been 
carefully documented in the FAQ (available at <http://info-uri.info/> 
and presented earlier on this list when the -00 draft was posted.
