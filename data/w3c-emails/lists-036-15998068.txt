But even with RDF you must *insist* on at least a potential or 
imaginary retrieval of some
RDF/XML representation in order to obtain the interpretation of the 
fragid.

Yes, RDF allows you to make statements with URIrefs with fragids, but 
ultimately,
the interpretation of those URIrefs depends on "some kind of" 
representation being
presumed or hoped to exist.
