Sorry if I'm jumping in on this thread out-of-context  (I can't find
the beginning of it) but I'd like to address the subject line....
Please look at:
http://info-uri.info/registry
and consider these two entries:  'lccn', and 'srw'.  Lccn has no
authority component because the info:lccn just takes an existing lccn,
normalizes it, and sticks it in a uri. No authority, because nobody is
coining the URI. In contrast, for srw, someone is coining the uri, and
there is an authority component built into the syntax (as for several
other entries ....  doi and netref for example).
