Yes, but in this draft, the interpretation of the #fragment
version is specified completely by the Internet-Draft, and
is not dependent on the type of stream encoding employed.

As Larry commented earlier, this conflicts with accessing a
slice of a MIME presentation as keyed by e.g. smil:par element ID.

That's an example of why I would recommend sticking to the query form
for time-sliced views.

A use case where you might actually want to be time-slicing a SMIL 
presentation is one where the SMIL player is a portlet and what goes 
to the client is streaming media but what the client requests is the 
play of the SMIL presentation by indicating a URI for the SMIL 
document (which serves as the head of the media tree for the 
presentation). In this case indeed we would want to have access to 
syntax for either a time slice or a structural sub-playlist reference 
by ID.

Which would remove them from relevance to this discussion.

'urn' perchance; 'info' I believe not.

It is 'representation retrieval' as it can be activated to initiate 
play for a tail of the longer stream.
