You talk as if LCCNs grew on trees, literally.  The authority to coin an
info:lccn URI is one and the same with the authority to assign the
corresponding LCCN, just as is the case with urn:isbn URIs, since the
meaning of the URI is tied to the meaning of the "number".  In effect, then,
the authority component of LCCNs is "lccn".
