No, it has has an arbitrarily different syntax that serves the same
purpose as the authority component in the generic syntax.  The urn
scheme has one as well -- that has proven to be a bad idea.
The point was that a generic concept like naming authorities should
be expressed using a generic syntax, since then you get implementations
for free, which is especially valuable given the cost of maintaining
a delegated naming system.
