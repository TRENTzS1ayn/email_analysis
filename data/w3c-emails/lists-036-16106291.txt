Yes, that was my objection as well.  The different authority syntax
for urn prevented its deployment for many years, but I think that
has finally been resolved.  URNs would have been deployed in 1994,
at least in terms of WWW client and proxy behavior, were it not for a
disagreement over the syntax.  New schemes should learn from that lesson
and try to be uniform whenever possible,
