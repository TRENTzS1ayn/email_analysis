Sorry, but that's wrong. URIs are indeed sequences of characters, but
they stand for sequences of octets. While in many cases, this distinction
isn't easy to see, the data: scheme provides a good example. If you
for example write: data:image/gif,....
and assume you don't use base64, then you may have the character
'3' in tha data, but that's not a '3' in the image, that's just
the octet 0x33 in the data for the image.
