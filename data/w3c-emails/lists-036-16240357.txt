I have tried various ways of explaining it in the text and finally
went back to multiple definitions of path, though I hope I've done
a better job of disambiguating the different cases than I did for
2396.  I would appreciate it if the grammar-driven parsing experts
could have a look at

    http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html  (or .xml)

and see if the new ABNF rules work (I've already tested them with
the abnf.c tool).
