Could someone please give me pointers/tips to a URI "scheme" for
images/media I should be using, instead of making up my own.

Right now I use:
http://natalian.org/pictures/2003/07/24/DCP_7071.JPG
For the large version of the picture. And:
http://natalian.org/thumb/2003/07/24/DCP_7071.JPG
For the thumbnail.

I am thinking of getting rid of the "pictures" bit, the filename and
incorporating the device used to capture the media.

http://natalian.org/kodak/2004/03/25/14:00:04/
Or:
http://natalian.org/kodak/2004/03/25/67/
67 is the 67th image taken that day (a key)
Or:
http://natalian.org/kodak/2004/03/25/description/

Thumbnail I could generalise to a preview(although a painfully long 7
letter word). Example:
http://natalian.org/preview/kodak/2004/03/25/23:45:45/drunk/

I am worried that a browsers might ignore the content-type and expect
HTML. Hmmmm...

Comments please, and please CC: me. Good day,
