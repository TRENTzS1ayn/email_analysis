Dear URI Experts,

Yesterday, I have announced a 2 week mailing list last call on the
public-iri@w3.org mailing list for the newest version of the IRI
spec, which you can find at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri-07.txt.
Additional information is at http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/.
The last call ends on Sunday, May 23, 2004.

I'm copying this announcement (see below) here because the IRI
draft relies strongly on RFC 2396bis.

So if you have any comments (I of course hope they will be mainly
of editorial nature), please send them to public-iri@w3.org
(and not to this list) by May 23.

Regards,   Martin.
