For the perl URI module I decided to use the second form.  The first
one does not give sensible answers if combined with relative URIs.

Try to resolve these according to the RFC 2396 rules:

   abs("../otherdir", "file:////myshare/mydir");
   abs("../../otherdir", "file:////myshare/mydir");
   abs("../../../otherdir", "file:////myshare/mydir");
