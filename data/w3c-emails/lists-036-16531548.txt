Hello Graham,

I have labeled this issue as convertASCII-30.

Yes, good catch. I looked at the actual text that needs to be fixed.
I can either add non-reserved ASCII characters to the 'except'
clause in parentheses in the original text, or can change the
procedure. Overall, in terms of edits, both need about the same
work. Which one would you prefer?

It is clear that with or without removing percent-encodings for
non-reserved ASCII characters, this can be done, and different
usages may choose different variants, according to their needs.

There is some interaction as some characters and character
combinations are excluded by the bidi section. I think the
various cross-references within the text take care of this.
There is also some interaction that with the conversion
from URI to IRI, the display sequence of the components
may change. But this will just happen automatically, this
is not something the algorithm has to worry about.
