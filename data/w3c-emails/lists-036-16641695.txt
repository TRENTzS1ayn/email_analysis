subject="[URIEquivalence-15]: Action Item on URI comparison text in RFC239 6bis"

I have an ongoing action [1] to track the integration of Tim Bray's text on
URI comparison [2] into RFC2396bis [3].

As far as I can tell, the text in [3] reflects what was contributed in [2].
There is a minor exceptions, where the the revised Internet Draft is more
permissive of ./ and ../ segments in absolute URI paths wrt respect to
RFC2396 and Roy has made consistent changes to text from [2].

The list of encouraged good practices in [3], section 6.3, differs from that
in [2]. The use of UTF-8 as a character-to-octet mapping is strongly
encouraged in section 2.5 of RFC2396bis [3], but not mandated (as in Section
6 of [2]). This difference is appropriate since mandating the use of UTF-8
would add a constraint that is not in RFC2396 and could introduce
interoperability issues in cases where a different character-to-octet
mapping is in use. 

I'd like to thank Roy and Tim for their work on this. And I'd like to
declare my action item [1] on URIEquivalence-15 [4] done.

Regards

Stuart Williams
