I have decided that it is better to also remove spurious percent-encodings
of non-reserved US-ASCII characters, because probably the main use of
the conversion from URIs to IRIs is for presentation purposes.

I have changed

    (except for potential case differences in percent-encoding)

to

    (except for potential case differences in percent-encoding
     and for potential percent-encoded unreserved characters)

I have also changed

    This procedure will convert as many percent-encoded non-ASCII
    characters as possible to characters in an IRI.
to
    This procedure will convert as many percent-encoded characters
    as possible to characters in an IRI.

I hope this addresses your concern.
