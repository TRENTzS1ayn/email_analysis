My opinion is that only 1% of that work requires a normative change
to the standard, and that is simply establishing a default encoding
for on-the-wire URI (the one currently being used by most Web browsers).
The rest is UI recommendations, which are being developed by the W3C.

I do not believe in having two different definitions of the same
protocol element floating around on the standards track.
