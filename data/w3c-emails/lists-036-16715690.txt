/ Dan Connolly <connolly@w3.org> was heard to say:
| Regarding...
|
| "Anything that has been named or described can be a resource."
| -- http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#overview
|
| Based on discussion with TimBL and Roy and a few others,
| as well as review of this issue...
|
| 024-identity Resource should not be defined as anything that has
| identity
| http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#024-identity
|
| it seems more straightforward to just say
|
| A resource can be anything; familiar examples include an electronic
| document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's weather
| report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other resources,
| but there is no constraint on what is a resource.

I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I agree that
anything can be a resource. On the other, it seems useful (to me, at
the moment) to distinguish the infinity of things that can be
resources from the finite number of things that actually are.

I have in mind something that does not have a URI (it's a virus on a
grain of barley in the stomach of a pink elephant in orbit around a
red dwarf). Until I (or someone) gives it a URI, it does not
participate in the web architecture, so what useful purpose is served
by calling it a resource in it's current "un-URI-ed" state?

Conversely, what harm is caused by saying that it isn't (yet) a resource?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
