Because you can mention/describe things without naming them by URI.
Sometimes (especially with help of RDF/OWL or rule languages) you can even
make those mentions/descriptions unambiguous, so that it becomes evident
to people and machines that there was 'at most one thing' that could fit
the description. 

For example, the mail message whose mail:mid  is 87smdp7cm3.fsf@nwalsh.com
was written by the person whose foaf:homepage is http://nwalsh.com/

That message, and that Person, are both things-aka-resources, from an
RDF point of view, regardless of whether they have URIs or merely have
URI-named properties or are merely described in prose.

(similarly, if that virus on the barley really existed, that message was 
in part about that virus, and we could say so in RDF pretty easily;
let's not have a thread about identifying non-existent things though...)



> Conversely, what harm is caused by saying that it isn't (yet) a resource?

Without a story that explains how something gets named by (some kind of)
URI, it becomes a very un-interesting property, technically. In which
case, the concept adds little but confusion to our explanation of URIs
and the Web.
