Oh? Hmm... I don't think I have any particular compelling
argument against that view; I hope others do; meanwhile...

In attempt to walk this fine line, the current draft says
  "Anything that has been named or described can be a resource."
which I don't find very helpful. Is the picture frame on my
desk a resource? I dunno; for all I know, somebody out there
gave it a URI; I suppose I just now described it. But I
haven't sent this mail message yet. Is it a resource before
I hit send? Why am I talking to myself like this? Witness
comments by Hayes about using "can be" in a definition,
and so on.

Do you like the current definition, Norm?

I think TimBL suggested that among this
philosophical discussion, an important question to be
able to answer is "can I give _that thing_ a URI?"
and of course, the answer is "yes". It seems helpful
to make "is _that thing_ a resource?" be the same
question, and to make the answer just "yes".
