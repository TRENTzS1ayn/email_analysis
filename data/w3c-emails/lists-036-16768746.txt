I recently updated and resubmitted

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-masinter-dated-uri-04.txt

Using "tdb", it is very clear how you can take anything you can
describe and create a URI for it. With "tdb", a resource really
can be anything.

On the other hand, I don't think it's reasonable to use "http" URIs
to do RDF's heavy lifting of grounding assertions about the world
in the real world. Fortunately, I don't think we need to solve
RDF's problems in this area to make progress on updating RFC 2396.

I was going to hold off asking for 'last call' on the tdb/duri
URN namespaces until RFC2396bis was clear, but perhaps it would
help!
