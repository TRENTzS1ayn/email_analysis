I don't understand.  The vast majority of stuff in IRI is simply how
to display one.  We don't need to include that.  The only thing I want
to include is the default: %xx means the character encoded as xx in
UTF-8.  That is already the default for MSIE and should be for other
browsers as well, and will simplify the specification.

The deciding factor on when a change causes a reversion of status is
still very unclear to me even after all of these years.  All I know is
that this clarifies how the server component should generate and
interpret encoded URI characters outside of the iso-latin-1 subset
of utf-8.  In other words, it doesn't change the parsers.  It is
certainly far less of a change than introducing [IPv6] notation
within the authority component.

Those kinds of things should still be specified elsewhere.
