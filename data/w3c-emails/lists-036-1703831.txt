I disagree. While it's the default in MSIE for URIs, the user enters
into the address bar, it's not the default for the vast majority of
%xx encoded octets requested by MSIE, they originate from HTML forms
where MSIE uses the document or user selected character encoding scheme
to generate the octets, hence most %xx encoded octets representing
non-ASCII characters are not part of valid UTF-8 sequences. There is no
facility to define any other encoding than UTF-8, hence applications
assuming UTF-8 encoding are said to fail.
