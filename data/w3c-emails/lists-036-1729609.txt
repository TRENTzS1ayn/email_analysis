There are two cases:

A) RDF documents (i.e. Content-Type: application/rdf+xml)

If you have: <rdf:Description ... rdf:about="#foo">

Then you *may* want the #foo to refer to whatever application/rdf+xml
says, and may ideally want to say that #foo refers to <xml:base#foo.


B) RDF embedded in other documents (XHTML, SVG,...):

Here the meaning of the fragment identifier is defined by the format
these fragment identifiers appear in. If you have

              <rdf:Description ... rdf:about="#section1">

then #section1 refers to e.g. Section 1 of the the HTML document in
front of you, independent of xml:base, and you don't want to change
that!
