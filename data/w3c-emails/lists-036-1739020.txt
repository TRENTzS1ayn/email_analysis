Procedurally, the goal is to produce a new document at
the "Draft Standard" level. I don't think we can introduce
new features at all, although it's possible to fix
errors and correct for difficulties, the corrections
allowable at Draft Standard level are usually those
things allowable in widespread use.

So the short answer is: no.

The best way to propose a new feature is to write a
separate document.

We might need to acknowledge xml:base in the 'base URL'
calculation, and possibly even propose an imaginary
URL scheme for "this here document" for dealing with
same document references, but I'd be uneasy about trying
to create some new form which actually was intended
to invoke a different calculation than what is currently
used.
