===================================

I too, have received a message with the same <iframe src=cid:...........> 
type of header, however, the message was not sent blank and I doubt that 
steve's message was likewise blank - there was an embedded object in the 
document - in mine it was called Apr18.exe

the message itself, without seeing the header info, is empty, but is it 
possible that this executable file runs automatically when the email is viewed?

Geobuilder.com mentioned something about virus messages and how to create 
rules to filter them out of your inbox.

this message was sent to my hotmail account - is there evidence that a web 
browser will run an executable from an internal frame (page sourced 
somewhere else) and deliver a virus payload? or is this something the 
affects MS outlook and outlook express?
