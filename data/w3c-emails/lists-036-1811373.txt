Using the 'last instant' has its own set of problems --
it seems to require deciding, a priori, whether after minting
  urn:tdb:2002:...yourwebpage...
you might need to change your mind about what's on
your page and mint another one. The shorter version urn:tdb:2002
comes after the more explicit urn:tdb:200204.

And anyone outside of your lucky time zone (you in the UK)
will probably get the date wrong on your international
journal anyway. Many journals seem to publish their April 29
issue late on April 28, in any case.

I'm not sure there's a solution that works uniformly for the
problem that Al's identified ("likely confusion over dates
if follows common usage"). The counter-proposals have just
as many failure cases.
