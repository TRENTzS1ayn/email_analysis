The example of resolving a relative URL could be improved.  It uses a
base
of http://a/b/c/d;p?q

Not wanting to read the RFC end to end, it took me a bit of searching to
find that the ;p part is a "parameter" and the ?q part is a "query".
But I
have no idea what their relevance is to this example.  It they are to be
ignored when attaching the relative parts, it would be nice to say so.

The basic expansion has one very confusing and not explained aspect.
The
relative path g is said to expand to http://a/b/c/g instead of
http://a/b/c/d/g.  The other expansions are obvious once the "remove d"
rule
is applied.  Would a base of http://a/b/c/d/ plus g expand to
http://a/b/c/d/g?


The examples should have enough annotation to
mostly stand on their own and to reinforce the concepts.
