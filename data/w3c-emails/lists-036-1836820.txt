The examples are intended to identify common bugs or deprecated features
in software.  The role of ";" changed from RFC 1808, so the tests can be
used to differentiate between an 1808-compliant parser and a 2396-compliant
parser, thus identifying places where changes are needed.

Yes, but again the purpose of the tests is to reveal the most common
parser bugs.  Treating a base as a prefix is one of the most common.

I'd like to expand the tests, particularly with other example base URI,
since there is one errata that would have been discovered that way.
More annotation is welcome.
