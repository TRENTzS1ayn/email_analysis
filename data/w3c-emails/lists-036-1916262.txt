Yes and no. XML, XML Schema, and XLink allow to include IRIs
directly in the XML. From a protocol point, that may still
be 'display', but many people will see it as more than just
display.

It is the default when converting from IRIs to URIs.
But it is not the default for an arbitrary %hh that is
out there.

I would be extremely delighted if we could just go and say
"it's UTF-8, and nothing else". Unfortunately, that's not
possible. But I think it's a very good idea to make clear
in the revision that UTF-8 is where things are moving,
rather than just the current

"For example, UTF-8 [UTF-8] defines a mapping from sequences
of octets to sequences of characters in the repertoire of ISO 10646."

Please be careful. This should be 'outside of the us-ascii
subset of utf-8'. iso-latin-1 and utf-8 are not compatible.

While we are at it, what about changes due to Internationalized
Domain Names?
http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idn-uri-01.txt
proposes to lift the restriction that %hh cannot be used in the
host name part. [Currently, only %80 and higher are allowed,
but I plan to change that because it would really be silly to
keep it that way.]

I agree.
