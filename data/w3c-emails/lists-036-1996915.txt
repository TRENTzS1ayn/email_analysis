It would be nice if this could be addressed in some fashion. Thanks for
bringing it up, and summarizing the history so nicely (I wasn't aware of
the previous discussion).

Those feel like guidelines more than hard semantics; IIRC, the main
distinction between URI path segments and URI parameters is that
parameters aren't ordered, so that aspect doesn't distinguish queries.

Perhaps what does distinguish queries is that while they are used in
identifying the resource, they aren't used directly in
locating/dereferencing it; just as fragment identifier semantics are
interpreted on the client side in the scope of the resource's
representation, so queries are interpreted on the server side in the scope
of the located resource (which may be a new concept).

I haven't worked through the ramifications of this; just food for thought.
