The acceptance of arbitrary order in a query component of a URI is, at its
broadest, specific to a scheme.  In the case of HTTP and 'http' URIs, the
acceptance of arbitrary order in a query component is specific to the
server.  Some administrators may enforce an order within query components,
responding to Request-URIs having disordered query components with 404
responses, or, better yet, with 3xx responses.
