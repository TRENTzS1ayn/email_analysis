I assumed that the query was semantically indistinguishable from the rest 
of the path -- part of what Hrvroje said? -- how they are interpreted is 
entirely up to the software the provides access to resources for the 
indicated authority.  Anything more, I think, is just a convenient 
convention, and not bound to anything fundamental in the nature of form of 
URI.

E.g. I think a web server could legitimately serve *files* with names (and 
corresponding URIs) that just happened to contain substrings that look like 
URI query elements.

Hence, in the general case, reordering of queries must be regarded as 
significant (i.e. different URIs), even though some severs may choose to 
return values that are invariant under reordering of same.
