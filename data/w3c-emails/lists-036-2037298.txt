Al,

I've no argument with what you say.

The URI spec rightly deals with the common ground between client and 
server, and in that there is no need for issues of "URIs are a language for 
building service-variant key expressions" -- you said it:  these are 
service variant.  Also, there's no need to deal with shades of requesters 
intent "to discover resources by their properties than to recover a 
resource by name".

I'm not denying the existence of these other issues, just saying they're 
not needed as a defined part of the protocol between client and server, so 
to make their semantics part of the URI spec is unnecessary complexity.
