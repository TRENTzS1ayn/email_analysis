Not entirely; relative URIs treat path segments and query components very
differently. This indirectly suggested to me that there might be the
concept of a "located resource" which differs from the more discussed
"identified resource". Thinking about it more, I'm not at all sure that
I'm not just offering guidelines as well; the semantics are determined by
the server alone; it's just that some common conventions are provided for
making URIs more useful, especially when using them to locate something.

Well, a Web server can do anything it wants behind the scenes; what
matters is the interface that the URI exposes.

Oh, I agree completely; it's completely up to the server.
