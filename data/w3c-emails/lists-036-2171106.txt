(Sorry if I appear to be obtuse, but I want to make sure I am clearly 
understanding what you are saying.)

Going back to the original example

http://www.example.com/redir?uri=http://www.example.com/someplace/else/

the generic syntax doesn't consider a / a hierarchy separator, only 
reserved.

So if it is mean to be presented to the redir cgi (in this case) as 
data, it should be encoded.

If it is meant to be presented to the redir cgi as its reserved meaning 
(whatever that may be) it should be left unencoded.

The only two parties that can determine whether it should or should not 
be encoded is the party writing the URI knowing how it should and will 
be interpretted by redir, and redir itself since it has defined the 
reserved purpose?

Am I following what you have written, or reading right past what you've 
written.

Thanks,
Jim
