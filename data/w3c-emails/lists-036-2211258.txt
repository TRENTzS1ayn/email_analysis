Many comments, mostly negative:

1) There is absolutely no need to have two different hash algorithms. 
For this purpose, both are equivalent. Pick one.

2) Appendix A will lead to lack of interoperability. You haven't 
shown why canonicalizing (that is, changing) the pre-hashed URI has 
any advantage.

3) Which leads to the biggest question: where are the real-world uses 
for this? Which actual content providers have said "I don't want to 
reveal the real URL for the thing you are comparing"? If those folks 
exist, they could easily answer the first two objections. Quite 
frankly, this seems like a cute and well thought-out idea searching 
for a problem.

4) Editorial: this document doesn't follow 
<ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc-editor/instructions2authors.txt> 
and therefore will probably be (at least initially) rejected by the 
RFC Editor.
