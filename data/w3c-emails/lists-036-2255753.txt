Re-read Appendix A and explain how this will help. Section 4.3 says 
"A possible canonicalization algorithm for hierarchical URIs is given 
in Appendix A." Note the word "possible". Saying that this is done 
sometimes but not others will immediately lead to lack of interop.

I'm still confused. Who needs to provide metadata without revealing 
their web browsing habits?

This is not useful unless you know what web page is being discussed.

This is not useful unless you know the participant

You can publish metadata about yourself without using your email address.
