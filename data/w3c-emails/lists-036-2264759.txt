I will admit that I never read the proposal.  You seem to be arguing
that interop suffers when there is more than one canonical
representation.  I agree, and in fact would argue that canonical in this
case is not the right word.  Maybe the author meant to say "normalize".

Are you saying that you, personally, do not see the utility of this?  Or
are you saying that such utility does not exist?

I would hope that anyone visiting the page would know what page they are
visiting!  Upon arriving at a page, the user would calculate the page's
hashed URI, then use the hashed URI to retrieve metadata.  This makes it
easy to find the comments that people have made about a *particular*
page, while making it more difficult to enumerate pages that a
particular *user* has rated.

Yes.  And a hash is a good way to do this.
