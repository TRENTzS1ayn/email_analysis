Hello Larry,

Many thanks for your comment on the IRI draft.

I have heard similar arguments from other people.
The main reason to include spaces was because the
people working on XPointer wanted it. I'll make sure
they know about the new proposal and get a chance to
argue their way, on www-international@w3.org.

Another specific issue with IRIs is that there are many
kinds of spaces in non-ASCII (starting with NBSP). It
may be better to allow U+0020, leading to some degree
of transcribability, rather than forbid it, having
some people use other kinds of spaces, which are much
less transcribable.

Using actual spaces (rather than %20) seems to be
rather popular in fragment identifiers.

As you may have noted,
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duerst-iri-02.txt
already updates the ABNF in parallel with rfc2396bis.
We have done this based on a request from Roy.

Yes, that would probably be a bad idea, in particular
if there are big differences.

Why do you think it's a bad idea? Because there is a
risk that there will be some more updates to rfc2396bis
while the IRI draft will already have moved to proposed?

How do you suggest we express the various details and
restrictions on IRI syntax without an ABNF?
As an example, we do not allow private use codepoints
in most parts of an IRI, but we allow them in the query
part.
