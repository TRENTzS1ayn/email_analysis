For a security protocol, some people think it is a good idea to have 
a fall-back; many others don't because of lack of interoperability 
and confusion. Regardless of that, what you are describing is not a 
security protocol.

Sorry, I believe that is still not good enough. Pick one.

So? They are still different URIs. If that is your reasoning, you 
should be hashing what is returned from the URI, not the URI itself.

Appendix A has examples of mapping ".html" to ".htm". That is *very* 
different than talking about case-insensitive host name parts. It is 
perfectly believable that <http://example.com/a.htm> will lead to a 
different object than <http://example.com/a.html>.

This simply re-affirms what I said before about lack of interoperability.

This has nothing to do with using them on the Internet, which is what 
we standardize in the IETF. You are making these only for 
publication, not for end-user use. This doesn't sound compelling to 
me.

At this point, I would have to say to the AD's original request: this 
probably should not be published as a standard or as an Informational 
RFC.
