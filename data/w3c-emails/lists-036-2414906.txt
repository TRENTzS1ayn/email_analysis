I believe it is increasingly being used in constructs involving name
spaces. I, for one, use it for that purpose and checked the RFC 2366
URI syntax carefully to make sure it was 'legal' in the way I was
using it

If there is a discrepancy between relative and absolute forms, I'd
recommend including ':' in both forms unless it breaks something.

I believe that, providing the initial 'scheme:' part can be parsed OK
(or determined to be absent if/where permitted) there should be no
other problems - but I've not done a rigorous check.
