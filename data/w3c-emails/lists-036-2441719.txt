Exactly my concern. If ':' is allowed in path segments, a URI like

http://example.com/my:car.html

is a valid http URI. My (imaginary) HTML editor now
creates relative URIs whenever it can and generates:

http://example.com/index.html as

<html>
  <body>
    <a href="my:car.html">my beautiful black toyota</a>
  </body>
</html>

Oops.
