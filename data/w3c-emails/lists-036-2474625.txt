My point is that allowing ':' in path segments makes life more
complicated than it needs to be.

Unless there is a compelling reason for allowing unescaped ':'
in path segments of *hierarchical* URIs, the spec should say that
':' needs to be escaped in these segments.

Then, generating correct relative URIs from absolute ones is
much less painful and less error prone.

Currently, code that "reliativizes" URIs needs to carefully check
that the first segment does not contain ':'. If it does, it needs
to prefix a './' to the relative URI.

I wonder how much code (other than mine :) did not see the need
for this check at the time of implementation and is now widely
deployed - its author hoping that ':' is never encountered...
