Existing practice is a compelling reason.

If I added your constraint to the syntax, then the code would still
have to do the same thing, since it isn't safe to assume the URI was
revised according to the new spec and it isn't valid to automatically
percent-encode the ":".  Either way, the code remains the same, and
we just piss-off the authors by demanding changes for no purpose.
