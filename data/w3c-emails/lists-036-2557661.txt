I've been trying to integrate the RFC 2732 update and have so far
found it to be a complete time-sink.  That RFC doesn't define the
actual IPv6 literal syntax, and the ABNF provided by RFC 2373 is
not even remotely correct.

Does anyone know of a correct BNF for the IPv6 literal?

It also looks like we'll have to switch to the formal ABNF of
RFC 2234 in order to define IPv4 addresses correctly.  At least
that will make the IESG happier, but it sure is a pain in the
editorial fingers.
