The IRI syntax, in this respect, tries to reflect the RFC 2396
exactly. Looking at RFC 2396, it seems to me that it has exactly
the same problem. I don't know whether the example is wrong, or
the syntax is wrong, or there is some other problem.

I have copied the uri list, where the experts on RFC 2396 can
help us.

I just pointed out the lack of *( ";" irparam ) in rel_segment
recently on uri@w3.org. Please see the thread starting at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Oct/0003.html.
