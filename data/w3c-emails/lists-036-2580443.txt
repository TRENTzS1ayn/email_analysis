I finished the first attempt at a revision of RFC 2396 just prior to
the I-D deadline and submitted it.  You can see it now at

     http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/
     draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis-00.txt
or
     http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html

If you'd like to see the blow-by-blow diffs of changes, see

     http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/ietf-uri/rev-2002/

I also updated the Issues list as I progressed

     http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html

which is now sorted with the unresolved issues up top.  This draft
contains all of the changes that appeared to be non-controversial.
Future drafts will focus on the controversial issues.

The following issues are still open.  If you wish to comment on them,
please include the issue name in the subject line, as in

  Subject: [010-gethostbyname] my implementation doesn't work that way

name                    title
=====================   ===========================================
021-relative-examples   relative URI examples could be improved
008-URIvsURIref         URI versus URI Reference
010-gethostbyname       gethostbyname allows much more than hostname BNF
017-rdf-fragment        RDF does not believe in same-document references

022-definitions         definitions for operations on URIs
024-identity            Resource should not be defined as anything

All discussion should take place on uri@w3.org.
