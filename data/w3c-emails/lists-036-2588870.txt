I've recently written four  XPointer scheme drafts that are in limbo
until November 22 or thereabouts because of the IETF cutoff on initial
drafts for the November meeting.

All four of these drafts are designed primarily to ask questions about
the nature of XPointer in particular and fragment identifiers and URI
references in general rather than provide conclusive answers in any
event, so limbo may be an appropriate status.  I consider all of these
completely experimental at this stage, but it seems worthwhile to
publish them now, while the work on RFC 2396 revision is just getting
started and as XPointer work winds down.

These documents specify schemes for use in XPointer-based fragment
identifiers. These schemes, like other XPointer Framework schemes, are
designed primarily for use with the XML Media Types defined in RFC
3023, to identify locations within a given XML representation of a
resource.

I'm sending these to uri@w3.org because they raise some questions about
the kinds of connections between URI references and the representations
with which they interact.  I'm concerned generally that URI references
were a convenient syntactic shortcut when they were first creator, but
that advances in the state of URI processing since then have made URI
references more opaque than convenient.

If anyone would like to make comments on the initial versions of these
documents prior to their submission as Internet-Drafts, I'd be happy to
hear them.  In many ways, this makes more sense than having a single
person publish initial Internet Drafts anyway, and many of these ideas
emerged from various xml-dev discussions.  Comments should probably be
directed to xml-dev@lists.xml.org.  (I'm not presently subscribed to
uri@w3.org, but will attempt to read and reply through archives.)

The four not-quite drafts are: 
--------------------------------------
The XPointer xinclude1() Scheme
http://simonstl.com/ietf/draft-stlaurent-xinclude-frag-00.html

The xinclude() scheme notifies an XPointer processor whether the
creator of the XPointer intended for XInclude 1.0 processing to take
place.

-------------------------------------- 
The XPointer xmlns-local() Scheme
http://simonstl.com/ietf/draft-stlaurent-xmlns-local-frag-00.html

The xmlns-local() scheme notifies an XPointer processor that it should
include all of the namespace binding context defined for the element
containing the XPointer in the namespace binding context for the
XPointer.

-------------------------------------- 
The XPointer content-type() Scheme
http://simonstl.com/ietf/draft-stlaurent-content-type-frag-00.html

The content-type() scheme notifies an XPointer processor whether the
creator of the XPointer intended for a particular pointer part to apply
to a resource representation which uses a particular MIME content type
identifier.

--------------------------------------- 
The XPointer pipeline1() Scheme
http://simonstl.com/ietf/draft-stlaurent-pipeline-frag-00.html

The pipeline1() scheme notifies an XPointer processor whether the 
creator of the XPointer intended for XML Pipeline Definition Language
processing to take place.

urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.6320 is another possibility altogether
