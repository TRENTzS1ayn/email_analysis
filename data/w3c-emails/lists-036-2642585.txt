The URI specification notes that the interpretation
of a fragment identifier (the part of a URI reference
after a '#') depends on the media type.

However, the template for media type registration
doesn't have a place to document the meaning of
fragment identifiers within the media type.

Originally, fragment identifiers were only used within
HTML documents, so the point was somewhat moot. However,
now there are several specifications -- mainly from
the W3C -- that use fragment identifiers more explicitly,
as well as proposals for changing or adding semantics
for fragment identifiers for existing media types
(such as a recent proposal for a fragment identifier
for plain text.)

Should the registration form for media types include
a statement about the semantics of fragment identifiers
for that media type?

Is there a consistent policy or design for 'good'
fragment identifier use?
