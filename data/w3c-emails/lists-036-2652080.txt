Regarding "good policy", I would encourage people to make fragment
identifiers, where possible, refer to 'anchor' style identifiers (i.e.,
using an extensibility mechanism like the 'id' attribute in XML, 'name' in
HTML, and so forth) rather than into the syntax and structure of the
format (as XPointer allows, through use of XPath). Doing so increases the
chance that a fragment identifier could be valid and useful across
multiple formats.
