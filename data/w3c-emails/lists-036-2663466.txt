Yes, your well presented summary above clearly indicates that the
addition of such a section would be a desirable enhancement and close
the lgap between media types and the URI specification.

Previously I would have said yes; current discussions indicate that
there is some disagreement, but it is being actively discussed. I hope
that it will be possible, fairly soon, for the Architecture document
to specify 'best practice' and 'common idiom' and to clarify, in a way
that covers the majority of existing specifications, what fragment
identifiers do and how best to construct them and how they may be used
or their use may affect other stages of processing such as
presentation.

Currently, I believe that we may have to note that there are existing
exceptions that have an entirely different model. Although I am hoping
that by appropriate layering, we may be able to have a low level and
universally applicable "syntactic" processing that says "this
portion/fragment of the content has been linked to" and higher levels
('presentation', and 'semantic') that say, respectively what the
effect of traversing a link including a fragment has on presentation
and what effect it has on application semantics (hoping that covers
the RDF case).

There is some initial wording to that effect in the Architecture
document, though it needs further discussion.
