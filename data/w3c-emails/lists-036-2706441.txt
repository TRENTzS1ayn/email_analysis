Here's a lo-tech contribution; it doesn't provide much
in the way of hypertext navigation, but it allows
me to read the file (in galeon's normal view) at least
as well as in view-source mode.

Add one line to the .xml :

<?xml-stylesheet href="issue-style.css" type="text/css"?>

and put these few lines in issue-style.css:

--8<--

issue, report { display: block; }

issue { border:2px solid black; padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em }

pre { display: block; white-space: pre }

name { font-weight: bold; vertical-align: super }

title { font-size: larger; font-weight: bold }
--8<--
