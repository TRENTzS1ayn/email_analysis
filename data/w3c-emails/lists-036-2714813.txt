I realized there can be multiple reports under one issue, so
this works a bit better:

--8<--
issue, report { display: block; }

issue { padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em }
report { border:2px solid black; padding: 1em; margin-top: 1em }

pre { display: block; white-space: pre }

name { font-weight: bold; vertical-align: super }
title { font-size: larger; font-weight: bold }

action { display: block; }

--8<--
