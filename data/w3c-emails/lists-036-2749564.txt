I have some questions about fragment identifiers.

When the media type is determined by negotiation, how can users 
specify fragment identifiers in advance?  I'm happy to see 
that the TAG is already considering this issue.

If fragment identifiers are interpreted by clients, why should 
they be standardized as part of URIs?  To me, they are not part 
of URIs or protocols, but they are instructions to clients.  In 
other words, why different applications for the same media type 
have to agree on fragment identifiers?

Cheers,

Makoto
