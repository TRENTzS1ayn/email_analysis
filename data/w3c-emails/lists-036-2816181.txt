Yes, but erroneously so.  This language in RFC 2396 was heuristic, and the
idea that individuation and a persistent referenceable identity are
intrinsic and universal in the Web, while central to the thinking of some
people, did not at that time nor at this one reflect a globally valid
interpretation of all the uses of URIs.

And the distinction between things and stuffs is not at all irrelevant to
building a reasonable engineering foundation for semantics for the Web.

On the web we need to be able to refer to both stuffs and things.

We just discovered we needed to factor ACSS into perturbations of the
text-to-speech transform, which is analogous to font characteristic
manipulation, and sonicons that are used as punctuation for phrasal elements.
Analogous to quotation marks and other punctuation which appear in the final
stream as characters but this is because these controls are of such
antiquity that there are standard glyphic characters for them.

The moral here is that this points straight at a distinction between text and
fills, which are styled as stuffs, and list elements and paragraphs and
such, which are styled as things.

If we comprehend this distinction at the outset, it would make the whole job
of characterizing styling a lot easier, and the result more like natural
language semantics.

In particular, for my dump on how regarding a search URL as a reference to
an identity is spurious, see

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/2001NovDec/0058.html

It is just much more direct to view a search URL as subclassing a stuff and
the server as returning references to things that exemplify the stuff that
the user's URL described.

The data of the 'dark Web' is more practical to approach as stuff typed by
tuples of properties than as entified things.  Or at least that view matches
application semantics better.

<et_cetera ad_nauseam/>

In any case, Miles, there are requirements in semanticizing the web both for
entities without identity, to refer to found instances matching a known
pattern, and for stuffs, in which you find the instances, as in the
examples above.  So web processing revolves around both things and stuffs,
and our logical vocabulary is not going to do the job if it doesn't deal
directly with both.

So please don't blow off what you know about logic because of what we didn't
know then.  We now have enough evidence that we should have known better.
