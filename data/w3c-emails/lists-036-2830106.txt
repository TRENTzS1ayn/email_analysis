I must admit I'm a bit taken aback by this response, however ...

... even tho' I don't have any particular metaphysical scruples when it 
comes to stuffs and substances, I'm afraid I simply don't buy this. 
Stuffs probably have a useful place somewhere, but I think not here.

Why are fills stuffs? Sure, I fill my pies with apple (apple-stuff, not 
individual apples), but text is nothing like a pie. This is a physical 
analogy too far: surely text-fills are properties. That gets you a 
categorical distinction between text and fill ... but a different one.

I have no idea what "subclassing a stuff" could possibly mean. I do 
understand types and subtypes tho'. And I've no idea how a thing 
"exemplifies" a stuff. A thing might exemplify (I'd prefer instantiate) 
a property, but it's _made_ of stuff ... and that's a different kind of 
relationship altogether.

Are we talking at cross-purposes? Do you mean by stuff what I mean by 
property?

I can't see anything there which directly relates to this thread. Could 
you give me an example?

I can certainly see a case for properties having first class status on 
the web, and I have no problem with properties counting as resources 
and having URIs. You'd need, in effect a second-order version of,

  A resource can be anything that has identity.

but it's also true that in almost all second-order systems,

  (VX)(X = X)

(ie. a second-order quantifier ranging over properties) is either an 
axiom or a theorem, so "that has identity" is _still_ redundant.

I can't see any immediate role for stuffs tho', and the fact that 
there's no well worked out formal theory of stuffs doesn't help either.

Cheers,


Miles
