No, that is not the only reasonably straightforward understanding of
identity.  That is the specific mathematical axiom of identity and not
identity itself.  We already had that discussion on www-tag.

Everything does not have identity.  "Everything" includes both things that
have been identified and those that have not yet been identified.  
Something
only becomes a resource after it has been identified, but not necessarily
by a URI.

The definition is correct as it stands.
