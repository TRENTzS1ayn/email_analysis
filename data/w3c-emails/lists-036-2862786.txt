Here you have assumed the point that I was attempting to
correct.  You assume that the category of resources are
a point set, and that URIs operate within this point set.

URIs operate within a set of communicative gestures we
term 'reference' and not all of them deal in the identity
properties of things, or in persistently entified 'things'
at all.

This all sounds nice, but it it unreal.  URIs are not all names.

URIs are used (search and data: URLs) to refer by characteristics that do
not qualify as names.

In the particular case of a search URL, there is no persistent thing.  The
'representation of the resource' received is a thing but the 'resource
identified in the request' is not.

The things that persist are the information model with regard to which the
query is written and the language for formulating a query against that
model.  And the service of synthesizing a thing that conforms to the type or
category specification defined by the query received from the client.

This distinction is not metaphysical, it has to deal with the structure of
computational processes linked by the references encoded in URIs.

You do the web a disservice to dismiss the architectural issue as
'metaphysical.'  It is very computational and economic and hence bears
importantly on how we frame our axioms for the Web.

The social process of denomination is not sustainably scalable to where the
web is going, because it is

a) costly
b) unnecessary

If we don't understand that URIs run on (derive their value in service from)
their use in the calculus of description, and not particularly a naming
calculus, we are going to leave the bulk of the future Web 'dark' by our
lights and wind up leading our own little backwater while the main stream of
the Web goes elsewhere following other pipers.

To understand the operating conditions of the Web one has to view it in
terms of relative unity, integrity and persistence and not view these
characteristics as boolean-valued.  Because at the actual operating point of
the web, "what URIs refer to" is characterized by fractional relative unity,
integrity and persistence.  This is what the market will bear.  This
operating point is sufficient to suport persistent expectation that
following URI-references will add value in the client user's world.  The
fact that this expectation is satisfied, in the main, keeps customers coming
back.  But only in the main.  It doesn't need to get perfect, and it isn't
about to do so.
