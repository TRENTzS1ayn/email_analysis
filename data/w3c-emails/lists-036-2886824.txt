I never talked about 'things' but resources as used
in uniform resource identifier. If a resource is a file
on my computer, my last google query or the set of all
quantum states of all particles of this universe one
thousand years from now is besides the point. Just
by talking about it, I can give it a name, without
even knowing what it (exactly) is.

As was clarified in the "denumerable" thread, the set
of *all* URIs (ever to be) is as mighty as the set of
all rational numbers, but not more. If you call those
sets "point sets", well fine.

Now, the set URIs operate on (or the set of whatever
they "identify", be it files, things or communicative
gestures) is certainly far greater than the set
of rational numbers. I do not know what it is - I just
called it R.

In what way do they not qualify? A data: uri holds its own content,
but it is still a valid name for that octet string. A google search
URL is a name for a certain query in googles database. The 
representation
returned will very over time, but that does not matter.

I wonder now, what a "persistent" thing is. You keep spinning off new
terms in wonderful English prose, but they mean less and less.

The goal of my last mail is a *definition* of what "identity" in 
the acronym
URI is or how it can be interpreted.

As far as I can tell, you have two issues with that definition:

1. resources is an insufficient name for what URIs try to address.

2. the defined mapping between resources and URIs does not
    have the same properties as people usually associate with
    "naming".

Point 1 is, for me, a play on words. If we call it resources or
things or whatever, I don't care. I just chose resources as it
is used in URI.

Point 2 has more substance. If the defined mapping does not
have the properties you think it should have, then please let
us come up with a better definition.

I see discussions on circular definitions and very slow progress
on what web architecture is. If we cannot define, in careful terms,
what an URI is good for, then the whole web architecture does not
need to be written down. It then just is what people do.

I proposed neither a unique, nor a centralized mapping of URIs. I said
that "having idenity" means that such a mapping exists. More, the beauty
of URIs and the Web is that the mapping can be done by anyone, if he
or she follows certain rules, as for example being authority for
a DNS subtree in the http: scheme. And that may be done even better
by future URI schemes which we cannot even think of now.
