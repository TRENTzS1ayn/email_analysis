I agree that the filesystem object must not be the resource. It can
be the resource in certain implementation. And even then, it must
not be the representation as I could imagine a translation service
on a text resource which hands out representation for different
content-languages.

Yet, there are URLs (at least on our server) which are not mapped
to anything (at a certain point in time). That's what WebDAV wants
to call a (currently) "unmapped URL". I do not see the mistake
in that.

While it is attractive that every character sequence following the
RFC 2396 syntax identfies a resource from sometime around 1992
to eternity, I find it problematic to derive any useful properties
from that definition. It certainly avoids the messy dependency on
time...

Is it impossible to model Dan's Toyota as a WebDAV resource? Maybe
one has to disallow certain operations on it...

More serious: variant handling in WebDAV is most certainly a
very interesting topic and currently not defined.
