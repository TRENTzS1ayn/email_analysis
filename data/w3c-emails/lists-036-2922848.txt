Yes, that's what I meant.

A "WebDAV resource" is just an HTTP resource.  Any resource that allows
PUT cannot vary depending on the headers of a GET request, since
any such variance would be eliminated by the PUT.  However, other
resources that are derived from that resource may also be impacted by
that PUT, and those other resources may vary depending on headers.
That is the nature of content negotiation in HTTP -- the negotiable
URI is never the same as the source URI.
