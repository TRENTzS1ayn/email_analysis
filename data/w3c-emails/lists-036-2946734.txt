You're confusing identity with identification.

The two aren't the same. Someone, I've no idea who, will be the first 
person to call me on the phone tomorrow. I can't identify that person, 
but whoever it will be is a satisfier of x = x.

If identification really is the concept that's being appealed to in RFC 
2396, then it would clarify things if the clause were revised to say 
that a resource can be anything that can be identified.

Whatever the concept being appealed to, if it's not being used vacuously 
then it ought to be possible to give illustrative examples of both 
things which satisfy it and things which don't.

Cheers,


Miles
