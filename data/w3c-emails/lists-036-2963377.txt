Some examples would be nice.

I take your point about stuffs, but only as metaphysics. In practical 
terms reference always goes hand in hand with individuation. Stuffs are 
referred to and manipulated in countable portions: eg. I can't buy 
unquantified oil-stuff, but I can buy 50 gallons of oil.

In any case for all practical purposes, stuffs can be traded off against 
properties ... which are at least reasonably well understood. That's 
not an argument that stuff is an empty concept, but it's evidence that 
we can do perfectly well without it.

Cheers,


Miles
