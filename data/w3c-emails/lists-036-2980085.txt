OOps...

I believe it does support iCalendar, judging from its publication format.

I know that Outlook/Exchange utilizes iCalendar, but AFAIK they use a
proprietary protocol to publish calendars and integrate with e-mail
(please correct me where I'm wrong), whereby iCal is using HTTP/WebDAV and
(unfortunately) URI schemes (instead of media types), respectively. As a
result, I don't think they'll interoperate in many cases (i.e., I can't
use iCal instead of Outlook to keep up with my corporate calendar
solution).

I didn't see the link?  As far as I know, Apple supports iCalendar RFC
2445, which is also supported in MS Outlook and undoubtedly many other
clients..
