I'd consider this a shortcoming of moddav -- it surely could persist the
content type that was sent. "Our" (actually SAP's) WebDAV server does that,
just like the content language when specified in the PUT request.

Of course inventing a new URI scheme just to workaround a specific
shortcoming somewhere else is an extremely bad idea.

The SAP Enterprise Portal WebDAV connector does this. If you're interested
in trying it, email me and I'll send you a test account on our server.
