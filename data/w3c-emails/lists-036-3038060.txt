That would basically mean that for every URI to which I can apply PUT,
there's only one representation a subsequent GET will deliver, so it doesn't
vary. It's certainly possible to use PUT this way, but I'm wondering where
the HTTP spec makes this a requirement? Looking at section 9.6, it seems
also plausible to consider GET and PUT to be symmetric. So I'd be allowed to
PUT to different representations of a resource with, let's say, varying
"content-language" headers. If you say that this is illegal, I'd like to
understand where RFC2616 forbids that.

Is there possibly another RFC that would say more about authoring HTTP
resources that can vary?

Q: you're using the term "source URI" as if it was formally defined
somewhere... If I understand you correctly, the source URI upon a GET that
varies would be the URI returned in the "Content-Location" header, right? As
far as I understand section 14.14, a server MAY report this URI, but it
doesn't have to. So, is your point that for an authorable resource, there
should *always* be a source URI for each individual entity that can be
modified?
