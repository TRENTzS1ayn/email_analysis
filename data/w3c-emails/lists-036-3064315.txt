This has always puzzled me. From an RDF perspective, where we say little
more than 'URIs are names' it is often easier (esp. for the logicians) to
take the perspective that there are no 'dangling URIs' that name nothing;
and that 404 and DELETE correspond to a lack of information about the
named thing, rather than to the named thing not existing at all. If the
consensus here is that there are some URIs that denote nothing, we ought
to take that message back to the RDF groups.
