Can this puzzling perhaps be resolved by looking at how URIs are
used in the different aspects/layers in the architecture?

In one layer all URIs are regarded as "names" for
[insert your favorite term]s. A name always exists. A name cannot be
deleted. Formerly, those URIs were called URNs until it was discovered
that every URI can be used as name and, for example, http URIs are
good candidates for XML namespaces.

In another (sub-?) layer URIs are used for "retrieval" of 
representations.
Representations can be missing (404), they can be removed (DELETE)
or even replaced (PUT). Formerly those URIs were called URLs, until
it was discovered that every URI can potentially be used for
retrieval.

Now for the term "resource".

If, as Roy said, the mapping is the resource, then HTTP is not about
manipulation of resources but about manipulation of representations.
In this terminology one could reformulate, e.g. "302 Found"
(RFC 2616 10.3.3) from:

"The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI..."

to
"The requested representation can be found temporarily under a 
different URI..."

or
"The requested representation is temporarily the same as for another
  URI and can be retrieved there..."

No, this is not a proposal to reformulate RFC 2616. ;)
