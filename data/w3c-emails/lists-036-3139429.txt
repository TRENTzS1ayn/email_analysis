sure there is a trade-off between simplicity and complexity. and 
fragment identifiers can always break. so why bother? i am nor sure that 
  the regex stuff is necessary, but it would be nice to have in some 
cases, and this is why i included it in the draft. unfortunately, people 
are so busy doing all kinds of xml-stuff, so the feedback so far has 
been minimal. most people seem to like the regex approach.

thanks!

good point. applications must be able to transcode characters.

however, i have received feedback that the parentheses-syntax is too 
complicated and should be replaced with a more ascii-ish syntax such as 
#char=2-4;char=7-3335, and i kind of liked the idea. i have no idea 
where the borden draft ist going, but i think that it will disappear. 
does anybody have news about this?

yup.

thanks.

so, apart from the minor fixes, does anybody have an opinion about the 
prantheses vs. equals syntax issue? i also thought about adding a 
checksum facility (md5 or something along these lines), so that fragment 
identifiers could recognize a particular version of a resource. any 
opinions about this feature (it would be optional, so that applications 
would be allowed to ignore the checksum)?

cheers,
