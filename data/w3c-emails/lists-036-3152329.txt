Do you mean 'delete' in the classic programming language sense (releasing
system memory, calling destructors, etc.) or do you mean the HTTP concept of
DELETE?

I haven't followed the discussion of the response status codes for
idempotent PUT/DELETE pairs, but it sounded like HTTP's DELETE should return
a 2xx success even if a GET would return a 404. What's the official word on
this?
