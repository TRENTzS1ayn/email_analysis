well, writing parsers for both syntaxes is not too hard. so it is more a 
question of policy (good old syntax or fashionable new schemes) and 
personal taste.

i would object to that. one of the most important use cases for fragment 
identifiers is creating them for documents over which i do not have 
control, so i cannot mandate a way of how versioning of the resource 
should be done. but maybe i still would like to have some robustness 
built into my fragment identifiers, and a checksum would be ideal for that.
