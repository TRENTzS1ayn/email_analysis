having a #name syntax would certainly be a nice thing, but in my opinion 
there is no evidence that there is a pattern that could be reliably 
searched for that clearly dominates other patterns. i would therefore 
rather omit the #name syntax, but if consensus can be reached which 
pattern should be used, then i have no problem with integrating it into 
the draft.

cheers,
