Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs): new mailing list

To complete the discussion on Internationalized Resource Identifiers
(IRIs) [1] and move it to Proposed Standard, we have created a new,
dedicated mailing list. This is based on discussion at the recent
BOF on URIs [2] at the IETF in San Francisco.

If you are interested in IRIs, please subscribe to the list
by sending a mail to public-iri-request@w3.org with "subscribe"
(without the quotes) as the subject, or just click below on [3].
The mailing list is publicly archived at [4]. Please wait for
discussion until next week to give everybody a chance to sign up.
Please note that the first time you send a mail, you may be asked
to confirm your mail via a web page. This serves as spam protection
and to make sure that you understand that your mail is publicly
archived.

I have also created an issues list at [5] where I will track
the discussion.

Regards,    Martin.
