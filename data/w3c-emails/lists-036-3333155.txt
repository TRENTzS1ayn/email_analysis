[much snipped]

This is rather densely written, but if I understand the issue (i.e. I am
not too dense myself), then what it seems to me that you want is in fact
the query (?...) rather than the fragment (#...) syntax.  Queries unlike
fragments are passed to the server by general URI dereference, to handle
as it pleases.  The query is part of an absolute URI, not merely of a URI
reference, and its meaning can only be understood in the context of
everything to the left of it.  Many schemes (ftp, telnet, gopher, e.g.)
don't do anything useful with queries, but they are always supported
syntactically.

AFAIK nothing prevents you from defining with the rstp scheme a universal
meaning of queries, as in the mailto: protocol where queries of the form
?foo=bar&baz=quux mean to generate header lines "Foo: bar" and "Baz: quux".
