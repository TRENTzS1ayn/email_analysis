I agree.

URI references address things on the Web, things that are not resources by
RFC 2396.

I agree.

The fragment identifier proposal does make the sub-part addressable, at the
cost of mangling standard URI semantics. That this mangling is both bad and
avoidable is the opinion of at least two people on this list.

Yes! As I contemplate the issue, I reject the query proposals as well as the
fragment identifier proposals. Extracting media runs is essentially a
protocol parameter: it has standard meaning in RTSP regardless of the server
and of the media type. Thus the expression of the extraction should be a URI
parameter, [";" param] in the grammar of RFC 2396.
