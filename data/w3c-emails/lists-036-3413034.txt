And it would be intuitive for anybody familiar with the development of URIs
that the fragment identifier means that the entire resource is passed and
available while only the identified fragment is emphasized or targetted.

I agree with this statement. I do not agree that the fragment identifier
should have an effect on what the server delivers.

I'll let Tim Berners-Lee, Roy Fielding, Larry Masinter, and Mark McCahill
answer on what influenced the specification of fragment identifiers. I
believe that the principles in effect are solid and good, regardless of the
motivation.

Let's take an example. Suppose that I have an enormous XML document, like an
aviation equipment specification. I might want to retrieve just a small part
of that document. Rather than pass a fragment identifier over the network
and expect the server to handle the fragment identifier, the Right Thing is
to append segments to the path to drill down through the document hierarchy.
So I integrate XPointer into the path, send the resulting URI to the server,
and get a few slim XML nodes in return. This scenario works just as well as
passing fragment identifiers for server-side interpretation, but does not
disturb existing semantics.

I agree. This means that fragment identifiers are inappropriate for handling
media extraction of the sort that you intend. Use parameters in the path
instead.
