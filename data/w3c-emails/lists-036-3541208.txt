I don't see what the tradeoff is, actually. The idea for
pointing into 'frozen' documents without IDs is to supply
context. This has been common practice in finding locations
in plain text files for decades (`man patch`).

The 'patch' command has been pretty reliable, in my experience,
in figuring out where to apply a patch even when the original
source file has been edited. So why shouldn't text/plain fragment
identifiers employ some of the same mechanisms?

A line number plus some bits of context would be useful;
I don't see the use of character counts or general regular
expressions, at least for the applications I can imagine.
