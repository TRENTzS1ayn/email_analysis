I like that use of backquotes in plain text for incorporating something by
reference!

Diff format works for patches because there is no real need for pointers:
adding highly verbose context (one or more lines) is only a small cost
compared to the new content itself.  Here we are trying to capture a
location in a document that will fit into reasonable expectations about
the size of URI references.  Regular expressions are well-supported by
libraries almost everywhere, and can be much more condensed than context
lines.

The basic advantage of character counts is that they are fast to
compute and fast to reference, and would be handy for pointing into
documents like RFCs that are truly and forever frozen.
