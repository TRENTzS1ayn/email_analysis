This is peripheral to your point, but quantum mechanics tells us that
atoms are truly Leibnizian indiscernibles -- there is not only no way
to label all the sodium atoms in your body, but there is not even any
sense in which they can be individuated from one another.

(By "atoms" I mean only what physicists call atoms, not Leibnizian atoms.)

I think you underestimate the power of substitutional quantification,
unnatural as it seems, to work in the Real World, an essentially finite
place.  Objectual quantification is clearly neater in a formal sense,
but provokes intractable computational difficulties.
