So do I, and I agree it is peripheral, but I think you are wrong 
about the atoms in my body.  Particular atoms are distinguishable by 
their relative location, if by no other means. These days, one can 
actually *see* individual atoms and even push them about in some 
cases. They obey Bose statistics, but that's another matter: that's 
like saying they have no *intrinsic* identities, that could be 
discovered by looking at them in isolation, like blemishes on an 
apple; but I didn't say that they did.

If you wish to have a debate about the nature of quantification, I am 
willing to engage you in  one, but it will take a long time. I 
absolutely do not accept your implication that talk of the Real World 
is inherently suited to the substitutional interpretation, or indeed 
that the set of entities we need to refer to, in order to talk about 
the Real World, is finite.  For example, I am quite sure that there 
are things which have no names and which have never been, and never 
will be, referred to by names. In the substitutional interpretation, 
what I just said is *meaningless*.

But surely the point here is not which one of us is right in some 
absolute sense, but whether the central definitions of the Web should 
be posed in a form which renders vast areas of the intellectual 
landscape out of bounds. Most working mathematicians are Platonists, 
for example, who believe that their abstractions are real: try 
telling a Platonist that she is obliged to use substitutional 
quantifiers.

Really? Can you say what those computational difficulties are? I know 
of none, and have been using formalisms with such quantifiers in 
computational settings for about 30 years now.  And the issue is not 
to do with formal 'neatness', but practical matters of interpreting 
normal language. Kripke's 1976 review seems to me to be a masterly 
demolition of substitutional interpretations in general, in fact.
