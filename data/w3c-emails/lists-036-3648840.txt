Well, okay.  The central issue is whether "Ax" and "Ex" are best interpreted
as "For all things" and "There exists at least one thing" or whether
the righteous thing for SW purposes is "For all names of things, the
thing named by the name" and "There exists at least one name of something
such that the thing named by the name".  The latter interpretations look
and are more complicated, but have (according to me) certain advantages.

However, I haven't read the Kripke article that my interlocutor is
referring to, and I have a lot of respect for Kripke (anyone who doesn't
is either just ill-informed (fair enough) or an idiot).  Is the article
on line anywhere?
