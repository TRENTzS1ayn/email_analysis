Sorry, *now* I am confused.  What does this mean?  

It seems to have nothing at all to do with what Pat was talking about,
and in fact seems to have no meaning at all.

What does "defined more precisely outside the English language" mean?
Surely you can't mean "defined in some non-English language", or worse
yet "defined in some non-language"?
