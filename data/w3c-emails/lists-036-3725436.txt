Huh?  <dl> is a definition list in HTML.  All I want is a definition of
the "R" in URI, and the existing one is sufficient without excluding
anything that might be in the class of resources identified by URI.

Thank you for proposing some real text!  However, please note that the
definition of resource in 2396 extends beyond the scope of the Web and
into all of the possible things that Internet protocols might identify.
I cannot use a subset of examples to define the concept because then
people use the examples to declare those outside the set to not be
resources.
