Just an aside, but I doubt if any philosopher has ever argued about 
that. The term 'resource' as used in W3C circles is a private term of 
art in the W3C, and not used in this sense by any other community as 
far as I know.

The technology will change if we restrict "resource" to only refer to 
things that are in some sense 'identified' by a URI. That has 
immediate technological consequences for a whole range of 
applications, or else we will have to rewrite several draft W3C specs.

I sympathise with your frustration with philosophy; I share it myself 
to a large extent. But I have found that the best way to handle it is 
actually to learn some philosophy, oddly enough, if one insists on 
making philosophical pronouncements; and this sentence seems to be 
one.

My problem with it is precisely that in the English I speak and read, 
it means "A resource can be anything." However, the extra words, and 
your insistence upon them, seem to indicate that this isn't what you 
intend it to mean. Hence, I am left unsure about what it does mean, 
as I have been ever since I first read it; and I don't think I am 
alone.

I would prefer to not exclude anything. What's wrong with. "A 
resource can be anything."  I can't see any reason so far to impose 
any kind of restriction on what can count as one.

Thanks for the pointer, but Im afraid that only makes things worse 
for me. I have no idea what you are talking about in this message. 
What for example is a 'system of identification'? What is 'sameness 
of essential character'?  Does it differ from inessential character, 
for example? Citing Webster isnt good enough, sorry: we are trying to 
get these ideas tied down well enough so that we can use mathematics 
on them. (BTW, if this is not a philosophical discussion, I must be 
dreaming.)  What do you mean by an 'identification mechanism'? 
(mechanism??)

Your example of the clock I find particularly confusing. Why would it 
be a different resource if it gives me UTC time rather than local 
time? The criteria for what counts as a resource seem to be getting 
murkier with every sentence in your explanation, rather than clearer. 
(BTW, can the time itself be a resource?)

Im not trying to be difficult, honestly. I am just totally confused. 
None of what you say about resources enables me to get a clear 
picture of what you mean by the term.

Let me ask: why do we need to attempt to define or limit the term? 
What is wrong with just saying, a resource can be anything?
