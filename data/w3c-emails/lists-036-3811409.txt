Ah, that is progress (for me), thanks. I agree that the word "name" 
is potentially troublesome, so how about "a resource is anything that 
can be referred to".  That sidesteps the question of HOW you refer to 
it, of course.  It still has the problem, for me, that the extra 
words at the end read like a qualifier, and immediately suggest that 
one is presupposing that there are things that cannot be referred to, 
and I kind of doubt if there are any of those.  So I still prefer the 
wonderfully simple version: a resource can be anything.

PS. How about the following as a way to introduce the whole thing? 
Obviously more would be needed.

URIs can be used to refer to resources, and a resource is anything 
that can be referred to. The vacuity of this as a definition reflects 
the fact that there are no a priori boundaries on the kinds of thing 
that URIs can be used to refer to; the need for a special 
nomenclature arises from the fact that URIs are used in Web protocols 
associated in various ways with the resources they refer to.
