Yeah, that's exactly what I meant to say.  Isn't that what everyone else
is saying?  Does it eliminate the ambiguity to say:

"A resource is anything that can be assigned a name for purposes of
identification"

This seems to address Pat's concerns -- some things are, indeed,
unnamable.  Those things are not "resources"; everything else is.

Wow, I am surprised that anyone would want to stipulate that something
must already have a URI assigned to qualify as a "resource".  What
possible use could there be in trying to argue about *that*?
