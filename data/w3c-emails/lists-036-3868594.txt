The use is that it constrains the discussion and implementations to
something manageable. What I'm after is one term that applies to things
that a URI is bound to (what I call a Resource with the capital R being
intentional) and another, wholly seperate term for things that might
exist but which don't have a URI bound to them. That way systems like
LDAP v3 referrals can safely say they only deal with 'things' that have
URIs already bound to them.

It is very intentional on my part to design things such that, if it
doesn't have a URI, then it simply does not exist.
