You sound as if the term philosopher has some private meaning.
I can assure you that there are well over 100 philosophers in the W3C
and IETF, and a good many of them even have Ph.D.s.  I can further 
assure
you that many of them argue about "resource" far too frequently, as 
evidenced
by the size of my saved mailbox.  Whether or not they are qualified to
be called "philosophers" is yet another ontological debate that is
better avoided.

Which is, of course, why the current definition does not do that.

Anything includes those things that cannot be identified, and those 
things
are not resources.

Heh, that's amusing.  I'd cite the OED or some more definitive source,
but they don't have a convenient website.

Mathematics is a tool, not an answer.  If you can't do the translation,
then maybe you are using the wrong tool.  What good is having a 
mathematical
model if that model fails to correspond to what is supposed to be 
modeled?
Maybe the wrong type of mathematics is being applied.

> What do you mean by an 'identification mechanism'? (mechanism??)

A system of identification that has been mechanized.

What is time?  Please don't tell me it is an absolute quantity 
independent
of any frame of reference.

I think you need to slow down and spend more time thinking about it.
It's not as if this is a new subject, and I don't see any reason why
you need to completely understand it in an day's study.

Because a resource must be identifiable.
