Yep.

You'd think that was the case. Sometimes I wonder.....

It could be exactly what I was saying iff you used the definition of
Resource I'm using in the earlier paragraphs. At least for me, the term
'resource' means only what RFC 2396 says it means. It has no english
meaning outside that document. That might not jive with 'reality' but it
works better than attempting to get everyone to agree on what the
english definition of 'resource' is.

For me I divide the world up like this:

There are things. Everthing is a 'thing'. There are no exceptions. Even
'nothing' is a thing.

There are 'Resources'. 'Resources' are 'things' that have had a URI
bound to them.

Use of the term 'resource' any where else is either deprecated or
meaningless. If it is used then, unless stated explicitly, you are _not_
using the definition found in the previous two sentences and as far as
I'm concerned you're talking gibberish. If that's provocative then maybe
we should pick a different word?
