I believe many members of the RDF developer community, doing their best
to take 2396 on faith, will be glad to hear this stated so explicitly.

Are there such things? To claim so without adopting some specific 
theory of reference / naming is a little vague. If my time in the Philosophy 
dept taught me anything, it was that theories of reference are subtle 
and unrewarding and liable to cause controversy. Which theory of reference 
we adopt will influence our judgement about which things (if any) are
unidentifiable. I find little practical engineering value in 
the mailto:uri@w3.org list engaging in discussions about "what counts 
as being identifiable?", yet we're inevitably drawn to that by 
making a thing's 2396-resource-ness dependent on whether or not it 
can "be identified", whatever that means. From where I'm standing, the 
simplest option seems to be to retreat to plain old 'resources are things'.
(this from someone who fled academic philosophy to avoid spending time on
futile debates about meaning and reference (doh! ;)).

Could you expand a little on this notion of 'things that cannot be 
identified'? Specifically, on why there is value in having a technical 
term for 'everything except things that can't be identified'.
...by whom? ...when? etc too -- can a thing become a resource? can a 
resource slip from resource-hood and become unidentifiable? 

I'd be particularly interested in use cases for where such distinction
has proved valuable in a Web context, and (if this even makes sense) some 
examples of unidentifiable things? Could you describe a few of them?

I think this tool could be applied with a bit more enthusiasm first, before
we admit defeat and agree that 2396's notion of 'identity' is just too 
subtle and rich for the clumsy mechanisms of mathematical logic.

Re the 'wrong type of maths', yes there are aspects of the URI story
eg dealing with change over time which may mean we go shopping for a 
formalism designed for representing such things. That is why it is imho 
important to get answers to the questions Pat raised such as 'can something
stop being a 2396:resource?'. I'm not sure what the process is for doing so, 
except proposing textual changes to the spec. Formalising the temporal 
aspects would likely be a nightmare, which is one of the reasons I'm 
happy with just saying 'everything is a resource, the end.'

FWIW we went through the same process with RDF. The 1999 spec was interesting
and evocative and specified in prose. Implementor feedback led us to go back
and clarify things with a combination of logic and test cases, I think with 
some success. There was similarly

Turned into a machine or mechanical process? So that specific acts of 
identifying can be undertaken without sentient supervision? I'm not sure 
I follow, could you give some examples of such mechanisms?

I believe Pat has more than done his reading and research, both in terms 
of ploughing through relevant W3C and IETF specs, following mailing 
list discussions, and through spending many years studying the 
subtleties of building formal representational systems. He asked good, 
if slightly bemused sounding, questions that may help tease out some  
of the unarticulated design principles and assumptions behind 
the RFC 2396 document.

I've just re-read 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Jul/0128.html
and am still puzzled. If by identifiable you mean 
"in principle identifiable" rather than "in actual fact 
identifiable 'cos it has a known URI", then you really do 
raise expectations that those principles be articulated somewhere.

Maybe we could have a URI FAQ:

(this is proposed draft text for the revised spec btw):
[[
Appendix X: Some common questions about Resource-nature...

Q: Are all things 'resources'?
A: No, only some things. Unidentifiable things are not 'resources'.

Q: Which things cannot be identified?
A: Only those things which, in their current history, have 
   not been named or in-principle nameable with a URI reference.

Q: What is it to be name-able by a URI reference?
A: To be the kind of thing that can truly be said to be named
   by an RFC2396-formatted URI reference string.

Q: Are there any things that are not in this category?
A: At the present time, we do not know.

Q: Can an unidentifiable thing become identifiable?
A: Yes, either through improvements in Web naming 
    infrastructure, or through changes in its 
    characteristics.

Q: Are there any things which are currently 'resources'
   but which were previously not identifiable.
A: This is an open research question.

Q: Can a resource ever stop being a resource, yet 
   continue to exist as a non-resource thing.
A: Only in the event of a catastrophic collapse in 
   the in-principle identifiability infrastructure.
]]


etc. Ok the last answer was a bit flippant, but in general I'm 
serious. These questions come up all the time, and the spec 
rather than scattered mailing list archives seems a better 
home for their answers.
