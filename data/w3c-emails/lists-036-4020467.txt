That wasn't my intent. One may be able to refer without identifying, 
which was part of the point. Also, I know what 'refer' means much 
better than I know what 'identify' means. It carries less baggage.

Whats wrong with circular definitions? At this level of generality, 
its almost inevitable for definitions to be mutually recursive.  It 
might be better just to not give definitions at all, however.
