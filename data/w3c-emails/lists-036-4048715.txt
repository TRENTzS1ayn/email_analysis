No, we want you to put up or shut up.  We want you to take the time to
describe what it is you want the definition to say, because it is quite
possible that you might come up with better wording than what we have 
now.
That is standard operating procedure for editing specifications.

Oh, so you just want me to tell you what it means, and that will be the
end of it?  Every time I do that, other people claim I am just arguing
from authority.  Ask them if you want that kind of answer.

You obviously have something you want it to say, otherwise you would not
be concerned about any of those things.  In any case, the definitions
aren't in the normative part of the document anyway.  They are attempts
to answer the most commonly asked questions.

I didn't know I had the job of telling everyone the definitions.
Heck, if that's the case, I don't need a working group.

The definitions I like are already in the document.  I already gave
you a reference that defines them as completely as I wish them to be
defined.  If that isn't good enough for you, how am I supposed to
know what will be good enough?

As near as I can tell, the entire source of your confusion is due to
assuming that the word "identity" refers to the identity function of
mathematics, which as I said at the beginning of this thread is not
the case.  I can clarify that in the text, assuming I ever get a chance
to work on the document.

No.  Look, you guys aren't the ones who have to answer questions in the
absence of definitions.  I do.  I refuse to leave what has been deployed
in an unspecified state, regardless of how many arguments that causes
in the Semantic Web.  If SemWeb needs a better definition, then its
proponents can reach consensus on what it should be and provide me
with an appropriate text that has no adverse impact on deployed
implementations of URI.

I am not even remotely confused about what resource means.  That does
not mean the definition can't be improved.
