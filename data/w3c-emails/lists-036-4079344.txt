That decision would completely break large parts of current Web 
technology. It is completely unacceptable, quite apart from being so 
obviously false that it would be simply ridiculous to assert it. 
Moreover it is completely unnecessary: if LDAP v3 wishes to restrict 
itself to entities which have a URI assigned to them, then go ahead: 
you can use that very phrase to identify your intended universe of 
discourse, or invent some special term. But don't try to impose that 
restriction on the rest of the world.
