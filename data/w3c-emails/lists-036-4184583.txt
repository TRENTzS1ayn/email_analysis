OK.  I assume this is in response to the phrase "this document does not 
specify ...".

I think the argument about 'refer' vs 'identify' is a bit sterile, because 
I think I can supply an identifier for anything that Pat can refer to, and 
I think that anything with an identifier can be said to have identity (the 
identifier being sufficient if not necessary);  and clearly anything 
identified can be referenced.

I have generally read the existing (RFC2396) text to mean that anything can 
be a resource.  On the margin, there may be some debate about whether there 
are or are not things that cannot be identified, but I don't think such 
things really matter to the immediate future of the Web.  On this 
assumption, maybe the last sentences of Pat's text might be:

[[
The entities referred to or identified by URIs when used in Web contexts 
are called "resources".  Anything can be a resource:  there is no 
restriction on the nature of resources."
]]
