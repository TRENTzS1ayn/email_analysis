I like Sylvia's idea and concepts, but I agree, I have to be able to 
know (client side) how to handle a URL before I even contact the 
server.  Indeed, I need to know what I (client) will interpret and 
what I want the server to handle.  It seems that the specification of 
how fragments are handled should be owned by the protocol (rtsp, 
http), not the MIME type, no?
