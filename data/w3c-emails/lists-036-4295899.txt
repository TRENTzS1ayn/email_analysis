Seems we agree on that.

You have it backwards: RDF and the SW *don't* need to make this 
assumption, which is being imposed from elsewhere.  You won't find 
anything about grounding or designation in any of the RDF/S or OWL 
documents, and we are purging the fluff about "social meaning". In 
fact, the reason Im howling so loud about this issue is that this 
assumption (that URIrefs *must* by some magical process always be 
uniquely grounded) is FATAL to SW semantic theories. That's why I 
don't want RFC 2396 to say anything that can be interpreted this way.

Don't give the impression that logic requires grounding. It doesn't.

Again, the problem is not that the logic requires unambiguity; quite 
the reverse, in fact: it is that imposing unambiguity as a defining 
characteristic of URIs is logically incoherent.

Suggested modification, without the logic-bashing:

>  What is a Resource? Can a URI be used to identify a Concept?

>  This specification does not define the word 'resource' carefully,

The reason for the last three words is that it doesn't make sense to 
say that a URI identifies a *single* thing, in almost any logical 
language. (In fact, it doesn't make much sense in any language, IMO, 
but leave that aside for now.)

PS. That could also end, "...they are used to identify or refer to." 
if that reads better.
