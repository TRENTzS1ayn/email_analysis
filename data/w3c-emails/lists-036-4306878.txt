I don't think so. It's possible (although why one would want
to do so isn't clear) to serve a SMIL document using rtsp.
In that case, the fragment identifiers are still SMIL fragments,
not 'rtsp' fragments.

It may be that if you know the MIME type early in retrieval
(via FTP, HTTP, RTSP or whatever), you can process the fragment
identifiers early. However, the _meaning_ depends on the MIME type,
even though the way you process it might vary depending on
the protocol.
