Pat, 
  I think that's one of the places that we're falling down on our
explanation. You assert that it doesn't make sense "in almost any
logical language". And that's the point, URIs aren't _in_ a logical
language, they exist outside all of them. URIs may be used _by_ a
language but at that point it is incumbent on the language/system that
uses them to define what it means concerning the things that URIs are
allowed to identify. 

  As Graham has pointed out before, the problem here is that RDF, SW,
OWL, etc have erroneously attempted to inherit RFC 2396's concept of
Resources unmodified, and that was a severe mistake. IMHO, it is
probably worth inserting language into the new document suggesting that
it is extremely dangerous to simply inherit this definition of a
Resource without some sort of system specific profile of it. Systems can
do it but they have to be very clear that they are inherit it, not the
other way around...

  To simply inherit this documents concept of a Resource would be the
network equivalent of simply specifying an application layer (8)
protocol directly on top of IP, ignoring its admonitions to use things
like TCP/UDP/ICMP, etc that constrain IP to something that is usable by
higher layers.
