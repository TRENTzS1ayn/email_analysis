It is not enough to say "strcmp()is OK".  We must require 
the minimal level of C14N provided by XML, namely resolution 
of entities and numeric character references.  While this is 
obvious in a pure XML environment, I remain concerned that 
namespace URIs may be plucked out of XML documents and 
transplanted into other environments without the application 
of this minimal C14N.
