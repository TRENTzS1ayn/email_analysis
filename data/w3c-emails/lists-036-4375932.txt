The Namespaces CR is welcome to choose CDATA comparison over URI 
comparison,
but it has no choice in regards to URI equivalence.  It cannot claim 
they
are different -- it can only claim that they are inconsistently written.

BTW, there is no reason for the Namespaces specification to include
the quoted text above -- they are over-specifying the protocol.  What
they should say is that identifiers are assumed to be in normal form
and are not normalized for consistency prior to comparison.

That is mixing normalization with comparison.  The document doesn't say
that because it isn't usually necessary -- URIs are often compared with 
the
assumption that they are already in normal form.  That's the whole point
of the additions for section 6.
