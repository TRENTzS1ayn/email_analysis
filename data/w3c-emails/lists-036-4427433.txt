This message does not contribute directly to the RFC2396bis wording debate.

I'm trying to explore, in response to Pat's comments, reconciliation of 
formal notions of denotation with the commonly understood idea of URIs as 
identifiers.

Oops, in that message, to you, I should have said "denotes".  (I was trying 
to separate the nature-of-resource question from what-is-identity question, 
and failed.)

As for the uniqueness of denotation... I think I begin to see the problem 
here.  .....

In logic, I think one uses expressions like (exists x . f(x)) to express 
such.    Is a query answer is an RDF graph with bnodes, I interpret that as 
meaning much the same thing -- I'm not asking to export the binding, just 
express the query result.  My concern is that URIs are not the right form 
to denote some elements of query results, because some parts of query 
results are not "resources" in the intended sense.

I don't see that contradicting what I'm trying to say.

One of the aspects of model theory that it's difficult for ordinary 
programmers to fully take on board is the idea of any denotation being with 
respect to a given interpretation, and the fact that there is (for MT) no 
single overriding interpretation that is the root of all truths.

I think I can see why MT needs to take this approach in the justification 
of proof techniques.  If something works for all possible interpretations, 
it must also work for any particular interpretation.

But the jobbing programmer in me doesn't need all this stuff:  for most 
practical work, especially at the level of Internet protocols, a URI is 
paired with ("bound to") a resource in Humpty-Dumpty fashion:  it means 
what I say it means (or what the specs say it means, or what it has been 
determined through interoperability testing that most developers think the 
specs say it means).  Implicitly, there is a single interpretation that 
defines the denotation of the URI.  For most practical purposes, I really 
don't want to be concerned with interpretations other than the one I "know" 
I'm concerned with.  On this basis, people have constructed a functioning 
Internet.

So how can we deal in terms of this "fiction" of a single interpretation in 
which URIs Identify (denote a single thing/concept) -- which I believe we 
must do if the specification is to have any traction with real developers 
-- without committing you to a belief in magic?  (In part, I agree with you 
to say as little as possible, but maybe a tiny bit more than you said -- 
per my proposed wording copied at the end of this message.)

Yes, I agree.  But somehow there is this expectation of a particular 
interpretation, which in many cases is widely-enough held to work for many 
practical applications...

I think there is an expectation that URIs are usable outside of any context 
in which they may be generated.  (Though there is not, I think, any general 
expectation that any string that happens to follow URI syntax is usable as 
a URI.)

I'm not sure that this expectation holds for a query result.

The problem here, I guess, is that there's no *formal* way to distinguish 
these cases -- neither a URI or a query result are formally defined to 
denote a particular value, but there's an expectation in one case that 
affects the way that people want to use them differently.

I admit I can't formally distinguish the cases.  But I'm not so comfortable 
with using URIs as Skolem constants.  I don't think we can yet declare a 
consensus about whether or not its kosher.

Yes, formally, it's a fantasy -- not sustainable.  But it's a fantasy 
widely-enough believed to be of practical value.

I don't know if this is just word-play, but my view is not to attempt to 
claim a URI has a single denotation in all possible interpretations, but to 
suggest that there exists a particular intended interpretation, which 
provides a denotation for all URIs, and hence that the thing "identified" 
by a URI is that which it denotes in this particular interpretation.

It seems clear that we don't know enough to completely specify this 
interpretation, but on the other hand there are demonstrably a useful 
number of things we do agree on for it to be of some practical use.
