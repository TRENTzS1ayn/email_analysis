I don't recall saying that which you attribute to me.   But it seems to me 
you are pushing much the same thing as Pat, in a different way.  That the 
URI spec shouldn't be committing layered logical languages to specific 
interpretations of URIs.

Where I (maybe) differ slightly from your line is that I think it's OK for 
the layered specifications to inherit the RFC2396 concept of a resource, 
but that RFC2396 should not say anything about a resource that it really 
does not need to say, so that there's less to cause problems for the 
layered specification.  Running with your example of IP, it's important 
that IP *does* specify the syntax and interpretation of the IP header, but 
that it says as little as possible about the IP payload.  One could imagine 
a (poor) specification that says the payload should start with something 
like a TCP/UDP header, providing some groundwork for most of the traffic 
that is actually conveyed by IP.  But that would be entirely unhelpful for, 
say, ICMP.

I think an important point that the URI specification probably does need to 
convey is that a resource is not the same thing as a representation of 
same.  And enough background information that protocol developers use URIs 
in sensible ways.  But beyond that, the nature of a resource should be 
constrained as little as possible by the URI spec.
