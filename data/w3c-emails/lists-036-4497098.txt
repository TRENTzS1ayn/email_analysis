In brief: One cannot simultaneously maintain BOTH that URIs denote 
things in the world (not just inside computers), AND that the 
relationship between URIs and what they denote is similar to the 
relationship between identifiers in programming languages and what 
they conventionally identify.  Because the second 'identifier' idea 
relies on a basic property of computable domains which is not true in 
the wider world, viz. that any set of equations over such a domain 
has a unique minimal solution which is computably enumerable.  Most 
of the universe is not like this.  So if this is really 'commonly 
understood', then there is a serious mismatch between this common 
understanding and the RFC 2396 notion of the meaning of a URI. 
Either the Web is only about (semi-)computable things, or Web 
reference is not (semi-)computable.  Someone decide, but don't try to 
pretend that you can have it both ways at once.

OK, lets try to keep them separate; although I think they have been 
thoroughly mixed up already, before the SW came along.

No. This is an aside, but that expresses a *proposition*, not an 
anonymous identification. There isn't anything in conventional logic 
to do this any better than using a 'new logical name' already does 
it, in fact. In English you might say "something" or use tricks like 
"John Doe" to indicate that you aren't meaning to identify anyone in 
particular. We thought of allowing a special DQL bnode-ish construct 
to indicate an unknown thing 
(http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/0897.html), but in 
fact I think that Skolemized URIs work just fine. The existing Web 
protocols and conventions are perfectly adequate, in fact, to handle 
this. They are BETTER than the current RFC 2396 prose says they are.

Well, that is what bothers me, to get back to the point. ARE they, in 
the intended sense? What IS the intended sense? I can read the prose 
either way as it stands.

Well, Ive been a jobbing programmer in my time, and I don't think 
this is true at all.  What is true is that one often thinks of one's 
identifiers (in code) as having particular values in a particular 
environment, eg data structures or whatever; and the semantic rules 
for programming languages tell you how this is possible, because they 
are defined over closed domains which satisfy the second recursion 
theorem (all recursive equations have a UNIQUE least fixed point.) 
But that only applies to the 'internals' of your code; it doesn't 
apply as soon as you ask what those datatstructures REFER to. Most 
jobbing programmers are capable of either not giving damn about that, 
or more often being quite hair-raisingly casual about having their 
datatstructures denote a whole slew of things at the same time, with 
the choice determined by context. I bet it would be almost impossible 
to write a compiler if you tried to keep telling yourself that every 
identifier denoted some particular thing and you had to always make 
sure it stuck to that one thing.

>Implicitly, there is a single interpretation that defines the 
>denotation of the URI.

People keep SAYING that, but I havn't seen a single ARGUMENT for it. 
For most URIs, trying to insist that there is one thing they denote, 
and then to argue about what exactly it is, has just given rise to 
long, energetic and irreconcilable debates.  Meanwhile, 'ol man Web 
keeps rolling along, and these debates are irrelevant to it.  How 
does it DO that, I wonder? Does it know something that we don't know? 
Or maybe it doesn't care? If so, why are WE arguing about it?

>For most practical purposes, I really don't want to be concerned 
>with interpretations other than the one I "know" I'm concerned with. 
>On this basis, people have constructed a functioning Internet.

The fact that the Internet functions is an indication that even 
though one person may be using a URI with one thing in mind, and 
another person using it with another thing in mind, the variations in 
these interpretations somehow do not matter. The same thing happens 
in normal language. This is a very interesting fact that deserves to 
be analysed carefully.  But just DECLARING that 'URIs have a unique 
denotation, and that is why it all works' isn't a theory.  In order 
for this to explain why the Web works, you would have to explain why 
it is that *even though the interpretation you had in mind* wasn't 
what the URI *actually* denoted, that it still managed to work. Or 
else you have to explain how it comes about that the interpretation 
you have in mind just IS the right one, which sounds like magic to 
me, or maybe e-telepathy.

I don't believe this for a second.  In fact, I think that most 
developers would say that it is a fantasy (or irrelevant), if the 
notion of denotation were explained to them. Its a fantasy for any 
program which claims to manipulate denoting expressions. Its like 
saying that you can't wrote DB code unless you believe that all the 
table entries are somehow magically bound to the things they are 
being used to say things about.

What does need to be explained is that denotation doesn't work 
everywhere the same way that it does in programming languages, 
because the entire world isn't like the inside of a computer: even a 
jobbing programmer needs to bear that in mind from time to time.

I can go with that, provided we allow 'useable' to have a wide enough 
sense.  It works for the DQL skolemization case, for example.  Being 
useable is not the same as having a unique referent 'bound' to it.

Im willing to declare that it is, because it works and it doesn't 
violate any *technical* part of any W3C spec. If it violates some 
philosophical part of a spec, then as a user I don't really care. (As 
a spec editor I do, of course, but for different reasons.)

So the business of writing specs is not to describe, or even to 
prescribe, but to offer parables and fantasies? If so, then I insist 
on my right to treat them as fiction and still say that I am 
conforming to them.

The general tendency in science since the 17th century suggests that 
it is usually better to admit doubt and look for explanations than to 
assert known fantasies as truth.

I agree that makes sense, but its just as fantastic, and just as 
corrosive to semantic analysis. It means that A entails B just when B 
is true in the single intended interpretation, for example, so that 
inference engines should ignore any facts they may have been told, 
and just read off their conclusions from the single True 
Interpretation. That is like telling the inference engines to seek 
enlightenment through prayer.

The current MT semantic framework expresses this perfectly. There are 
a number of things we agree on.  Express those things somehow, and 
they amount to some assertions which we both can agree to accept as 
true. We have a "common ground", and we have agreed to limit the 
interpretations to those that keep it true. The practical use arises 
right here: we are both able to draw the same conclusions.  This is 
how most communication works, maybe ALL communication, in fact.  But 
we don't need to have so much agreement that between us that we have 
managed to pin down a SINGLE interpretation. If we did need to do 
that it would get in the damn way, we would be always arguing over 
*exactly* what one another meant (just like we do on these mailing 
lists, but all the time about everything) , we wouldnt be able to 
move until we were SURE that the thing you were referring to was 
EXACTLY what I was referring to, and so on. We don't get stuck like 
this because we don't need one globally perfect alignment of 
reference: we just need a good enough alignment for the task in hand. 
(This last isn't just a philosophical claim, by the way: it is easy 
to show empirically that people who are cooperating in practical 
tasks are often systematically misunderstanding their intended 
referents without even knowing that they are, because of course it 
doesn't matter.)

It takes  LOT of asserting to pin down a single unique referent, even 
if it can be done at all. In actual human discourse, when it is 
really needed, we resort to legal language to do this, which is 
long-winded, highly technical, very hard to get right and hard to 
follow (and even then it might not, in fact, pin down a single unique 
referent.)  Most of the time we don't bother, and most of the time it 
doesn't matter.  Same for the Web, I suggest.
