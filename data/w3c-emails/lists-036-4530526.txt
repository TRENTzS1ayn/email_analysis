It was never meant to be 'computable' and if someone told you the entire
thing is supposed to be then they're wrong. You can make it computable
by putting a set of constraints on it. RDF and the SW are one such set.
LDAPv3 is another set. If you don't identify your set of constraints
very explicitly then you're back to a non-computable world....

That's because, as I said above, 'web protocols and conventions' are
just one set of constraints. If they work for you then great, but
remember, the HTTP Protocol and the 'http:' scheme are not the entire
URI space. If the SW needs to say it can only use URIs of particular
flavors and resources of a particular type, then that's the exact
correct thing to do.

I'd have to disagree with Graham here. If there is a need to identify it
then it can be a 'Resource' in the RFC 2396 sense. Anything means
anything. But that's not something that RFC2396bis can care about.
That's for RDF to figure out and create a constraint for.

It works because most of the developers realized that the thing being
identified by the URI is so mutable that they should try and think of it
as some value, instead they simply use the URI as the handle by which
everything is picked up with. I'm starting to think that this discussion
is just one of those that needs to be done face to face....

I don't think its that they don't matter. Its more that there is an
authority statement involved in the URI. So that the person who _isn't_
the authority comes to the table with no expectation that they are
correct, just that they might be able to get away with making a
temporary assumption.

There is one HUGE difference between URIs and 'normal language'. In
normal language you don't qualify every single word with the owner of
the definition for that word. But you do with URIs. And unless you have
some definitive statements from the authority over a given URI (i.e.
what RDF and the SW are/were supposed to do) you know that you shouldn't
assume things about that URI that you don't know for certain.

but you can't write DB code unless you belive that all the table
locations are bound to the things inside them. If it weren't then the
table would be just some mess where any entry could just change to some
other column willy nilly. You're assuming some connections to objects
when you weren't given any statements from the authority that this was
so.

What needs to be explained is that 'denotation' is bounded by the
authority (or the scheme if the scheme has no authority section).
And unless a) the authority tells you something, b) the scheme tells you
something or c) some external, authoritative service/systems tells you
something then you can't know anything more than "the URI identifies one
and only one thing".
