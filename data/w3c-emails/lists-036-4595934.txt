Identifier

    An identifier is an object that carries identifying data. It is not 
necessary for the identifier to define what is being identified; it is only 
necessary for the identifier to provide sufficient data to distinguish 
what is being identified from all other things within the scope of its use. 
A URI is an identifier object consisting of a sequence of characters that 
matches the restricted syntax defined by this specification.
]]

I am concerned by the 'within the scope of its use' qualifier. Could you 
give 2 or 3 examples of such usage scopes? Can the state/content of these 
scopes change, making something into an 'identifier' or making it 'mere data' 
depending on context. I find this a very slippery concept to thing about 
without examples.

My specific proposal is that the phrase "within the scope of its use" be 
dropped. Without more detail, it adds only mystique. And we've plenty of
that already...

ps. 
re "A resource is a source of supply or support within the context of a given system."
...is that wording as intended, or in progress. The terms "supply" and "source of" 
seem to do the same work.
