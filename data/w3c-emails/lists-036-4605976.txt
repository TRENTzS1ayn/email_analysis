Additional metadata about the result of a GET request on a URI does
not belong in the URI itself, nor is there any reason to squeeze it
into that protocol element.  The same can and often is accomplished
by way of related attributes (such as an additional attribute on the
link) or by third-party link verifiers (such as the signature files
often distributed separately from software packages, that provide
the signature for that package).
