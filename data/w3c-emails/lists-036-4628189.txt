I think this is essentially what I have been trying to express by
talking about SW agents "presuming" that URIs have globally consistent
intepretations. 

I.e., that the SW enables consistent, reliable 
interchange of knowledge by which different SW agents can draw the
same conclusions -- because there is this *presumed* single 
interpretation for all URIs. 

That doesn't mean that there can't be other interpretations, nor does
it mean that there won't be other interpretations, but the practical
goals of the SW must *presume* that such a single interpretation
holds across the SW in order to achieve any semblance of consistency.

Eh?
