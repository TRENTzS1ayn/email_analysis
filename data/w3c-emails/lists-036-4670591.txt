I mean that if there are only 10 things that can be identified by the
system, then the identifier only needs to distinguish one from the other
nine.  In other words, it isn't necessary for an identifier to have
global scope within a context that only has local scope.  The reason  
that
was included is because I need to add some text about global scope to
the section on schemes.  Maybe it should say "from all other things
within the scope of the system"?

I was trying to avoid the rathole of claiming that something can be
distinguished from all things when the set of all things is infinite.

It comes from several dictionary definitions of "resource".
Consider the difference between a source of information and a
sink of information (e.g., in HTTP, a process that accepts POST
on a URI but not GET).  I found it difficult to think of that as
a supply, and yet they are clearly resources in the sense that
the system makes use of them to achieve a purpose.  *shrug*
