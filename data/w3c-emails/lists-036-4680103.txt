Consider the following two use cases:

1. Overloading of denotation looks like disagreement, but isn't:

My graph:
x:J rdfs:label "Jane" .
x:J x:address "123 Main Street" .
x:address rdf:type owl:FunctionalProperty .

Your graph:
x:J rdfs:label "Judy" .
x:J x:address "345 Main Street" .
x:address rdf:type owl:FunctionalProperty .

Since the denotation of x:J has different interpretations, and 
hence its denotation is overloaded, if you syndicate my knowledge
into yours, it will appear that we disagree about Judy's address.
If I syndicate my knowledge into yours, it will appear that we
disagree about Jane's address. But it may very well be that we
both agree about both Judy's and Jane's addresses, yet we can't
see that because we are using the URI x:J inconsistently.

(and since rdfs:label is not a unique property
2. Overloading of denotation looks like agreement, but isn't:

My graph:
x:J rdfs:label "Jane" .
x:J x:address "123 Main Street" .
x:Ju rdfs:label "Judy" .
x:Ju x:address "345 Main Street" .
x:address rdf:type owl:FunctionalProperty .

Your graph:
x:J rdfs:label "Judy" .
x:J x:address "123 Main Street" .
x:Jn rdfs:label "Jane" .
x:Jn x:address "345 Main Street" .
x:address rdf:type owl:FunctionalProperty .

Here, even though the denotation of x:J is still overloaded,
if you syndicate my knowledge into yours, it will appear that
we agree about Judy's address (but we don't) and if I syndicate
your knowledge into mine, it will appear that we agree about
Jane's address (but we don't).

In either case, it is *impossible* for the reasoning engine
to determine that overloading has occurred, since URIs are
atomic primitives and it has no (formal and reliable) machinery 
at its disposal to inspect or test the actual denotations.
It can only presume that a given URI always has the same
interpretation, and that any syndication of knowledge from
multiple sources presumes agreement of denotation among all
of those sources.

(Well, of course, the above depends on whether there is also
agreement about the denotation of x:address, owl:FunctionalProperty,
rdf:type, etc. etc. ;-)

So, even though we can't ensure against overloading of 
denotation and differing interpretations of URIs, in actual
practice, overloading of denotation on the SW is always bad,
always detrimental, and furthermore, completely invisible
to SW agents.

SW agents can do anything *but* presume that URIs have
consistent interpretations, and it is up to the users (humans)
to monitor the behavior of our systems and identify and
correct overloading of denotation (disagreement in interpretation)
as much as possible.

Without this presumption, the entire SW is useless as a means
for *global* knowledge interchange.

Because 'ol man Web doesn't care about such things -- or rather humans
using the Web are satisfied if they GET something useful given a 
particular URI and they either don't need to know what its actual
denotation is, or can live quite happily with ambiguous overloading,
since humans are kinda good at that sort of thing.

SW agents, on the other hand...

'young babe SW is going to choke and puke on the grub 'ol man Web's
been eatin...

Of course it doesn't matter, on the *Web*, but we are talking here
about the SW, and the needs of the SW for non-overloaded, consistent
interpretations of URIs is far higher than that of the Web. Please don't
presume (as you seem to do) that the Web deeply cares about the issue now
being discussed. I don't think it does. 

The SW is a bright light shining on the present Web architecture 
showing things in dark corners where no'one before cared or dared to go.
So don't expect to see clear answers to these questions in the present Web
architecture specs, because they simply haven't been critical issues
to the practical, day to day operation of the Web.

Yes, there are hints here and there of these issues, but not really
in those parts of the Web architecture specs where the "rubber meets
the road".

The SW is now putting those sections to task, and not getting much
traction...  hence the need to revise, clarify, and expand the
specifications -- for the needs of the *SW*, not for the Web.

Again, just because the *Web* works given the present architecture, 
does *not* mean the SW will work given the same architecture at the
same resolution of specification.

Pat, you seem to be presuming that Web = SW, but that is not the case.

The SW is (IMO) a layer on top of the Web, and while it utilizes the
present Web architecture, it extends that architecture and inserts its
own additional requirements and behavior into the mix.

The present specs address the lower layer, but fail to sufficiently
address issues that are critical to the higher layer, such as the
consistent interpretation of URIs, because such things *aren't*
critical at the lower layer. This is fully understandable, and as
such, insofar as the Web is concerned, those specs do the job. But
we're now moving on to new things, and the specs need to evolve and
grow to cover this new territory.

Just because the Web has been successful, does not mean that the SW
will be so based on the present specs.

Well, I'm a developer, and I completely agree with Graham. Of course,
my wife frequently says I live in a fantasy world, so err maybe that
means nothing...  ;-)

No, it's about whether when you say in your schema rdfs:range
and I say in my schema rdfs:range that we *both* mean the same
particular property as defined by the RDF spec.

You seem to be arguing that there is no way that my SW agent can
presume that its interpretation of that URI actually corresponds
to your interpretation of that URI -- that our two SW agents can
in fact interpret them in entirely different, and possibly 
incompatible ways, and moreover, that such incompatible 
interpretations are perfectly OK.

If that is the case, then RDF, and the RDF MT, are complete
worthless for the global interchange of knowledge. We might as 
well just quit and go raise cows or something.

Pat, how can an inference engine *know* that B does not have a 
single interpretation? We're talking here about its denotation,
not what is said about the thing it supposedly denotes.

Even if a reasoner detects a contradiction in statements about B
it can't know whether (a) there is overloading and in fact the
statements may in fact not be contradictory but about different
resources, or (b) the intended interpretation for B in all 
statements is the same and there is in fact a contradiction. 
This is reflected in the two use cases above.

The only reasonable choice, IMO, is to *presume* that B has a globally
consistent interpretation and deal with the assertions "at face value"
so to speak.

I don't see *how* a given reasoner could detect much less deal
with multiple interpretations of a URI since the machinery for
defining the URI to resource mapping is below the atomic level
for the reasoner and it must accept all URIs as atomic primitives.

It may simply be that I am just woefully ignorant of such things
and that such determinations are child's play to a qualified
logician. If so, I'd would appreciate being set straight.

Hmmm... you seem to be expressing here the point I've been trying to
make, that while the MT might allow for multiple interpretations,
the SW Architecture nevertheless purports a presumption that there
is a single interpretation shared by all SW agents, for the purpose
of consistent interchange of knowledge.

No?

Well, we certainly would be able to move, even if we were not sure
if we agreed on our interpretations -- as our SW agents would presume
that we did, and if we seemed to be arriving at different conclusions,
or the conclusions we were arriving out did not reflect our view of
reality, then we would have to consider that we were not in agreement
and take steps to rectify the situation. That's how communication on
the SW will work. We presume we mean the same thing when we all use
the same URI, until and unless stuff blows up. Then, someone will have
to probably start using some other URI than the one they were using.

So even if we can formally prove agreement of interpretation, we *can*
specify as part of the SW architecture that SW agents may *presume*
that such agreement exists, and proceed accordingly.

Cheers,

Patrick
