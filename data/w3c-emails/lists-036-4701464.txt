And I hope that in the very near future, for those URIs which contain
an explicit web authority and which are meaningful to an HTTP server
than one can request an authoritative description of the resource from
that server -- and for all other URIs one may request a description of
the resource from any number of 3rd party servers -- all based on a 
standardized solution.

E.g. http://sw.nokia.com/swe/URIQA?uri=http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema%23Class

Cheers,

Patrick
