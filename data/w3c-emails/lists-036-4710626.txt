Absolutely not. It's not meant to be. Ultimately, the URI to resource
mapping will remain outside the machinery of the SW and any sleuthing
a SW agent might do based on descriptions of the resource in order
to clarify that denotation based on similar descriptions of other
resources denoted by other URIs will always remain conjecture, for
the SW agent.

Well, I never intended to suggest that any knowledge provided by
a URIQA server would fix the interpretation of a URI -- rather I
was trying to show that such knowledge could clarify e.g. whether
the resource denoted was a web page, an image, a person, etc.
and (perhaps a bit too implicitly) presuming that the information
was at some level being interpreted by a human being.

I.e. given two people arguing over whether some URI denotes a web
page or a person, they could request an authoritative description
from the web authority and see if the resource is asserted to
belong to some class or has some other properties, which would
resolve that debate.

Sure. I've tried to maintain a clear distinction between the denotation
of a URI and statements made about the denoted resource using that URI.
This is a very important distinction.

And of course, it is quite true that, just as others can make statements
about some resource using a URI you minted (where you all agree about
the denotation) likewise others can mis-use a URI you minted to denote
something entirely different. And both cases are such that must be
resolved using social (even legal) means.

But if I, as a completely neutral and ignorant third party, recieve
RDF statements from all of you, I am going to presume that you all
agree at least about the denotation of the URIs you are using.

How I deal with contradictory statements, or prioritizing of sources,
is another issue entirely.

It works as the Web, but not as the SW. See my other posts about this.

What constitute "grounded references" on the present Web are sources
which require human interpretation. At some point, for SW agents, 
you've got to decide where to draw the line and what your minimal
set of atomic primitives will be.

If you are able to devise some kind of ultimate semantic vocabulary
by which you can unambiguously define the meaning of all other terms
(URIs) used, I will be very very impressed, but even then, the terms
of that ultimate vocabulary will still have to be taken as atomic
primitives that SW agents will not be able to inspect or test to
any degree.

Because otherwise, there is no hope of reliable global interchange

It has not necessarily learned what the actual resource is that
is denoted (but in fact, so what, since it's really humans that
care about and interpret the actual URI to resource mappings, not
the SW agents). But it may have learned something that, when combined
with other knowlege allows it to infer something new, and inform
a human user about that new knowledge, who will then interpret the
URI in terms of its mapping to some actual resource and evaluate
that knowledge against the real world.

A SW agent does not *need* to know about the actual denotation. Only
that it should presume that a URI only ever denotes one thing.

But it *has* learned something new, and important.

Before doing that reasoning, all it knew was that PatHayes.person
denotes a specific thing, and that TheOneWithSSNumber.xxx--xx-xxx
denotes a specific thing, but it did *not* know that those two
things denoted by those two URIs were in fact the *same* thing.

Now it knows that those two URIs both denote the same thing, and
that all statements made using either URI apply to the same thing.

Now *what* that thing is IN THE REAL WORLD, the SW agent doesn't 
know -- and doesn't *need* to know. It simply knows how to refer
to it, and what is asserted about it, and that, now, it can be
refered to using two URIs rather than just one.

But to merge two graphs is to IMO assert that those two graphs
are valid in the SAME interpretation -- since all nodes having
identitical URIs will be merged.

OK, if folks want to have separate, isolated SWs where they maintain
their own interpretations that differ from other folks interpretations,
fine, but if we are talking about the global interchange of knowledge,
then that reflects the presumption that all interchanged graphs will
share a common interpretation!

No?!

If not, then we're all crazy to think the SW will succeed.

We're talking about a *global* SW, not just a bunch of separate,
isolated KM systems doing their own thing.

Let the RDF MT say that there can be multiple interpretations. Fine.
But make the SW Architecture specifications say that there is expected
to be ONE SINGLE GLOBAL INTEPRETATION OF ALL KNOWLEDGE. 

Otherwise, there is simply no point. 

The Web has succeeded and scaled because is provided for *ARBITRARY*
yet *CONSISTENT* interaction between disparate systems based on
the explicitly defined consistent behavior of those systems.

To fail to specify the presumption/expectation of a single global
interpretation for all URIs for the SW will result in the failure
of the SW to emulate that key source of success of the Web.

SW agents should be able to interchange knowledge with any other
arbitrary SW agent anywhere on the SW and presume that there is
a shared interpretation of all URIs. Period. That is critical and
paramount to the success of a *global* SW.

Failure to embrace and formalize such a presumption/expectation
will doom the SW to fragmentation and failure.

I think I agree. There can be more than one interpretation. But the
SW presumes there is only one, and that everyone shares it. And to 
hell with all other intepretations (even if the MT provides for them).

I don't disagree at all. But if you mint a URI to denote your son,
and I decide to use it to denote your wife, and make statements
about your wife using that URI, I guaruntee that someone, somewhere
is going to get very confused.

The Web is interpreted by humans, who are reasonably good with
dealing with overloading of denotation. The SW will be interpreted
by software agents, which are notoriously bad at dealing with
overloading of denotation.

I've never asserted that the URI to resource mapping is anything
that exists in any formal sense. It is something interned in the
minds of the human users, who use URIs to refer to things they
want to talk about. 

And yes, the way that different humans communicate what things
their URIs denote may take many and varied forms, most of which
will be non-formal, based on natural language and other forms
of expression.

And yes, humans interpreting a representation provided by an
HTTP server might be able to grok what resource is actually
denoted by that URI -- but only if the author of that representation
actually cares about communicating information about the actual
denotation.

Most representations on the web do not contain information about
denotations, because actual denotations of URIs are not critical
to Web applications. All Web applications care about are getting
consistent *representations* -- and most folks don't even think
in terms of resources or representations but of documents, files,
data streams, etc. that are "accessible" via a given URI.

This whole issue of what a URI denotes and consistent denotation
and distinction of denotation between things and their
representations, etc. is all of minimal importance to the *Web*
but of critical importance to the SW.
