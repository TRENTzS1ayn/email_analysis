Not in the least presuming that I am even worthy of untying Tim's
sandals, I can try to offer one ;-)

If Tim says that http://www.w3.org/Consortium/ denotes the W3C,
then that's (probably) what it denotes.

If you do an HTTP GET on that URI, and you get a document titled
"About the W3C" then that is a "representation" of the W3C and
is some other, distinct resource. Ideally, the HTTP server should 
tell you the URI of that other resource in its response header,
but not all servers are so well behaved.

It may be that you are not told what URI denotes what you have
gotten from the HTTP server, but that doesn't mean that either
(a) it has no known URI to denote it, or (b) that the URI given
to the server is overloaded to denote both the W3C and the document
(which would be very bad indeed).

Ultimately, if you want to talk about both the W3C and the
document titled "About the W3C", you will need a distinct
URI for each (at least insofar as RDF is concerned ;-)

Quite so. Though I do it all the time myself regardless ;-)
