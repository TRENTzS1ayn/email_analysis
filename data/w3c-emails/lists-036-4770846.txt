Fair enough.

Well, actually, a GET never returns a "document" as I use that term.
What it returns is a MIME entity-body: that is, a sequence of octets,
and a media type, and possibly some other metadata.

Documents contain words, phrases, titles, and are independent of
MIME entity-bodies and can be instantiated in ways that don't involve
them (most obviously on flattened dead trees, but clay tablets work too).

> then that is a "representation" of the W3C

By fiat, yes.  But what then is the URI of the document, of which the
relevant MIME entity-body is also a representation?
This document *describes* the W3C rather than *being* the W3C.

A MIME entity-body of type image/gif may be a representation of Shakespeare,
but if so, only by being a representation of a *picture* of Shakespeare,
(or possibly a representation in GIF form of a textual *description* of S.)
that is, a representation of a representation.

To say the least.

It doesn't absolutely *compel* either of those things, no.  But they
seem quite likely to happen nonetheless unless measures are taken to
stop them.  There is, Heaven knows, no shortage of available URIs.
What there is, is a lack of will to assign them appropriately.
