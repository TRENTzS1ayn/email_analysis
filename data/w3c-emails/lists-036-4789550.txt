Hence my "(probably)". After all, hearsay is hearsay...

Well, I'm also familiar with Tim's recent arguments along these
lines, though I think he is in this case in a pretty small minority.

If URIs can denote anything, then one need not use a URIref to 
denote something that is not a "web document".

I personally find the use of URIrefs to denote anything other than
logical and/or physical components of the resource denoted by the
base URI to be poor practice and contrary to the original purpose
of fragment identifiers.

So I would be quite happy to have the abovementioned URI denote
the W3C with no qualms about it not being a URIref.

In fact, in our ontologies at Nokia, we use no URIrefs.

Cheers,

Patrick
