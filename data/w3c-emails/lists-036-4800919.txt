Hi Patrick,

One smallish niggle. The term URIRef from 2396 is inclusive of references
that do not happen to have fragment identfiers.

> In fact, in our ontologies at Nokia, we use no URIrefs.

I rather think you do... but I suspect that you don't use fragment
identifiers in those ontologies.

I've come to find the term URI-Reference apt for references made, say in
hypertext documents or on the side of busses, using URI syntax rather than
as a term for distinguishing URI with fragment ids from those without -
which the term doesn't infact do in any case.

Regards

Stuart
