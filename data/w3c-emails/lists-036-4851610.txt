Then, by definition of the HTTP specs, the URI denotes nothing, at
least at the moment that somebody attempted unsuccessfully to
dereference it.  That there is some Semantic Web server, at a
different URI, which makes a claim to the effect that the above URI
actually denotes some particular product, is irrelevant, just as it
would be irrelevant that Google lists some particular URI as
representing the Web site of a church, when in fact they recently let
their domain name expire and it now leads to a porn site.  The only
thing one can definitively say about a HTTP URI is what it leads to
upon dereferencing, which, of course, can be a constantly changing
thing.
