I don't really understand why anybody ought to use "http:" URIs to
denote anything other than the document dereferenceable via that URI
and the HTTP protocol.  That seems to be asking for confusion.  Why
not use a different URI scheme if one needs URIs to denote non-
dereferenceable entities such as persons or organizations?
