There are merits to the idea that security metadata should not be part
of URIs.  Here is one idea that implement the fundamental idea (which
I still believe is useful) without modifying URIs, like the above
approach does.

The syntax would be:

meta:<METADATA>:<URI>

So to embed that a HTTP resource should have a certain SHA-1 hash (for
integrity, or even authentication, purposes) would be (this happens to
be a working example):

meta:sha1=oHn3H7i+rYwEnZulnHb09KO/6Ro=:http://josefsson.org/key.txt

Thoughts?
