"A resource is a source of supply or support within the
context of a given system."

That doesn't appeal to me. The dc:title property doesn't
seem to match that definition very well. I still prefer
the text from Hayes on 23 Apr:

"This document specifies the syntax of URIs, which are a form of 
global identifier used in Web protocols and languages.  Particular 
uses of URIs, and their intended meanings in various contexts, are 
described in other specifications. In general, the entities referred 
to or identified by URIs when used in Web contexts are called 
"resources"., but this document does not specify the nature of 
resources or to restrict resources to any particular category of 
entities."
