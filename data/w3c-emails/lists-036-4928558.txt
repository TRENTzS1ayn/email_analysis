I like that too.  I'd put the <URI> first, for readability.  Then it 
doesn't look too different from my suggestion.

One difference is I was using brackets to separate the URI from crypto 
data.  Since brackets aren't "uric" characters, that's probably a bad 
idea.  So if I change my initial approach to use a colon, like yours does, 
and change yours to put the URI first, we can see the remaining difference:

http-://josefsson.org/key.txt:sha1=oHn3H7i+rYwEnZulnHb09KO/6Ro=
meta:http://josefsson.org/key.txt:sha1=oHn3H7i+rYwEnZulnHb09KO/6Ro=

I'm denoting a secure scheme by appending "-" to the base scheme, you're 
denoting a secure scheme (or metadata-enhanced scheme) by "meta", with the 
base scheme in the scheme-specific part.  I'm not sure which way is better.
