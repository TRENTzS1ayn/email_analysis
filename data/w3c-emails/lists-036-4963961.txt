true.  Would you want to rename "meta" to "secure" or "crypto"?  Then it 
becomes a little more readable..

secure:http://www.blabla...
secure:mailto:alice@acme.com...

Interesting..  I wanted to use asterisks, but I thought software unfamiliar 
with secure URIs might puke on seeing a document with an invalid scheme 
character.  So I chose "-" as a trailer since there's currently no schemes 
using it, and I figured we could just cross our fingers about private schemes.

But either way, following my suggestion we'd have to change the base 
specification to disallow future use of "-" as a trailer, or allow use of 
"*" as a trailer, whereas your proposal doesn't impact the base spec.  If 
you changed "meta" to "secure", I'd probably prefer your approach (I'd need 
to think about it a bit more), since it's also more readable.
