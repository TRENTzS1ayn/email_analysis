I agree meta: isn't very informative, so a better name would be good.
On the other hand, secure/crypto might be too narrow.  I'm thinking
about other possible "metadata" you might want to attach to an URL.
E.g.:

meta:preferred_language=fr:http://www.debian.org/

Although this example is probably not a good one, as it is http
specific.

It may be safer if old software puked on it, rather than possibly
parse it as an existing private-use URI.  But this is really mostly a
theoretical problem.

I do prefer registering one new URL scheme, instead of either
modifying the base specification or register many URL scheme, though.
