I can't think of great uses for metadata like this beside crypto data, so I 
wouldn't mind having a "secure" scheme just targeted to document hashes, 
key/cert fingerprints, and key/cert-retrieval URLs, unless there's a 
compelling reason to broaden it.

yeah..  I prefer that too, after further thought.  I'm in favor of a 
"secure" scheme with the URI first, since then it kinda reads as if "secure 
http" or whatever is the scheme name, which just looks nice:

secure:http://www.whatever.com:sha256=...
secure:mailto:alice@whatever.com:x509_sha1=...
etc..
