This is fine.  It could be a little shorter, clearer, and stronger:

   1.  This document specifies the syntax of URIs. A URI is a form of
   2.  global identifier used in Web protocols and languages.  Particular
   3.  uses of URIs, and their intended meanings in various contexts, are
   4.  described in other specifications. In general, the entities referred
   5.  to or identified by URIs are called "resources"; this document does
   6.  not in any way define, specify, or restrict the nature of "resources."

Changes:
   Line 1.  It's easier to define a concept in the singular.
   Line 6.  This is true here.  Other documents may use the term differently.
