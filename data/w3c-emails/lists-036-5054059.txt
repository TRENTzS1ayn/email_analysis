Bitter experience says that it's always better to make the scheme as wide
and extensible as possible. In particular, "why would you want that?" is
almost a guaranteed recipe for later regrets.

I also don't like "secure" because it isn't a secure link, it's a way of
(in this case) checking that the target of the link hasn't changed. To most
people, "secure" means untappable, as in the "s" of "https".
