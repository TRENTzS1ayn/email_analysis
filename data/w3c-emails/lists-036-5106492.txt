If "secure" is restricted to crypto metadata, you could always define other 
schemes for different metadata types:

language:http://whatever.com:french

But I can't think of a type of metadata (besides crypto) where this would 
be a good idea.  I guess I perceive crypto data as not really "metadata" 
about the resource, but rather part of the resource's identity.  If you 
want to reliably retrieve a document, than knowing how to cryptographically 
authenticate the document (or document owner) is just as important as 
knowing its URL (at least in a sufficiently paranoid threat model).

In other words, this isn't just metadata to be used after resolving the 
URL, but is integral to the process of resolving it, and I can't think of 
other data that's similarly deserving of being bound to the URL.

I think that every secure URL would provide authentication of some sort (of 
the document itself, in the form of a hash value, or of the party serving 
the document, in the form of a key fingerprint).

Some secure URLs would also provide confidentiality.  So "secure" here 
would mean "authenticated and possibly confidential".  I agree that some 
people might assume confidentiality, but that's a minor problem, and it's 
not uncommon to talk about, for example, XML-Security, and mean both 
XML-DSIG and XML-Encryption, so I think lots of people understand security 
has both authentication and confidentiality aspects to it.
