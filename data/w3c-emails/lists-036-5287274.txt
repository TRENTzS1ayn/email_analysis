Hi Martin,

Thanks for your clarifications.

Yes, I suggest the '/ipx/' and '/at/' forms in RFC 2609
URIs for NetWare/IPX and Appletalk should be included
in RFC2396bis.  URIs are much more useful if they
can extend beyond DNS-based naming/addressing.

Service URIs are _supposed_ to be constructed based on
existing "concrete" (IANA-registered) URI schemes.

Service URIs that are self-descriptive use the SLPv2 
format of "service:abstract-type:concrete-type:...",
where "abstract-type" is an IANA-registered (or private)
abstract service type (for example "printer"), as 
published in the directory:

    ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/svrloc-templates/

For example, a single SLP (or equivalent LDAP) service
advertisement that uses abstract "service:printer:..."
often includes more six or more legacy print protocols
in the attribute "printer-xri-supported" (which supports
authentication and security elements separate from the
URI themselves).

Cheers,
- Ira McDonald, co-editor of SLP and LDAP Printer schemes

Hello Ira,

[I have copied the uri list.]
Is it possible to construct service URIs from arbitrary other
URIs, or are there some restrictions?

Please note that RFC 2396 does not restrict the syntax after
// to be [ [ userinfo "@" ] hostport ]. In particular we have
(from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt, App A. Collected BNF for URI):

net_path      = "//" authority [ abs_path ]
authority     = server | reg_name
reg_name      = 1*( unreserved | escaped | "$" | "," |
                           ";" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" )
server        = [ [ userinfo "@" ] hostport ]

This leaves open the "regname" part, which is arbitrary.
This means that if the 'service:' uri allows to just plug
in arbitrary URIs, it would be against the current RFC 2396
syntax. However, it would be okay with the new, proposed
RFC 2396bis syntax.

Also, are you saying that the /ipx/ and /at/ conventions
should be general conventions for URIs? Or are they just
conventions within the 'service:' URI Scheme?

Please note that the change from RFC 2396 to RFC 2396bis
does not prohibit the use of  things such as NetWare or
Appletalk as long as they don't appear after //, which
seems to be okay for the 'service:' URI, but not for
SMB.

Regards,    Martin.
