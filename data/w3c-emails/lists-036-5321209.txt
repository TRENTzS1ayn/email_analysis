Greetings. After being prodded to produce an Internet Draft on 
historical URI schemes, I completely dropped the ball and didn't 
announce the draft to this mailing list. So, here it is:
    draft-hoffkohn-rfc1738bis-00.txt

All comments are welcome. There are two open issues listed in the 
document, and I look forward to hearing opinions on them.

    Section 2.8: will be updated to include specific usage of the file:
    scheme on different operating systems

Having done some experimentation, I believe that we can't say much 
general about particular operating systems. Instead, it seems like 
various versions of browsers and other URL resolvers do different 
things for file: based on the whim of the implementer. I can 
certainly discuss that in a paragraph, but that's probably all we 
need.

    References: some of the references are to URLs that no longer work or
    are likely to be abandoned in the future. How do we want to deal with
    this?

My feeling is that we should remove the references altogether, and 
leave the schemes described but not defined. However, I'm open to 
other ideas.
