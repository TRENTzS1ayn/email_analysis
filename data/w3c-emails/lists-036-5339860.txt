I think the document should try to give answers to the following FAQs --
even if the answer happens to be that there is no interoperable
solution/answer:

1) How do I embed a Windows drive letter?

-> file:///c:/path

2) Can I put in relative paths?

-> not in an absolute URL

3) What's the syntax for accessing Windows file shares?

-> file:////share/path

4) How do I encode non-ASCII characters in filenames?

Encode the filename in UTF-8, then URL-escape (this may not be widely
implemented, but I think this what SHOULD be implemented).
