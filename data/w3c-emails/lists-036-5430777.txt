That would be true for file: URIs. For other URI schemes you generally
cannot deduce such a thing. Pure HTTP does not have the concept of
a "file" or "directory". A client makes a GET on the URI and will
get a representation (or 404 or something else).

WebDAV, as extension of HTTP, defines "collections" which behave
like folders in a file system. A client performs a PROPFIND request
and asks the server for the type of the resource.
