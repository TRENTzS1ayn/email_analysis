That depends entirely on the server.  I see breakage caused every day by 
people who don't understand this.  For example, entries on my weblog 
have URIs that look like this:

http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/08/25/AugPix

One of the weblog-ranking services (blogdex or popdex or whatever) 
consistently fails in its attempts to point at my entries because it 
stupidly assumes that since they don't end with .html or .pdf or 
something, it should put a '/' on the end, which gives a 404 not found.
