So I see (from previous answers) that at least in the file: scheme a
trailing slash is the convention to identify a folder URI.
Am I wrong ?

I'm participating in writing application note on file URLs for JDF in
cip4.org.
The JDF is XML instance that describes printing workflow of a print job.
One of the attributes there serves as the Base URI of the document that
relative URIs reference to.
It is according to RFC2396bis-03 section 5.1.1.

I'm just trying to understand how should one resolve a relative URI
reference according to a Base URI.

If I have a Base URI
"file://e:/f/g"

and a Relative URI
"../h"

It can influence the resolving URI in case the 'g' above is a file or a
directory. (Lets assume 'g' file and 'g' directory exist in "file://e:/f").

In case g is a directory : Resolved URI would be "file://e:/f/h"
In case g is a file          : Resolved URI would be "file://e:/h"

I think the same question regards other schemes as well.
