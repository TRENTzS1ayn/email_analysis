Because of various individual constraints, this request
is also quite constrainted. We request a BOF for URI
at the next IETF on Thursday morning, and also that
WebDAV be scheduled close (the same or adjacent day).

================================================
Agenda and goals:

* 30 minutes (Roy Fielding)
      Review plans for revising RFC 3696 (URI) to Standard
     http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html
     Goal: insure process on track; decide on whether
      a 'working group' is necessary.

* 15 minutes (Martin Duerst)
   Review plans for IRI (as Proposed Standard)
      Discussion of current state, IAB concerns
      Goal: clear up any disagreements about process

* 15 minutes (Patrik F?ltstr?m)
   Review mailing list, process, and 'experts' for URI
   scheme registration.
   Goal: set up new mailing list & process
