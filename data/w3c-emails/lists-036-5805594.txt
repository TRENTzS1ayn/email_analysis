I've updated the proposed "agenda" to improve the 'goals'
of the various sessions.

Because of various individual constraints, the request
is for a BOF for URI at the next IETF on Thursday
(preferably in the morning) and also that
WebDAV be scheduled close (the same or adjacent day).

================================================
Agenda and goals:

* 30 minutes (Roy Fielding)
      Review plans for revising RFC 3696 (URI) to Standard
     http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html
     Goal: disseminate information about activity
           encourage focus on issues in issue list
           create schedule & milestones

* 15 minutes (Martin Duerst)
   Review plans for IRI (as Proposed Standard)
      Discussion of current state, IAB concerns
      Goal: review IAB issues & coordination with DNS I18N
            review process & mailing list
            establish schedule & milestones
