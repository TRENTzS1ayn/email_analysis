They aren't issues with 2396, but with the draft, and editorial ones
at that.  I don't think they need any discussion, but I do need to
figure out how to distinguish them on the issues list from changes
to 2396, and haven't had time to do so given the discussion of more
important issues related to URI.

They will show up the next time the list gets updated.
