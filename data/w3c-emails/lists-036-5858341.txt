Hi,

I have some questions on file URI.

1) I understood that there is no need to escape the ':' sign in examples like
<file:/e:/xxx.pdf>file:/e:/xxx.<file:/e:/xxx.pdf>pdf
file:///e:/xxx.pdf

but is it legal to have it escaped

<file:/e%3A/xxx.pdf>file:/e%3A/xxx.<file:/e%3A/xxx.pdf>pdf
file:///e%3A/xxx.pdf ?

And in general, is it allowed to escape even characters that are not 
reserved in this context ?

2) I understood that the sign '&' is not reserved except inside a query.
So in case I have a file name including space and '&' , should I escape the 
space to %20 and not escape the '&' ?

<file:/c:/test/George%20&%20Sons.doc>file:/c<file:/c:/test/George%20&%20Sons. 
doc>:/test/George%20&%20Sons.doc
or
<file:/c:/test/George%20%26%20Sons.doc>file:/c<file:/c:/test/George%20%26%20 
Sons.doc>:/test/George%20%26%20Sons.doc

3) About relative file URI.

I understood it should be something like

"./foo.pdf" without the <file://>file:// scheme.

But would <file:///./foo.pdf>file:///./foo.<file:///./foo.pdf>pdf be also 
legal ?

Thanks in advance

Israel
