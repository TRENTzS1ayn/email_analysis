I'm assuming that the RFC2396 revision is intended to fold in the updates 
from RFC2732.

RFC2732 says:
[[
    This document updates the generic syntax for Uniform Resource
    Identifiers defined in RFC 2396 [URL].  It defines a syntax for IPv6
    addresses and allows the use of "[" and "]" within a URI explicitly
    for this reserved purpose.
]] -- (Abstract and section 3)

which implies no use of [ and ] for other purposes.  But:

[[
    (3) Add "[" and "]" to the set of 'reserved' characters:

       reserved    = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                     "$" | "," | "[" | "]"

    and remove them from the 'unwise' set:

       unwise      = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "`"
]]

which has a knock-on effect on the definition of uric.

Test cases -- are these legal URIs?:

   http://example.org/[2010:836B:4179::836B:4179]
   http://example.org/abc#[2010:836B:4179::836B:4179]
   http://example.org/xxx/[qwerty]#a[b]

etc.
