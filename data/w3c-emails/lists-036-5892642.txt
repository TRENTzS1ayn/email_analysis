Yes, I made those changes within draft 00, visible at

     http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/

and am currently working on the next revision.  Please let me know if
draft 00 does not address your concerns.  I did not use the BNF of 2732,
and thus hopefully avoided the error condition you described.
