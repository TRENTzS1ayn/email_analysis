I just want to verify that I am reading the spec correctly here.

Section 3.1 of 2396 says:

>    Relative URI references are distinguished from absolute URI in that
>    they do not begin with a scheme name.  Instead, the scheme is
>    inherited from the base URI, as described in Section 5.2.

And section 5 says:

>       relativeURI   = ( net_path | abs_path | rel_path ) [ "?" query ]

where net_path is

>       net_path      = "//" authority [ abs_path ]

Is the following then correct?

I can write

<a href="//www.example.com/resourcePath">resource</a>

in an HTML document and the scheme will be derived from the base (i.e. 
http or https depending on how the original resource was requested)?

Thanks,
Jim
