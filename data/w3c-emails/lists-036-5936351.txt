In connection with the work of the W3C TAG, I undertook the task of 
documenting in-the-field practices as to how software can and should go 
about the very common task of comparing URIs.  The latest draft of this, 
which I think represents TAG consensus, is at 
http://www.textuality.com/tag/uri-comp-4.html.

The TAG (including two 2396 co-authors) thinks that one plausible way to 
use this text would be to fold some or all it into RFC2396bis.  So I'm 
posting here to offer it for that purpose.  -Tim
