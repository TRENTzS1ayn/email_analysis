No, 'a' and %61 are *not* equivalent in an EBCDIC environment.  I just 
don't see where, in RFC2396, it says that the hex-encoding is 
necessarily that of the ASCII value of the character.  I repeat: if I'm 
on an EBCDIC computer, and the URI reads out as /dir/a, that is 
*different* from /dir/%61.  Yes, this is egregiously broken and stupid, 
but it's within the bounds set by RFC2396.

Actually, the problem is that RFC2396 is just hopelessly unclear.  The 
fact that you and I are unable to agree on what it says is 
incontrovertible proof of this fact.  May I argue for a brief truce?  As 
part of the revision process, I'm working on an essay whose subject is 
what RFC2396bis *should* say on the subject of data and characters and 
octets and %-escaping, so that we don't have to have these endless 
arguments.  Frankly I would rather not waste any more time arguing about 
what the current revision of 2396 says.  -Tim
