No, that would violate the axiom
x + (y-x) = y
i.e.
join(x, refTo(x, y)) == y

since join(x, z) = z when x and z are absolute
and don't share a scheme, which is the case for
join('http://ex/x/y', 'q:r')

It's quite necessary to escape the ':' for this reason.

I don't manage negative tests. Perhaps I should.
