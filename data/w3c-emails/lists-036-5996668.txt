OK, I added these, after a tweak...

TimBL prefers root-relative paths, i.e. "/x%2Fabc"
to "../../x%2Fabc"
Both are correct relative paths from here to there,
but our code currently does "/x%2Fabc".

I don't really like it; it doesn't support moving
filesets around as well as it could. But I haven't
convinced timbl, nor have I completely debugged
an algorithm for returning "../../x%2Fabc".
