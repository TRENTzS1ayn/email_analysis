Just to be sure, I'm looking at 
http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html, I hope 
that's the right text.

The abstract uses the "URI" form of plural in its second paragraph; a 
quick re-look reveals ony "URIs" nearby, maybe I was reacting to a 
singleton; I gather this is purely editorial, I'll keep a sharp eye open 
next time I do an end-to-end on this. -T
