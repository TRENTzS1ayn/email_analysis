The specification refers to the IETF working group discussions that can 
be
found in the URI archive and the set of specifications thereafter 
produced
that created separate standardization tracks for URL versus URN.  Maybe 
I am
getting too old, but I assure you that the term URN existed long before 
the
"urn" scheme as defined by the IETF.

I prefer the wording established by the IAB group, but I will look to 
see
if it can be better explained.

I've added these to issue 019-URI-URL-URN.

Sure.  It would be best if they covered the range of variance, so that 
the
folks who try to implement according to examples (and not BNF) are not
led too far astray.  [I have seen plenty of cases where implementers of
RFC 2616 looked at the examples and implemented only the cases 
described,
ignoring the actual syntax specification.]

Because it is a BNF term.

This is tied up with the URI vs URIref issue and will be rewritten 
anyway.

Historically speaking [1993-1994], implementations of such were entirely
inconsistent.

I think you need to look more closely at what the browsers are doing.
They send the /../ and /./ stuff to the server, whereupon an Apache 
httpd
will respond with a redirect to the correct URI.  Other HTTP servers may
do the same, others may not redirect and just serve it as a separate
resource (leading to a large number of security holes), and still others
will simply respond with 404 not found.

I don't have an objection to changing it in the specification, but
no existing browsers that I know about do this canonicalization on
the browser side.  Spiders often do.  Furthermore, HTTP servers do
consider them to be different resources at the present time -- the
redirect is for the sake of back-end security and to help-out ancient
versions of the lynx browser with relative URI (which in early days
simply concatenated the relative URI to the base URI), not because
we think of them as equivalent identifiers.

I'll place this under the issue TimBL raised when I add it to issues.

As it says, "Resolution examples are provided in Appendix C."  There is
another issue 021-relative-examples calling for more examples (using
a different base URI), but none have been suggested so far.

Thanks for your comments,
