A standalone .html disk file loaded in IE on Windows (via file: uri)
displays a normalized url (no dots) in the status bar, but the auto-link
detector in Outlook Express (it underlines and turns blue stuff that looks
like a link within a plain text document) does not normalize the url - it
shows up with dots.

Just fyi.
