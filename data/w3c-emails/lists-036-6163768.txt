I've got both in my test suite for now.  I'll sort out which to keep later.

How does this square with these cases?:

   ('file:/ex/x/y/z', 'file:/ex/x/r', '../r'),
   ('file:/ex/x/y/z', 'file:/r', '/r'),        # I prefer this. - tbl

If using a root-relative path, wouldn't the first be:

   ('file:/ex/x/y/z', 'file:/ex/x/r', '/ex/x/r'),

?  (Maybe that's what the "I prefer" case aims to show?)
