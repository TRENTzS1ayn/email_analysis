We still haven't been scheduled and I need to start planning the trip.
WebDAV is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.  The best slots for me are

Tue: 1415-1515 Afternoon Sessions II
Wed: 1300-1500 Afternoon Sessions I

I don't think it is worthwhile to have the BOF on Thursday, since
almost all the APP area attendees will be gone by Wednesday night.
If it has to be Thursday, then the only slot I can make is

Thu: 1300-1500 Afternoon Sessions I

because I will need to fly up in the morning and back in the evening.
