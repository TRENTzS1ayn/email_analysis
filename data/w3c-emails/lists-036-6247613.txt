In the DNS the trailing '.' is never part of the domain name. It is only
used in zone file format to explicitly declare a domain name as FQDN.
Also, it's currently true that TLD names do not start with digits, there's
nothing in 1123 (or 952) that would forbid this. Until 1123 was published,
a digit was not allowed as the first character of any label, but this was
what 1123 relaxed. The only remaining restriction in this direction is that
a hostname must not "look like" an IP (v4) address, i.e. it would be
unwise to have a TLD consisting of digits only.

I'd like to suggest that a hostname be either an FQDN (identified as such
by having at least one dot) or consist only of a single label. Everything
else is too dependent on the actual DNS searchlist strategy.
The only remaining ambiguity would be the TLD name used as a hostname in the
URL (of the 258 TLDs roughly a dozen, e.g. DK and TV have an A RR for the TLD
itself). For the sake of consistency that should be treated like a non-FQDN
first.  A trailing '.' should not be allowed.
