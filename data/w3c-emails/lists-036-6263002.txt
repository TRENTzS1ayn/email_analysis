I just got caught by the hier-part production ambiguity.

May I suggest that a note be placed close to the hier-part production in 
section 3 referencing the text in section 4.3?

[later]

I'm finding there are a number of other areas in which the grammar is 
ambiguous.  Unfortunately, using a "greedy" parse approach doesn't always 
work, since some parts of the grammar fail if the previous sections are 
greedy-matched;  e.g. domainlabel; qualified.

(These are pretty picky points, which I'm noticing because I've tried to 
build a functional-language parser directly from the grammar as 
given.  I've got all test cases parsing OK now, but I've had to add in a 
few messy patches to get the kind of behaviour I'd expect from a "normal" 
parser.)
