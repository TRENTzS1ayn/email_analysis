Actually, it is used anywhere that a resolver is used.  I have 
personally
used it in the past to differentiate between an ill-fated College of 
Medicine
subdomain "com" from the TLD com, for both e-mail and URI addressing.

That was not the intent of 1123.  It allows all-numeric domain names 
only
because it is well-known that TLDs will never be allowed to be 
all-numeric.
It is therefore useful (and encouraged by 1034 and 1123) that we
syntactically distinguish IP addresses from domain names.

Sorry, there are no implementations that correspond to such a 
restriction.
