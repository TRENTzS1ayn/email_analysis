All, 
   Please excuse this email if this is the wrong forum: I was sent here
by another developer who suggested I submit this.

   In writing a configuration program here, I needed a way for an URL to
say "look in NIS". After some googling and other bits, there didn't seem
to be an existing syntax, so I invented one.

nis://TABLE/KEY

Because a NIS client (at least a program querying NIS on a client) has
no choice of which server or port to access, I left those parts out. The
scheme assumes that the client host already has access to NIS.
