Well.

1) I think it's an extremely bad idea to simply change the definition of the
term, because it will negatively affect tons of other RFCs/recommendations.
If you need a simple term to talk about URIs + optional fragment, define a
new one.

2) On the other hand, *if* the definition is changed, there's no way to
avoid defining a *new* term for what a URI used to be. Or am I missing
something?
