I support Tim's suggestion, even though it will result in many 
descriptive
changes throughout the specification.

That isn't actually a problem.  There is no current BNF rule for URI,
and thus any spec that used it would necessarily be doing so in an
informal way.  My observation has been that most specifications, when
referring to URI in an informal way, do expect the possibility that
it may include a fragment.

The existing BNF rules already do that.  They would not be changed.
