OK, I think this is an important statement. Any spec that currently refers
to RFC2396 for URIs should either

- use BNF terms such as "absoluteURI" instead (if that's what's meant) or
- clearly define what RFC2396 construct it's talking about.

I'm still not happy that absoluteURIs don't have fragment identifiers, while
URIs may. That's not really intuitive.
