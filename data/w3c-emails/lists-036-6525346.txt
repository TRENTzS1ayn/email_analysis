Please review the RDFCore last call working drafts which are linked from

Whilst we would welcome your comments on any and all aspects of these 
documents, the WG particularly requests feedback on:

   o the proposed used of xml:base, and especially its handling of same 
document references
      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-ID-xml-base
      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-baseURIs

   o the rdf interpretation of fragment identifiers
       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-fragID

The last call period for these documents ends on 21 Feb 2003.  Please can 
you let me know if you expect to be able to comment in that timeframe.
