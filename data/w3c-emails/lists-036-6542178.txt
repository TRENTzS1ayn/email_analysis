I agree; context of use isn't a syntactic restriction, so this would suit
better as a schema extension, rather than a type.

(Doing it in Schema is arbitrary; it could also be done in RDF, etc. I
think it's interesting in Schema because it's the way that many formats
are normatively described.)

Cheers,
