Hello Roy,

Can you please split the following issues for RFC 2396bis into two issues:
http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#020-utf8-default

One issue is the question of using utf-8 as the default. I'm sure we
can find a wording here that is better than the vague stuff we have
in RFC 2396 without being exclusive; I'm glad to help on details.
This should continue to be labeled as 020-utf8-default.

The second issue, which could be called "host-escape", is about
officially allowing %-escaping in the host name part, in order
to deal with Internationalized Domain Names.

These issues are related (we better fix %-escaping for host names
to be UTF-8-based, or we lose the genericity of that part of the
syntax), but they are separate in that they affect different
parts of the spec and can be dealt with independently.

Regards,    Martin.
