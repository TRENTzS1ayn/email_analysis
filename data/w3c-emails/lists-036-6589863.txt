I'm using a Perl script that contains XML::Catalog. The following
instruction is used to create a catalog object (on a PC):

my
$catalog=XML::Catalog->new('file:/users/abaqus60/utils/generated/doc_env/doc
types/catalog');

This works. However, what I'd really like is to specify the partition, as
in:

my
$catalog=XML::Catalog->new('file:d:/users/abaqus60/utils/generated/doc_env/d
octypes/catalog');
or something equivalent to be able to specify the 'd' partition.

The previous syntax does not work. Does anyone have any ideas about how I
can change the above line or change the XML::Catalog package to make this
work?

Thanks,

Jerry Kasten
