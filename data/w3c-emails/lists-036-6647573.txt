I guess "must not" is more accurate.

okay

Still just less efficient -- it results in the application thinking
there are two similar namespaces when there is, in fact, only one.
I don't know of any case where that would result in system failure.
However, I guess it won't hurt to add incorrect.

okay, I like shorter paragraphs.
