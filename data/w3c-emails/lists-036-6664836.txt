Dear Larry, Martin, Al, all,

I don't understand, Larry - why do you believe that the proposal does not
work with current HTTP (RFC 2616) and RTSP? We have implemented it with
current standard-conformant software and have not had to change anything in
the protocols. Could you please explain your reasoning in more detail?

I am currently travelling through Europe and will be attending the IETF
meeting in Vienna in two weeks. I am more than happy to discuss the temporal
URI fragment proposal in person with anybody else attending. Drop me an
email if you're there.

Best Regards,

Silvia.

I think I now understand that most of this proposal is
dependent on updating HTTP (RFC 2396) and RTSP (RFC 2326)
to allow fragment identifiers in the request URI.

I can see that they've managed to produce a demonstration
where doing so "works" with a HTTP server, but I don't
think it's a good idea.

No matter what the syntax of the fragment identifier.

Larry
