I don't think the DDDS folks will be too worried about this.

But if you insist on going forward, then:

  http://urn.X.Y/

is a sufficient hack. It also doesn't require inventing new points 
of failure in the web architecture*, doing DDDS badly, or the costs 
of dealing with ICANN and whoever provides this service.

* As for the full richness of the web archiecture, think about how 
the provider would scale this service. - I suspect purl works 
because not many people use it.
