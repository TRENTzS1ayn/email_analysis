Well, I consider both to be elegant solutions. I just consider
a new top level domain to be more optimal, all things considered.

DDDS may be your preferred solution, but I would hope you
could see the domain based solution as something a bit more
refined than a hack.

But, hey, feel free to think what you like. I won't argue
the point.

Surely you can elaborate...

I fail to see any organizational distinction. It's purely
technical. There exists an organization which manages the
registration of urn: subschemes. That organization "controls"
the urn: namespace (all URIs beginning in urn:).

The owner of each subscheme controls their individual subspaces.
E.g. The ISSN folks control urn:issn: and decide what further
URIs are minted beginning with urn:issn:, etc.

If we simply shift that to domains, the same organization that
controls the urn: namespace and the registration of urn:
subschemes controls .urn. Each owner of each subdomain of 
.urn controls all URIs and further subdomain divisions intersecting
with that web authority.

The organizations are the same. The policies that are employed
to decide which URN subschemes are registered remain the same.
Nothing in the organizational/practical structure needs change
at all.

It's simply an issue of whether or not the resultant URIs minted
within that organizational machinery are meaningful to HTTP
servers.

If I'm missing something fundamental, please tell me what it is.

I'm sorry, but I don't follow you here.

Can you please specify exactly what the problem is that
you percieve?

You're going to have to provide some hard cold facts

Sorry. No. That's like saying a car's design is responsible for a
lousy taxi driver, who is rude, drives to fast and is shamelessly 
flatulant. Since there exist many acceptable and even some execellent
taxi drivers using the same technology and working within the 
same constraints, we can fairly attribute failure for a satisfactory
taxi experience to the driver, not the vehicle.

There is always a tradeoff in how general a tool can be and
how specifically that tool can affect a given result. 

My point was that organizations managing URN minting services
will be expected to provide certain basic services and if 
one particular organization fails to do so, or does so in an
unsatisfactory manner as compared to other organizations
providing the same services with the same architecture, 
then the failures or shortcomings of one organization have little 
to nothing to do with the architecture.

???

Precisely how does it punish them?

You seem to see specific flaws in the proposal, but I've yet
to get any clear picture what they are.

In either scenario, we have

1. A hierarchy of organizations that control URI allocation.
2. A means to reflect that hierarchy in URI structure.
3. A mapping from more-opaque name to less-opaque name.
4. A mapping from less-opaque name to representation.

Both my proposal as well as the urn: URI scheme and DDDS
provide solutions for the above. But applying Occam's Razor,
my proposal does so with less machinery, and particularly,
with already deployed technology.

What exactly do "we" know now that we didn't know 10 years ago
that suggests that my proposal is not an elegant solution
to this problem (even if considered less elegant, by whatever
degree, to DDDS)?

You seem to be strongly asserting that it is a flawed idea,
and I'd like to understand where you see those flaws.
