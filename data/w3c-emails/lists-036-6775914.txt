My apologies if my posting sounded like an objection.

I didn't mean to imply that I objected to your posting, just that I didn't 
think discussion on RDF/URI lists would really be productive.  My opinion 
on this is a small matter, and I suggest we not debate the point -- this 
message is merely to convey my apology for any appearance of overbearing 
behaviour, which was not intended.
