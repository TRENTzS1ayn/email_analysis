FWIW, I've been doing something like this for a while, cf.

The latter is interesting in that I did (at the time) get a commitment from 
higher management that the URI space designated would be held immune from 
re-use for any other purpose.  So far, it seems to have held through a 
change of company ownership and my own transfer to other pastures.

I still think it's a bit of a hack, but one that, as far as I can tell, is 
mostly harmless.
