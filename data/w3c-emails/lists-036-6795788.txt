No problem.

It's probably more relevant to uri@w3.org than www-rdf-interest
and I'll probably exclude the latter in future posts, unless
any topics arise that are particular to RDF.

Your comments about the unlikelyhood of a new top level domain
did get me thinking, and of course there is no actual need for
a new top level domain.

A subdomain of .org would do just fine.

So if there actually is strong opposition to a new, special,
top level domain, the proposal is still just as feasible,
though with simply one extra level in the domain.

Cheers,

Patrick
