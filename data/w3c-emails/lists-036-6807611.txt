Right. The key difference in my proposal is that for any
given urn: URI, you'd have no less degree of opacity in
its corresponding HTTP-URN. 

But technically, there is no difference. Both are simply
more persistent, more opaque names that are mapped to
less persistent, less opaque names.

Exactly. Having a domain root that is controlled by the same
organization that manages the urn: subscheme registration
alleviates the danger and worry of preserving the integrity
of the namespaces.
