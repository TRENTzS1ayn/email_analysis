HTTP clearly says to not send the fragment identifier to the server,
but you send it (in your telnet experiment). So you are NOT standard-
compliant.

There are lots of way to send the information you want to the server
(parameters, query part,...). There is no need to create a new way.
Unfortunately, I won't be in Vienna.
