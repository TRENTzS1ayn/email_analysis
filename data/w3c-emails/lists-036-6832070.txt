Hi,
I took the www-rdf-interest group off the
reply list since I don't know the list charter and can't tell
whether my reply is relevant.

1) There is zero reason for a new TLD for
this; if you want this hack, you could do it at urn.iana.org
with no change to the rest of the hack.

2) This hack runs into the typical confusion
between the infrastructure required for retrieval and
for identification.  As a trivial example, note that
http://www.ietf.org/ and https://www.ietf.org/
are both commonly used retrieval mechanisms for
the same resource, but they are not the same identifier.  The
same would be true of https://issn.urn.iana.org/1560-1560;
if it redirects to the same as http://issn.urn.iana.org/1560-1560
is it the same or isn't it? There are quite a few non-trivial examples  of
problems re-using DNS records that already have a purpose in mapping
to IP address records; the potential for getting both AAAA and A 
records back is one
example.   When you are trying to layer retrieval and identification over
each other using the existing redirection services, you are pretty
much bound to get confusion.  This is avoidable in small scale services
with well-known conventions, but it gets a lot harder as it scales.

3) If you really believe this isn't a hack, but a solution
that would work and scale to the size of the Internet, writing
it up as an ID with a full specification is a good first step.
This is pretty well-trodden ground, and getting folks to see
how your proposal avoids the common pitfalls requires a
full specification to be convincing.

regards,
Ted Hardie
