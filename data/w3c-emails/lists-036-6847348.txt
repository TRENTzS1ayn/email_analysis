You lost me here. I said using http://urn.X.Y was a hack, a 
sufficient one.

Thank you. Feel free to follow the thread.

Oh come on! Buying into a new tld instead of regsitering a urn 
scheme. Providing  the resolution service (when they copuld jsut 
provide HTTP UTIs).

I don't need to convince you of anything. Your convictions don't 
chnage how the web functions.

Irrelevancy objection.

It has everything to do with the architecture. The web wasn't 
designed to route such traffic through a single server. Which is why 
   I cite the purl idea working insofar as not too many people use 
the service.

Type 'slashdot effect' or 'google cluster architecture' into a 
search engine.

Routing urn resolution traffic through a single management 
infrastructure acting as a front controller to content providers 
will be problematic, at best. Even DNS isn't that centralized.  Why 
would you want to spec that?

So does my urn.X.Y hack, but at a fraction of the cost to the 
provider. heck you could just define a urn.txt at the server root 
and allow people to GET urns.
