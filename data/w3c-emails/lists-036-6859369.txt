I agree. That occurred to me after my original post, and after
some prodding from Graham Klyne.

In fact, the mapping from urn: URI to HTTP-URN could be
generalized to

  urn:X:Y   ->    http://X.D/Y

where

  X is the URN subscheme name
  Y is the URN subscheme specific part
  D is the root domain for HTTP-URN management

so, whether D equates to .urn, .urn.org, .urn.iana.org, etc.
is a secondary issue, where the guideline "shorter is better"
should nevertheless be taken to heart.

I don't see there being any confusion. Let's take an example:

   http://issn.urn.iana.org/1560-1560 denotes some resource

That resource is owned/managed by Example Inc. and is synonymously
denoted by the URI

   http://example.com/issn/1560-1560

Now, both of those URIs denote the same thing. I.e.

   <http://issn.urn.iana.org/1560-1560> 
      owl:sameAs
         <http://example.com/issn/1560-1560>

Either of those URIs could be used to obtain representations or
(ideally) descriptions of the resource denoted. And, in fact,
the resolution of both URIs, not just the first, might involve
redirection.

But nowhere is there any ambiguity regarding the denotation of
the URIs.

As for https: URIs, well https: is an oddball URI scheme that
has inherent in it (IMO) an equivalence assertion. I.e. for
any two URIs

   http://X
and
   https://X

the following can be presumed

   <http://X> owl:sameAs <https://X>

and the extra 's' in the URI scheme is simply a processing 
instruction to the server, not a semantically significant
component of the lexical form of the URI.

http: and https: URIs are in free variation with one another,
with no change to meaning.

Ultimately, when resolving an HTTP-URN to a representation,
a server somewhere will return an entity in
its response corresponding to a representation of the
resource denoted by the URI provided in the original
request; and if it is a well behavied server, will specify
in the response a URI denoting the representation itself,
if it is an entity distinct from that denoted by the
original URI.

I see no problems with ambiguity here. 

If you still think I've missed something, please try again.

Firstly, it does not have to scale to the size of the internet,
only to the scale that managed URNs are deployed.

Secondly, this approach can be done now, with no particular
steps taken whatsoever by any of the central organizations
managing internet and web standards. I could found a company
today, grab some domain such as .urn.org and begin charging
money for subdomains such as issn.urn.org and also sell
the software needed to manage the namespaces and redirection
mappings. This requires no action on the part of the IETF,
IANA, W3C, etc.

The only part of my proposal that concerns organizations
such as IETF, IANA, W3C, etc. is the present, existing
management and control of urn: subschemes -- presuming that
it is better to have that same organization manage any
subdomain registrations of a .urn(.*) root domain rather
than creating a competing organization.

Thirdly, I see the scalability complexity of my proposal
and that of DDDS to be roughly the same, and both define
machinery that can be employed to deal with scalability
and non-centralized management -- the key difference being
that the machinery used by my proposal is already in place.

Well, I think putting it on the table for informal discussion
is a good first step.

An ID is certainly an expected subsequent step.

I keep puzzling about what those common pitfalls might be.

You mentioned a couple potentials above, but I'm not 
convinced of those.

This really is a proposal for a change in management
practice, not a change in web architecture. The technology
and solutions outlined are already widely deployed. So
forgive me for being rather skeptical about claims that
this approach is technically flawed. I see the only real
threat to its adoption being politics, not technology.

Patrick
