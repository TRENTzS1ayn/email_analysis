I was simply taking issue with the word "hack" which typically
denotes a lack of quality or integrity of design, which I don't
see as applying to my proposal.

Perhaps in your lexicon "sufficient hack" == "elegant solution"? ;-)

Firstly, a new top level domain is not a cost burden. It's a
political and/or organizational hurdle, but once past that,
constitutes no added cost for those adopting this solution.

Secondly, as has been pointed out by several, including myself,
a top level domain is not actually necessary. Only a consistent
root domain. 

Surely you don't consider obtaining a new .org or other domain
a substantial cost burden.

Nor do yours, with all due respect.

And no, you don't have to convince me of anything.

What in my proposal suggests that there would be a single
server for all URN resolution?!

In fact, I particularly stated that there was a great deal
of flexibility in dealing with scalability issues. 

I think you should go back and re-read my original post, as
your comments seem to be motivated by some misunderstandings.

Each managing agency of a URN subdomain is free to further
partition and organize that namespace as they like, including
the specification of additional subdomains, each with their
own server, as a means of load balancing. 

And please don't tell me that a single URN subdomain agency
such as ISSN, or DOI, or the like could not set up an efficient
server cluster to handle any reasonably concievable load when 
all that service is doing is issuing redirects.

Your argument fails to serve as convincing evidence
that PURL would *not* work if it scaled up several
orders of magnitude.

Your argument equates to "X works with Y users,
therefore X will not work with Y^2 users" which
I don't find very persuasive.

Sorry. No. I see now where our communication may be breaking down.

The above referenced problems are due to a single point of service.

Yet what I am proposing provides for (theoretically) an infinite
number of servers, organized independently by each level of the 
management hierarchy, and is just as scalable as the web, because
it is just as flexible and distributable as DNS.

There is no single mother-of-all master server that is managing
all redirects for all HTTP-URNs in use. If you understood me 
as proposing one, then I ask that you go back and re-read my
proposal more carefully.

There are at least as many servers as there are HTTP-URN subdomains,
and likely far more than that, organized as subsubdomains under
each HTTP-URN subdomain, particularly for subschemes that
are very popular and have a large customer base.

If my proposal is not scalable, then neither is the web.

OK. It's clear you have misunderstood my proposal.

Insofar as what you misunderstood me to say, I fully agree, that would
be a pretty stupid design, and garunteed not to scale.

Though, since I was not proposing any such thing...

To clarify, consider a top level management domain .urn.org which 
is owned by the same organization responsible for registering urn:
subschemes. 

That top level management organization will probably have a server
located at urn.org which provides all kinds of useful information
about the organization and the process of getting a URN subdomain.

Each registered URN scheme subdomain will have their own server.
Thus each of

   ietf.urn.org
   oid.urn.org
   issn.urn.org
   nbn.urn.org
   pin.urn.org
   isbn.urn.org
   newml.urn.org
   oasis.urn.org
   ...
   etc.

would each be a different server, each constrained to the
management of each particular URN scheme.

Now, it may be that none of those servers actually are used
to mint URNs within those schemes. Rather, each URN subdomain
is further partitioned, in the interest of scalability, into
arbitrary segments:

   x001.issn.urn.org
   x002.issn.urn.org
   x003.issn.urn.org
   ...
   etc.

where each of the above might be managed by separate servers.

Then, URNs are minted according to whatever organizational
structure the URN agency employs:

   http://x287.issn.urn.org/...

Thus, each URN scheme agency is free to organize their own
server space as they see fit. 

Whether or not there is one single server or thousands
of servers is up to each level of the management hierarchy,
*exactly* as it is for web servers in general.

Again, if my proposal won't scale, then neither will the web.

I think you need to reassess that in light of your
apparent misunderstanding of what I was proposing.

In either case, managing organizations must manage mapping
information. Since they already deal with web servers, having
them learn/apply yet another technology (DDDS) seems far
more costly to me.

Not to mention the fact that all web clients would immediately
benefit from my proposed solution with zero change to any of
the actual web infrastructure, including client software,
operating system drivers, web servers, ...  *nothing* needs to
change to put my proposal into use.
