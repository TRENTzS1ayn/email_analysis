The problem I see is how you make a domain name, even issn.iana.org,
stable.  It seems totally possible that 5 years from now iana will
change its name, and politcal winds will make it really, really want
to change issn.iana.org to issn.joePoliticanMemorialIANA.org.   

Or someone could forget to pay the bills.  I've lost a domain that
way.  I pushed pretty hard and was assured that even verisign couldn't
get its own domain back (unless trademark law applied) if it forgot to
pay the bill on time.  And it's not only individuals who forget to pay
bills (I'm thinking of microsoft forgetting to pay for hotmail.com).

Presumably, if enough was built on the exact name, there would be
enough of a back presure that the domain could not be taken away, but
... it's a concern.
