I believe that it only appears to work because you were not testing
with a proxy and because the Apache code will ignore non-compliant
parts of a request-URI for the sake of robustness.  A future version
might redirect such a request with a 301 --- highly probable
given that rewriting the httpd URI parsers is on my list of things
to do after the spec is complete.
