No, it really cannot.  I know of several cases where they
point to different resources, and many cases where one points
to a resource and the other does not.  Further, they
are clearly functionally different as protocol elements; the
difference between them makes a fundamental assertion
about how to engage in protocol processing.

You seem to be working from the assumption that if two
identifiers resolve to the same resource at the end of
this processing, they were the same identifier.  That's
not true, and it has been discussed to death.  If that's
not what you mean, I don't think you're being clear
(and, again, I think the way to be clear here is to
write a draft specifying the mechanisms in full)

Sure, and if you want to found one,  go ahead.  You'll need to build
the trust of your customers that your resolution mechanisms
work better than and will return the same answers as the
mechanisms already specified, but that's up to you and
your marketing department.

My informal response is "this has no obvious advantages over the
DDDS proposal, has strong flavors of things that have
been discussed and rejected, and isn't well specified."

That would help, thanks.
