Which is why I proposed a top level domain.

Still, something like urn.org would be just fine. There's very
little chance, I think, that any future organizational change
would impact the legal/political/etc. significance of that name,
and it's hardly much more informative than "urn:".

Still, .urn would be the safest bet, IMO, if it could be pulled off.

Well, I wouldn't expect this particular domain to be commercially
owned or managed. Hence the idea of a top level domain. Noone is
paying to own '.org' or '.com' or '.net' (even if they may be 
charging others to own/maintain subdomains below them).

I agree. And it's one that can be addressed, I think, quite
nicely with a special tld .urn which is owned and managed by
the same organizational body that manages urn: subscheme
registration -- and is guarunteed perpetuity by the powers that
be...

Maybe that's a pipe dream, but I'd be very surprised if it was
beyond the real of possibility.
