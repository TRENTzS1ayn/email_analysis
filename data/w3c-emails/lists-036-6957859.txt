Perhaps actually different representations, rather than
different resources.

I.e. both URIs denote the same resource, but there may
be a different set of representations accessible via
one than the other.

Er. Right. Like I said, the 's' in https: is a processing
instruction that results in different behavior from the server.

Insofar as denotation is concerned, that 's' is semantically
(though not lexically) transparent.

Insofar as resolution of that URI by an HTTP server, that 's'
has semantics relevant to the resolution protocol, just
as most of the other structural components of a URI do.

One can denote the same resource with an http: URI, an
https: URI, a urn: URI, an ftp: URN, etc. and insofar
as the denotation is concerned, those URIs are opaque.

However, http: and https: URIs have IMO a special relation
in that whereas other lexical distinctions between two
URIs might correspond to a difference in denotation, alternation
between the http: and https: schemes for the otherwise
lexically equivalent URIs cannot and does not result
in any difference in denotation.

Any URI https://X denotes the very same resource as
the URI http://X, even if there may be representations
that might be accessible via https://X that are not
accessible via http://X, or visa versa.

In that way, https: is a pretty odd fish.

No. I don't assert that. Not for arbitrary pairs of URIs.

Only for pairs of URIs which differ only in the alternation
of the http: and https: schemes.

Well, I can try to be clearer. It may also be the case that
you are not reading my posts carefully enough.

I agree. My point was simply that there is no *technical*
obsticle or flaw in my proposal, insofar as a common base
domain for the management of the URN namespace is concerned.

It's simply political/practical/organizational/beaurocratic.

For the sake of assurred perpetuity of URNs, it would be best
all around if the base domain were owned/managed by the same
organization now managing registration of urn: subschemes,
and that the registration of subdomains would follow the
same process as for urn: subschemes, with no cost incurred,
no chance of losing ownership of the subdomain due to e.g.
failed payment, etc. and no risk of reuse of a subdomain
if a subdomain owner ceases to function/exist.

Eh? You don't consider the possiblity of immediate access
to representations using existing HTTP machinery an advantage?!

You appear to be reading those things into my posts (and

To be honest, given the simplicity of the idea, I'm not
sure how its specification could be expanded upon to
any great extent.

Granted, I've not taken a historical tour and related it
to every possible alternative...

I do, though, plan to work up an ID in the coming weeks.
