I've been on vacation and blissfully ignoring this thread but this had
to be corrected....

You are simply and flatly wrong here. By using the term 'resource' in
this context without clarification most will assume you are using the
term in its RFC 2396 sense. If you aren't then please say so since its a
very important distinction. If you have two URIs then you, by
definition, have two distinctly different Resources. You personally may
have some knowledge outside the web or within some particular
application of it that suggests these two Resources may be considered
equivalent according to that _other_ set of rules, but in so far as the
web and URIs are concerned, there really are two separate resources.

Especially since one is included in an SSL session that is signed by a
certificate. In today's world there are many communities that would
consider the unsigned one to be downright dangerous.

Wrong. Very very very wrong. In a security minded world it is most
definitely _NOT_ transparent.

This last paragraph is so wrong as to be very dangerous to even post on
a official list for the discussion of URIs. Please clarify your
statement and reconcile it with RFC 2396 because on its face it violates
the standard.

That was never defined for 'https' and in practice is not the case. The
fact that access to one Resource is signed and one isn't means that no
matter the claims to the contrary, those are two different Resources.

Nope. We've read 'em carefully. You're not the first to suggest this
approach. It's been suggested at least three times going back to '92.

For your simplistic view of it, yes. But those that manage namespaces
with much wider deployments than your needs have already determined that
it is insufficient.

All you're doing is encoding the first rule of the DDDS for the URI
Resolution Application. And many have determined that there is a need to
go beyond it due to the fact that while the namespace may be unchanged,
the delegation rules may change over time. You are requiring that those
delegation rules only be expressible within one single (aggregate) HTTP
server, using the mechanisms found only within HTTP 1.1 and that simply
isn't workable.

Obviously not! If all anyone ever wanted to do with URNs was to make a
webpage available we could've done that a decade ago. We've already made
the determination many many times that the 'HTTP machinery' is
insufficient and actually the wrong model. There was even a proposal
many years ago called WIRE that attempted to use 30x redirects to do a
style of DDDS resolution that ended up being extremely convoluted. 
Do you think we rejected HTTP due to some inherent 'not invented here'
syndrome? Many of the folks involved with URNs were also involved with
the HTTP protocol development. We knew its limitations and rejected it
with many good reasons (most of which is the redirection model).
