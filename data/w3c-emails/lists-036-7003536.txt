I don't know. You're using a definition of equality drawn from OWL and
not from RFC 2396. I don't use OWL and thus never intended for its
definition of 'equality' to be used in any comments I made. When I talk
about URIs _universally_ I make it a point to use only terms that are
universal for all possible applications, past, present and future. That
means the only definition of equality that's available to me is the one
found in RFC 2396. You're talking about OWL's concept of equality which
is a perfectly fine thing to do. OWL probably has a completely different
definition of what a 'resource' (note no capitalization) might be.
Again, I don't use OWL so its definitions are not in my lexicon.

Where are you drawing your definitions of 'resource' and 'same'?

I probably am in a small community since I'm attempting to make sure
that people are speaking only about their own particular applications
and not the universality of all systems and objects that could ever be
identified by a URI. Most here seem to be speaking as thought their
system of choice is _the_ system that everyone else uses.

Again, where are are you getting your definitions of 'same' and
'resource' from?
