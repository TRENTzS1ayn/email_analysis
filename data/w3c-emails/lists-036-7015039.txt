[thinking to myself... oh boy, why am I doing this...???]

My friend Michael Mealling [mailto:michael@neonym.net] asserts:

> If you have two URIs then you, by definition, have two distinctly
different Resources.  

The following three URIs are well formed and distinct, but resolve to
precisely the same resource:

http://purl.org/dc
http://purl.oclc.org/dc
http://dublincore.org

It can be argued that the first and second actually point to a resolution
table, which in turn supports redirection of the link to the actual resource
(the third), though this seems to me a distinction without a difference, and
unhelpful.

The distinction between the first and the second resides at the DNS level
(two domains pointed at the same machine... not all that uncommon).  Clearly
these two are different URLs that resolve to the same resource.
