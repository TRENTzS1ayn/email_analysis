The definition of 'same' that you are using is perfectly reasonable to
you but might be completely unreasonable to someone else. I personally
don't agree with it since I have no real garuantee that oclc.org will
remain under OCLC's control since domain-names are re-assignable. We
spent a large amount of time way back when realizing that 'sameness'
with respect to URIs has many 'flavors', only one being universal for
all cases in which a URI can be used.
