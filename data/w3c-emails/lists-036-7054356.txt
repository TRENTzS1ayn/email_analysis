> Where are you drawing your definitions of 'resource' and 'same'?

I'm using "resource" in the sense of RFC 2396 bis, which I believe to
be the same sense as used by RFC 2396, RDF, and OWL.  In philosophical
or mathematical logic, I think one might use the term "object in the
domain of discourse", or just "object" or "entity".

I'm using the word "same" in the normal dictionary sense of being
truly and completely indistinguishable.  If I tell you <Jim>
owl:sameAs <James>, then you know I'm using the terms "<Jim>" and
"<James>" as synonyms, as two names for the same thing.

Isn't that what URI theory is about, generalization about URIs?  If
we're not trying to be general, what's the point of using URIs?

Clarified now?
