The one implicit in the identity function: I.e. a URI is equal to
itself....

I agree that is a very simple and limited form of equality but its the
only one that's universal. Its so simple you could also get away with
saying that there is no such thing as equality for URIs or
RFC2396-Resources....

I'm comfortable with either one since they're essentially the same
property depending on whether your consider the identity function to
also be an equality function.
