But you are decorating that definition with concepts from RDF and OWL
that don't exist in 2396. The main one being that you can make
statements within OWL about a resource that also hold true for
generalized URIs, and that's not the case.

Absolutely correct! _You_ have told me that "Jim" and "James" are
synonymous. But RFC 2396 provides no method for making such statements.
It has no concept of 'you' or 'tell' or 'me' or 'same' or any other word
you just used. The reason is that someone _else_ may come up with a
vocabulary for making similar but different statements and still use
URIs without conflicting with your definitions....

I was hoping you'd say the same. By trying to be general we have to make
sure that URIs work for all possible applications. Without that they
loose their general applicability.

Yes. But to be clear, you're using definitions not found anywhere in RFC
2396 and not found in large numbers of application that use URIs and
make statements about 'sameness'. You might be using 'sameness' in its
'normal dictionary sense' but you have to realize that you're using an
English dictionary....
