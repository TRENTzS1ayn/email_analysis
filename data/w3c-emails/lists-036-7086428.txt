So you say.  But how do we know that, absent a clear-cut operational
definition of "resource"?  A resource cannot be identified with the MIME
entity body that is returned when you GET it:  the resources may be
different even though the entity bodies are bit-for-bit identical and
have the same media type; contrariwise, a single resource may return
different entity bodies on different retrievals.

So the most you can say is that two URIs always return the same entity
bodies (or none at all), which cannot be established empirically because
it has to span the entire past and future history of those URIs.
