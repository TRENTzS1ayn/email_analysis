I can put aside the OWL terminology entirely.

You seem to be saying that 
    http://www.w3.org/
and
    http://WWW.w3.org/
could not possibly ever both identify the same resource.  You seem to
be saying that if two URIs are textually different, they cannot
possibly identify the same thing.

If you are saying that, you are making the "unique names assumption"
(UNA) for URIs, and living in a world in which RDF and OWL cannot work
as currently specified.
