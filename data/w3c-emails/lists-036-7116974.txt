It depends on where in Tim's taxonomy of normalization you are. Since
you deal with the 'http' scheme a lot I assume you can normalize that
down to something that allows you to compare them via string
equivalence. If you were in the LDAP world and had no need to know about
the 'http' scheme then you wouldn't be able to do that scheme specific
normalization step that would allow you to do that comparison.

I.e. if I knew nothing about the http scheme then yes, they are
different URIs and thus different Resources. Remember, I live in a world
that doesn't understand the 'http' scheme. No 'representations',
'redirects', or any other 'http' specific semantics.

I never said my very simplistic definition of 'sameness' is the only one
that's allowed. Its simply the only one that's universal. OWL and RDF
can make statements about degrees of sameness between two URIs all day
long. They just have to be explicit about doing so....
