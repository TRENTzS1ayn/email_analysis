I guess that is another way of saying the same thing. It like Graham
said: 2396 doesn't make any statements about equality other than the
identity property of a syntactically normalized URI being equal to
itself. Any other concepts of equivalence are outside the generic URI
syntax and thus based on the semantics of a particular scheme or
application making use of them.....

Is there a difference between those two ways of saying the same thing?
