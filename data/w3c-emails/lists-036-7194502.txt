How do you mean?

  <blort href="#foo"/>

Which context is that?

This really does look like a serious problem. Some people want #foo to
be the same as it was in 2396 and some people probably describe that
as a bug in 2396. :-)

On the whole, given the significance of the change, I think it would
be better to stick with the status quo.
