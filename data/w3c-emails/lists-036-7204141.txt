I disagree.

It comes down to intension versus denotation.

Different URIs do, in fact, have different intensions. And the
statements made about a given resource using oen URI versus another
reflect the intension of the URI.

But two URIs can certainly have the same denotation.

Two URIs can both denote the city of Paris, even if the
representations provided, and the intensions expressed
in statements using one or the other URI differ.

That is completely beside the point.

Or, perhaps, that is the very point. The only real difference
between http: and https: URI variants is in the nature of
the interaction with those representations, such that one
is more secure than the other. Not in any difference in
denotation.

I stress again: Insofar as denotation is concerned...

Precisely how does it violate the standard?

If, for you, resource = intension, then I agree. But I'm talking
here about denotations of URIs, not intensions of URIs.

And I keep waiting for specific references or examples

No. I've already clarified that
I'm not talking about a single server.

Perhaps you have another fault to point out?

And yet, the only real-world applications I've seen argued for
the use of URNs was to make representations of resources available
using minimally mnemmonic identifiers.

I'll have a look at that. Feel free to suggest any particular
pointers.

Certainly not. In the many years that I've been following the
developments relating to URNs and DDDS, the only arguments that
have repeated stood out is that http: URIs aren't acceptable
because (a) server names change and (b) server names typically
contain too much mnemmonic/trademark related content.

While a PURL approach with an official, persistent root domain
certainly does not have the capabilities of the more generalized
DDDS approach, I wonder whether, given the removal of the two
objections mentioned immediately above, is nevertheless sufficient
for nearly all real-world use cases of URNs.

Any pointers to documents or other materials summarizing the
rational of your rejection of HTTP, apart from those two above
objections, are appreciated.

Patrick
