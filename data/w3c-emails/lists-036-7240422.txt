Uhm, Ok. So suppose this element occurs in http://example.com/my/test.xml:

  <blort xml:base="http://example.com/other/file.xml" href="#foo"/>

To what does #foo refer?

If I understand you, you're suggesting that if http://example.com/my/test.xml
contains:

  <rdf:li xml:base="http://example.com/other/file.xml" rdf:resource="#foo"/>

then I might make deductions about "http://example.com/other/file.xml#foo" but
if I clicked on it, I'd go to "http://example.com/my/test.xml#foo"

That strikes me as just totally wrong.

Ah, yes, but continuing my example from above, per 2396 the absolute
URI bookmarked for #foo has to be http://example.com/my/test.xml#foo
irrespective of the base URI at the point where href="#foo" occurs.
