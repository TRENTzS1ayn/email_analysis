Its all about _layers_ Patrick. At the Layer that RFC 2396 is at there
is no language for talking about comparison of Resources because you
don't do it at that layer of the architecture. If you need to say that
two Resources are the same or different by some degree then you have to
go up a layer into something like OWL or RDF or some other application
(try LDAP where equivalence can depend on some funky DIT rules). Now if
I were OWL or RDF I would not use the term 'resource' since its to
easily confused with that term as its used one layer down. Call it an
'object' or something like that.

Its prohibited _at that layer_ by the simple fact that you have no
language in which to express any of those concepts. OWL and RDF can
contribute all manner of equivalences if they so desire but those
concepts are not universal to all URIs or applications, they exist
within their own application scopes at their own layer.
