Correct. Lexical equivalence of URIs is all that RFC 2396(bis) talks
about. If you want to go beyond that then you have to do it in an
application specific manner.

You're mixing your definitions of 'same' again. You are posting this
discussion to the uri@w3.org mailing list, not an RDF or OWL mailing
list. Here we always operate in terms of RFC 2396 alone since that is
how you maintain the generality of URIs. If OWL has a way of saying that
two different URIs have some owl-ish concept of equivalence then great,
go talk about it on the OWL list. Its not a concept that is generally
applicable to all URI schemes and all applications.

Great to hear it! But how is that universally applicable unless you are 
suggesting that every application that uses URIs must become OWL and SW
compliant? I hope not. I don't think Cisco hubs can spare the cycles for
parsing RDF graphs.

Its not intended to prohibit it. But its not intended to mandate it
either. Its a feature of OWL/RDF/SW, not URIs....
