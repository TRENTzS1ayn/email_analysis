I could accept the assertion that they are different names;
and thereby, have the potential, if not even presumption, 
that they denote different resources.

But I don't accept the assertion that they *cannot* denote
different resources.

And that has nothing whatsoever to do with concepts of representation,
redirect, description, etc.

But you seem to be asserting that co-denotation is prohibited,
not simply possible. There is nothing left for OWL or other
layers to contribute, without coming into direct conflict with
what you appear to be asserting, that lexically distinct URIs
always denote distinct resources.
