We have a choice: either 1) the fragment is part of the URI and there
is one process for handling it, or 2) the fragment is an auxiliary
instruction to the user agent that is removed prior to URI processing.
I can work with one or the other, but not both depending on context.
The parsing libraries need to know what answer to provide.

In this case, I find Paul's use case to be less compelling than the
desire by RDF to only deal with things in terms of URIs.  His example
application is already modifying the document to insert the base URI;
it can modify the internal references as well and not suffer from the
problem described.  Partial archiving is not a use-case that needs
to be optimized.
