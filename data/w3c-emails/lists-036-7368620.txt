Michael,

I agree that equality of URIs is well understood (enough for most purposes).

At risk of (re)stating the obvious:  I think we should not conflate 
equality of *identifiers* (URIs) with equality of the *resources* that they 
identify, unless such conflation is to be stated explicitly as part of the 
design.

My view is that, according to the URI specification, given two different 
URIs we simply do not know whether or not they identify the same resource.
