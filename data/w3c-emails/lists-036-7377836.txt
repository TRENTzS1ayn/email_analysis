I'm not proposing any such thing, only that RFC 2396 not
preclude the possibility that two lexically distinct URIs
might denote the same resource.

You seem to be asserting that they can't, at the level of
URIs alone, which hamstrings any higher layers.

Well, all fine and good. But your earlier comments strongly
suggested otherwise.
