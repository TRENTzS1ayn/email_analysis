No shit. Don't patronize me.

You explicitly stated that two lexically distinct URIs denote
*different* resources. 

That's simply wrong. And means that the lower layer is
constraining higher layers against co-denotation.

It is true that RFC 2396 is unnable to say anything about equivalence
of denotation. Fine. But it should also clearly reflect that
there is no restriction against co-denotation of URIs.

Sorry. No. Just because you don't have the language to express
something does not mean it is either impossible or prohibited.

It simply means you can't tell.

It's about granularity. RFC 2396 does not provide sufficient
granularity of specification to clarify co-denotation of 
resources. But that doesn't mean it is prohibited.

That's like saying that atomic structures are prohibited because
at the "layer" of my eyes, I can't see them.
