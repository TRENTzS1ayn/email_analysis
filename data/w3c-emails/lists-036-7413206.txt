I'm not sure where you get this idea, but I can't let it pass
unchallenged.

In the Last Call Working Draft of _RDF Semantics_ (the current spec)
[1], "resource" is defined as "An entity; anything in the universe."
(In this kind of formal logic text, "universe" means "universe of
discourse", not just the real world you and I live in.  Unicorns are
certainly resources by this definition.)

This is, as far as I can tell, exactly the same entended meaning for
"resource" as in RFC 2396 and RFC 2396bis.  And that's what the RDF Core
WG intended, as far as I know.
