Sorry 'bout that. I'm just seeing layer violations in just about
everything you're suggesting.....

Given the lack of language in 2396 about comparing resources I can't see
how you can suggest otherwise.

No. I'm simply saying that higher layers have to create new definitions
for 'resources' that are a superset of the one used by 2396. I.e. there
are URI-Resources and there are SW-resources (or LDAP-resources, or
Gopher-resources). A SW-resource can be referred to as a URI-Resource
but if that is done by something that isn't SW aware then it must not be
expected to 'know' about SW concepts of equivalence.

Correct. There is no restriction of co-denotation because 2396 is
completely silent on subjects like that. That is for applications and
systems to determine. Its just the same thing with IP addresses. RFC 791
specifies no methods for saying that two different IP addresses denote
the same host. That is something that's left for things like /etc/hosts
files and DNS. RFC 2396 is the same way, it makes no statements about
co-denotation since that is something that is left to things like RDF
and OWL. URIs won't solve that problem for them, but it doesn't get in
their way of solving it either.

Its impossible at that layer. Do it at a higher one.

Correct.....

I didn't get that last analogy but the statement its based on is
correct. co-denotation is something that RDF does to RDF-resources, not
URI-resources.....
