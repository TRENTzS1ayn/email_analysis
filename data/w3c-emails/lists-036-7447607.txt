And that was a layer violation and a mistake...

Just because the members of the set of RDF Resources have a direct
mapping to the members of the set of URI Resources doesn't mean that the
semantics are the same. If they were then you would be saying that all
applications that use URIs would then have to be aware of RDF's
equivalence semantics. 

It's like saying that since a domain-name returns two different IP
addresses that you can use the same routing table to get to both since
they denote the same logical host. That's a layer violation...
