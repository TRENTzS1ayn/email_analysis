My previously described use case was just one example.

Are you saying that it never makes sense for an author to use
xml:base or HTML's BASE element?

If we change how #foo works from what's described in RFC 2396 to 
what's described in 2396-bis, how does an author of a document 
that uses xml:base or HTML's BASE author a link in that document 
that is certain to be an intra-document link?
