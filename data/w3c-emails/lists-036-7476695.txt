I am. You made an unequivocable statement. I provided a counter-example.
You are wrong.

Agreed.

That may or may not be the case.

However, that's a statement of the form:

    Any URI https://X can denote the very same resource as
    the URI http://X,

which is very different from what you said the first time.

If the difference between "denotes" and "can denote" is too subtle for you
(is English your first language? I can't tell) then may I suggest you don't
belong in this debate. If the difference is clear to you, then please
retract your former statement.
