I believe one really needs to be able to author something in a resource
that is certain to refer to that same resource.  If you look at most W3C
specification's--certainly most of those with which I am familiar in the 
XML Activity--I think you'll find most links are intra-document links.

No, that is not certain to be an intra-document link if the document's
base URI changes.  For example, W3C specs end up at many different
URIs during their development--in some cases, every draft has a 
different dated URL.  Using your suggestion, every time the document 
is placed at a different URL, the author would have to modify all
intra-document links.  (Redirects also can cause a resource's base URI
to be different from what the author expected thereby causing what should
be intra-document links no longer to be intra-document links.)

I also don't see a practical way using your suggestion to have XML 
with intra-document links generated from a database that may not know 
at generation time where the XML will end up.

I continue to believe this serious backward incompatible change to semantics 
defined by 2396 and assumed by various other specs including XML Base is
quite problematic.
