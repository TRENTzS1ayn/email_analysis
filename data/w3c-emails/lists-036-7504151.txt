Hmmm... I'm not sure I completely follow you. How does a resource
make statements about itself?

I don't see that the definition of a resource needs to be
different for the Web versus the SW.

A resource is simply some entity that is referred to 
(denoted by) a URI.

Different layers are able to provide different functionality
relating to those resources in terms of URIs.

The Web provides facilities for obtaining representations
of those resources, and for indirectly linking one
representation to another by referring to resources
within representations. The link is not between the
resources, but between the representations.

RDF/OWL provide facilities for formally describing those 
resources.

The SW, based on standardized extensions to the Web such
as URIQA, provides facilities for obtaining descriptions
of those resources, and for indirectly linking one
description to another by referring to resources within
description statements.

Thus, for both the Web and SW, URIs denote resources.
That is the key point of intersection between the Web
and SW. How Web vs. SW machinery allow one to interact
with those resources, either by representations or
descriptions, does not require that the definition of
what a resource is and the function of a URI to denote
that resource must be different.

No. While that is also true. It is needlessly vague.

Just because RFC 2396 does not provide any means to determine
if two lexally distinct URIs do or do not denote the same
resource, does not mean that one must posit some different
kind of resource in order to allow SW machinery such as OWL
to do so.

Funny, I found your rewording far more vague than my version.

Though, the vagueness probably arises in the need to nail
down the definition of 'resource' (and ideally, IMO, a common
definition used by both the Web and SW).

I was glad to see Pat Hayes bringing this issue to the Tag
recently.

Here's where the miscommunication is, I think.

I was not asserting that RFC 2396 make any equivalence statements.

But that it would also not make any non-equivalence statements. I.e.
that it would remain completely silent about whether two lexically
distinct URIs *might* denote the same entity in the universe, 
whether or not one might get the same representations of that
same entity from both URIs via HTTP GET.

It's about RFC 2396 only saying what it must say, and not
hobbling the upper layers.

Well, that's hardly going to get us anywhere -- if I must constrain
my use of 'resource' to the meaning defined in RFC 2396 when the
very discussion relates to the meaning of 'resource' as defined
in RFC 2396.

I was trying to be. I hope my comments above make it clearer.
If not, I'll try again.
