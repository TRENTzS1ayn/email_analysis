Then you must be misunderstanding me, or I must have no clue
as to what a "layer violation" is for you (or maybe a bit
of both).

Errr... if 2396 does not talk about comparing resources, that that
also means that you cannot presume that two lexically distinct
URIs *definitely* denote different resources -- only that the two 
URIs *might* denote different resources.

I also see no reason why, given knowledge of the significance
of 2396 to the Web and SW architectural layers, that these 
points cannot be made clear, even without referring to those
higher layers.

I.e. RFC 2396 can explicitly point out that 

(a) there is no requirement that there be a 1:1 correlation between 
resources (things identified by URIs) and URIs -- i.e. it is
possible that lexically distinct URIs may be used to identify
the same thing.

(b) the only equivalence test RFC 2396 provides is for lexical 
equality of URIs, and that is not sufficient to determine whether
two lexically distinct URIs denote the same resource, only
whether two URIs are lexically the same.

Saying the above would provide a clearer foundation upon
which higher layers such as HTTP, RDF, OWL, etc. provide
the extended machinery to clarify the meaning of and
relations between different lexically distinct URIs.

HTTP can define equivalence of denotation between URIs 
which differ lexically in particular ways, such as in
case for the scheme and web authority prefix, etc.

OWL can define equivalence of denotation between arbitrary
URIs entirely.

Yet despite those extensions which allow one to equate the
denotation of lexically distinct URIs, the definition of
what a resource is (anything in the universe) and the
relation between a URI and a resource (the URI refers to
or denotes the resource) can remain the same for all layers.

But if the definition of 'resource' could be identitical for
all layers (and I assert that it must) wouldn't that be better?

You seem to be equating resource and representation again. That
a URI resource is a particular bit-stream.

I see no reason to define 'resource' in such a constrained manner,
nor does such a definition seem compatible with any of the higher
layers.

I also fail to see how the present definition of 'resource' in
RFC 2396 fails to correspond to an LDAP-resource, or Gopher-resource, 
etc.

Well, I'm glad that 2396 will remain agnostic about co-denotation,
but I was taking issue with your assertion that lexical inequality
of URIs could/should be taken to indicate distinct denotation.

Perhaps you didn't mean to make that assertion. Perhaps there really
is no point of disagreement.

Whether asserted or not asserted in 2369, what I was taking issue
with was what you nevertheless asserted -- that lexically distinct
URIs denote different resources.

If we presume (and I think we can and must) that the different layers
of the architectural cake have a consistent definition of what a
resource is, then such an assertion is in direct conflict with the
higher layers.

So if you consider RFC 2369 as defining resources in a way that
is not equivalent to that presumed by the higher layers, then we
have a problem -- either 

(a) RFC 2369 is too vague and allows valid interpretations which
    directly conflict with that of RDF/OWL, or

(b) RFC 2369 is too constrained and precludes interpretations
    which are required by RDF/OWL.

In either case, the definition of 'resource' in 2369 needs revision,
or else those higher layers will need to use something other than
URIs.

Given that the primary (almost exclusive) "customer" of 2369 are
Web and SW applications, it would seem rather strange for 2369
not to facilitate a harmonious abstraction of 'resource' by all
of the layers.

I meant, it's not impossible in reality.

It's one thing to say the resolution is too low to discern some
feature and therefore that feature must be addressed at a higher
resolution (higher layer). It's quite something else to say
that if a feature is not discernable at a particular resolution,
that it is an impossiblity at any resolution.

But your assertion was that, since RFC 2396 cannot equate
the denotation of two lexically distinct URIs, then those
URIs *have* distinct denotation (as opposed to might have,
or could have, or can be presumed at this level to have, etc.)

Again, perhaps you didn't meant to make so strong an assertion,
but you did.

It seems we have incompatable metaphysics.

Resources are just things in the universe of discourse. The fact
that URIs alone cannot provide information about their denotation
does not constrain their denotation, nor does it demand two
entirely different classes of resource.

RFC 2396 tells you about URIs. Not about resources. It mentions
resources because the whole point of URIs are to serve as a
means to denote resources. But all RFC 2396 can say is that
a given URI denotes some particular resource (thing) and 
whether two URIs are lexically equivalent or not.

But the fact that 2396 says nothing about denotational equivalence
does not mean the resources denoted by the URIs it defines are 
different from the resources that REST or RDF or OWL talk about.
