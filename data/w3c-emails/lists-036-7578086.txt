Of course they do.  Venus is Venus, necessarily, and "the evening
star" and "the morning star" both denote Venus.  That said, it was not
trivial to discover that.  There is no reason, just because something is
necessarily true, that it has to be knowable a priori.  IOW, it has to be
true that Venus is Venus, and when we discovered that "the morning star"
and "the evening star" (Hesperos and Phosphoros) had the same referent,
we learned a novel necessary truth.  But in a different universe, we could
have found out otherwise, that H and P were really different objects.
Luckily, we are not in that universe.

No identifiers without a criterion for identity, I'm afraid.
And no entity without identity, either.

Nope.  Even if you don't know that the evening star and the morning
star are both Venus, they still are.  Metaphysics != epistemology.
