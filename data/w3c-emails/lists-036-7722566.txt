I have added a new issue for comment.

http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#043-same-scheme

The changes already made for draft 03 for the remove_dot_segments
algorithm makes it possible to remove the exception altogether
and define the "backward compatible" result as the standard.

The reason this could not be done in the past was because a document
with an opaque base URI, such as "this:top", might have similar
references within it mangled by the parser:  e.g., an absolute ref
to "this:that" would be forced into "this:/that".  As you can imagine,
such a result would be upsetting to the urn scheme.  Since this is
no longer the case with the new algorithm, we could fix this once
and for all by specifying the loophole result as the standard.

It would help if folks test a reference like "http:this" in their
favorite parsers with a normal http base URI and tell us what
the result is for current implementations.
