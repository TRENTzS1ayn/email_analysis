I didn't see any feedback on this comment I posted earlier so am reposting
the comment. It seems significant and worthy of some reply.

The following passage from end 2nd para, section 1.1.3, strikes me as very
peculiar:

'This specification deprecates use of the term "URN" for anything
but URIs in the "urn" scheme [RFC2141]. This specification also deprecates
the term "URL".'

Given that a URI scheme may be classified as a 'locator', a 'name' or both,
how can the term 'URL' be deprecated while maintaining currency of the the
term 'URN'? This seems to introduce an imbalance into the glossary of terms.
Surely in the contemporary view the only term of any significance is 'URI'.
IMO the term 'URN' should be deprecated wholesale along with the term 'URL'
otherwise we introduce an inequitable skewering of the URI space. The 'urn'
scheme just marks out a certain class of URIs which have a particular
semantics - i.e. 'persistence'. Nothing more.

Cheers,

Tony
