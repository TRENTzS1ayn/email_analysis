Roy,

I'm rather with Larry on this one.  I think "semantics" means slightly 
varying things to computer scientists and logicians/philosophers.  Larry's 
suggestion has the advantage of isolating the essential issue of 
identification/denotation without getting drawn into differing views of 
"semantics".

<aside>
Also, I think the apparent plurality of "semantics" is a red herring.  From 
my dictionary:
[[
semantics // n.pl. (usu. treated as sing.)
the branch of linguistics concerned with meaning.
]]
A singular noun form is not listed.
