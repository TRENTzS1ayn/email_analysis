I have changed

   Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing the semantics
   of a URI, but this should not be done unless the URI is being used
   in a context that does not allow the unescaped character to appear.

to

   Escaping unreserved characters in a URI does not change what resource 
is
   identified by that URI.  However, it may change the result of a
   URI comparison (section 6), potentially leading to
   less efficient actions by an application.  Therefore, unreserved
   characters should not be escaped unless the URI is being used in a
   context that does not allow the unescaped character to appear.
