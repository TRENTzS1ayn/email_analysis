I think that's an improvement.  A small suggestion for your consideration:

   s/efficient/effective/

(The rationale is to steer slightly away a possible implication that this 
is simply a performance issue.)

I also noticed the double negative is harder to read, so maybe:
[[
Therefore, unreserved characters should not be escaped unless the URI is 
being used in a context that forbids such characters to appear.
]]

(I don't feel strongly -- these are just suggestions.)
