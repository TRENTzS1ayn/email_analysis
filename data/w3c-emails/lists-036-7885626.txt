Roy, latest draft looks great, except for the following issues (all
minor):

Under no reasonable definition of the phrase "in common use" could the
gopher URI fit.  It should be removed.

In Appendix D, please consider putting the names of rules in <brackets>,
as recommended in RFC 2234, Section 2.1.

There's not enough information to dereference [Siedzik]. The symbolic
name [UTF-8} should be changed to [RFC2279] for consistency.  Also,
please change <?rfc sortrefs="no"?> to yes to make it easier to review
the references.
