"A path is always defined for a URI, though the defined path may be empty 
(zero length) or opaque (not containing any "/" delimiters)"

The production for net-path says that abs-path is optional, so for a URI 
like http://ABCD?query, we have both abs-path and rel-path undefined and 
not empty and therefore path would be undefined. Do we still have to assume 
that path is empty even when both abs-path and rel-path are undefined ? or 
is the above statement from the draft incorrect ?
