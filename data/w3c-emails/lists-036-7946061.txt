Thanks.

It is pretty common in historical documents. ;-)  Seriously, though,
gopher is still in common use in Universities.  I'd prefer to find a
replacement example, such as imap or urn -- suggestions are welcome.

I actually tried that while working on 03 and the result was butt-ugly
and much harder to read.

Unless there is a strong objection, I'd prefer to keep it clean.

Hmm, I guess we should be consistent.  Personally, I prefer symbolic
names like UTF-8 except when we are referring to a specific RFC number.

Unfortunately, the xml2rfc doesn't know much about non-RFC references.
