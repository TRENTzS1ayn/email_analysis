Dear Larry,

many thanks for taking the time to read through the document.

Indeed, my main point was that we need _some_ standard. I'm not really 
too fuzzed about which way we do it, but our proposal seems the most 
advanced of all the ones I have seen. I've also discussed it with others 
such as people in MPEG-21, people at Apple, and SMPTE people and our 
proposal seemed to make sense to them, too.

As you correctly point out, I have not addressed some of the objections 
about _this particular_ formulation, because I have already incorporated 
them into the document (namely: need for more SMPTE schemes, need for 
registration for other schemes, need for addressing of temporal 
intervals as well as time points). The main objection on this list was 
however that we should not go for "fragments" but rather for "queries". 
That's the main point I tried to address. Sorry for being unclear.

Great!

Hmmm...

Our proposal was actually based on the RTSP standard that you're 
pointing out (rfc2326). RTSP uses all three classes that we provide for, 
too. The section you're pointing out describes the npt way of 
addressing. The smpte way of addressing is in section 3.5 and the utc 
way of addressing in section 3.7. After feedback from SMPTE, we've just 
made the SMPTE list more current. With registering schemes through IANA 
it is possible to extend it at any time. I fear it's a little like the 
MIME types registration. We just cannot foresee all required time 
addressing schemes right now. E.g. there may be some scheme for 
addressing pico-second resolutions in data of physics experiments. 
Therefore, I believe we need to be extensible.

That's actually one of the reasons I've been quiet for a while. We have 
implemented a system that demonstrates the use of the temporal URI 
schemes. We've put descriptions up at http://www.annodex.net/ . There is 
no code yet, but the libraries are coming within the next week. An 
application should be up within 2 weeks.

Silvia.
