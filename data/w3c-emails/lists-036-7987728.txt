(I wish we'd pick more meaningful subject lines...)

As one of the main original proponents of the whole 'anything that has
'name' semantics is a URN' approach, I'd like to suggest we drop this
attempt to revive that concept, even linguistically. It just doesnt' get
you anything except more confusion and will certainly drive the RDF/SW
crowds nuts. A URN is a particular URI scheme and anything beyond that
just isn't worth it....
