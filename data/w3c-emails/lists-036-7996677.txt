Hmm. Just wonder why we need to dignify one URI scheme over all others by
giving it a special name. Seems invidious. Or does that mean that it is
somehow special? Otherwise why not refer to a 'dav' URI as a DAV, etc?

I know the whole thing is just a horrid, historical accident, but are there
no means to redress this?
