Please don't.  There is no consensus in the community as to how 
persistence is to be achieved (for example some people believe that this 
is achieved by using the 'urn:' scheme, others think that persistence is 
a matter of management and practice).  I think the usage that URN means 
"urn:" is in fact common in the community, why fight it.  Agreed that 
(as Tony points out) this is perhaps a bit unfair, but it's not actually 
pernicious.
