No, the algorithm does not have to account for every possible bogus
reference and maintain that bogosity.  It only has to be consistent
in handling the bogus parts.  URIs that do not have authority components
are not going to have any paths that begin with "//", period.  There
is no reason for the algorithm to jump hoops for nonexistent schemes.
