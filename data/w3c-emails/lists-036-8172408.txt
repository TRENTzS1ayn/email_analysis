We are talking about a canonicalization.  The choice of which
are escaped is fairly arbitrary.  I agree, the list which I took from 
the current
spec is not appropriate -   "." at least!

The choice is arbitrary.  We are talking about canonicalization,
which has not been defined before.
The choice is driven by the current set of things used
in URIs vs things used as delimiters.  Xpath has increased the former
significantly.  Originally there were many characters which were
not supposed to occur free in a URI (including the typical unix command
line characters) but now we have changed style to do the quoting
in the surrounding environment. So probably erring on the side of
unescaping in the canonical form is best.

The main point is that we should define equivalence and 
canonnicalization
crisply, to give provable properties, and avoid "fear" etc.
