Please explain in what terms you find the 'mid' scheme to be "clearly 
non-hierarchical."

MIME multiparts use the header-list form of metadata wrapper 
hierarchically, and this
reference is a reference based on that hierarchy.

This construction  uses the '/' delimiter to indicate a part of an RFC-2822
object and it identifies it both by the ID of the outer message/multipart
package and the ID of the inner object or MIME part.

PS:

In

  Universal Resource Locators: cid scheme
  http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_1_Cid.html

There is some serious mis-information.

The uniqueness of 'cid' values is global to the Internet, with similar
schemes and reliability as regards 'mid' values.  Also, the syntax for
referencing Content-ID values together with their Message-ID contexts is
well defined as quoted above.

<quote
cite="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2392.html">

    With the appended "content-id", it refers to a body part within a
    message, as does a "cid" URL.  The Content-ID of a MIME body part is
    required to be globally unique.  However, in many systems that store
    messages, body parts are not indexed independently their context
    (message).  The "mid" URL long form was designed to supply the
    context needed to support interoperability with such systems.

It's too bad the w3.org URL is delivering disinformation about MIME.
This incorrect page comes up first in a Google search for "'cid' scheme".
