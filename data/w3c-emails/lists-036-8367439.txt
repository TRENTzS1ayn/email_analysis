You're right. :) I was only thinking of time-continuous real-world 
signals that need digital conversions.

I guess, we came from the rtp/rtsp example and there all were supported.

Hmm. What if the precision of a specific rational number is required?

Sorry, should have read: #@smpte-60=00:01:05

Yes, smpte-60 says that the time label is given as a label with 60 fps, 
i.e. the last number represents 5/60 seconds. This says nothing about 
the actual sampling rate of the video and only refers to the 
interpretation of the time format.
