No, that won't happen under RFC 2396 bis; it is required to use the
existing document if the base URI matches the document URI.  The
uncertain case to my mind is where there is no document URI; in
RFC 2396, "#foo" relative URI references still work, but in
RFC 2396 bis as currently drafted they do not.
