Sorry, I meant to write that if the non-fragment part of the URI matches
the base URI, then the current document is not re-fetched.  So in
the document "http://example.com/foo.html", the URIs
"http://example.com/foo.html#bar" and "#bar" both refer
to the referent of "bar" in the current document.

Ah, I understand the use case now.  Yes, then the change will impact you.
