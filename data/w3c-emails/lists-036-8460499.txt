In the opposite direction to your concerns, I find that the old 
same-document reference approach is problematic because there is *no way* 
to specify a fragment relative to the current base URI without also 
specifying part of the base URI.  (See also my comments at: 
http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#017-rdf-fragment)

I think the underlying problem is that this bit of syntax (i.e. bare #frag) 
is overloaded, and the most useful choice of functionality varies with the 
use.  Which suggests that a fix to satisfy everybody would require more 
syntax, but I don't know if that's a good idea, or even possible.
