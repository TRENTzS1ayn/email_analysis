'varies with use' does not automatically imply we need more syntax.
The two uses we know are HTML-like, where it clearly is a same-document
reference, and RDF-like, where it is treated as being relative to the
relevant base. These uses should be distinguishable by context.
And in both cases, there is no reloading of the document: In the
HTML-like case, because it's a same-document reference and we already
have the document, and in the RDF-like case because we can assume
that the document is a copy of the one at the 'base' location, and
therefore reload is unnecessary. So despite the differences, there
is a lot of commonality.
