That makes it a resolver side convention, not a part of the domain name.
The trailing dot simply doesn't belong there.

Then you were lucky it worked, as you are if you use an Umlaut in an email
address or an IP address as a target of an MX RR. It may work and may have
worked for a long time but still it doesn't mean it's syntactically
correct.
If you're thinking of section 6.1.4.3 of RFC 1123, that explicitly deals with
the user interface only.

The intent was to allow for domain names like "3com.com". I do not think
many people had in mind defining or even restricting future TLDs back then.

This is an operational or administrative convention, but it's not written
down in any DNS spec I am aware of (One should take section 2.1 of 1123 with
a grain of salt here.), so I doubt it's a good idea to make this assumption
for the URI spec.
