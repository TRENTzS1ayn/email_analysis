Dan,

I think some of your test data is at odds with the RFC:

   base = 'http://a/b/c/d;p?q'
   # C.1.  Normal Examples
   (base, '?y', 'http://a/b/c/?y'), #@@wow... really?

My code, and RFC2396bis, give:
   (base, '?y', 'http://a/b/c/d;p?y')

...

I think this case is suspect:

   (base, '#s', 'http://a/b/c/d;p?q#s'), #@@ was: (current document)#s

I've taken the approach of preserving the empty path to indicate the 
current document.  i.e.

   (base, '#s', '#s')

...

These test cases in your file also are at odds with those in RFC2396bis:

   (base, './g/.', 'http://a/b/c/g/.'), #@@hmmm...
   (base, 'g/./h', 'http://a/b/c/g/./h'), #@@hmm...
   (base, 'g/../h', 'http://a/b/c/g/../h'),
   (base, 'g;x=1/./y', 'http://a/b/c/g;x=1/./y'), #@@hmmm...
   (base, 'g;x=1/../y', 'http://a/b/c/g;x=1/../y'),  #@@hmmm...

I think RFC2396bis is pretty clear about its intent here.

...

That's it ... I've now worked through all the test cases on offer, plus a 
few more of my own.  I'll post a note when my code is online.
