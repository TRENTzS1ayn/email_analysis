According to the URI spec [1], that is relative to the *current document*, 
as opposed to the current base URI.  For example, when xml:base is used 
within an XML document, the #frag is not (as I understand) relative to the 
base URI.

The URI spec [1] is quite explicit about stating that when resolving #frag 
relative to some base URI, it refers to a fragment the *current document* 
as distinct from the base URI;  cf. algorithm in section 5.2.

(I'm using this latest work-in-progress as a reference, but, without 
explicitly checking, I think the current spec says the same.)
