Yes, but note that the following issue

http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#017-rdf- 
fragment

is a request to change that algorithm.  The only way that can be
accomplished is by changing the spec to remove the bit about current
document and instead replace the empty URI with the base URI, later
stating that a retrieval action must not take place if the new URI
differs from the base URI only by its fragment.
