Scheme-specific I believe.  "Not well defined" seems like a symptom of a 
broken scheme.

This would tend to support the general feeling that the "file:" URI 
scheme is basically broken.  Further evidence of that fact is that there 
is very poor interoperability in the field.

I see your point, but if a scheme is so broken that a programmer can't 
be sure what needs escaping, then it needs fixing.
