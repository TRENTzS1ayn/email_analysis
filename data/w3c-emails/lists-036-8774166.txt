There is the problem, I mentioned, with ":" in path components. ":" is 
not
reserved in path-segment, but is reserved in the rel-segment. So, 
de-/resolver
need to take special care about escaped ":" octets/characters?

So with base "http://example.org/x/y" URI ref "z%25test"
would need to be resolved to "http://example.org/x/z:test"?
