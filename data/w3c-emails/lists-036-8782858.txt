[some general comments]

+ FYI re process:

Dan Brickley forwarded this proposal to <public-tt@w3.org> and 
<www-annotation@w3.org> on
account of their [presumable] interest in the topic.

+ IMHO re standing of the question for a URI-spec solution:

Usually we say that the interpretation of #fragment is strictly up to the 
rules of the type
of the recovered representation.  In this case it makes sense to think 
again, because there
is a broad class of temporal-data datatypes where the representation of the 
data is peculiar
to each but the common concept of a proper timebase for each such temporal 
media object is
generally interoperable.

+ W3C prior art:

The prior art in W3C is summarized in the SMIL timing model.

  http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-timing.html#Timing-Overview

This demonstrates the capability to deal in terms of local-time-base-valued 
parameters with a
welter of media types and achieve a unified presentation responsive to one 
common master
timebase.

For an example of the use of this SMIL timing model in annotations, see the 
annotations
capabilities in the ANSI/NISO Z39.86 Digital Talking Book:

   http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-86-2002.html#Bkmk

+ Notation options within the URI framework

The semantics of this reference fits a natural English expansion of
   ".. where [some named parameter] is [some given value]"  In other words, 
it fits
the generic semantics of the searchPart syntax.  So an alternative syntax for
this functionality would yield the examples

.. is the default, not indicated by fragment.

>rtsp://foo/bar.rm?utc=now
>(start streaming now)

needs a parameter name that implies wall-clock time, maybe not utc, but not
an anonymous reserved token, must be qualified that this token is a metavalue
in the timeStamp dimension.  That is a limitation that comes with using the
generic searchPart syntax, but it's worth it.

This may also be the default.

+ Other coordination points:  timestamp formats for SMTP and 
calendaring-and-scheduling.

+ Other process:  Sounds like an example of what one would want to register
broadly-applicable property-names for use in ?name-value-pair-list
searchParts in URIs.  Of course any properties one would be likely to want
to commonly use are also likely to have standard definitions somewhere
already.  A registry of short names for standard properties?  Or
URI-references as property names as in RDF?  All it takes is encoding the '#'.
But 'who wants to write those things' when 'smpte' works?
