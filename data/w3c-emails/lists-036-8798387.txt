Thank you for clarifying issues 2 & 3.

About issue 1.

In RFC 1738's definition of "file:" URIs, there _must_ be a host field, 
although the host can be omitted.
So, if you're asking is it 'legal' to write 
'<file:/e:/xxx.pdf'>file:/e:/xxx.<file:/e:/xxx.pdf'>pdf', the answer is no, 
not according to RFC 1738, you must write 
'<file:///e:/xxx.pdf'>file:///e:/xxx.<file:///e:/xxx.pdf'>pdf' which is valid.

BUT
 From RFC 2396 I understood it replaces RFC 1738.
<<<
This document defines the generic syntax of URI, including both absolute 
and relative forms, and guidelines for their use; it revises and replaces 
the generic definitions in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808.

 >>>
And in RFC 2396 '<file:/e:/xxx.pdf'>file:/e:/xxx.<file:/e:/xxx.pdf'>pdf' 
seems to be legal as an absolute URI.
<<<
absoluteURI = scheme ":" ( hier_part | opaque_part )
hier_part = ( net_path | abs_path ) [ "?" query ]
net_path = "//" authority [ abs_path ]
abs_path = "/" path_segments >>> ---> so 
'<file:/e:/xxx.pdf'>file:/e:/xxx.<file:/e:/xxx.pdf'>pdf' is legal.

Why can't you satisfy both?  What do you *need* to do where they  are in 
conflict?

It is a valid URI.  As a URI it is synonymous with the URI containing 
the  unescaped ':' character.  Whether all file: scheme processors will 
process  this correctly is something I don't know.

A file system that expects a drive letter at the head of a file path and 
fails  to treat e%3a as synonymous with e: where it appears in the 
appropriate path  segment for a drive letter to appear in a file: URL is 
strange indeed.

Of course, stranger things have happened.

 >3) Relative file URIs : Is it equivalent to use "./foo.pdf"

or >"<<file:///./foo.pdf>file:///./foo.pdf>file:///./foo.<file:///./foo.pdf> 
pdf" ?

No.

 >Are the last 2 examples which uses scheme name and relative form , 
invalid >URIs ?

Yes.
