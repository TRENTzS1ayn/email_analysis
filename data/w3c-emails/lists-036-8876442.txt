I just got aware of Section 12 in
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipngwg-scoping-arch-04.txt,
which defines textual representations for zone ids in IPV6 addresses.
At first impression, it seems as if this, in some way or another
(definitely not with the syntax that includes a '%' character), may
have to end up in URIs. I'll try to find out more during this week
at the IETF, and will try to have some people who understand this
come to the URI BOF on Thursday. Any comments from somebody more
knowledgeable than me appreciated.

Regards,   Martin.
