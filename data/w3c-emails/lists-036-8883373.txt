Concerning:

   http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html

In a separate discussion, I've had a slight indication that it may not be 
clear that the regexp given does not validate the URI syntax, but just 
splits a well-formed URI into its components.

It's a very small point, but you might like to consider changing:

[[
The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a URI 
reference into its components.
]]

to:

[[
The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a 
well-formed URI reference into its components.
]]
