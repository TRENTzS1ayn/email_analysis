The subpart is a resource. You want the client to address it and the 
server to return a representation of it. To me, this is the definition 
of a resource.

The fragment component is something interpreted entirely on the client. 
That's why it doesn't generate a "new resource" the way the fragment 
identifier is perceived to.

Query results can be cached in network proxies. I believe this is a 
variant of the myth here:

http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/get7#myths

The query result _does_ address a Web resource:

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.2

The HTTP 1.1 spec. is clear that query-retrieved entities CAN be cached, 
but you might have to trigger that explcitly:

    We note one exception to this rule: since some applications have
    traditionally used GETs and HEADs with query URLs (those containing a
    "?" in the rel_path part) to perform operations with significant side
    effects, caches MUST NOT treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless
    the server provides an explicit expiration time. This specifically
    means that responses from HTTP/1.0 servers for such URIs SHOULD NOT
    be taken from a cache. See section 9.1.1 for related information.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt

If you look through the rest of that document you will see that query 
strings are accorded no special status except

Caches will treat a fragment identifier on the wire as a bug, as they 
should. They will probably discard it.

I believe your "large volume of data" is equivalent to what the specs 
mean when they talk about "database".
