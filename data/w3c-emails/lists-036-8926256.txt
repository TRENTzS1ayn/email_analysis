I believe that the intent of a fragment was to address a subpart of a
retrieved representation.
By definition it is offset from the start of the local data that was
actually received, not offset from the start of the remote data.

If you address anything on the Web, it is a resource. Whether it is also
related to another resource (a 'sub-part') is immaterial.

I think a lot changes, and unnecessarily so.

Then make that small sub-part addressable. Problem solved.
You write a server that enables access to sub-parts (required for both
approaches) via a URI & nobody else changes any code and it all works.

How about using a ';' character instead of '#'?
