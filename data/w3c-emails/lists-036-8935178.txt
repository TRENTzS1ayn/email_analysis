(minutes forthcoming)

Roy Fielding reviewed the issue list for RFC2396bis.
Progress was made on remaining issues; it looks likely
that there can be a 'last call' before the next IETF meeting.
We discussed the IRI draft, and decided to set up a
separate mailing list and publish an issues list. There
are still some deeper issues (IDN and IRIs, whether IRIs
need scheme-dependent logic).
For reviewing proposed new URI schemes, the
uri-review@ietf.org list was (re)announced. Roy
will initiate the (minor) update of the URI process document
(also changing the title from 'URL' to 'URI').
Some cleanup work (e.g., 'file:' scheme definition)
was scheduled. Work seems to be progressing well
informally on public mailing lists, and it didn't
seem necessary to charter formal IETF working groups
at this time.
