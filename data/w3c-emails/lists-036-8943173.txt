I think I finally understood 'the issue' (or at least 'an issue').
Currently, the interpretation of fragment identifiers is defined
by the media type "retrieved" (at least with HTTP and FTP). Fragment
identifiers are not defined for use with URI schemes that don't
"retrieve" a representation in a particular media type.

I think your proposal is that, at least for 'rtsp', that it
might make sense to define a general mechanism for fragment
identifiers that are associated with the _scheme_ instead of
the media type. I think the idea (as I understand it) is that
the rtsp fragments might be somewhat independent of the
'media type', and instead be uniformly applied to any resource
accessed via rtsp.

Is that a fair characterization of the issue?

I'm trying to focus on "how the URI spec might change" issues
rather than the specific details of the temporal fragments
themselves.

Here are examples for temporal URI fragment offsets that we envisage:

http://foo/bar.mov#@smpte=00:00:14:15
(start downloading at 14 seconds and 15 frames into bar.mov)

rtsp://foo/bar.avi#@utc=20030308T143000.00Z
(start streaming data recorded on 8th March 2003 at half past 2pm)

http://foo/bar.mpg#@start
(start downloading from the start)

rtsp://foo/bar.rm#@now
(start streaming now)


Fragment handling
-----------------
Currently, the preferred handling of "fragment" offsets is that they are

only interpreted by the client and not transmitted to the server at all.

For multimedia data and the "#@..." fragments we're proposing, it makes 
sense, however, to allow the server to interpret the fragment offset in 
order to reduce network load by serving out data only from the offset 
that a user is really interested in receiving.

A more detailed discussion of this is included in the draft:
