It seems to me, without really knowing anything about NewsML, like it
wants to be using tags.  I imagine the developers had to make a new
URN NID to go with their markup language because they didn't know
about tags, or because tags hadn't made it through the IETF process
yet.  I'd be interested to hear from a NewsML creator on this
question.

I was one of the editors of the NewsML NID RFC.  It was one of the first
approved NIDs, and I don't remember that "urn:tag:" or similar had been
mentioned at the time.  News generates a lot of item IDs, so it was not
inappropriate to have a NewsML NID.  However, I wouldn't recommend using it for
anything other than news.  I don't see that it hurts if there is a more generic
NID that just happens to have a similar RFC.  Just don't copy the mistake in
the productions in the NewsML NID RFC.

Cheers,
Tony.
