maybe "meta" could transport RDF statements about the URI.  Something like:

meta:<URI>:<default RDF schema namespace>:prop1=val1,prop2=val2,prop3=val3

I still think crypto data is less metadata about the resource, and more 
metadata about retrieving the resource, so I'm not sure it should be 
treated the same as other metadata.  But if you had a secure URI using a 
"secure:" scheme, you could nest it inside a "meta:" scheme like above.
