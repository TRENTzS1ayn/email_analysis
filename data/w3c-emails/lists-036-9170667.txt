No. A 404 response can reflect a temporary condition that has nothing
to do with whether a representation is normally available. E.g. the
server may not at that moment have mounted a filesystem that it normally
has mounted, for whatever reason. So a 404 response does *not* reflect
anything about the denotation of the URI in question.

If the current specs actually say the above, then they are clearly wrong.
(but I don't think they say, or are intended to say the above).

That is a different issue. If the information provided by a non-authoritative
3rd party conflicts with the "reality" of the actual denotation and
representations (if any) available from the authoritative Web server,
then that is simply a matter of disagreement between knowledge sources.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with the official, authoritative
denotation of a given URI.

I disagree. The state of the resource denoted by the HTTP URI may
be constantly changing, such that one may never get the same representation
twice. But the denotation should be presumed to be reasonably static.
