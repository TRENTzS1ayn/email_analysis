Great. And I would like this expressed in some clear, normative
manner in the RDF specs. I appreciate that the MT must allow for
multiple interpretations, but we should be clear that the global
interchange of RDF expressed knowledge between arbitrary systems
presumes a single shared interpretation for all URIs.

The present RDF specs do not say this clearly and explicitly, even
if it is implicitly reflected in the graph merge operation.

Perhaps the place for this to be stated is in Concepts.

I agree with this, and I hope my other posts have reflected this.

It is a matter of what the MT allows and what the SW requires. The
MT of course allows for multiple interpretations, since RDF may be
used in contexts other than the SW -- but the SW requires a single
shared interpretation.

I admit that some of my earlier posts were not clear about that
distinction.

Well, within the context of the SW, I think there is presumed to be
a single intended interpretation.

Agreed -- not all by itself, devoid of context, but within the
context of the SW, a URI does, all by itself identify a single
thing in the world (or at least, is presumed to)

That's fine for humans. But for "stupid" SW agents, drawing conclusions
about things is more difficult, if not impossible to do reliably if
there is overloading of denotation.

Also, SW agents do not "communicate" the same way that humans do.
SW agents perform operations on statements. Period. You seem to
be talking about communication as it relates to full cognition
of sentient beings. I am talking about communication at the level
of interchange of data resulting in the consistent behavior of software
applications.

> Its the

Agreed.

But if we do not express the knowledge in a way that has a consistent
interpretation by both parties, how can the knowledge be shared and
exchanged by means of that expression?

Right. If only *you* and *I* wish to communicate.

Ahhh, but here is where you are wrong, within the context of the SW.

On the SW, we usually do not *know* with whom we are communicating!

We cannot agree on a case by case basis on the names to be used
for *each* case.

So we agree, using the SW, that we will (at least try to) use a
set of global names with which to denote things, so that no matter
who our SW agents communicate with, there will be a single (presumed)
interpretation of all URIs.

It is this global scope of the SW involving arbitrary parties
engaged in communication that requires a single consistent
(presumed) interpretation of all URIs.

I follow you. But this is surely an issue of how important a given
resource is. The more important a resource is (such as a resource that
is part of the fundamental machinery of the SW, such as rdf:type
or rdfs:Class) is simply more sensitive to overloading than other
resources and thus, the need for consistent interpretation becomes
critical -- giving rise to the "illusion" of appearing like a 
genuine 'identifier'. But in fact, it is no different than any other
case of URI denotation. Only the degree of negative impact from
overloading is different.

If two SW agents have knowledge that reflects a human disagreement
in the denotation of rdf:type, that will likely be fatally detrimental
to their operation. If they have knowledge that reflects a human
disagreement in the denotation of e.g. ex:foo (whatever that is)
then the impact on their behavior is likely to be far less drastic.

But the two cases are the same. Both involve URIs that denote
resources. Neither URI is a 'genuine identifier', even if one
appears to act more like one then another, because of its significance
to the core SW architecture.

OK. Let's say that we presume we have agreed on a single intepretation,
even if in fact, we haven't -- in which case our communication will
be impacted.

Our communication depends on, or embodies, the presumption that we
have agreed on a single interpretation.

Because our SW agents won't be able to detect overloading and without
this presumed (and ideally achieved) single interpretation, the SW
cannot be an effective tool for the global interchange of knowledge.

No, no no. *Please* do not throw current software systems in with
humans. When a system passes the Turing Test, fine, include *that*
system in with humans, but for now, let's only talk about (fairly
stupid, limited) software applications.

Because we want our SW agents to communicate reliably with any
and every other SW agent on the SW.

No. It is not important. And what a server provides as a representation
of a resource does not necessarily give any indication of what resource
is actually denoted by the URI.

But I think that *is* why you are concerned with the wording. 

It is because the *Web* does  not need URIs to denote integers and 
unicorns that the specs do not say clearly and explicitly (enough) that 
they can be used that way.

It is the needs of the SW that is forcing this issue, and those
who have been involved in the specification of RFC 2396 have 
(understandably) be thinking in terms of the Web, not the SW.
So it is not surprising that these special needs of the SW (but
not the Web) are not clearly and explicitly provided for.

Any revisions to RFC 2396, however, *must* account for and support
these special needs of the SW.

Of that, it appears, we are in full agreement.

Yes, but...

I think that would constitute a schism of sorts between the Web
and SW whereby there is no direct connection between the two. Both
use URIs, but that is then just a practical coincidence.

Rather, and ideally, the primary point of intersection between the
Web and SW are in fact the globally consistent denotation of URIs.

Given any URI within the scope of the Web+SW, it is presumed to 
consistently denote the same thing, and one may either obtain a
representation of that thing, such as via an HTTP server, or reason
about that thing, such as by a SW agent. But in either case, the
thing denoted by the URI is the same.

In this way, one can use the SW to reason about things that are
accessible via the Web, as well as other things that are not 
directly accessble via the Web.

For this to happen, both the Web and SW architectures *must* agree
on the nature and denotation of resources.

Agreed. Clear and wrong is better than unclear.

But hopefully we can get it clear and right.

Eh? This sounds like a tautology to me.

Well, yes, but I guess I am unaware of some significant distinction
between "interpreting X" and "interpretation of X". I would use
the two interchangably.

(remember, I'm speaking in English terms, not Mathematical terms ;-)

Because, if it is a SW agent (or a component thereof), it has this
presumption hard-coded as part of the SW architecture itself.

Because if I am asking my SW agent to do things for me, such as
make an appointment at my dentists, and the denotation of the
URI x:firstDayOfWeek is IMO Monday but for my dentist it is Sunday,
then I may very well find myself a day late or early for my
appointment!

OK, I am now completely lost as to what you are saying.

I'm talking here *only* about denotation of URIs. There are beliefs that
are expressible in RDF *about* a resource denoted by a URI, and there
are beliefs that humans have about the denotation of URIs used to
express those other beliefs. A SW agent only has access to the former
kind of beliefs. It has no access to human beliefs about denotation.

The common ground is the shared *human* belief in a single interpertation
of the denotation of a given URI, not a shared belief *about* the
resource denoted by the URI.

When I say "single interpetation" I mean "single agreed denotation"
or "everyone interprets the URI to denote the same thing".

I appear to be making (or you understand me to be making) a claim that
I am not trying to make.

Apparently, the terminology gremlins are getting out of line again..

Hopefully I've made clear above what I am trying to say.

Well, by uniqueness of interpretation, I have been meaning "agreement
about what the URI denotes". If that is not what uniqueness of 
interpretation means, I'd love to know what it does mean. It seems
that it includes, in addition to agreement about denontation, all
assertions also made *about* the resource denoted. I never meant
to say that everyone has to agree about everything asserted about
every resource. That's silly. Only that everyone needs to (presume)
to agree about the denotation of every URI.
