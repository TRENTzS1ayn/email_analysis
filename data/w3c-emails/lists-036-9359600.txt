Presumed by whom, and why?  I've been "burned" several times by
having hyperlinks in my own sites to what were relevant documents on
the Web at the time I linked them, and later finding them to go to
pornography or other annoying or irrelevant content, usually because
somebody failed to renew a domain name and it got taken by somebody
else with a completely different use.

The lack of persistent meaning for URLs is the reason why URNs were
created as another form of URI with more persistence.
