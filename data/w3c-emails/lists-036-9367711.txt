I think this is nonsense. We have 100 years of philosophy of
language, and decades of work in AI to show that understanding
what a "noun" might "denote" is difficult. For example,
whether "http://www.w3.org" denotes the web site, the
organization, the computer running the web site, the
server process running the HTTP server, the web page
as it evolves over time, the page at the time the URI was uttered,
all of the web pages on the same site, the web page and
its embedded IMGs or just the HTML page itself,
or any of several dozen other things -- is not specified.
None of those things are "the same", and the URI all by itself
doesn't disambiguate between them.

I think "cleaner" is a good engineering design criterion,
but disagree that a model for interpretation of URIs by
reference to denotational semantics is "cleaner".

I think it is "cleaner" to say that a HTTP URI serves to
identify a resource that one communicates with via the
HTTP protocol (as specified in RFC 2616), and that any
denotational semantics are layered on top by communication
systems that (should) provide the necessary context to
disambiguate between all of the various concepts that
might be associated with that resource.

The most widely deployed system today which uses URIs for
denoting something other than the resource identified is
the XML namespace system. In some circumstances, a
URI such as "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" is used to
denote 'the contents of that web page at the exact
instance it was uttered'. If I believed that, then
when I saw xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" in
some XML instance, I would need to find out the creation
date of the XML instance and go to 
http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
to see that there have been at least three versions
of http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml, and I might have
to build a model of XML namespaces where namespaces
changed over time.

I can have a conversation with you about the history
of 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' as a web page maintained
by the W3C webmaster (in RCS, no less, currently saying
Last modified: $Date: 2003/04/11 14:00:50 $) and another
conversation with you about the XHTML namespace.
The two concepts are different. Which is the (single?)
denotation of the URI?
