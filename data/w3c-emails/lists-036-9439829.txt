I beg to disagree.

From: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2234.txt

[[
         HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
]]

and

[[
ABNF permits specifying literal text string directly, enclosed in
    quotation-marks.  Hence:

         command     =  "command string"

    Literal text strings are interpreted as a concatenated set of
    printable characters.

         NOTE:     ABNF strings are case-insensitive and
                   the character set for these strings is us-ascii.

    Hence:

         rulename = "abc"

    and:

         rulename = "aBc"

    will match "abc", "Abc", "aBc", "abC", "ABc", "aBC", "AbC" and "ABC".

                 To specify a rule which IS case SENSITIVE,
                    specify the characters individually.
