Graham,

I think I would prefer your interpretation that HEXDIG allows
upper or lower case.   But in a literal reading of RFC2234
and other reference materials, the following three
counterarguments concern me.

(1)The reference ABNF parser available from IETF does not
        permit lower case values for HEXDIGIT.
http://www.ops.ietf.org/abnf/

(2)The HEXDIG production satisfies the individual character
specification constraint of RFC 2234:

"To specify a rule which IS case SENSITIVE, specify 
the characters individually."

HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

(If specification by numeric value is required, and not
just an option as shown in the examples, then why doesn't
        RFC2234 say "by numeric value" rather than "individually?")

(3)Section 3.4 of RFC 2234 shows that a range of numeric
values has an equivalent specification as individual characters.

DIGIT =  %x30-39
is equivalent to:
DIGIT =  "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9"

Therefore, one should be able to say that %x41-46 is 
equivalent to "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
and hence 
HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
is equivalent to 
HEXDIG         =   %x30-39 / %x41-46
