Hello Harald, Chris, Dave, Paul,

The work on updating RFC 2396 (URIs) got into some dispute
over ABNF (RFC 2234). Can one of you please help us with
the following question:

Does the HEXDIG rule
(HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F")
include lower case digits, or not?

See below for various arguments.

Many thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,    Martin.
