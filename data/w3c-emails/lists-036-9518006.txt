You mean the example parser.  Someone should ask Harald to fix it.

Because there is no other way to specify a character individually.
The string syntax doesn't just specify the character, it also specifies
that it is case-insensitive and ASCII.  The ABNF for the ABNF specifies
char-val independent of the number of characters inside the string.

It does not refer to those as individual characters.

I do not agree with that conclusion.  If the authors had intended to
specify it as case-sensitive, then they would have specified it using
a numeric range and not as quoted character strings.  A mechanical
interpretation of the ABNF syntax cannot choose whether they are
case-sensitive or -insensitive based on the length of the string.
