Because cool URIs don't change.

Well, that doesn't invalidate that the denotation of URIs should
be *presumed* to be resonably static.

Presuming it remains static does not mean it will. Only that unless
evidence arises to the contrary, such as in the case you describe
above, one treats a URI as consistently denoting the same thing.

Fair enough. The presumption of persistent, global and consistent
use of URIs may be more maintainable for URNs than
for URLs, but the presumption is still valid for all URIs. No?
