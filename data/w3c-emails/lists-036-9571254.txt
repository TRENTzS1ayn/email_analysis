I think that Pat and I actually are in more agreement about this
than disagreement, and in fact the disagreement reflected above
does not exist but arose out of my misuse of the terminology.

My key point is that, for the SW (and not any application using RDF
that is not considered to participate in the SW) all parties must
agree upon denotations of a given URI which are compatible, even if
not identical.

Well, one could consider your scheme as *promoting* bad URIs rather
than just allowing them  ;-)

I think I agree with this. It seems to reflect what I said above that,
even if different agents have different interpretations of a given URI,
those interpretations should be compatible.

I gave a few test cases that show how overloading of URIs leads to
a breakdown in communication between people *using* the SW to
exchange knowledge, but I can't think how one would be able to
define a use case that would show a breakdown in the machinery of
the SW itself, since that machinery is incapable of identifying
any such overloading.
