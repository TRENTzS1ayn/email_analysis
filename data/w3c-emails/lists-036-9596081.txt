Thanks Graham. This fits well with how I've been viewing the matter.

Even if, according to the MT, the denotation/interpretation of a 
given URI may differ, what counts for the SW is that those 
denotations/interpretations be compatible.

Incompatible denotations/interpretations are what harm the SW.
