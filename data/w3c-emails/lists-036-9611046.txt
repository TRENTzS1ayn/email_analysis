I suggested a strawman RDF-based scheme a few days ago in another
thread [1], but perhaps it wasn't recognizable to everyone as a
generalization on the secure and meta schemes.

Maybe my horizons are too short, but it's hard for me imagine new
schemes like this actually catching on, so I'm hesitant to really work
on such a thing.
