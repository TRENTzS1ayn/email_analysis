It seems to me that making use of a URI in RDF amount to an owl:import
of the URI's associated web content pretty well solves this problem.
It would make any incompatible use of a URI looks about the same as
self-contradicting RDF graph.  I argued for this a while ago [1] and
mentioned it again yesterday in e-mail which oddly is absent from the
archives (with "KIF" in the subject).
