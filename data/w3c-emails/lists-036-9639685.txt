All are wrong. I've just spoken to Paul Overell, one of the authors of
RFC2234.

Firstly, he is *CLEAR* that ABNF is always case insensitive.

"That's a bug."

No it does not.

If you read the text in the RFC, it actually says:

    To specify a rule which IS case SENSITIVE,
    specify the characters individually.

    For example:
        rulename    =  %d97 %d98 %d99
    or
        rulename    =  %d97.98.99

Paul was clear that HEXDIG allows lowercase.

Because it says "individually". And because, in context, the example makes
it clear what is meant - the previous example used quoted strings.

And if "a" was case-sensitive, the example in 3.1 would not have been
written the way it was.

Because, strangely enough, those are not letters.

No. %x41-46 is equivalent to %x41 / %x42 / %x43 / %x44 / %x45 / %x46.

Very simply, it says:

    ABNF strings are case-insensitive

It does not say:

    ABNF strings longer than one character are case-insensitive
