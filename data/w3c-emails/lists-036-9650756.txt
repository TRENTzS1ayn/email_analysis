You have now expressed this opinion on many occasions dating back quite 
a few months.  I remain unconvinced.  Yes, the main utility of 
namespaces has been to sneak URIs into element/attribute names to 
support dispatching and collision avoidance.  But if we choose to say 
that the URIs thus used do actually identify resources, and provide 
representations of them, this breaks nothing and is actually useful in 
the real world.  So why not?
