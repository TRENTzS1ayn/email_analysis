I concur with Paul's interpretation.  The intent of the ABNF spec is that 
anything enclosed in double-quotes is case-insensitive.

Note that there is no such thing as a reference implementation of ABNF, only 
the ABNF specification is normative.

The ABNF validator referenced by <http://www.ietf.org/ID-nits.html> is 
available at http://www.apps.ietf.org/abnf.html and it does permit lower-case 
hex.
