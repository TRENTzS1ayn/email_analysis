The rationale for that is noted in the list of changes
at the bottom of the spec.

    The ABNF of hier-part and relative-URI (Section 3) has been corrected
    to allow a relative URI path to be empty.  This also allows an
    absolute-URI to consist of nothing after the "scheme:", as is present
    in practice with the "DAV:" namespace [RFC2518] and the "about:" URI
    used by many browser implementations.
