Just for the record, this is nonsense as stated.  One wouldn't expect 
that two different interpretations would be compatible.  What I think 
Patrick meant is that incompatible ASSERTIONS are what harm the SW. 
That is debateable, but at least it makes sense.

Yes, but...

1.  There isn't any clear notion defined anywhere (AFAIK) of what is 
'the ... associated web content' of a URI. (What is the associated 
Web content of, say, rdfs:Class ?) This is precisely the ball that 
has been dropped between the SW community and the URI community. Each 
thinks that it is the other's problem.
2.  owl:import doesn't have any well-defined nontrivial semantics (yet).
3.  There is no such thing as a self-contradicting RDF graph.

So while I agree that this picture has a nice intuitive feel to it, a 
lot of work needs doing before we can make it coherent.
