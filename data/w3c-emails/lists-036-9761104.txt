Can we view this association as like sensing the physical universe? 

Or, on the server side, as affecting the physical universe?

What more (less-trivial) do people want than what the OWL docs say?

I continue to follow the practice of assuming the semantics of an RDF
graph are the semantics not just of RDF but of RDF in combination with
the semantics of all the terms used in the RDF graph.  Which, IMO, is
the only approach that makes sense in practice.  And brings us back to
my point above.    When I send you a message, the full meaning of my
message depends on the full meaning of all my words; if you don't know
all those words, then you'll miss some of my meaning.   

It's clear to me how that works for web-connected machines if the
semantics of each term are communicated via an axiomatization
available on the web [perhaps using LBase] at the appropriate address;
it's less clear to me how to do this with model theory, or in general
when you can't say what you want in an axiomatization in some standard
language.  But I strongly suspect using a normative rdfs:Comment is
actually sufficient; if you can read the language, you can infer more.

It's good to have work to do.  :-)
