Yes, yes. Of course. If they in fact do not agree about the objects
they are talking about then there is a total breakdown in communication.

And that's the *POINT* here.

And again, I'm not saying and have never said (and have re-re-re-reiterated
this several times) that folks *can't* do anything. Only that they *shouldn't*
and that if there is no evidence to the contrary one should *presume* that they
haven't.

Please re-read this a few times because you keep missing it every time I say it.

Sigh. I say "should", you read "must". I say "harmful", you read "fatal".

I give up. I'm going to stop spending time trying to speak a foreign
language and go write code that does something useful...
