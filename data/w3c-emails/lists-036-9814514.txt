Howdy folks,

I'm happy to announce the release of the first public version of URIQA, the 
Nokia URI Query Agent, which is an example implementation of the URIQA model 
for semantic web enabled servers.

http://sw.nokia.com/URIQA.html

URIQA is a model for knowledge discovery, both from authoritative sources 
as well as from arbitrary third party sources. It introduces an extension 
to the present web architecture used to indicate to a web server that it 
should resolve the specified URI in terms of knowledge about the resource 
denoted by that URI rather than in terms of a representation of the 
resource in question. 

You can see URIQA in action on the Nokia Semantic Web Server:

http://sw.nokia.com

The impatient can dive right into the server via any of the following:

http://sw.nokia.com/URIQA?uri=http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema%23Resource
http://sw.nokia.com/URIQA?uri=http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns%23Property
http://sw.nokia.com/URIQA?uri=http://forum.nokia.com/product/terminal/N7250r100

For more examples: http://sw.nokia.com/examples.html

My hope and vision is that the concepts and techniques embodied in the URIQA 
model will be widely adopted by the SW community and will provide a consistent
means by which SW agents will be able to obtain knowledge about resources
from disparate sources.

Anyway, for what it's worth, there it is...  ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
