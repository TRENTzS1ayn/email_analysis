The answers to all your questions are system- and even library-dependent,
as file: explicitly depends on the conventions of the local system
(except for using / as the hierarchical separator).  Most systems ignore
the host field, but the old libwww treated a host field other than
localhost as meaning "use FTP instead".  UNC support is certainly
possible; whether anyone does it is another question.
