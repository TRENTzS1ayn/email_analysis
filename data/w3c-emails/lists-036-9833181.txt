Argh. Right. Thanks. I had been giving an offline demo and forgot
to switch it back ;-)

Fixed.

Cheers,

Patrick

For more examples: http://sw.nokia.com/examples.html

My hope and vision is that the concepts and techniques embodied in the
URIQA 
model will be widely adopted by the SW community and will provide a
consistent means by which SW agents will be able to obtain knowledge
about resources from disparate sources.

Anyway, for what it's worth, there it is...  ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
