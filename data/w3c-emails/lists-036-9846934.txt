I'm asking since I'm writing an application note on file URL for JDF (see
www.cip4.org).

So it is not a matter of existing implementations , but how to instruct
developers to follow file URL RFC rules and produce correct file: URLs
within XML job ticket for the graphic arts / printing industry.

I think my questions are still relevant.
If everything is system / library dependent so why RFC 1738, 2396 doesn't
say any word about it ?

Regards Israel
