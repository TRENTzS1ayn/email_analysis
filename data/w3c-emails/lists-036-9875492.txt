Exactly.

I agree, and if you look at the URIQA demo, you'll see that each
description is given its own distinct URI.

The reason why it is imperative that one be able to get a description
based only on the URI denoting the resource you wish described is
that usually, that's all you have -- and while it would be possible
to first do a HEAD request and hope to get a URI denoting a description,
and then do a GET on the description URI, that is very inefficient
and unneccesary, since one can simply specify in the first GET request
that one would like a description of the resource rather than (some
other form of) a representation.

That's why URIQA also supports direct querying of arbitrary
URIs via its servlet interface.

Er. Perhaps you should read the information provided by
http://sw.nokia.com/URIQA.html as that's precisely what it does.

The reason why the header approach is needed is that one cannot
know, given only a URI, what arbitrary web services might exist
that can provide descriptions of the resource -- and what the
URIQA model defines is a means by which a SW agent can obtain
an authoritative description from the web authority (if any)
component of the URI itself. I.e. the same web authority that
provides representations can be queried for a concise bounded
description.

It may very well be that there are other servers which can
provide third-party knowledge about a given resource, and
URIQA provides for that at well, but the header is intended
for interaction with the web authority of the URI itself.

I consider URIQA to provide the basis for such web services and
to define the nature of the function you suggest.
