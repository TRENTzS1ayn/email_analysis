I have just submitted draft 02, which can also be obtained via
the issues list at

    http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html

Please note that all issues have been fixed or closed, with the
single exception that 032-component-examples is still waiting
for some examples that might improve the current description.

This would be a good time to review the specification.


Cheers,
