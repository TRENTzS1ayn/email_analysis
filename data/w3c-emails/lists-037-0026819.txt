Overall, I have to agree with Roy, who makes the most detailled
and consistent argument, and is most familliar with the questions
and comments that readers of the document make.

With respect to Joshua's comment below, I'd like to point out that
a large number of languages has a mechanism to distinguish between
things that have been named/described, and things that haven't been
named/described. It's the distinction between the definite and the
indefinite article. For example: "I went to the store and bought
*an* ice cream, and then I went to the beach and ate *the* ice
cream." Of course, the context for this distinction is usually
much smaller than the global one assumed in the URI spec.
And while many languages have such a distinction, many others
don't.

Regards,    Martin.
