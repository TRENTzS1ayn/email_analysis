It works for me. I feel like we're treading off into philosophical
territory here; I keep trying to figure out what practical impact this
has on the systems we build.

Dan (Brickley) said earlier in this thread that he felt the concept of
resource was un-interesting if it depended on having been named or
described. I'm not sure what's interesting (or useful) about the term
resource if everything that is or can be imagined is a resource.

I have something else in mind now, not the virus on the barley. I
haven't named or described it yet so it's utterly useless to you. What
value does it add to the architecture document to call it a resource?

If you feel that this email message names or describes the other thing
I have in mind now, and therefore it is a resource, I'll concede the
point. But there are other things that I have thought or seen or done
that you don't know about and they aren't resources, except as the
"set of things norm has thought or seen or done that you don't know
about" which may now also be a resource by virtue of this message.

But individually, those things don't exist in the web architecture and
they won't until someone puts them there. And the way someone does
that is by giving them (directly or indirectly) URIs. I'm content to say
that they become resources at that point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
