Good.

Yes.

Rather, let me give you a Yankee answer.  The question that
should determine this is "Do you need the restricted term
to say clearly anything that you need to say in this document?"
I first answered 'yes' to the broader sense for 'resource' because
I don't think that anything in the general public form or generic processing of
URIs as specified in this document requires that the term 'resource'
be limited to "things for which a URI has been coined to identify them."

I would  suggest rather that we use

"a resource" -- to refer to anything anyone might wish to coin a URI for
(for which simply 'anything' is a serviceable plain-english short form)

and when we want to be more narrow, use the definite article as in:

"the resource identified by a URI"

or

"the resources that have URIs"

So the dispositive argument is that the restriction is not required
by the specification and should not be asserted or implied.

Yes, this gets to the heart of the matter. The resource-ness
generally (but not always) pre-exists; hence this quality is referred
to simply in the present tense, not in a clause expressing a
potentiality.

Because this paragraph is non-restrictive, and heuristic in nature, it
is best that our diction be guided by the preponderance of cases
and not strain to be definitive.

The specification does not (as I believe Roy said) in any way
restrict what a URI may refer or identify. Limiting the use of the
term 'resource' in the specification to those things that have a URI
is a gratuitous constraint, it introduces a Term of Art where none is
required and thus loses on the grounds of Occam's Razor. This is
Norm's answer: it introduces a digressive and non-contributory
restriction that diverts the reader's attention from the business at
hand.

The general-English sense of 'resource' is "something of potential
utility."  While sometimes it is the distinction itself between the URI
and other URIs that is of value without benefit of a valuable referent,
still the more common case is that there is somethign that already
posessed potential utility, and assigning it a URI  enhances
but does not create the utility. So most often the thing is a resource
both before and after someone coins a URI to refer to it. It makes it
something of more ready utility, but does not change it into the
class of things of potential utility.  Except in the case of opaque
correlation keys.  That's a valid, but not the general, case of where
the utility comes from.

Actually, it is more to the point to change the opening sentence in
the display-list where the intended sense of 'resource' is discussed.
Note I do not say 'defined,' as this is not a definition, the
*specification* contained in this document does not in any way depend
on restricting the nature of the 'thing' 'identified' by the URI. We
just need to make the non-restriction more clear.

Where it now says

<quote cite=
"">
    Resource
       Anything that has been named or described can be a resource.
</quote>

It is true that this language does not restrict what may be regarded
as a 'resource' in any way. The problem is that a casual reader may
think it does.

So don't use language that talks about what may or may not be a resource.
There's no 'there' there.

Use language that clearly leaves wide open what may have a URI coined
to refer to it.

<draft>

Resource
<hangingIndent>
A URI may be coined to identify anything for which the coiner feels
it would be of benefit to have a URI to retain or communicate. There
is no restriction in or by this specification on what the 'resource'
identified by a URI may be.

The value added by coining this URI may lie in the latent and
intrinsic potential utility of the 'resource' so identified, or
in the distinction between the thing identified and other things.

</hangingIndent>
</draft>

With best regards,
