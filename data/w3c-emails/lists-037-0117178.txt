I do *not* support the change away from "has been."  There is too much 
room for argument without practical import as to what might or might 
not be a resource, but on the other hand if it already has been named 
or described, there's not doubt at all that it could be a resource.

BTW, Larry's wording does a much better job of describing how I think 
about resources and how I describe them to people than the existing 
draft wording.  Not that I think that the current wording is wrong or 
that they are inconsistent; I just think Larry's is clearer and 
friendlier and less likely to cause people to wrinkle their foreheads 
and think "WTF?" -Tim
