Yes.  The first is hypertext architecture; the second is semantic web 
architecture.  They are different.

A warning: read the diagram carefully: it is not a venn diagram of 
resources, but of URIs.
Sets -- subset of URIs -- are labeled in roman text, or typewriter text 
with syntactic constraints such as URI scheme.  Then, some regions in 
the diagram are annotated in italic with some examples of the things 
which can be *identified by* those URIs.   It is rather squeezed.  
"Anchor" should be in italics.

Yes.

Actually the arrows show in URI space the mapping from a set of URIs 
without a hash to the set of URIs with hashes, specifically the mapping 
in which corresponds to appending a hash and something.  The syntactic 
relationship between the URIs is the same.  However, for hypertext and 
the semantic web architecture, the

No one is calling the arrow "+#localiD" "Identification".  
Identification is the relation between the URIs mapped in the venn 
diagram and things they are deemed to identify (as annotated from time 
to time in italics).

Yes indeed.

The editor has instructions to do the edit so we can see what it looks 
like.
