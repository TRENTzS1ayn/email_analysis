Well, its actually SWeb semantics. Im not sure that semantics and 
architecture are the same kind of thing.

Ah. Ok, then my point is better stated thus: there are two different 
senses of 'identify' being used here. The sense in which an XHTML 
URI+localId "identifies" an anchor is not the same as that in which 
an RDF URI+localId "identifies" whatever it denotes.  One single 
URI+localID could identify an anchor in one sense and also refer to 
something completely different in the second (SWeb) sense.  The two 
relationships of 'identification' have nothing particular to do with 
one another, a priori.  Now, y'all might want to say as a matter of 
Web architecture that they *should* have something to do with one 
another, for example that they should be the same. This position has 
its merits, I agree, but (1) it would be a lot clearer if it were 
said explicitly, rather than just implied by what reads like a 
conceptual confusion; and (2) I'd like to see a case made out for it, 
as I can see some neat alternatives. For example, we could use the 
anchoring to locate a critical piece of representation which was 
intended by the owner of the URI to be definitive in identifying the 
referent (for example, a name, or a reference number, or a 
descriptive piece of text, ("the woman in a white dress who left her 
slipper at the Ball") which could be anchored and suitably labelled 
with an XML property). This might provide a semantically sound basis 
for connecting RDF markup with hypertext, for example.

BTW, aren't anchors GETable?  That is, shouldn't the pale blue area 
project down on the LHS to the bottom of the diagram?

OK.

:-) Sorry if I got a little yellish there.

Ah, I see that point now, sorry.  The fundamentally different aspect 
is the relationship of the surrounding border to "anchor" and 
"anything", I guess: different kinds of example.

I wish you had finished that thought. I'd like to read the rest of

Yes, got that now. I had thought that the long horizontal division 
was a split between syntax (above) and referent/resource (below). But 
my point still stands, even if it needs to be re-stated with 
reference to the diagram.

Ok, great.
