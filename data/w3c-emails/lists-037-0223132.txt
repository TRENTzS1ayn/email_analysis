Works for me.

That's the only part I can't live with; I believe that any constraint on
what a particular URI identifies is a result of interactions with the
URI only.  And while, in practice, that's often related to the scheme,
it's not mandated that it be so.  But it seems to me that removing that
part wouldn't change your message substantially.  Any objections?

Ok.  Here's a little friendly amendment;

"Commonly, URIs are used to identify Internet accessible objects or
services; for example, an electronic document, an image, a service
providing today's weather report for Los Angeles, a collection ..."

It flattens the nested example (i.e. "e.g." within the "for example"),
and also makes it clearer, IMO, that the example is the service, not the
abstract concept of today's weather report for L.A.
