Are you saying that you think the scheme definition *doesn't*
define the range of things identified by URIs using that scheme?
I'm wondering why you think we have different URI schemes, if the
resource-identifier to resource-identified mapping isn't defined by
the scheme.

Anyone is free, in a Humpty-Dumpty way, to use any term to mean whatever
they want it to mean, but at least in this document, I think we are in
a position to explain how URIs are expected to work. And I don't see
anything
wrong with the expectation set up that the scheme definition has a
central role.

It leaves out some interesting and useful information.
Maybe you could explain something that is harmed
by the assertion in question?

vs.

> providing today's weather report for Los Angeles, a collection ...

FWIW, that part of the sentence was left from the previous text.

The problem is that the examples, when flattened, aren't really parallel; 
'an electronic document' is a general category like 'a service',
while 'today's weather report for Los Angeles' is a very specific
service, which, to be parallel, might need 'an electronic document
such as a news article in the New York Times'.

So while I agree that the original you're correcting is awkward,
I'm not happy with the amendment. Frankly, I'd just as soon leave it.
