Just as a heads-up, I don't think these are difficult problems at 
all, and that y'all are making things difficult by trying to avoid 
these imaginary problems.  It would all be much simpler if you just 
used words with their normal meanings. The actual situation is 
perfectly clear: URIs have been traditionally used as identifiers, 
but now with the Sem Web they are also being used to denote more 
generally. The exact relationship between these two kinds of usage is 
not entirely clear yet (which is fine, of course).

This is moving beyond my area of competence, but could you just 
weaken the wording a little, eg "a URI scheme may define" or some 
such?

The NEW is better than the OLD, just on expository grounds, but it 
has the same old problem built into it, in the form of the ambiguity 
about what "identifies" means.  The text changes the meaning in its 
last sentence (I think). Also it seems to imply that something is a 
resource only when its identified by a URI, which has got to be wrong.

Suggested changes to fix these:

-----
The word 'resource' is used as a general term, meaning anything that 
can in principle be identified or denoted by a Uniform Resource 
Identifier; ...

... However, a resource need not be accessible via the Internet; URIs 
might be used to denote human beings, corporations, bound books in a 
library, and even abstract concepts.
-----

OR, slightly better:

-----

The word 'resource' is used as a general term, meaning anything that 
can in principle be identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier; each 
URI scheme defines the range of things that are identified by URIs 
using that scheme. Commonly, URIs are used to identify Internet 
accessible objects or services; for example, an electronic document, 
an image, a service (e.g., "today's weather report for  Los 
Angeles"), a collection of other resources. However, URIs might be 
used to denote entities which are not accessible via the Internet, 
such as human beings, corporations, bound books in a library, and 
even abstract concepts. Some URI schemes are naming schemes which 
identify the things they denote, so that the scope of what counts as 
a 'resource' is limited only by the availability of URI naming 
schemes.

------

Obviously the 'new' wording here at the end is only a suggestion, but 
something like this would serve to explain why the scope of 
"resource" is so open-ended and also, by distinguishing denotation 
from identification (while allowing them to coincide in some cases, 
eg URNs) provides a way to be more precise in architecture/Sweb 
descriptions (eg there can be denotations which do not work through 
identifiers.)

This second version allows the notion of "resource" to be somewhat 
restricted compared to the entire universe of discourse: it really 
does refer to things that can be IDENTIFIED rather than merely 
referred to. This seems to go along with much of what is said about 
URIs and resources in other parts of the document.

However, a substantive question, not about wordsmithing. Do y'all 
want to say that anything that can be *described* using URIs should 
count as a resource? Because that is a larger category than things 
that can be *identified* by a URI scheme.  This point has been made 
in email by others, but it bears repeating. Some URIs (the RDF/OWL 
vocabulary) now have official meanings (lets suppose that those 
meanings are resources) which allow one to write expressions which 
unambiguously refer to things that may not have any URI identifying 
them, and in fact may not even be the kind of things that any URI 
scheme currently in existence would be empowered to identify.  Since 
the process of writing OWL ontologies is so much easier and faster 
than the process of registering new naming schemes, this is likely to 
always be true. So you might want to say that the real definition of 
"resource" ought to be anything that can be uniquely *described* 
using URIs. Then just being directly identified by a URI is like the 
ground case of a potentially very large recursion.

On the other hand, to return to wordsmithing, you might want to 
deliberately NOT say this, because this would require major changes 
to other parts of the document.
