Just a minor suggestion... I realize it's just an example, but since
private TCP/IP based networks / intranets commonly employ URIs but are
not always considered "the Internet", I would prefer to say
  "objects or services accessible via a network such as the Internet"
rather than
  "Internet accessible objects or services",
and would say
  "not accessible via a network"
rather than
  "not accessible via the Internet".
