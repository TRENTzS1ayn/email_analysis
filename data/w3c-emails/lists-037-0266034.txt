Well, more like "shouldn't" than "doesn't", since some scheme
registrations clearly do restrict the range.  But yes.

I believe we have different URI schemes because we have different
information spaces, and a URI needs a means to indicate which
information space its information comes from.   But IMO, that's
orthogonal to the type of resource that the information represents.

It suggests that a proliferation of URI schemes is desirable, because
there are obviously an unbounded number of types of resource that can
be identified.  I consider that harmful due to the large cost of
deploying new URI schemes, i.e. that until a new scheme is well
deployed, possibly useful information is unavailable to many (like
those darned itms:// Apple URIs I keep clicking on).

Ok, no biggie.
