Hi:

I thought there were two actually terms in use: 'internet' and 'Internet'. 
An 'internet' is any telecom system of interconnected networks (e.g. an 
intranet). The 'Internet' is just one particular instance of a rather public 
'internet' - pretty big one, mind. But just one instance, nevertheless.

In same way, there are multiple webs out there. One just tends to have this 
capital 'W'.

Tony
