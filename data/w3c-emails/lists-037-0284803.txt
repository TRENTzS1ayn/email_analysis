Neither "urn" nor "tdb" define the range of things identified by URIs
using that scheme.  Most schemes only define how names are assigned,
not what they are assigned to.

The mapping is defined by the scheme, but that doesn't imply the
range has been assigned a singular type by that scheme.  Perhaps you
meant something else by your suggested wording, but that is how
it reads.
