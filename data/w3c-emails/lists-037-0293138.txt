Roy must be burying his head in his hands now. The level pedantry we
all demonstrate must be staggering :)

So, you are suggesting leaving the new text as-is, and just lowercasing the 
"I" in "Internet"? I wouldn't do that.

There being a difference between 'an internet' and 'the Internet' I can 
appreciate even without any cited references because I'm a big nerdy geek, but 
this is a pending _Internet_ Engineering Task Force _Internet_-Draft we're 
talking about improving, here. Almost everyone reading the spec would not 
think to interpret "internet-accessible objects" any differently than 
"Internet-accessible objects".

You also seem to assert that an intranet is a type of internet. The inter- and 
intra- prefixes are typically used in a mutually exclusive fashion; the the 
latter can't be a subclass of the former.
