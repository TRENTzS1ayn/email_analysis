Many thanks for the pointer. It helped me add an IANA section to
the IRI draft at the last moment. I'm not sure why you would need
an update to RFC 2717 and RFC 2718. Wouldn't it simply be enough
to say, in your IANA section, that the relevant references to
RFC 2396 in RFC 2717 and RFC 2718 should be replaced by RFC
2396bis? I have copied Ted Hardie, maybe he can help here?

Regards,    Martin.
