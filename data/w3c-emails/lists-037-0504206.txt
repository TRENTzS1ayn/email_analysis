XML Schema Becomes a W3C Recommendation

   2 May 2001: The World Wide Web Consortium today released XML Schema
   as a W3C Recommendation in three parts: Part 0: Primer, Part 1:
   Structures, Part 2: Datatypes. The specification is stable and has
   been reviewed by the W3C Membership, who favors its adoption by
   academic, industry, and research communities. XML Schemas define
   shared markup vocabularies, the structure of XML documents which use
   those vocabularies, and provide hooks to associate semantics with
   them. Read the press release and testimonials.
