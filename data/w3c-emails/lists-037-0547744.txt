XHTML 1.1 and Ruby Annotation Become W3C Recommendations

   31 May 2001: The World Wide Web Consortium released XHTML 1.1 -
   Module-based XHTML and Ruby Annotation as W3C Recommendations. The
   specifications are stable, and have been reviewed by the W3C
   Membership, who favor their adoption by industry. XHTML 1.1 is a
   reformulation of XHTML 1.0 Strict based on XHTML modules, including
   the ruby module. Ruby is a short run of text alongside base text
   typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or
   annotation. Read the press release and testimonials.
