SMIL 2.0 Becomes a W3C Proposed Recommendation

   5 June 2001: W3C is pleased to announce the advancement of the
   Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 2.0) to Proposed
   Recommendation. SMIL (pronounced "smile") 2.0 defines an XML-based
   language that authors can use to write interactive multimedia
   presentations. It allows reuse of SMIL syntax and semantics in other
   XML-based languages. Comments are welcome through 5 July. Read the
   implementation report and more about the W3C Synchronized Multimedia
   Activity.
