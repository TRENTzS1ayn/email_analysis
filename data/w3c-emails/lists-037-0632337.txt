XML Fragment Interchange Becomes a W3C Candidate Recommendation

   12 February 2001: W3C is pleased to announce the advancement of XML
   Fragment Interchange to Candidate Recommendation. The specification
   allows exchange of XML fragments from volumes or chapters down to
   paragraphs, tables or footnotes, without having to manage each as a
   separate entity, or risking incorrect parsing due to loss of context.
   Comments are invited through the end of April 2001. Read about the
   XML Activity.

W3C Launches Semantic Web Activity

   9 February 2001: W3C is pleased to announce the launch of the
   Semantic Web Activity. The Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of data
   on the Web defined and linked in a way that it can be used by
   machines for automation, integration and reuse. The Web can reach its
   full potential only if it becomes a place where data can be shared
   and processed by automated tools as well as by people. Learn more in
   the Semantic Web Activity statement.
