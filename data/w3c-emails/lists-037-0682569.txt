Annotea Project Launches Home Page

   9 March 2001: The product of collaboration at W3C, the Annotea project
   now has a home page. Annotations are external remarks attached to any
   Web document. When the user gets the document he can load the
   annotations and see what his peer group thinks. The first client
   implementation of Annotea is W3C's Amaya browser and authoring tool.
   See a quick tutorial for annotations to get you started. This project
   is part of the W3C Semantic Web Activity Advanced Development work to
   develop and deploy RDF infrastructure.
