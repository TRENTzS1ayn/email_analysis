In Memoriam: Michael Dertouzos

   30 August 2001: Professor Michael L. Dertouzos, director of the MIT
   Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) since 1974, died on 27 August
   2001, in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Born in Athens, Greece, author
   of eight books, and widely admired for bringing his humanity to
   computing, Dertouzos was 64. Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director, credits
   Prof. Dertouzos with the W3C's existence, and has written a personal
   tribute. In his last interview on 22 August 2001, Dertouzos said,
   "Don't forget the impact that love has on education." His impact is
   difficult to overestimate. He is already sorely missed.
