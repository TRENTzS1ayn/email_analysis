The draft WEBDAV protocol extensions specification is now available as an
Internet-Draft.  This is essentially the same draft that was examined at
the Irvine meeting, with the addition of an abstract, table of contents,
author contact information, and minor formatting changes.

Del Jensen, the document editor, worked very hard in preparing this draft
-- thank you Del!
