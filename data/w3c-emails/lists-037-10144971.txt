I have no idea.  Stuff from the mailing list always gets routed to me
through w3c-dist-auth-request as well.

I favor headers, and don't have a strong feeling about where they should be
defined.

I do think such a section is extremely useful.  I've been looking through
attribute-related specs the past few days, and I've been very grateful to
authors who say on the first page what problems they are trying to address,
so that I don't have to read the rest of the spec if their problem set is
different from mine.

You did a huge amount of work, and I'm sure no one faults you for not having
a polished, watertight spec in time for the Irvine meeting.  Thanks for all
you've done!
