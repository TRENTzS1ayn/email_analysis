Here are a few other questions I had about hierarchical collections:

It should be possible to search a hierarchical collection based on attribute
values.  We might not want to provide methods for performing searches, but
we need to know that such searches are feasible.

Can members of a collection be ordered (so that collections can be used to
implement compound documents)? 

Can many people add objects to a collection and remove objects from a
collection at once?
