Here are some more versioning questions that we discussed informally during
the break at the Irvine meeting:

1.  Does the versioning model allow a given resource to belong to multiple
version trees?

2.  It needs to be possible to navigate from each version to its
predecessor.  It also needs to be possible to find out for any resource
which version tree(s) it belongs to. 

3. There needs to be some mechanism for guaranteeing that the person who is
checking something in is the same one who checked it out.
