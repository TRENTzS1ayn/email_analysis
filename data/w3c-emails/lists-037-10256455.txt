1. Yes. This issue will be further explored in the context of
distributed versioning, even though it occurs on centralized versioning
systems.
2. These links all are defined in the specification, though I think
predecessor got dropped on the editing floor. The NextVersion gives the
successor relationship and TreeHandle provides the versioning tree
identifier.
3. That is authentication and is orthogonal to this specification.
