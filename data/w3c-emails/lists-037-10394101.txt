OK

Just to double-check:  In the spec, a versioned resource does NOT have a
link to the TreeHandle.  Is this an oversight?

Well, this is an area that I don't understand very well, but . . . I don't
think what I am talking about is authentication really.  It's not that I'm
trying to masquerade as somebody else.  It's just that I'm trying to check
in a resource that I never checked out, or that somebody else checked out.
Whatever lock tokens do for you in the context of locking, that's what I'm
looking for here.  If you need lock tokens, why don't you need checkout
tokens?  If you don't need checkout tokens, why do you need lock tokens?
