Searching is one part of metadata (and one of the ones I'm interested
in)
but there are so many other applications that all depend on the metadata
being there. We have to get the metadata creation as close to the actual
resource origination point as possible in order to get good data in 
the system. This is why I think we have to make sure we get it right.

The Warwick Framework would be my suggestion as well. Now whether or not
that Warwick collection is bound to the resource(s) by a link or by
some other method ( a META method? ) is argueable. I don't think the
metadata should be part of the resource since metadata can change 
without the resource changing. 

Anyway, I just wanted to re-iterate what Judith said since WEBDAV
has the greatest opportunity to actually do metadata correctly...
