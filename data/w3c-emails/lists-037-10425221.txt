What is the rationale for wanting this capability?  What user scenario does
this support? I'm starting to think this might be a design decision
(especially if you require version identifier information embedded in a
URL), not a true requirement.

Same issue.  What capability are we really trying to support?  Is the idea
to provide the user a way to figure out from the name what version they're
working with?  Or is the consumer of this information software?

Also, I fear that any URL decoration scheme will have an assumption of a
non-replicated version store behind it.

I'm also interested in how you propose to keep URL's opaque, yet still
embed semantic information (in this case, a version identifier) in them.
