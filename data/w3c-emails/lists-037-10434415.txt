Well, no, actually... All the people who just do versioning thought that
some URI-based scheme was the most sensible. The W3C position, strongly
articulated by Dan Connolly, was that any interpretation of URLs was not
acceptable.

Without arguing the merits of that approach (I disagree that is it a useful
restriction in this case), we said "a method" in order to allow the group
to decide whether "URL-hacking" or new HTTP methods were the best
implementation. So the function is required. The obvious implementation in
terms of URLs can come up for discussion again. The early archives of the
versioning discussion have a great deal of discussion of this point.

As above, "URL-hacking" was a controversial approach that some were not
willing to accept. The functionality is crucial, but if URLs cannot be
interpreted new HTTP methods are needed, and a round-trip is required for
certain obvious operations.

I will add that VTML also contains facilities to send multiple versions of
a document in a single reasonably organized package. This is essentially a
simplification/generalization for general stream of the kind of information
kept in a version repository.
