On the subject of query, I do not believe that the LinkSearch method
provides any support for searching for documents based on attribute values,
which is what this requirement is about.

It looks to me as though LinkSearch lets you search for attributes based on
the properties of links.  So you can use it to find out whether a given
resource has an author attribute, or to locate the author attribute of a
given resource.

But you cannot use LinkSearch to formulate a query like, find me all the
resources with author = "Shakespeare".

(On the broader issue of whether the requirements should be altered in light
of the spec, I absolutely agree with you that in an ideal world this should
never happen.  But in reality, it often does.  And sometimes rightly so.  We
sometimes get a better understanding of a problem area as we work the
details, and realize that the requirements were mistaken.  I think this is
certainly happening in some areas of WebDAV.)
