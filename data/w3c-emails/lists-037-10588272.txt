The requirements MUST NOT tell the implementation authors how to do
their job. This requirement spec oversteps its bounds when it moves away
from stating goals to dictating implementation, as it does in section
4.9.2.*. If the authors of the requirements spec do not like the current
implementation they are free to comment on the mailing list. They should
not, however, use the requirements document as a backdoor to put in
their preferred implementations.
