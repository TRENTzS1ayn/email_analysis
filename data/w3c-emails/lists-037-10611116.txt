It should not be possible to tell if a URL represents a versioned
resource - Sign me up w/Connolly et all on this point.

VTML - VTML is cool but given that no versioning system currently
requires that sort of transfer functionality I have to wonder as to its
utility. Still, we do need a mechanism to do partial writes. This is
something to be considered as part of the implementation, not the
requirements.
