I think I mentioned at the last meeting there was work
on a generic Internet transaction protocol.

 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories.                                                              

       Title     : Transaction Internet Protocol                           
       Author(s) : J. Lyon, K. Evans, J. Klein
       Filename  : draft-lyon-itp-nodes-01.txt
       Pages     : 17
       Date      : 02/10/1997

In many applications where different nodes cooperate on some work, there is
a need to guarantee that the work happens atomically. That is, each node 
must reach the same conclusion as to whether the work is to be completed, 
even in the face of failures.  This document proposes a simple, 
easily-implemented protocol for achieving this end.                        

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-lyon-itp-nodes-01.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-lyon-itp-nodes-01.txt
 
Internet-Drafts directories are located at:
                                                
     o  Africa:  ftp.is.co.za                    
                                                
     o  Europe:  ftp.nordu.net            
                 ftp.nis.garr.it

     o  US East Coast: ds.internic.net

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-lyon-itp-nodes-01.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
