The requirements are inconsistent with the current specification on
many
points, and these need to be resolved.  In addition, the requirements
document takes positions on many issues that have turned out to be
controversial.  The group needs to come to some consensus on these
issues.

The current specification is irrelevant to the requirements. The
requirements state what the goals are, we will figure out how to get
there later. Though I do agree that there needs to be some very serious
consensus seeking, especially on the issue of versioning.

1.  Attributes.  The current specification says almost nothing
explicitly
about attributes, although it is possible to deduce a lot about how
attributes would be manipulated from the discussion of links.  I
believe
that all the requirements about attributes are satisfied except one:
"Via
HTTP, it should be possible to ... query ... arbitrary attributes ..."
We
need to decide whether we want to define a query syntax.  If not, we
need to
decide whether we want to support a weaker requirement, for example
that the
model of attributes we define should be capable of supporting some
query
mechanism.

A good requirements spec should only say that it must be possible to
query attributes, not how to do it. BTW, the current draft does include
attribute querying, please review the LinkSearch method.

As for the rest of your points, I believe I have addressed all of them
in my response to the requirements draft.
