I'd like to see more discussion of whether we are extending HTTP, and if so
what that means.  Both the charter and the requirements describe what we are
doing as extending HTTP.  Maybe they should be changed to say something
broader, like "make extended authoring capabilities available on the Web" or
"on the Internet".  Or maybe we can be precise enough about what it is to
extend HTTP that it becomes a clear design guideline.
