Despite the creditionals of the organizations who employ the authors
of "Web Collections", and the fact that SoftQuad, the W3C, IBM, Apple,
and Microsoft are all reputable organizations, the quality of the
previous "Web Collections" spec doesn't fill me with cheerful 
anticipation that the next version is our best hope for a
"uniform frame work for meta data"[sic].

Of course, we can judge this when we ourselves can see the
"completely re-written" specification. (If you completely
rewrite a spec, is it the same spec?)

But most of the problems with the previous spec were not in the
writing of it but in the actual protocol element it described.

Larry
