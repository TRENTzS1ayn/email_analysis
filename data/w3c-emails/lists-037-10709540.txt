I like this a lot!

A couple of comments:

Postcondition 3 on COPY seems weak to me.  I would expect something more
like "Independence: A modification to the resource at the dest-URI must not
cause any modification to the resource at the source-URI, and vice-versa."
Is there a reason for stopping short of this?

Now that we've introduced metadata into the picture, we also need to take a
look at DELETE.  It will need some similar extensions to deal with metadata.

Since we are making it possible for metadata to be shared by multiple
resources, the server may find that it cannot comply with a user's request
to move metadata.  Should the server in that case refuse to do the move at
all, or do it but not move the metadata, do it and fix up the links to the
mdetadata?

I'm still pretty confused about what should happen for version trees and
collections.
