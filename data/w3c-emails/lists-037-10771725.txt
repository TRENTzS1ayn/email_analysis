Thank you Yaron for taking the time to review the requirements so thoroughly!

Since this particular requirement has been in the distributed authoring
requirements document from the very beginning, I'd say that Judith
shouldn't have to provide justification for the received view.

However, being the one responsible for drafting this requirement initially,
I can't really recall the initial justification for this.  I scoured the
archives to see if I could pin this one on you, but the best I could come
up with was a message in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/msg00207.html

Where you clarified that the principal asking for a lock should be able to
specify whether it was single or multi-person. :-) I guess I'll have to
take full responsibility for this one... :-(

That said, early on we were thinking about having shared locks, and this
requirement would justify having a mechanism for specifying who shared the
lock.  However, I think we correctly realized during the design team
meetings that a shared exclusive write lock is really just a limited form
of advisory lock, and the group seems to have decided not to provide
facilities for advisory locks.

This isn't necessary, since just about every requirement in the document
has this caveat.  I am in favor of adding some requirements about
interoperability with existing authentication and security protocols.  The
locking section might include some text on the need for authentication
(otherwise the lock devolves to an advisory lock).

Yeah, but let's use the term "principal" (recommended by Dan Connolly, I
believe) instead of the overloaded term "entity."  I'm also in favor of
removing the access rights clause (for similar reasons to above).

The source link was dropped on the cutting room floor during final edits on
the document.  I fully expect it to return in the next draft.

Also, I've been toying with the idea of restricting the source link to only
those cases where the servecr can maintain the source link automatically.
So, this would apply to CGI and SSI, but not to the relationship between an
executable program and its source (since the server has no control over
that relationship).  This handles "the source link concept is too simple to
account for case X" arguments by restricting them from consideration.

Would someone like to specify how this should be done?

Well, since the specification of a hierarchical collection didn't make it
into the draft, Judith is technically correct.  Another cutting room error.
However, resolving this one is tied up in the use of Web Collections,
which still do seem to have some value for specifying the syntax of
Hierarchical Collections.
