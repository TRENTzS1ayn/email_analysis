I don't even think the requirements document needs to state that "we
must use
HTTP as our base", either.

The requirements document is not the only constraint on the group's
output,
of course.

I think it would be a viable option to define a DAV protocol that didn't
use HTTP at all.

Well, there's a fundamental choice, really, that isn't to be made 
case-by-case, which is "are we layering a completely new distributed
object protocol on top of HTTP". If you're going to do that a little,
you might as well do it all the way. If you're not, then you shouldn't
do it in little parts.

This isn't a matter of killing original ideas, it's one of coming up
with
a spec that's self-consistent.

I don't think "self-consistency" needs to be in the requirements
document,
even though it's a requirement.
