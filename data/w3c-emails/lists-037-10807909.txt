There is an article on the Warwick Framework in DLIB at:
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/dlib/dlib/july96/lagoze/07lagoze.html

There is a (very slightly) more detailed architecture paper at: 
http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu:80/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/ncstrl.cornell%2fTR96-
1593?abstract=lagoze

There is a description of a MIME implementation of the Warwick Framework at:
http://weeble.lut.ac.uk/MIME-WF.html

There is also a set of more formal specifications, intended to become
Internet Drafts, that I don't want to distribute before checking with the
author (Ron Daniel at Los Alamos).  They look very rough right now, but
include a description of a new application/relations MIME type that might be
interesting to us in its own right, as a way of describing and transporting
relationships between resources.
