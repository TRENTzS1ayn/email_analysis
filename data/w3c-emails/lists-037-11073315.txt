If we let our terminology be "version tree" and "member of a version tree",
the requirements start looking something like this:

4.9.2.1. Referring to a version tree. There should be a way to refer to a
version tree as a whole.  Some queries do not apply only to one member of a
version tree, but to the version tree as a whole.  Furthermore, some
operations may affect all members of the tree, rather than any specific
member.  In these cases, a way to refer to the whole version tree is required.

4.9.2.2. Referring to specific members of a version tree. There should be a
way to refer to each member of a version tree.  This means that each member
of the tree is itself a resource. This is required for version-specific
linking, and for non-versioning client support.

And so on . . .

OK?
