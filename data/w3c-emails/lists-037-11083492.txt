The overall requirement of WEBDAV is that we create a 
way that (web) authoring tools can interact with
(web) (versioning) servers in an interoperable way.
The technical requirements in the requirements document
need to be justified in terms of how they help in 
accomplishing the overall requirement. In the case
of range locking, this justification has not been
made. That is, while range locking might help some
web authoring tools interact with some versioning servers,
it is not in support of any particular interoperable method.

If there is consensus, it must be on the fact that
the linkage is there.
