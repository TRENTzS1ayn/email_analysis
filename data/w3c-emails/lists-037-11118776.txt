Was there (is there) a scenario that involves range locking?
Range locking doesn't make sense for mutual editing of any of the
document formats that I'm familiar with that are in common use on the
Internet, even including Microsoft proprietary formats.

# The reason we need to be able to
# lock a portion of a document is because many people tend to share the
# same document and the ability to specify a section of the document as
# "locked", rather than locking the entire document, enhances the
# interaction of users. 

This would justify "section" locking, but not "byte range"
locking, since in word, powerpoint, HTML, PDF, GIF, JPEG,
tiff, and most other formats, editing a section of a document
generally changes all of the byte ranges.
