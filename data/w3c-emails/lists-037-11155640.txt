I'd like to understand this comment, because I don't.

Document in MS Word, chapter 2 is bytes 30-50 and bytes 80-90.

User A wants to edit chapter 2
User B wants to edit chapter 1
User C wants to edit chapter 2

A locks bytes 30-50, bytes 80-90
B locks bytes 10-20
B edits chapter 1, adds 20 bytes. Can B check this in?
Create a new version? Increases the size of the existing
version?

How does this work?

Larry
