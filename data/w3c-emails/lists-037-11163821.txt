Not considering style, I think I like it. It is much clearer this way,
although repetitions and allitterations may cause the prose to be more
obscure and hard to read than necessary. If there is a way for improving
the readability, for instance introducing neologisms such as vtree and
movert, then it could look like:

4.9.2.1. Referring to a version tree. There should be a way to refer to a
version tree as a whole.  Some queries do not apply only to one member of a
vtree, but to the version tree as a whole.  Furthermore, some
operations may affect all moverts, rather than any specific
member.  In these cases, a way to refer to the whole vtree is required.


But, again, it's just style, and we have different tastes and it's not my
language anyway, so what am I complaining about?
