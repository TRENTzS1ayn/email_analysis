# This document reflects the consensus of the WWW Distributed Authoring
# and Versioning working group (WebDAV) as to the functionality that needs
# to be standardized to support authoring on the Web.

I think you should remove this paragraph, and instead substitute
something like:

# This document is intended to reflect the working group consensus
# as to the functionality that needs to be standardized to support
# distributed authoring and versioning on the Web. However, this
# version still has some elements that are being debated in the
# working group. In particular <blah blah blah>

and then enumerate the controversial ones. It is often quite
productive to actually write down what the nature of the disagreements
are, in the draft itself, so as not to mislead those reading
a working group draft into thinking that it represents more consensus
than it does.

Just claiming "consensus" in the document doesn't actually help create
it.

With the caveat, the draft then becomes a good basis for discussion.

Regards,

Larry
