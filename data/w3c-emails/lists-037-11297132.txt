You sound like a person who has learned from experience that byte-range
locking has some problems, and you seem happy to report that GroupWise
doesn't use it.

I can agree that a lot of people and products have used byte-range locking.
Would you agree that it's often been merely expedient, rather than being a
good idea architecturally?
