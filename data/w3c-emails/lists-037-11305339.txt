No, I don't feel that expediency is the issue. Clustering (granularization) is a common
method of handing shared things. In many operating systems the easiest way
to do this is to use byte range locking. It is a quick way of creating a shared
semaphore.

As far as having "problems" with range locking, this can be said of most all mechanisms
that are used. Each mechanism has it's up- and down-side. Sharing a file and allowing
multiple writers (not simultaneous) requires some shared attribute with an owner.
Again, byte range locking has it's place.

You sound like a person who has learned from experience that byte-range
locking has some problems, and you seem happy to report that GroupWise
doesn't use it.

I can agree that a lot of people and products have used byte-range locking.
Would you agree that it's often been merely expedient, rather than being a
good idea architecturally?
