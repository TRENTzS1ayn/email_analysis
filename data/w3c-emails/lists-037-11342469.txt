I guess that I don't understand why byte range locks are singled out for
special treatment among all the flavors of legacy system behaviors that one
might choose to support in WebDAV. Why not hardware pages? Unix inodes?
nodes in a B-tree index? All of these seem to me to have the same character
as byte ranges: they have no necessary connection to the semantic structure
of a document or document collection, and they are used by various legacy
repositories and databases to implement forms of locking.
