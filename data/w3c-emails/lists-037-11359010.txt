This is interesting. Byte ranges are indpendently cacheable, as are
multiple representations of the same resource, but unless I'm
misunderstanding something fundamental, they don't have URIs. It seems here
that the difficulty comes from the assumption that a lockable resource must
be uniquely identified through a URI.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
