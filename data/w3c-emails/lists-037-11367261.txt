This revision has also been submitted as an Internet Draft.

Note that there are still several sections of this draft which are being
debated on the list (partial locks is one example), and there is a section
at the beginning of the draft where these issues are listed.  This draft is
not an attempt to railroad the discussion in one direction or the other --
once the group has reached rough consensus on a direction to take, the
requirements draft and the specification draft will be amended to reflect
the group opinion.

Also, Judith and Fabio have worked hard and have done a great job on this
revision of the requirements document.  Thank you!

- Jim
