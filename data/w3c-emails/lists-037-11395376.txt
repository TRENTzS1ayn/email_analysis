Hello,

I have been lurking on the list for several weeks now and found this
issue forces me out into the light. 

I find that option 3 is preferable to the other options.  While email 
is not my priority, a model for disconnected operation is.  As the 
architect for the corporate web group, I am finding that portable 
computers, even though they represent only about 20% of our desktops,
are a defining design criterion in nearly all of my efforts. 

While resolving the apparent charter conflict between email being in-scope
while disconnected is out of scope, you can model disconnected operation 
and how email transport can be used to change status/state without a full 
connection. 

With the extended model, I have hopes of inter-operable solutions that
can be used. Without it, I might as well extend the gateways used for
the disconnected/part-time connected population to achieve 
inter-operation, or wait for the next DAV working group.

Best Regards,
Dave Hollander
