Regionalization of W3C Offices

   6 May 2002: As W3C increases its presence worldwide through its
   Office program, some of the Offices have been transformed into
   regional Offices. This means that they are not bound to national
   borders any more and that they act as regional outreach centers for
   countries that share common culture, history, or language. As a first
   step, the former W3C German Office is now the W3C Office in Germany
   and Austria, the former W3C UK Office is now the W3C Office in the UK
   and Ireland, and the former W3C Dutch Office is now the W3C Office in
   the Benelux (i.e., Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Read
   more about the W3C Offices Program.
