From first hand experience and a limited amount of anecdotal
evidence, I think that disconnected operation
(at least the sort that Larry writes about) would be very valuable.

On the other hand, after noodling about it quite a bit, the
design doesn't seem obvious to me at all.

Note that email might be insufficient for the
the sort of disconnected operation that Larry
mentions: an update operaition might involve one or
more synchronous operations (i.e. round-trips).

I'd like to hear from experienced designers/implementors on
this issue: is disconnected operation a long-standing research
issue, or a straighforward engineering excercise? or something
in-between?
