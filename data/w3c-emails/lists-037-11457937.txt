Note that email might be insufficient for the
the sort of disconnected operation that Larry
mentions: an update operaition might involve one or
more synchronous operations (i.e. round-trips).
-------------------

I've been lurking also, and will now register my two cents on this.
I do believe that some manner of disconnected operation is desirable,
but I've never really seen an email interface to such functionality
that wasn't a blight upon the world of software in general.  To get
more to the point, disconnected operation is good, (although I'll
agree it may take significant effort to get that functionality right),
but doing it via email is definitely bad.  Anyway, that's my feeling,
