Last I check 3/3 isn't a consensus and it certainly isn't a consensus in
favor of being rid of range locks.

Given that our goal is to provide for a distributed authoring and
versioning system that will be implemented (I mean it isn't like this is
our Phd. or something ;) and given that range locks are such a
fundamental feature that every major operating system, document creation
system, and database system provides them in one form or another, it
would seem that range locks are absolutely in scope.
