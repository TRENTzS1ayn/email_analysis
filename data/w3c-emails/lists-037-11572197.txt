Steve Carter recently circulated the ODMA standard.  They are also working
on Internet access for ODMA repositories.  The attachment is a proposal that
is currently out for a vote by ODMA members, that would make some very basic
functionality of ODMA repositories accessible via the Web.  This proposal
covers only retrieval of document content and attributes, and searches based
on attribute values.
