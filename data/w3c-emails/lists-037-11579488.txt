I agree with Larry on this. If we can do locks based on URIs, then
we have the ability to identify the resource that is bytes n..m of
some other resource and lock it. Maybe I've just missed them, but I
haven't seen any real arguments on why this is insufficient and why
the only good way to implement this functionality is to make it a part
of some special protocol, such as a new LOCKRANGE method for HTTP.
