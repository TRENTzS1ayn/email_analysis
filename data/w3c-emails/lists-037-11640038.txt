I second the motion. Let the requirements document read:"Whereas
documents may contain defined sections, specified by such concepts as
pages, chapters, and byte ranges, and whereas the purpose of DAV is to
facilitate the editing of a single document simultaneously by multiple
users, and whereas often multiple users wish to independently edit
different sections of a document, let the DAV protocol provide a
mechanism to identify these defined sections and determine their URLs so
as to prevent collisions amongst multiple users."
Or something less pompous than that =)
