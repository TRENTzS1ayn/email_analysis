Since I'm with Fabio in being anti-locking generally, though I agree with
him that we need to accommodate it for those who want it -- why not say
that it's a requirement that DAV not _PREVENT_ such sub-resource locking
behavior.

    I don't think we're going to put in URL-hacking rules for fractional
resources -- and I don't think that we should. Servers can provide whatever
resources they want, and those may in fact overlap in terms of the
_server's storage model_ -- but this requires no special support in the
protocol. It will require a lot of work for the server, but that's it's
problem.

   So essentially, I think Jim's first post is right (and Larry is right)
there's no need to mention range locking in the requirements because it's a
_result_ of support for resource locking -- for any servers that wish to
create resources to represent lockable ranges. So we may have lockable
ranges, but I don't think there's any reason that they need to be in the
requirements, or the protocol explicitly. They need to be in the
documentation for servers that need to provide sub-resources.
