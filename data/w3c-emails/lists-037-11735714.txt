A reminder,

The next meeting on WEBDAV topics will occur at the Memphis IETF meeting,
on Monday, April 7, 1997.  The WEBDAV meeting is currently scheduled for
3:30-5:30 in the afternoon.

I'll start developing an agenda in the near future for this meeting -- if
you would like a topic discussed, please send me an email describing the
topic.  Likely topics for discussion: range locking & locking in general,
metadata, disconnected operation.

The Application Area schedule for Memphis can be found on the Web at:
