Not at all. To put it more strongly: the editor of an IETF
document is at the service of the working group. If a
comment is raised, it's the duty of the editor to write
it down or explain why not. If the explanation isn't satisfactory,
discussion continues, moderated by the chair.

Telling people to "go write your own" is not cool, per IETF
process[1] and culture.
