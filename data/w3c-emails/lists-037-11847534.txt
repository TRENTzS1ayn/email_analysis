Andre posted his points.
I responded and explained why I felt his proposals should not be
implemented.
No one came forward to refute my explanation or defend Andre's
assertions.
As pointed out yourself, at this point the matter is closed.

Given that Andre's proposals were basically dead I wanted to give him
another mechanism to perhaps sway the group. The only option I saw left
for him was to write a full spec which the group could then review and
decide if perhaps it had not fully understood his proposal. It was
either that or Andre just throwing in the towel.
