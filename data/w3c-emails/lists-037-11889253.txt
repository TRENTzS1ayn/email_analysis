We asked the editing group to try to improve interoperability, even if
it
meant limiting flexibility. Limiting flexiblity isn't a goal. It's hard
to
have design arguments about motherhood and apple pie, though. We're just
floundering until we have a new proposal to look at, unless we want to
go
back to Ohta-san's internet draft.
