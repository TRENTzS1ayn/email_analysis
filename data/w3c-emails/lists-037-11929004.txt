This suggestion touches on points of interest in several other contexts.
Partly with those contexts in mind, a few requests for clarification:

How does the (flat?) list of URIs map to the structure of a document
that can be in any arbitrary format?  By the metadata?  What is the
format of the metadata?

| resource. Thus if the structured resource is http://foo then
| http://foo/bar specifies a member of foo's structure.

How is the relationship of bar to other members of foo indicated, and
in what context?  If I PUT a bar, how does my interlocutor know where
in foo bar should go?  Would I not have to PUT bar plus at least an
outline of the new structure of foo, as modified by the addition of
bar?
