The approach I've been looking at is to represent structured resources
using the multipart/related media type. Such stuctures would be flat, but
the could contain other multipart objects, thus allowing for arbitrary
hierarchical strucuctures. Finally, more general structures could be
represented using Content-ID URIs as "pointers".

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
