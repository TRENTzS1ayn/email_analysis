Yaron,
  I realize the need for a light HTTP oriented metadata method. I
would make the suggestion that instead of using the method
names of META* that some other name is used since at least in
my world I would assume that a method with a name that
general should be able to handle metadata in a general way.
I.e. when we begin to to REAL metadata standards stuff
in HTTP we're probably going to want to use those methods
for more generalized stuff. Its similar to some
current proposals for a new HTML tag to actually
fix the META tag.

  I would also urge you to look at the application/directory
MIME type as a way of doing "light" metadata but I think
you have more of a desire to actually do it within HTTP 
itself, right?
