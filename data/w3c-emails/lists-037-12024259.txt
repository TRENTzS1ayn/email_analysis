For those concerned about searching & metadata in web repositories,
perhaps this is a direction we should pay attention to.

You are receiving this note because of your past interest in STARTS - 
Stanford Protocol Proposal for Internet Search and Retrieval.  As you 
might recall, STARTS is the result of an informal "standards" effort, 
coordinated at Stanford, to develop a simple protocol that text search 
engines should follow to facilitate searching and indexing multiple 
collections of text documents.

Over the past several months, Stanford and Cornell have collaborated 
to test and refine the STARTS protocol through the development of a 
reference implementation.  This reference implementation is written in 
Java and provides a STARTS compliant front-end to the freeWAIS-sf 
search engine.  The source and full information on the reference 
implementation is available at 
http://www2.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/starts/starts_reference.htm.  The 
STARTS home page is at 
http://www-db.stanford.edu/~gravano/starts_home.html.

At this point we are still determining how best to proceed with the 
STARTS effort.  One possibility recently discussed is to incorporate 
the "Dublin Core" attribute-set into the STARTS protocol (in addition 
to the "basic-1" default attribute set).  STARTS could then be used as 
a means for searching over multiple sites that use the Dublin Core for 
document metadata.

We are open to other ideas on how to exploit the interoperability 
afforded by this protocol.  If you have any questions or comments, 
please contact me or Luis Gravano at Stanford 
(gravano@cs.stanford.edu).
