The next WEBDAV Design Team meeting will take place April 1-4, 1997, at
U.C. Irvine.  The preliminary attendee list is: Steve Carter, Novell; Asad
Faizi, Netscape; Yaron Goland, Microsoft; Del Jensen, Novell; Jim
Whitehead, U.C. Irvine.

The intent of this meeting is to perform a detailed revision of the
protocol specification based on feedback received at the Irvine meeting,
and from posts to the list.  While this meeting is past the I-D deadline
for the Memphis meeting, the Design Team will definitely give a report at
the Memphis IETF meeting, and will discuss contentious issues with the full
group at Memphis.

The output of this Design Team meeting is subject to review and comments
from the full list.  The intent is to develop a refined specification which
can be commented upon, as an intermediate step towards development of a
final specification which receives consensus from the group.
