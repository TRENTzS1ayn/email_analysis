I agree that it would be useful to provide some support for structured
documents, and I like the idea of trying to use the same technique for
dealing with structured documents and collections.  There are differences
between structured documents and collections, however, that are worth
keeping in mind.  The most important one for us is that ordering matters in
structured documents, but generally not in collections.

Operations that we would want to be able to perform on structured documents
include:

Write the entire document to the server in one step
Delete the entire document from the server in one step
Move the entire document in one step
Copy the entire document in one step
Insert new content into the document at a certain position in the structure
(for example, insert 5 new pages after page 10)
Delete content from the document
Move content from one location to another in the structure
Copy content from one location to another in the structure
Link content into a document at a certain position in the structure
Delete a link to content
Move a link from one location to another in the structure
Copy a link from one location to another in the structure
Get the entire document in one step
Get any content piece or range of pieces

Whatever approach we take, we need to confirm that all these operations are
possible.  Being able to manage the entire document as a single object is a
difficulty for your approach, I think.  Being able to insert content at a
certain point in the structure is a problem both for you and for the
multipart/related approach.
