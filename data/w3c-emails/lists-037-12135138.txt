I concurred with Ron in approbating multipart/related.  On the basis
of precisely parallel issues that have arisen in the XML discussion,
I think the minimum structure required to relate metadata and documents
is something like multipart/related.  As MIME is an existing, implemented
technology, it makes sense to use it.  Alternately, you can define the
semantics necessary to use multipart/related or any other syntax, and
let implementors try out various syntaxes.
