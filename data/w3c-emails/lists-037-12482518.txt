I think in MIME that "message" and "multipart" are treated specially.
They're not just "application", they're media type where the sender
intends for the recipient to actually unwrap the message. I don't think
you should *ever* store something as "multpart". Rather, a content
negotiated resource is "multpart/alternative", message/http is just
another wrapper around the HTTP message as if the wrapper weren't there,
etc.
