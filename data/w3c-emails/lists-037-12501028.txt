Based on Larry Mastiner's feedback I have gotten rid of the
PropagateLevel header and the DAV.ResourceLink type and replaced them
with the DAV.PropagateLink and DAV.NoPropagateLink link types.

1.0DAV.PropagateLink/DAV.NoPropagateLink Links

1.1Problem Description

The proposal before this group for handling structured resources
requires that members of the structure use the URI of the structure as
the base of their URIs. However there are times when one wishes to
include URIs in a structure, which do not use the structure's URI as a
base.

1.2Proposal
To provide link types that when defined upon a structure using the LINK
method will result in the resource including the destination of the link
in the results of a STRUCTURE method. The source of these links is the
resource the links are defined on. The destination must be a URI that
does not have the source as its base. The type will be DAV.PropagateLink
or DAV.NoPropagateLink.
DAV.PropagateLink type is used for members which should have, when the
results are definable, methods executed on the structure propagated down
to them. An example of propagation is the DELETE method. If a structure
has DAV.PropagateLink members then a DELETE should be propagated down to
them. An example of non-propagation is MOVE. There is not sufficient
information to reasonable define where the resources being pointed to
would be moved.
DAV.NoPropagateLink type is used for members who are only meant to be
included in STRUCTURE listings for the structure, but should not have
methods propagated down to them.

1.3Discussion
If this proposal is accepted we can be completely rid of ADDRESOURCE and
REMOVERESOURCE methods proposed in the current DAV spec.
