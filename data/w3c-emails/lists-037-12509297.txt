Larry:
Whether the server understands the structure of a resource does NOT
depend
on the content-type. For example, a server might know about assembling
HTML from components, but not know about the structure of those
components.
A server might be able to parse some postscript files (those that follow
document structuring conventions) and not others (those that do not.)
