FYI, I was recently asked to write an article giving an introduction to
WEBDAV for ACM StandardView, a new ACM magazine.  The article, "World Wide
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WEBDAV): An Introduction," will
be published in the March 1997 issue.

This article is available via the Web at:
