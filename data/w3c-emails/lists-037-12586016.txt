1Save Response Header

1.1Problem Description

In some cases a client may want to use methods available on the server
to manipulate the response. Using these methods is less bandwidth
expensive if the response is stored on the server.
For example, a client may wish a working copy of a checked out resource
to be kept on the server, rather than being transmitted to the client.

1.2Proposal

SaveResponse = "Save-Response" ":" ("<" URI ">" | SET)
The Save-Response header requests that the response entity to the
request is saved at the URI specified in the Save-Response. If the
header is obeyed then the response should contain all the headers that
would have been returned with the request if the Save-Response header
had not been specified. If there is any problem saving the response at
the specified location then the server should just return the response
entity in the response.
If the SET attribute is used then the requestor asks the server to
choose an appropriate URI to record the result at and to then return the
URI in a Save-Response header in the response. The location header can
not be used because that header may be needed if the request was, for
example, a PUT with a 201 "Created" result. What is being saved in the
Save-Response location is the response body, if any, not the entity.
