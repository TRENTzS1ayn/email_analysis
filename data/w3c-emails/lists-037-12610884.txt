Sorry for the late reply on this thread. I would like to make sure that the
concepts promoted by Document Management Systems (DMS) be supported
as well. Basically, a "version" in a DMS is just a previous version (or revision)
of the document and CAN be altered any time in the future. That is why
we make the distinction between the CHECKOUT/IN and (UN)LOCK methods
in the specification.

Regarding 4.9.1.1 I believe that a requirements document should discuss
the concept of frozen and unfrozen versions and the need for the
protocol to distinguish between the two. It should not, however, specify
how that distinction is made.

As for uncheckout, I suspect I will eventually convince myself that you
are right so I will drop the subject. =)
