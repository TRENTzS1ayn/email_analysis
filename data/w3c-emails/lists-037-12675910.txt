I guess it depends upon your approach. If locks are implemented as
metadata, this might be hard. If locks are implementeds through lock
servers (NFS style), then it should be easier. Even if locks are
implemented as metadata, I'm not sure it would be *that* bad. In fact, I
like the idea of associating metadata with a resource or collection in the
form of a URI which identifies the resource that actually administers the
locks.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
