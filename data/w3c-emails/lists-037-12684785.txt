If what you want to do is say to the server "do this method only if the
resource is still locked with this lock token", then yes you will need
to define yet another If-* header field.  That design decision was made
by the HTTP WG in spite of my vehement objections, as Larry can attest.

There is zero chance of extending If-Match or If-None-Match -- they were
not designed to be extensible and cannot be safely changed once implemented.
In any case, making the lock token a URI would not improve cross-server
locks, since either the client would have to ask for the lock on each
server or the requested server would have to establish the lock in such
a way that it affects the other servers, and thus in a way that allows
any server to know of the lock and the lock token.

BTW, why do you need the functionality of If-Lock?  Are you treating the
lock token as a credential for authentication?
