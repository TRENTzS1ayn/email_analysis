Asking the server to do a retrieval to obtain the content of a resource
to be replaced is fundamentally different from asking a server to replace
a resource with the supplied content.  That is why the first is a COPY and
the second is a PUT.  The server-side implementation may be similar, but
the request semantics are not.
