Roy, is this true for PUT in general, or are you thinking that
WEBDAV has some other special action? Is the PUT body in general
required to be "this is what you will send as the content of
future GET requests", or is it more complex than that?

For example, if we're storing a document with server-side includes,
would you use PUT, or STORE-SOURCE, or PUT to a different URL?

I wish I felt confident that WEBDAV actually had addressed these
fundamental simple operations, before we went off onto long
flights of design around COPY and MOVE and establishing metadata.
