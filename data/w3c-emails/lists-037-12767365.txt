1LINK Method

1.1Request-URI

The Request-URI is the resource where the link will be recorded.

1.2Link Header

Link = "Link" ":" #("<" URI ">" *(";" DAV-link-param)
DAV-link-param = (Source | Destination | Type | link-param)
Source = "Source" "=" URI
Destination = "Destination" "=" URI
Type = "Type" "=" Token

This definition is adapted from section 19.6.2.4 of RFC 2068. Link-param
is defined in that section. Please note that the above is not a
redefinition of the link header. The syntax specified above is 100% in
compliance with the link header given in RFC 2068. Rather the above
simply specifies the fields and extensions of particular interest to
DAV.

A link header must contain exactly one Source or Destination attribute.
The URI included at the beginning of the header then takes upon itself
the unspecified value.

Link: <http://foo>; Destination = http://bar; Type =
DAV.Versioning.History

In the previous case http://foo is the source as destination is
specified as http://bar. In addition all link headers MUST include a
Type attribute.

A DAV server is only required to record Source, Destination, and Type.
It may drop all other attributes if it so chooses. In addition a DAV
server may not record two links which have the same source, destination,
and type but differ on other attributes. A link is uniquely identified
by the source/destination/type triple.

2UNLINK Method

2.1Request-URI

The Request-URI is the resource from where the link will be removed.

2.2Link Header

The link header included in UNLINK is only required to have the
Source/Destination/Type triple.
