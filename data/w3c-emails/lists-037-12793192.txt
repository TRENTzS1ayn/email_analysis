The goal behind having if-lock is for atomicity. Locks can disappear at
any time for any reason. Having an "if-lock" lets a user say "Only
process this request if my lock is still in force."

In addition I will be proposing advisory locks in the context of
versioning. So users will want to be able to say "Only process this
request if no locks are outstanding on the resource."
