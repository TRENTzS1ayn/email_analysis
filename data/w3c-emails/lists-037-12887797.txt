Your proposal is no different, in terms of race conditions, from mine.
Between the time you receive the response and the time you send out a
request based on that response, the state of the server may have
changed.

In either case, the system deals with recovery. The content-nature
header provides for requesting exactly what you want and the server is
required to refuse the PUT if it can't match the content-nature header.
So if the situation has changed, the PUT will fail.

As for your accusation that my proposals do not seem thought out, I
personally find facts more compelling then assertions.

In regards to my "rapid fire approach", there is an author's meeting
next week and I wanted to give the author's a chance to see my proposals
before I bring them up at the meeting. However, rather than just sending
the posts to them privately, I decided to share them with the list. You
can not have it both ways Larry. Either you have openness with me
sending the proposals out to the list, or you don't. I will eventually
be making all the proposals available in a single file, once I have
finished them. Until then, anyone wanting to refer to them can check the
archives of this list.

All in all your post was offensive and unproductive. I hope you will
refrain in the future from such postings as it makes it extremely
difficult to work with you. Your attitude is consistently
confrontational rather than cooperative. If you have a problem with the
content or speed of my postings there are ways to bring the issues forth
without being insulting.

PS Sorry about the Microsoft mail address. Something went screw when I
sent the mail out.
