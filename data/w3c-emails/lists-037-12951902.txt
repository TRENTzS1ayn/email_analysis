Yaron, I'm just asking for a little consideration and context.

You were sending a lot of proposals to the mailing list. The issues
of timing and interaction, robustness and transactions were not
addressed or referenced in any of them. The problem statements
made allusions to previous proposals without giving reference to
them, and did not, in the "Problem Statement" section, identify
what Distributed Authoring and Versioning problem they solved.

I'm happy to accept that these are just advanced notice of what
you and others will be discussing at a private meeting next week,
but it's useful to say that they'll need serious review against
robustness criteria, and that the proposals, as written, don't indicate
that the review had been done. It's OK that they're preliminary
drafts. I hope it's OK that there's not really a lot of time to
review them in depth, and that the analysis of the robustness
of the proposals that I gave was pretty hurried.

I'm sorry that my attempt at humor ("Problem Description" / "Proposal")
was taken as insulting. I just wanted to say "ouch", what you
were doing hurt.

Regards,

Larry
