I agree with the sentiment, but am in stronger agreement with Jim
that it is unclear on how to determine and communicate resource structure.

I think that, at a minimum, you would have to provide a specification for
describing structure in HTML as well. In the absence of an existance proof,
I'm unconvinced that a reasonable job can be done on it. I suspect there
are a lot of really hard problems that you won't encounter with the two
example standards you propose to use. Jim mentoned one, bad translation
from a legacy document. Besides, until HTML has such a standard, a lot of
the promise of the STRUCTURE method for DAV goes unfulfilled.

It may be the case that a credible job on HTML can be done
by a simple approach - expose only the "important" tags like <head>,
<body>, <H#>, <blockquote>, <HR>, <DL>, <UL>, etc. Later approaches would
presumably do better at coping with all the bizzare tag abuse we know
lurks on the web. How are clients and servers to know what structure
extraction approach is used? Don't they need agreement on that so the
client has a way of marking the structures for the user? If they do, then
is a negotiation mechanism necessary? (I sure hope not).

Just some of the questions that arise...
