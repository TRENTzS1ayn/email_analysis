I assumed that the semantics of PUT with respect to various media types had
already been addressed, either in the HTTP/1.1 specification, or by
convention.

It seems that the general issue here is: how should a DAV-capable server
handle PUT operations for certain MIME classes (multipart, message, etc.).
Would you do us a favor and describe the bounds of this issue (i.e., what
classes of MIME types you find to have troublesome semantics in the context
of DAV)?

However, it seems to me that this issue is largely orthogonal to copy,
move, and metadata operations.

I'm also not yet convinced this needs to be addressed by the DAV specification.
