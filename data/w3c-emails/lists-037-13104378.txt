Huh? URIs are not tokens and whitespace is not a reliable separator in
header fields.  I must have said that a couple thousand times on http-wg,
and one was just last week.  If you want to separate URIs from parameters
in a header field, you must surround the URI with <angle brackets> or
"double-quotes", since they are the only characters that will never
appear within a URI even if it is broken across more than one line.

If you are going to redefine the syntax, then 

   Link       = "Link" ":" 1#( link-type *(";" link-param) )
   link-type  = token
   link-param = ( "from" "=" <"> URI <"> )
              | ( "to"   "=" <"> URI <"> )
              | ( token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ] )

otherwise, the HTTP/1.1 spec defines it as

  if rel=type

       <first URI> is destination
       anchor="URI" is source (current document if elided)

  else if rev=type

       <first URI> is source
       anchor="URI" is destination (current document if elided)

I don't like that model, but it was inherited from HTML.

Extensibility is a WEBDAV problem.
