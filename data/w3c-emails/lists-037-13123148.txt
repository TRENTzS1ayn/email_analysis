The next open meeting of the WEBDAV Working Group is at the Memphis IETF
(http://www.ietf.org/meetings/Memphis.html), which runs from April 7-11,
1997.  Due to a scheduling conflict with the WWW6 conference, also April
7-11, and the Hypertext'97 conference, also April 7-11 (at which I must
present a paper), the Web-related working groups will be meeting early in
the week, mostly on Monday.  The WEBDAV session is on Monday, April 7, from
3:30PM to 5:30PM.

Developing an agenda for the Memphis meeting is very difficult, since there
are a lot of open issues, and relatively little time available in Memphis
to discuss them.  Here is my first pass at an agenda -- feedback is
welcome.

3:30 - 3:40 :: A very brief introduction to WEBDAV (Whitehead)
3:40 - 3:45 :: Introduction of Document Editors, Brief updates on each document
3:45 - 3:55 :: Briefing on the Design Team meeting
3:55 - 4:25 :: Discussion of lock semantics, including partial locks
4:25 - 5:00 :: Discussion of metadata operations (META*, *LINK)
5:00 - 5:30 :: Discussion of versioning

Also, if you are looking to talk with me at the Memphis meeting, please do
so *before* the meeting, as I will be leaving soon after the meeting to
make my 8PM flight.
