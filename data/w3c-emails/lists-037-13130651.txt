Even though I will be watching the WWW6 conference via video link
(http://www6conf.slac.stanford.edu) from the Hypertext'97 conference
(http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ht97/) in Southampton, UK, there will be a
short informative session on WEBDAV at the WWW6 conference, on Developer's
Day.

Jim Cunningham, Netscape, will be giving an talk introducing WEBDAV at 4PM,
on Friday, April 11, 1997, during a session titled, "New Tools -- World
Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WEBDAV): An Introduction."
It's located in Ballroom E.  Ralph Swick, W3C, will also be present during
this session, and will be discussing the cooperative relationship between
the W3C and the IETF on WEBDAV.

Thank you Jim and Ralph for representing the WEBDAV WG at the WWW6 conference!
