The ZORBA project has just kicked off! 

ZORBA focuses on "Information Retrieval using Distributed Object 
Technologies", with an initiative to produce a standard interface for 
performing distributed search and retrieval on the Internet. ZORBA 
motivates a middleware solution using OMG-IDL.

Assumptions and broad directions of the intiative are contained in 
"The ZORBA Manifesto" at
http://www.dstc.edu.au/Zorba/manifesto.html
The ZORBA home page is still under construction as we are still 
sourcing documentation on related standards/projects/implementations 
etc.

ZORBA is intended to be a grass-roots initiative. To that end, Doug 
Nebert from the US Federal Goegraphic Data Committee initiated the 
ZORBA mailing list. 

To subscribe to the list, send email to:
  majordomo@dstc.edu.au

with message body:
  subscribe zorba
  end

(subscriptions to zorba-discuss have been automatically transferred 
to the zorba list, please address email to zorba@dstc.edu.au)

**To start the ball rolling ** if you have any experiences and/or 
documentation on related standards/projects/implementations etc. that 
could be of interest in light of "The ZORBA Manifesto" please post 
them to the above list or if preferred email either Doug or myself. 
In particular, we would like to focus at this stage on 3 main streams:

1. Suggestions for the overall IR interface architecture - how do you 
see the big picture?

2. What services should the next generation Internet IR standard 
support?

3. References to and/or comments on existing object implementations 
or related IDL specifications.
