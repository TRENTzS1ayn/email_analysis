Changing something is an implementation detail.  As I said, the server-side
implementation may be similar, but the request semantics are not.

PUT with a Source header tells the server to copy the resource indicated
by Source and place it at the PUT request-uri.  The contents of request-uri
will therefore be the contents of what the server sees when it gets the
Source, at the particular time at which it gets the Source, and with the
particular authentication characteristics of the server performing a request.
That is the nature of a COPY operation.

PUT with media type means place the data provided by the client at the
request-uri.  There is no request made by the server, and no opportunity
for misunderstanding based on who is making the request, when it is made,
or how it is made.  That is the nature of a PUT operation.
