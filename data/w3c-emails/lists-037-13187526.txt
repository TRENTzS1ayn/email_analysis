But that would assume that the lock token is the entity tag, because
the server wouldn't be able to continue the operation if it wasn't.

Just to clarify, what I said is that the HTTP-WG decided to go with
separate header fields for every conditional, rather than a single
field with a well-defined grammar like

    IF: {eq {Lock "the thing Yaron wanted"}}

which would allow any number of preconditions and be extensible.
Thus, you will need to define

    If-Lock: "the thing Yaron wanted"

instead, which, in my considered technichal opinion, sucks.
