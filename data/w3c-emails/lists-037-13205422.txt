A new revision of the WEBDAV protocol specification is now available.  This
draft is available at:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-jensen-webdav-ext-01.txt
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/draft-jensen-webdav-ext-01.txt

It is also accessible via a link from the WEBDAV home page,
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/

This is *not* a major revision from the previous draft.  The majority of
the changes made to this draft were to remove sections of the draft which
described functionality on which there was rough consensus that it should
not be in the specification.  The only addition made to this draft is the
addition of a section which was accidentally not included in revision 00.

What was removed:
  - The entire schema section (old Section 2)
  - The sections on COPYHEAD, MOVEHEAD (old Sections 7.2, 7.4)
  - The sections on DESTROY, UNDELETE (old Sections 7.5, 7.6)

What was added:
  - Section 3.7 describing the DAV.Source link

The intent of releasing this version of the specification was to perform a
minor cleanup on the original draft 00 specification.  While this
specification is still quite far from the group's current opinions on many
issues, performing any further cleanup than these simple actions would
require significantly greater effort.

I'd like to thank Del Jensen for his work producing this latest draft, and
submitting it before the I-D deadline for Memphis.

- Jim
