I think to some extent you, Jon, and I are probably talking past each other
here.  I don't think anyone has proposed that we define read locks as part
of WebDAV (although I personally think they would be useful -- if we
understand a read lock as one that prevents anyone from putting a write lock
on the resource).

What I think Jon suggested was that there be two sorts of read access
permission:  One would let you read a resource only when it has no (write)
locks on it.  The other would let you read a resource even if it has
(advisory write) locks on it.

To me it seems that access rights should be completely independent of issues
of locking.  Either you have permission to read a given resource or you
don't.  The server can figure this out without knowing the lock state of the
resource.  Then it checks separately for the lock state to decide whether to
let you read the resource now.

We might need to look again at the types of locks we define.  I have seen
RDBMSs that distinguish between stronger and weaker types of write locks --
one that lets people read while the write lock is in place, and one that
does not.
