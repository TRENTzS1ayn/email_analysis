The concept that access policies are a resource can be eliminated
and thought of in an abstract sense.

The setting of access attributes via the metadata model can be
eliminated as a design constraint.

As I understood it, implementation via HTTP is a requirement of
the WebDAV charter and the general consensus.  This can be eliminated
if it is felt that this shouldn't be true for access control.

A stated WebDAV requirement appears to be that any resource on
any medium could be controlled.  If we don't include applications,
then I don't believe we meet this goal.  We should make a decision
as to whether WebDAV access control will apply only to static
document-based resources or any type of resource.

There are two items here:

  1) Whether access control will be a WebDAV requirement.  Thus far,
     general consensus has been that it should.
 
  2) The objective was to define required categories of access
     control that would be "understood" by all WebDAV servers, not
     that it necessarilly implement each category.  In fact, the
     proposed requirements document states that it would be up to
     the WebDAV server to determine how it would interpret the
     meaning of a particular access control attribute.
