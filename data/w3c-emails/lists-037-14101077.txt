You are right.  The only thing I was concerned about was stating that access
control would be implemented by new HTTP methods, as opposed to, say, new
headers for existing methods.

It's one thing to define access permissions for the application itself.
(User U1 is allowed to execute the application, user U2 is not.) So one
question we can ask is whether this is in scope for WebDAV.

I thought you were talking about something else.  Maybe we have an
application that generates several different kinds of HTML pages on the fly.
Some of these it wants to make available to everyone, but some it wants to
restrict to members only.  A request to change a page from members only to
public would just be a request to the WebDAV server that it would pass on
via CGI or something else to the application, which would do whatever it
liked with the request.  It doesn't seem as if there needs to be any special
attention from WebDAV to the mechanism for passing the request on from the
server to the application.

I guess I was assuming that we had decided that WebDAV should define an
access control extension to HTTP, but without deciding whether we would
require every WebDAV-compliant server to implement it.

OK, that makes sense.
