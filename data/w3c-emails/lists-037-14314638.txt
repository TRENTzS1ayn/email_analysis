One additional item for discussion:

Jim brought up that we may want to require that the contents of
an access policy to be based on a standard specification.  The
advantage here would be some added interoperability, e.g., you
could copy an access control policy from one WebDAV server to
another of a different type.

My feeling is that we should not state this as a requirement.
I think we mostly care about making sure that you can modify
access attributes and that resources that are constrained by
such attributes behave in an expected manner.  Since the
interpretation of the policy is left to the server, this isn't
really an "over the wire" issue.
