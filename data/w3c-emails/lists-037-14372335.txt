Unfortunately recent scheduling conflicts prevent me from attending
next week; I'm sorry.

I am now responsible for sheparding the "metadata work" within W3C.
The scheduling conflict is an important authors' meeting to converge
several proposals that are on our plate.

This metadata work began as a set of proposals to extend the
Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) to support more
datatypes in property values, including structured values.  The
current working name for this project is the Resource Description
Framework (RDF).  The DAV metadata is one of the application
areas we wish to target for RDF.  (You can take a look at
http://www.w3.org/PICS/NG for a general idea of what has been
happening.)

I have looked over "DAV Base" and "DAV Properties" with an eye to
uncovering anything in the model represented there that might be
inconsistent with RDF as it is currently shaping up to be.  I do
not see anything that should be a problem.  There are some syntactic
things with respect to use of XML as the transport syntax for
metadata that we are working through now but this should be trivial
to incorporate into the examples in the DAV Property spec.

Have a productive meeting in Orem; wish I could be there.

-Ralph
