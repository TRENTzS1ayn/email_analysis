Hi DAV folks,

Sorry for cross-posting this message but I hope that you may be interested!

A new PEP draft is ready - I have submitted it as an ID and also as an W3C
WD. You can find it in both txt, html, and ps as

http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-http-pep
or
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-http-pep-970714.txt
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-http-pep-970714.html
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-http-pep-970714.ps

You can also find general information about PEP at

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/PEP/

Thanks for the input on the previous PEP draft - you know who you are!

The main new feature is that the mode of "long lived" mappings no longer is
there as it was too hard to get to work through a proxy. A PEP extension
declaration is now for a single message, which makes all extended messages
understandable by any other PEP agent.

Another new feature is that the mapping of PEP into HTTP/1.1 has been made
explicit so that it is clear what is part of the PEP model and what is part
of the mapping.

Since the last draft, issued April 28, we have gained significant amount of
implementation experience working with a small PEP demo developed by Eric
Prud'hommeaux. The demo will be made available at

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/PEP/Demo/

Have fun!

Thanks,

Henrik
