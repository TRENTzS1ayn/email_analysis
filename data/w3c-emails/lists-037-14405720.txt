Oh - I thought that it was one of those philosophical questions that you
always fear late Friday afternoon :-)

Good question - short answer: part of it no and part of it yes.

The "yes" part is the metadata part (using the "PEP-Info"), which can be
expressed using XML or any other format for describing metadata without
affecting the "no" part.

The "no" part is the mechanism for introducing new features into a protocol
message explaining what they are and allowing the recipient to potentially
interpret the message correctly with no prior agreement. That is, you can
extend HTTP dynamically in a decentralized mechanism.

Thanks,

Henrik
