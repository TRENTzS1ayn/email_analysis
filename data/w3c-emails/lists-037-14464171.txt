I would particularly like comments on the i18n requirements arrived at by
the group in Orem, if possible by COB Wednesday, July 23.

The consensus of the group at Orem was that we should stay away from issues
around variants, which are not specific to internationalization and would
add enormously to the work of WEBDAV.  Jim will make sure that this position
is acceptable to the area directors.

The question was raised whether we need to be concerned about collation.  We
think that we do not -- we do not sort any query result sets, and we do not
define greater-than or less-than operators for pattern matching.

We think that we need only to insure that any information intended for user
comprehension should be expressed in a way that makes it possible to display
the information in any desired writing system and language.  The proposed
internationalization requirement is the following:

"All information intended for user comprehension must be expressed in one of
the ISO-10646 character sets and must have a language tag."
