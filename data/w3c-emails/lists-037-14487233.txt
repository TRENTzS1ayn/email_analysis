A new version of the WebDAV protocol specification is available as
Internet-Draft, <draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt>.  Note that this draft
is what was discussed at the Orem working group meeting, and has not been
substantively changed since (i.e., a terminology section was added, and
minor formatting changes were made, but the proposals remain as they were
at the Orem meeting).

Due to some format conversion problems, the version of this draft currently
available at ds.internic.net has some ASCII characters with bit-8 set,
which could cause some printing problems.  A fixed version of this draft is
available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt

As always, this draft is also available via a link from the WebDAV home
page, at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/

Thanks go out to Del Jensen, the document editor, for collecting the draft
proposals into this document.

Standard I-D boilerplate:

 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
 directories. This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring
 and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

       Title     : Extensions for Distributed Authoring and Versioning on
                   the World Wide Web -- WEBDAV

       Pages     : 65
       Date      : 07/21/1997

This Document specifies a set of methods and content-types ancillary to
HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, simple name space
manipulation, simple resource locking (collision avoidance) and
resource version control.


Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type:
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
