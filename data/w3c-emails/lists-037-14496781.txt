Jose Kahan <jose.kahan@w3.org> has been doing a lot of work on the WebDAV
mailing list recently, and I'd like to let you know about some of the new
features:

* Improved archives: the mailing list hypertext archives have been broken
into 3 month increments so it is much easier to download them.  There is
improved formatting within the messages as well.  Mailing list archives are
available at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/

* Digest function: if you would like to receive WebDAV mail every 32K or 3
days (whichever comes first), then subscribe to the digest list.  To
subscribe to this list, send a message with subject "subscribe" to
<w3c-dist-auth-d-request@w3.org>, then unsubscribe from the main list by
sending a message with subject "unsubscribe" to
<w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org>.  Please make sure you post to the
"-request" addresses!

* Downloading archives: If you want to download the mailing list archives
(for example, if you have mail software with good search facilities), start
the process rolling by sending mail to "w3c-dist-auth-request" with a
subject of "archive help".  This will retrieve instructions on how to
download the mailing list archives.

Many thanks to Jose for his hard work on the mailing list, and continuing
thanks to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for hosting this mailing
list.
