It was suggested to me at the Orem meeting that the WebDAV group should
perform a structured walkthrough the spec. on the mailing list.  This
walkthrough would involve picking a section of the specification and then
focusing on it for a fixed period of time.  The idea is that dilligent
members of the mailing list would take on the task of reading the focus
sections, and would ask questions about the spec., and make comments on the
section to the list.  At the end of the review time, the comments will be
collected, and then addressed.

I propose that we start discussion by looking at the Properties section of
the draft.  I feel that a two week period is sufficient time to allow list
members to read the Properties section, ask questions, and register
feedback.  After the Properties section, the Containers and Namespace
operations will be next, followed by Locking and Versioning.

Other topics can certainly be discussed during this time -- the idea is to
elicit comments on the Properties section, not to stop other debate.  Also,
comments on properties are still welcome after the focus period, however,
the earlier comments are registered, the easier it is to address them.
