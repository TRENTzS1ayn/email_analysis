From July 23 through August 6, the working group "focus section" of the
specification is Section 2, "Data Model and Methods for DAV Properties."
The specification under consideration is
<draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt> which is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt

While all feedback is welcome, discussion on the following major design
issues is especially desired:

1. the use of URIs for property names (Section 2.2.2.3)
2. the encoding of URIs to create names which can be used with GET and
DELETE (Section 2.4.4)
3. the flat namespace of property names (Section 2.2.2.3)
4. the requirement that the value field for properties be XML data
(implied, but not explicitly stated)
5. the semantics of HTTP/1.1 methods (GET, DELETE, PUT) applied to
properties (Sections 2.6.2, 2.6.1, and 2.6.4)
6. the syntax and semantics of PROPPATCH (Section 2.6.3)
7. the syntax and semantics of SEARCH (Section 2.6.5)
8. the encoding of links into XML (Section 2.5)

Please post your feedback to the mailing list.

Thanks!

- Jim
