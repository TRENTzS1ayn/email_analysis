I view the proposal to use containers to implement multi-resource locking 
as
a somewhat clumsy way to satisfy this requirement for a number of reasons
including:

1. The principal may not be authorized to create a container, or to file a
    resource in a container, and hence could not use this mechanism to
    perform a multi-resource lock even if he was authorized to lock each 
of
    the resources.

2. Creating a transient container in order to obtain a multi-resource lock
    is relatively inefficient, requiring O(2N) operations.

3. Servers may elect to implement only session based locks or short lived
    timer based locks to provide robust services in an otherwise 
unreliable
    environment.  In such cases, a client is just as likely to fail to 
remove
    a transient container as he is to unlock a lock yet the server has no
    WebDAV sanctioned way of removing these transient containers.

I'd prefer to see the LOCK and UNLOCK methods take an ordered list of 
resources
to LOCK or UNLOCK respectively.  (I'm not familiar enough with HTTP to know 
if
the protocol makes passing a list of resources difficult -- WebDAV has 
already addressed
multi-status responses for the COPY, MOVE and DELETE methods)

Subject: Requirements Open Issues from Orem

A new version of the requirements draft will be submitted to the IETF on
Thursday, 7/24.  Your comments on these issues discussed at Orem will be
helpful.

------------

Multiple Resource Locking

As a result of the discussion at Orem, I was asked to raise the issue of
atomic locking of multiple resources to the mailing list one more time.

In an informal vote by those present for the discussion, 9 voted to keep 
the
requirement, 4 to remove it.  The rest (about 10 others) did not vote.

At the moment, the requirement reads as follows:

5.3.1.2. Multi-Resource Locking. It must be possible to take out a
lock on multiple resources residing on the same server in a single action,
and this locking operation must be atomic across these resources.

("residing on the same server" was added at the request of the group at 
Orem.)

The rationale for the requirement is to prevent livelocks.  That is, if 
the
requirement is not satisfied, it will be possible for 2 principals to try 
to
lock the same group of resources, and for neither to get all the locks he
needs.  Each may end up with only some of the locks he needs. In addition,
the requirement is meant to lessen the burden on the server that would be
caused by multiple individual lock requests.

The current locking draft does not satisfy the requirement.  The 
difficulty
is that it defines a LOCK method where the request URI is the resource to 
be
locked.  If we tried to accommodate multiple URIs by moving them into the
body of the request, it is not clear what request URI would be 
appropriate.

One suggestion was that the user put all the resources to be locked into a
container, and then lock the container.  The server would be required to
treat the lock request as atomic to whatever depth was requested.

------------

The requirement concerning EMail transport will stay as is.

------------

Internationalization

The consensus of the group at Orem was that we should stay away from 
issues
around variants, which are not specific to internationalization and would
add enormously to the work of WEBDAV.  Jim will make sure that this 
position
is acceptable to the area directors.

The question was raised whether we need to be concerned about collation. 
 We
think that we do not -- we do not sort any query result sets, and we do 
not
define greater-than or less-than operators for pattern matching.

We think that we need only to insure that any information intended for 
user
comprehension should be expressed in a way that makes it possible to 
display
the information in any desired writing system and language.  The proposed
internationalization requirement is the following:

"All information intended for user comprehension must be expressed in one 
of
the ISO-10646 character sets and must have a language tag."

------------

Reservations

The consensus of the group at Orem was to leave the reservations section
separate, as it is now, and to continue to use the same terminology.  The
locking draft will discuss the standard use of the word "reservation" and
explain how the shared lock satisfies the need for reservations.

The language of 5.4.1.1 will change to make it clear that the point of
reservations is to inform other users, not the server, of an intent to 
edit.
The new 5.4.1.1 will say:

"It must be possible for a principal to register with the server an intent
to edit a given resource, so that other principals can discover who 
intends
to edit the resource."
