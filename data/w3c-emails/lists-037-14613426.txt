I don't accept the argument that this is complicated. If you can generate this list of URLs when a PUT is attempted then I don't know what is so complicated with redirecting a PUT to the correct language version of the URL if an appropriate header is present (especially if you need to know this in order to be able to provide this content for a GET anyway).

I don't think it is necessary to change the semantics of PUT, it would be good enough to have the ability to obtain a list of the language versions of a document i.e. give me list of the languages and the  mapping between each language and its source URL for a given negotiated (or source) URL. The client would then be able to construct the correct PUT command and no modifications to PUT would be necessary.

I am more prepared to accept the argument that an author is likely to know how her particular server maps a negotiated URL onto a particular source URL for a given language although this prevents the writing of an authoring client which allows for the authoring of multilingual resources in a user friendly way.

Cheers
Dylan
