It might be that there are many other scenarios for content negotaiation and I realise that we won't be able to satisfy all of them but accept-language is standardised so we should support it.

Precisely

I've come to the conclusion that as long as it is possible to get at the
individual variants when necessary, and determine exactly what variants there
are, and to not check out an URL that has variants under it (because one could
end up in the bizzare position of using one set of client settings to check it
out and another to check it in and having the wrong variant get updated),
it is really up to the application built on top of the protocol to sort
this all out. 

How is the application going to "sort it out" if it there is no standardisation on what the variants represent?

Cheers
Dylan
