That is why we have a WebDAV working group.  Both the 300 and 406
response bodies were left unspecified because the intention was that
they be specified by a group that actually had time to study the
problem in detail and come up with a [hopefully] better solution
than some off-the-cuff invention of mine.  It was one of the WebDAV
to-do items, last time I checked.
