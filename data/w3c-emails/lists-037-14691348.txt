Many thanks for this information. If we assume that the response
bodies to be designed will include language information (or any
other information needed for other kinds of variants) in an uniform
way (which should not be too difficult for language information),
then this should mean that reasonable clients can be written that
do whatever necessary for language variants, without knowing the
naming scheme used at the server for distinguishing language
variants, FOR ALL THOSE VARIANTS THAT ARE ALREADY EXISTING.

Not yet covered is the creation of new variants, but this should
also be covered. Otherwise, we have a half-way solution of rather
limited usability. So we need some way of asking the server:
"What actual URL would you give to a Spanish version of this
document" so that we can later do a post on this actual URL
and the document is correctly created, or it has to be possible
to do a POST directly on the "abstract" URL with "Content-Language: es"
and get the right actual URL created. Figuring out the actual
URL may indeed not be easy for the server, but if the server can't,
who would?


Regards,Martin.
