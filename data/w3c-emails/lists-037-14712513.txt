 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring 
 and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.                                 

       Title     : Requirements for Distributed Authoring and 
                   Versioning on the World Wide Web

Current World Wide Web (WWW or Web) standards provide simple support for 
applications which allow remote editing of typed data. In practice, the 
existing capabilities of the WWW have proven inadequate to support 
efficient, scalable remote editing free of overwriting conflicts.  This 
document presents a list of features in the form of requirements which, if 
implemented, would improve the efficiency of common remote editing 
operations, provide a locking mechanism to prevent overwrite conflicts, 
improve link management support between non-HTML data types, provide a 
simple attribute-value metadata facility, provide for the creation and 
reading of container data types, and integrate versioning into the WWW.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-01.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
