I have to concur that generalized transaction support should not be
pursued by this working group.  General transaction support is a hard
problem ("Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques" (a good guide
to the issues) is over 1000 pages, not just a journal article).  It will
likely take a look at the whole issue before transaction processing can
be added to HTTP.  (It may even take HTTP 2.0 to do so.)
