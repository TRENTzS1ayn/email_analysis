I think you are confused about the use of the word transactions. (perhaps
our fault). We refer to cooerpative transactions, not the kind that is
refered to in Gray's book. There is a good survey article by Gail Kaiser on
the book "Modern Database Systems", ed: Won Kim. You can also find the same
article on the web at cs.columbia.edu.
