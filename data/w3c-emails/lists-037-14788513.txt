1. Atomic Locking - The problem is that a single server's namespace is
often controlled by many different programs. Therefore it is usually
impossible for any single program to enforce locking across all the
available namespaces. This forces us into an "arbitrator" model of
locking where an arbitrator accepts a request to lock a list of
resources and then locks those resources, atomically, on your behalf.
However, as previously pointed out, it may not be possible for any
single program to lock resources across the expanse of the namespace on
a single server. Thus the client will have to discover which arbitrators
handle which namespaces and then determine if any single arbitrator
covers all the resources the client wishes to atomically lock.
As such I do not believe we will be able to resolve the atomic
locking issue until we have had a chance to write up some real code and
see just how ugly the problem really is. This probably means we should
put in some wishy washy language saying something like "It is a goal to
product an atomic multiple resource locking system if a reasonable
implementation can be agreed upon."

2. Search - I believe that we should remove this requirement and move
the issue to another group. There is no reason to separate the search
problem into two rather arbitrary partitions. We should keep the problem
whole and tackle it in either another requirement/protocol doc within
this group or in another group all together.

3. Internationalization - Agreed.
