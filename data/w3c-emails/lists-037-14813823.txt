So the essence of the problem is that a requirement which is 
unimplementable shouldn't be in the requirements document. This boils down 
to whether we should require server implementors to include an atomic 
locking capability in their systems.  I think we need some feedback from 
list participants with server experience to determine how to proceed.

I have asked the Area Directors for their opinion on whether they would 
favor extending the charter of the working group to handle cross-resource 
searching, and Keith Moore's response was:

Based on this, and on the current wording of our charter, I feel that 
searching properties and links on a single resource is OK, but 
across-resource searching is beyond our scope, and is not likely not become 
part of our scope.  I feel the requirements should reflect this.

The advantage of the current language is that people understand exactly 
what is required -- my fear is that if we relax the language on the 
requirement, we may bite off more than we expected.  However, I'm all in 
favor of more abstract language for the requirement, so long as the 
implementation only requires using ISO 10646 encoding.  Would someone like 
to take a stab at rephrasing the requirement?
