Below is my recommendation for the agenda for the Munich WEBDAV working 
group meeting.  Looking through the list of registered attendees for the 
meeting, I see very few familiar names from previous WEBDAV meetings.  As a 
result, I predict that most of the attendees at the meeting in Munich will 
be attending a WEBDAV meeting for the first time, hence the emphasis on 
education in the agenda below.

The WEBDAV WG meeting is scheduled for Monday, August 11, at 13:00 in the 
Chiemsee room of the Munich Sheraton. The duration of the meeting is 2 
hours.

Agenda:

13:00 Overview presentation on Properties, Containers, Locking (1 hr., 
Whitehead)
14:00 Open discussion on draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-00.txt, focusing on 
properties and collections issues (40 min.)
14:40 Discussion of open issues in the requirements document (20 min.)

If you have an item you would like to discuss, or feel this schedule should 
be modified, please send me an email at <ejw@ics.uci.edu>.
