I've given up on search, and am assuming that it will be out of scope for
WEBDAV.  (To repeat my understanding of what search is: it's the ability to
get a list of the resources in a given name space that have properties
matching the search criteria I set out.)

What I want to focus on now is what it would take to satisfy the requirement
to be able to retrieve the properties of a resource.  We've left the
requirement vague enough that we have lots of room for debate.  Here are
some possible interpretations, more or less from weakest to strongest.  

1. If you know the name of a property instance, you can retrieve it.

(Section 2.6.2 GET of the current draft satisfies this.)

2. You can retrieve several properties of a resource at once if you know
their names.

(Section 2.6.5 SEARCH of the current draft satisfies this.)

3. You can retrieve all the properties of a resource, without knowing their
names.

(Although the current draft does not explicitly say that you can do this,
one of the examples in 2.6.2.1 shows this happening in response to "GET
bar;DAV/".  So I assume we expect to satisfy this.)

4a. You can find out the names of all the properties on a resource, in order
to retrieve the particular ones that interest you using 1.  You can find out
which property schemas the resource supports, and retrieve all properties in
a given schema.

(There is no support for 4a that I can see in the current draft.)

4b. You can retrieve the properties of a resource that meet specified
conditions.  This allows you to retrieve properties without knowing their
names in advance.  You may want to know the author of a resource, but not
know the spelling of the property name that will get it for you, so you ask
to retrieve "*author*".

(Section 2.6.5 of the current draft satisfies this, but I hear you saying
that you want to change the definition of Match-String in 2.6.5.2.6, so that
it will no longer be possible to use "*" or "?" to give approximate names of
the properties you want to retrieve.)



My view is that there absolutely has to be some way to retrieve the
properties of a resource without knowing ahead of time what all their names
are.  If we satisfy 1 - 3 above, we have that in sort of a clunky way.  

I think we would be better off if we supported 4a or 4b as well, so that
people weren't forced to retrieve all the property names and values, and
sort through them on the client side, just to get the value of a property
whose exact name they don't know.  You can imagine applications wanting to
be able to get the name of each property on a resource, together with a
human-readable display name, in order to show the list to users and let them
select what they want to see.
