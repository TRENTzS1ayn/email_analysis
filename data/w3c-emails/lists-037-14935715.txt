My proposed solution is to drop the SEARCH method and replace it with a
GETPROPS method that takes as its argument an XML body containing a
series of PROP elements which contain the names of the properties to be
retrieved. Please note that these are the abstract names of the
properties, such as http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/source not the URL
which referes to that property on that specific resource. Thus I can
retrieve a property without having to know the name of the property as
defined on that resource, all I need is the generic name of the
property.
