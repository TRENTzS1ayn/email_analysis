Having an arbitrator for locking multiple resources and the server for locking single resources is very contrived and doesn't make sense. The locking part of the standard is anyway optional (the single axis of negotiation) so if a server doesn't want to implement it it doesn't have to but if it does then WebDAV should specify a consistent standard method by which this can be implemented. If you want an arbitrator for locking multiple resources then it should be used for locking single resources too.

Cheers

I suspect we will end up with a LOCK implementation where you have the
concept of a LOCK arbitrator who accepts a list of resources to be
locked and then locks them on your behalf in an atomic fashion. Of
course this means discovering who the lock arbitrator is for all the
involved resources, assuming one arbitrator can cover them all.
Alternatively one can discover what arbitrators exist for a particular
server and what namespaces they cover on that server. Either way, I
suspect most folks will simply lock each resource individually.
