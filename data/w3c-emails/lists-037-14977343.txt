I agree that it would be too difficult to handle variants in general however language variants are a special case which would be easy to handle. There is always a one-to-one relationship between any given resource and its corresponding translation to another given language and the server is currently required to understand this relationship in order to handle the accept-language header correctly.

Um.. not that I'm aware. We decided very early on to not deal with
variants. It brought up too many ugly issues. In fact, the problem most
likely would require the introduction of a Turing complete scripting
language. Even TCN is not powerful enough to capture all the possible
issues.

Either way it was felt that we got a big enough win just solving the
non-variant scenarios that it was worth achieving that goal rather than
being hopelessly lost in an unending morass of negotiation specification
issues.
