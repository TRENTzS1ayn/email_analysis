This is the reason for having an arbitrator for multiple resource locking but not the reason for distinguishing between single and multiple resource locking. I think WebDAV should always use the arbitrator (specifying where the arbritrator is located or how it can be located) with an XML request body (this draft anyway contains enough XML) containing one or more URIs representing the resources to be locked.

It is not a matter of advantage, it is a matter of HTTP's design. HTTP
can only deliver a single message to a single destination. It does not
have multicast or broadcast capabilities. As such without transactioning
the only way to deliver a message to multiple resources in an atomic
fashion is to have the message delivered through some mechanism other
than HTTP. What the arbitrator does is act as the resource which can
access that out of band mechanism.

In the case of trying to atomically lock a single resource one can skip
the out of band mechanism since HTTP does support sending a single
message to a single recipient.
