I disagree with the statement that we do the world a disservice by implementing a solution for language variants only. I think that this would be doing those authors out there (most large coporations web authors) who have to develop and maintain multilingual web sites a great service.

It is not enough to say "Here are the different languages this document
is available in." You must also tie that into all the other axis's of
variation including CPU needed to execute, software required to read,
format, encoding, etc. We do the world a disservice if we try to solve
language variation independently of general variation. 

In addition, given the complexity of the issues and the varying
requirements from supporting variation on a single axis to supporting
variation on multiple independent axis's, I do not believe we are ready
to come out with a coherent standard. 

Variation is something the net does not do particular well. I think the
HTTP standard's attempts to deal with the problem have demonstrated
that. I can only speak from my personal experience trying to implement
HTTP on IE 4.0, a browser which is internationalized into some large
number of languages, but we were forced to cut support for the Vary
header and quality numbers from the get go. I think this problem needs
to age more, better consensus as to what the key features are need to be
developed, and then we can discuss standardization.

Standards never lead, they only follow.
