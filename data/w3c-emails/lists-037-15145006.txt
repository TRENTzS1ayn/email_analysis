Dylan,

My sense of the working group is that most members do not want to address 
the issue of providing authoring support for language variants in the first 
rev. of the WebDAV specification.  I have received this impression at both 
the Palo Alto meeting, and also at the Orem working group meeting.  Given 
this, if you wish to prosecute your position on language variant authoring 
support, I recommend that you produce some concrete recommendations for a) 
requirements, and b) protocol support required to implement this 
capability.  The best avenue for publishing such a recommendation would be 
an Internet Draft.  I can point you at instructions for creating I-Ds if 
you are unfamiliar with them.

Without such a concrete recommendation, it will be difficult for you to 
convince the working group to support such capability, especially since I 
believe there currently exists rough consensus *not* to support authoring 
of language variants.  You are also free to demonstrate to me that language 
variant authoring support is indeed desired by more than just two (vocal) 
members of the mailing list, but to date I have seen no such evidence.
