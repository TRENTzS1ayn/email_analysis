A new version of the spec should be coming out after Munich that will
provide significantly better support for compound documents. As for
variants, the problem there is that we are forcing our way into server
configuration and I do not believe that this is an appropriate area for
us to stick our noses. Still, I think it would be great to see some
proposals on how we could implement full variant support, we could then
go to the server folk with it and see what they think.
