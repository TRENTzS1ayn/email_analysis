Speaking as one of the "server folk", this sounds like a very sensible
suggestion. It seems to me that variant support can reasonably be
abstracted from most of the rest of server config, except, err, variant
support. The interesting question is one of efficiency - how does the
server know a resource varies without taking a double filesystem hit for
_every_ access? Well ... that's one of the interesting questions.

Cheers,

Ben.
