Some recommendations for how to settle the requirements open issues are 
presented below.

This issue was discussed during the WEBDAV working group meeting at the 
Munich IETF.  I proposed the following way of handling this issue:

- Keep the requirement as-is, since there is wide agreement on the need for 
the requirement
- Try to develop a means for satisfying this requirement in the 
specification
- Recognize that it may not be possible to satisfy this requirement, and 
move on

Attendees at the meeting were in favor of this solution.

Yesterday I attended a BOF on character set issues at which Harald 
Alvestrand gave a presentation on the proposed IETF policy for character 
set issues.  Although this has not yet been approved, it appears likely 
that the policy will involve supporting UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 
character set information, along with language tagging such information 
using RFC 1766 language tagging.  The most recent draft of this policy is 
draft-alvestrand-charset-policy-00.txt available in the internet-drafts 
directory at ds.internic.net.

Also at this BOF I was introduced to just how contentious these issues an 
be, and how carefully i18n requirements must be worded.

As a result, I propose that our requirements document simply reference the 
(emerging) IETF charset policy, making the requirement something like, 
"Since web distributed authoring occurs in a multi-lingual environment, 
text data which is intended for human use must conform to the IETF 
Character Set Policy."
