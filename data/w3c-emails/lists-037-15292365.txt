There were three presentations made at the Munich IETF meeting. The first 
presentation was a repeat of the high-level WebDAV overview talk which was 
given at the Memphis IETF meeting, to orient newcomers to the group.

The second presentation was an overview of the design of the properties, 
collections, and namespace operations in the current specification.  This 
presentation is available at:
