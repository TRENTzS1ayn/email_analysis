Some people were wondering about standards for search; here's one with a
reference implementation and a set of standard metadata.

This message is intended for all those who have an interest in:

-    the STARTS project (Stanford Protocol for Internet Search and
Retrieval) located at: 
         http://www-db.stanford.edu/~gravano/starts_home.html

-    the Dublin Core, Warwick Framework and related work 

The STARTS reference implementation has been enhanced and is available
for your evaluation at:
http://www2.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/starts/starts_reference.htm

Carl Lagoze developed the original reference implementation in
accordance with the STARTS protocol.  Carl and I planned the changes for
this new release, and I have just completed the work described below.
For those of you who know Carl, but don't know me, I am the new
researcher in Carl's Digital Library Research Group at Cornell
University.  

This version of the STARTS reference implementation was inspired by our
desire to support the Dublin Core attribute set in addition to the
"basic-1" attribute set that was developed with the STARTS protocol.
While conceiving of the changes required to allow the introduction of
the Dublin Core to the existing STARTS reference implementation, we
began to consider an attribute set as an abstraction in itself.
Influenced by the proposed container architecture described in the
Warwick Framework, we now regard an attribute set as a first class
object that has a relationship with a STARTS source, but is not part of
the source itself. Consistent with this perspective, we created STARTS
1.1 which is a first step in making the reference implementation
compliant with the evolving notion of metadata packages in a container
architecture. 

This version of the reference implementation achieves the following
specific goals: 

   1.Attribute sets are first class objects that can be linked to one or
more STARTS sources.   
   2.STARTS sources can support one or more attribute sets 
   3.STARTS queries can handle explicit attribute set qualifiers on
fields 
   4.STARTS results can report fields from one or more attribute sets


Please take time to review the new release of the reference
implementation.  All comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome!  

Regards,
Sandy
