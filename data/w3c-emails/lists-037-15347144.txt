Unfortunately I have been remiss in starting another focus period.  Many 
thanks to Judith and Dylan for their comments during the last focus period 
on properties.

From August 18 through September 5, the working group "focus section" of 
the protocol specification are Sections 4 (State Tokens) and 5 (Locking). 
While comments on any aspect of the specification are welcome during this 
period, the intent is to focus attention on the locking section, and to 
elicit comments on this part of the draft.

Please send your comments on the locking section to the mailing list.

- Jim
