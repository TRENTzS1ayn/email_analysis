I'd like to know more about what happened at Munich relative to recursive
operations on collections.

How will copy, move, delete, lock work for collections in webdav?  What is
being moved to a separate spec?  What schedule will that separate spec be
on?  Will it be developed by the webdav working group?  What will be its
relationship to webdav?

I'm especially concerned because recursive operations were one of the things
that made collections attractive as a way of managing compound documents.
Recursion would have made it possible to move, copy, etc., an entire
compound document in one step -- to treat it as a single object.
