Great questions.  Some replies.

Short answer: recursive operation for copy, move, lock, and delete are 
being moved to a separate specification.  At present, the DAV protocol 
spec. will only specify level 0 operations (or should it be level infinity 
operations?)

This is the focus of the new specification, which will start using the 
recursive operation descriptions in draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-01.txt as 
its base, as modified by discussion at Orem.

This is still TBD, but I hope this spec. will pop out the door a few months 
after the base specification. I still need to work out with Saveen Reddy a 
schedule for development of this document.

Yes.  This is still within our charter -- it's just a spec. 
packaging/timing issue.

Recursive operations will not be ignored, they will just be developed at a 
slower rate than the base specification.  The intent of this decision is to 
remove a contentious item from the base specification to allow it to 
progress faster.  What I have been hearing from vendors interested in 
implementing WebDAV is the need for speed so that WebDAV doesn't miss the 
next round of development cycles.

This isn't a repeat of SEARCH, which grew so big it needs its own working 
group.
