Both Martin and Yaron are missing the point here. WebDAV is not only ment to
version Web pages, but instead if versioning documents. In that respect Martin
is right: variants are an integral and very important aspect of versioning, as
well as authoring. Therefore, regardless of the answers to the above questions,
I can point you to the series of SCM workshops that contains a large body of
literature on variants and its importance in versioning and development.

AS WebDAV is supposed to be generic, i.e., any type of document can be 
handlded by it, this issue should be addressed.

PS: One question of Yaron I just have to answer: "How many web sites use 
    variants as opposed to "choose English here" tag?". If there would 
    be adequate support for the handling of variants, all these web sites
    *would* use variants; but given the lack of adequate support, they
    are not. Boom, there is your requirement......
