In so far as I am concerned a variant is simply "yet another version"
and requires no special handling outside of the normal versioning
mechanisms.

As for your assertion Andre, that if web sites had proper variant tools
they would use them, this would contradict your previous statement that
variant support is widespread through versioning systems. Most major
versioning systems hook directly into the Internet, so apparently
variant support isn't so terribly important.

Let us be clear on the issue, variant supports means creating mechanisms
which allow for a client to instruct a server on how it should handle
accept headers. I believe this to be a server configuration issue and
out of scope for WebDAV.
