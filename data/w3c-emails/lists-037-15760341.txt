And the body of literature I just pointed you to says exactly the opposite: 
variants handling requires special constructs and variants are not "simply 
just another version".

No contradiction whatsoever. There are namely two ways CM systems hook into 
the web:

   * they have some applet or HTTP FORMS thingy that allows their CM policy to
     be enforced. This is totally orthogonal to what WebDAV is trying to do.
   * they manage a set of web pages by some simple extension to the URL
     mechanism. Given the limited power of URL's, variants handling is totally
     out of the question (and so are lots of other CM processes etc).

Thus, the problem of making variants explicit in HTTP, and adding it as a 
primitive to the protocol has not been solved yet, and that is what WebDAV 
should be addressing.

Well, this is your opinion. I believe Judith, Martin, and I have a compeltely different definition of variants, and I believe WebDAV should at least address the issues we raise.
