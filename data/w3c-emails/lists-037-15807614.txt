Wrong use of the word "definition" here. You have not defined variants, you have given a restrictive solution to the variant problem and proclaimed that that is the definition. That is wrong. For example, versioning is not defined the same way in WebDAV either. You don't say "check-out" and "check-in" define versioning, but instead you list a versioning requirement and say that a limited solution to this is provided by the WebDAV standard through the solution "check-out" and "check-in". Similarly, we are asking for the WebDAV group to do the same thing for variants.

We are both talking about exactly the same concepts here:

   A variant is a structurally different, but functionally equivalent 
   document.

I can't find the original Tichy definition here, but the spirit is the above.

However, you have given a solution, that many of us don't feel appropriate. What we are asking for is for WebDAV to come up with a broader solution, that does not limit itself.
