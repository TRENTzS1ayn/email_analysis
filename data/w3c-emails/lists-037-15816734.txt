I know, I made the same mistake that everyone else did. In the first
paragraph you site I was using the term variant in the way that I think
you and Andre mean it. Of course that road leads to madness. That is why
I later defined the word variant as I understand its meaning in HTTP.
However matters only get worse because the definition given in the HTTP
spec does not necessarily match the common usage of the term in the HTTP
working group.

So might I suggest we all put our definitions down on the table so we at
least have some clue as to what we are talking about?

When I speak of "variant support" I am specifically speaking of putting
in place commands which instruct a server how it should handle accept*
headers. Thus if a client puts up a document and marks it as "the French
variant" it is expected that if the server receives accept-language:
(whatever the hell the French code is), it will return the French
version. It is this behavior which I do not wish to have specified by
DAV because I believe this is more server configuration than document
authoring. Document authoring is creating a document and putting
properties on it. One of those properties could even be "Language". But
it says nothing about how a server will server up that document. Only
that if you get the URL you PUT the document to, you will get the
document back.
