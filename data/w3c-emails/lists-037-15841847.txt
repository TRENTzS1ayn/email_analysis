Not necessarily, that is the road that the Configuration Management community 
has been taking for the past 20 years since it has been defined by Tichy the 
way I described. It has been non-confusing, non-madness, and commonly 
understood throughout the software development community to have this meaning.

I have done so.

Again, you define variant in terms of a *solution*. We are talking about a requirements document here, which should have nothing to do with accept headers etc., but instead should contain an abstract definition.

Also, one of properties WebDAV is talking about is versioning. You create a separate mechanism for that, and the server is supposed to serve up particular versions. Sounds like exactly the same problem to me, but in one case you dismiss giving a solution and put it as "server-issue", in the other case you completely embrace a solution (i.e., the versioning HTTP primitives bing created). To me there is no reason to make this distinction.
