Also Judith, the new specification actually makes it easier to deal with
compound documents. One of the discoveries of the arguments over depth
is that compound documents are not collections. Just because something
responds to INDEX, which a compound document can, does not mean it is a
collection. A collection has additional behaviors, such as supporting
addref and delref, which compound documents do not necessarily have. As
such if you copy the URL of a compound document, you copy the entire
document. If, on the other hand, you did an INDEX and got a URL to
chapter 1 of the compound document and then copied that URL, you would
only copy chapter 1.

You need to think it through a couple of times before the logic all
makes sense but then I think you will find it is a more natural way to
manipulate compound documents.
