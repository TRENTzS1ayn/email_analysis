This is clearly a 'willing misunderstanding'. The question is about the
preparation (authoring) of material that is suitable for delivery to
different kinds of recipients. Multipurpose authoring using HTML is a
boon, but we still see HDML, style sheets, etc. being prepared to allow
documents to be tuned to the various characteristics of the recipient.

Delivery of suitable documents to a requestor is the realm of HTTP, and
authoring of the content of Web servers is the realm of WebDAV. You
might not want to chew off too much for the first version of WebDAV, but
then that's an issue of schedule.

WindowsCE devices will want different material than Windows devices,
and  in some cases, you'll want to author it specially. (Wasn't MSIE
sending the screen resolution in the user agent field at some point? How
could you author content that could make use of that?)

Printers seem to have as much variability as displays, in terms of
resolution, color capability, etc., but it's just the same issue.
