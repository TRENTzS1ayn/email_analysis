There is an enormous variability and unusual constraints in many server
configurations about how they can and can't spell their URLs. Any
attempt to standardize URL-mangling will constrain origin servers unduly
and unnecessarily, and restrict (without good reason) the nature of
sites that you can automatically author against.
