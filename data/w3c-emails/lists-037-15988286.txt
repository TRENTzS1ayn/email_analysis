For more information, including an example to see how this can
be implemented, please see
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_negotiation.html
and
http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html
Please note that both Apache itself (in the details of
the Apache Negotiation Algorithm) and the webmaster have
considerable freedom with regards to both server organization
(i.e. which variants have what names) and server behaviour
(i.e. what exactly is returned on a client request).
I agree with Larry that we don't want to restrict this.

Regards,Martin.
