There seems to be a bit of a hole in the draft in its current form with regard to locks and reservations which needs to be filled. We need to specify - either in the requirements document or in the spec - what happens to locks and reservations when a resource or collection of resources is copied and/or moved. The issue becomes problematic when you consider that the current definition of MOVE is a COPY followed by a DELETE and when you consider the issue of multi-resource locking.

I don't know what the consensus is among the server folks but it seems to me that some of the server implementations might have problems dealing with these issues.

The simplest solution seems to me to do the following

1. Disallow moving of locked or reserved resources (or at least resource locked as part of a multi.-resource lock)
2. Specifically state that the correct behaviour in the case of a COPY is to NOT copy the locks or reservations.
3. Change the definition of MOVE to be independent of COPY

Cheers
