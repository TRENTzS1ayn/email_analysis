-------------------
[my opinion!]:  destructive operations on the *original* resource
should be disallowed.  destructive op's on a *copy* of the orig
resource should be allowed, unless the copy is subsequently locked...

------------
agreed.


> 3. Change the definition of MOVE to be independent of COPY
-----------------
definition should be independant, but implementation *could* be
performed as described or otherwise, as long as it's transparent
to the user...

just my $0.02...
