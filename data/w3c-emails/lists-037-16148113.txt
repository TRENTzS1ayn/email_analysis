I prefer to think of variants as independent URIs which can be manipulated through commands on the "master" URI i.e. allow for variants to be discovered with commands like "give me the list of variants on this URI" or "Add this resource as a German translation variant for this URI". These commands could then be performed on the result of previous discovery commands which would then allow a client to discover as many levels of the variant tree from a master URI as it requires and manipulate them in any way required.

The server would be responsible for the URI construction.

This should be flexible enough to be used for all sorts of variants (eg master document is a Word97 English document with HTML and PDF renditions and a German Word97 translation. The German translation could then also have HTML and PDF renditions which would be manipulated via the discovered German URI)

I think this is the only way to deal with the problem properly
