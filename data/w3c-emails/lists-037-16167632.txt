Apache is not, of course, "commercial" in the sense that Yaron probably
meant - the fact that many, many commercial sites use it is probably
considered irrelevant.

However, I fail to see that "commercial" has any bearing whatsoever on
the issue.

Variant support in Apache is certainly sufficiently widely used that we
have had to work on it several times over the years.

Some sites actually use both - you get the language you prefer by
default, but can force a different one by choosing the appropriate
language link (see www.iigs.org, for example - quite a cute trick, I
thought).
