It sounds as if Dylan, Martin, and I are in agreement that, while we want
WEBDAV to standardize some mechanisms for authoring renditions, we don't
want to hold up the core WEBDAV spec.  We would all be happy to see
renditions addressed in a separate spec, still under the auspices of the
WEBDAV working group.  What do others think?

I just want to emphasize my own opinion that it's critical for us to stay on
schedule with the core specification, which probably means we should limit
it to its present content: properties and links, collections (without
recursion) and namespace operations, locking and reservations, and versioning.

Recursion and variants can come later.  Where does access control fit into
the schedule?

Dylan and Martin, I'm taking your comments home for the holiday. Till next
week . . .
