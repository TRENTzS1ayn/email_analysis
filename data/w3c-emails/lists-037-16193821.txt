Actually, the present specification does address the interactions of LOCK, 
COPY, MOVE, and DELETE.  Section 5.2.4, Interaction With Other Methods, 
currently states:

5.2.4     Interaction with other Methods

            Only two methods, MOVE and DELETE, have side effects which
            involve locks. When a resource is moved, its lock SHOULD be
            moved with it. However this may not always be possible and
            there is currently no proposal to create a header which
            would specify that the lock request should fail if the
            resource's locks can not be maintained. A COPY MUST NOT copy
            any locks on the source resource over to the destination
            resource. Deleting a resource MUST remove all locks on the
            resource.

There has been some discussion concerning whether a lock should remain the 
same after a move (i.e., after the move you have the same lock on the same 
resource, only there is a new name for the resource).  My view is that 
since a move just renames the resource, the lock should still exist after 
the move.  However, this does disagree with the definition of move as a 
copy followed by a delete of the source, since copy should definitely not 
duplicate the lock.  My solution is to fudge this issue, and state that a 
move is a copy followed by a delete, except that the lock is transferred 
intact from the source to the destination.  While this gets the expected 
functionality (the lock follows the resource), it does create a certain 
inelegance in the definition of MOVE.

Also, where did you look for definitions of interactions between locks and 
other methods -- perhaps this section of the spec. should be located in a 
different part of the spec. (perhaps divided up and associated with COPY, 
MOVE, and DELETE?)

specify - either in the requirements document or in the spec - what happens 
to locks and reservations when a resource or collection of resources is 
copied and/or moved. The issue becomes problematic when you consider that 
the current definition of MOVE is a COPY followed by a DELETE and when you 
consider the issue of multi-resource locking.
