I am uncomforatble with the idea of a lock moving with a resource.  If the proposed semantics of move as "a copy followed by a delete" stands, then an authenticated client requesting a move with the appropriate lock token would anticipate the object to be where the move so directed (sans lock).  Thus, the lock acts simply as a collision aviodance mechanism over the lifetime of the copy and delete processes (whatever those entail).

To put it succinctly, "Locks on an object are lost when you move it.  ..."
