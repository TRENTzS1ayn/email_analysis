Th behaviour of removing a lock when moving a resource is bound to result in overwrite conflicts due to locks being inadvertantly lost through some structural re-organisation. This will also require that only the owner of the lock be able to move the resource which is unnecessarily restrictive in a shared authoring environment where one individual might be responsible for content and another for structure. 

This is very common in Web authoring.

I am uncomforatble with the idea of a lock moving with a resource.  If the proposed semantics of move as "a copy followed by a delete" stands, then an authenticated client requesting a move with the appropriate lock token would anticipate the object to be where the move so directed (sans lock).  Thus, the lock acts simply as a collision aviodance mechanism over the lifetime of the copy and delete processes (whatever those entail).

To put it succinctly, "Locks on an object are lost when you move it.  ..."
