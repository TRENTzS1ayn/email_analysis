It seems to me that you are using the terms version, variant and configuration in some strange ways.

e.g.
>Accessing multiple variants -- for an individual object, isn't that

Here you are confusing version with variant.

I think when you talk of configurations (at least from what has been said in this email) you are actually talking about a logical group of variants (e.g. A Word Document (source), its HTML and PDF renditions) which are all semantically equivalent. As far as I can tell this is what we refer to as the variants of a resource we just don't yet have a name for the group as a whole.

Does anyone disagree?

I find the concept quite interesting especially with respect to publication.

Cheers
Dylan
