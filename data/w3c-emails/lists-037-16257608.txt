Th behaviour of removing a lock when moving a resource is bound to result in
overwrite conflicts due to locks being inadvertantly lost through some
structural re-organisation. This will also require that only the owner of the
lock be able to move the resource which is unnecessarily restrictive in a
shared authoring environment where one individual might be responsible for
content and another for structure.
--------
I would say that a  lock must be retained when a resource is moved.  This
is something of a grey area WRT locks and the prevention of overwriting of
content.  The main purpose of the lock is to maintain the consistency of
content when one author out of potentially many is modifying the content.
This prevention of other authors modifying the content must be maintained
whether or not an administrator decides to move the entire resource to some
other location.  Note that this isn't dangerous to the content, unless the
lock is NOT maintained.  I would argue that the lock should simply be
moved with the resource, which allows administrators the freedom to do
their jobs without interfering with the maintenance of the consistency of
content, which is the job the lock does for multiple authors.
