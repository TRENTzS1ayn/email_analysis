It should be more closely specified what happens with the lock on a resource if
it is moved and the cannot be maintained. This is especially important with
multi-resource locks. In this case I believe it would be better to require the
MOVE to fail.
------------------------

I agree that the move should probably fail if locks can't be maintained on
whatever the logical resource is, be it singular or otherwise.  If not it
means that moving a resource, which should be a non issue, can be very
dangerous to the maintenance of content, which doesn't seem very sensible
to me...
