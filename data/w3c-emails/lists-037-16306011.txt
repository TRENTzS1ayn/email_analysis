Obviously, today is silly question day:

In any system (such as Unix) where I can create aliases or symbolic
links to a file, AND where the file system treats the link/alias as
if it were the file it referenced, ..

.. suppose I have a file /a/b/c and a symbolic link to that file 
/a/X/Y/Z, AND I request/get a lock on /a/b/c, .. is /a/X/Y/Z locked?

Admitedly, when one moves a file (in Unix, at least), what one does
is create a new directory entry for the file, deleting the old directory
entry, and the physical file doesn't actually move at all.  Thus, one
could treat MOVe as a special case of DELETE for these purposes.

But, when I create an alias, .. the original directory entry is still there.
