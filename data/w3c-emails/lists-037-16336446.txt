Thank you Judith for generating a new draft of the requirements document!

Since there are currently no open issues in the requirements document, and 
since I feel the document substantially reflects the rough consensus of the 
WebDAV working group, I hereby move the document, "Requirements for 
Distributed Authoring and Versioning on the World Wide Web," 
<draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-02.txt>, to working group last call status.

This begins an approximately two week long period for solicitation of final 
comments on the requirements document.  The working group last call will 
end Friday, September 19, 1997.  At the end of the working group last call 
period, a new revision of the document will be produced which will reflect 
consensus agreement on needed modifications.  Once this new version 
(draft-03) has been created, I will call for working group consensus on the 
requirements draft.  If I judge there is rough consensus within the working 
group on the requirements document at this time, I will then forward it to 
the IESG for consideration as an Informational RFC.

An HTML version of the draft is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/requirements/draft-ietf-webdav-req  
uirements-02.html

A text version of the draft is available at:

uirements-02.txt
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-02.txt

Process details on submitting a draft as an RFC can be found in RFC 1603, " 
IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures," in RFC 2026, "The Internet 
Standards Process -- Revision 3", and in RFC 2028, "The Organizations 
Involved in the IETF Standards Process."  Also affecting this review is RFC 
1543, "Instructions to RFC Authors."  RFCs can be retrieved via anonymous 
FTP to ds.internic.net, in the rfc directory.
