A new version of the protocol draft is now available.  Many thanks to Del 
Jensen for his work editing the draft!

The draft can be retrieved at:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-02.txt
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoco  
l-02.txt

For reasons unknown to me, the availability of the draft was not annouced 
by the IETF when it was place in the Internet-Drafts directory.

This draft incorporates changes to properties functionality which are a 
direct result of feedback received at the Orem meeting, the Munich meeting, 
and discussion on the list.  The remainder of the draft has not been 
substantially altered since the -01 draft, and hence the collections, 
namespace operations, and locking sections have not yet been updated based 
on group feedback.  Work is currently underway to update the remainder of 
the draft.

Major changes to property functionality include:
 - The SEARCH method was removed and replaced by PROPFIND, which can 
retrieve all properties on a resource, only named properties on a resource, 
and all property names on a resource
 - Changed examples to be correct XML
 - Removed ;DAV parameter
 - Added the PropLoc attribute to return the location of a property on a 
particular resource
 - The XML description appendicies were removed
 - Introduced a new Prop element format
 - Property values are now a single well-formed XML element, rather than an 
entire XML document
 - Changed application/xml to text/xml
 - Created PropSchema and related elements to describe schema members
 - Ressurected the Mandatory header from an early HTTP/1.1 draft
