FYI,

The correct way to be removed from this mailing list is to send an email 
to:

w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org

With subject of "unsubscribe".  If you send this request directly to the 
list, I as list maintainer have to manually unsubscribe you, and you also 
look silly since your unsubscription request goes out to all members of the 
list, and is archived, so years from now people will still see your 
unsubscription request.

As a last resort, if your unsubscription request isn't automatically 
handled by the "-request" address, send your request directly to me, 
ejw@ics.uci.edu.
