Or to paraphrase, "what's up with versioning?"

I feel there is a 2-3 week window right now where, if a versioning proposal 
was sent out to the list, and if this proposal then received sufficient 
discussion in the next few months to cause convergence, it could 
conceivably go out in the current protocol draft.  However, I felt this was 
more likely not to happen than likely to happen, and hence I didn't put 
versioning into the schedule.  In the event versioning does not appear in 
the first protocol draft, it will then become a second draft, with a likely 
completion date of next April.  The new requirement to have convergence 
with the DRP effort also adds a new schedule risk for versioning within 
WebDAV.

No matter when a new proposal on versioning is developed, it will have 
dependencies on properties, collections, and locking, so work on these 
aspects of draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-02 moves versioning closer to 
completion.
