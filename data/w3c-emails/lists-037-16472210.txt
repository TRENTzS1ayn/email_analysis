I have been holding off on the discussion period for collections until a 
new draft which incorporates feedback from the Orem and Munich meetings is 
complete.

The issue here is how to bound the size of the index results.  DRP is able 
to bound the size of their index results because this index file can be 
manually created, and because the creator of the index file can ensure that 
it will never become too large.  I don't think DRP is suggesting that their 
index files be used as a general purpose mechanism for retrieving the 
contents of all collections.  Rather, DRP is interested in getting a 
consistent configuration of resources (and their content identifiers) for 
each "channel," which is presumably a smaller set than all possible 
resources on the server.

My fear with returning a full depth infinity index for all cases is that 
some cases (e.g., collections high up in a hierarchy) may return very large 
results, which could cause a problem for low-memory clients.
