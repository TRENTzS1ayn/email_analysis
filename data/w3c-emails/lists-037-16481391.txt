Thanks for your background on the DRP index.

The current version of the WebDAV protocol specification, which includes
collections, can be found at:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-02.txt

Yes.  I was just looking for a single approach that would let you get the
DRP information about each member of the collection, or any other set of
properties for each member of a collection.  If you want it to be really
open-ended, letting the user-agent specify any set of properties it likes,
then you can't have a URL for each possible set of properties, so some
extension to HTTP will be needed.
