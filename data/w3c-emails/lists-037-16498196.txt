As most members of this working group will recall, leading up to the Orem 
working group meeting in July there was significant discussion on the topic 
of access control.  During this period Jon Radoff graciously volunteered 
his time to sift through these discussions and developed a first draft of 
an access control requirements document, which he presented at the Orem 
meeting.  As things were left at the end of the Orem meeting, Jon was to go 
incorporate the feedback he received into a new version of the document, 
and then present it to the list for further discussion.

Unfortunately, as sometimes happens in all-volunteer working groups, Jon 
appears to no longer be able to work on the access control draft.  As a 
consequence, I would like to thank Jon for starting off the discussion on 
this topic, and for the time he spent developing the preliminary access 
control requirements draft, and start the process for finding a new 
volunteer.

I am looking for a volunteer to take on the task of editing the access 
control requirements document (which will become the combined requirements 
plus protocol extensions document for access control).  This job requires 
approximately 20 hours/month, which includes writing and keeping abreast of 
list discussions.

To volunteer, or to find out more of what the position entails, please 
email me at <ejw@ics.uci.edu>.
