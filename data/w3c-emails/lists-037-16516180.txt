To repeat a comment from Orem, we need to be clear about whether every URI
hierarchy will behave like a collection, or only collections that were
created using MKCOL.  This has lots of implications, especially once
recursive operations are defined for collections.  Will those recursive
operations (MOVE, COPY, LOCK, etc.) work for all URI hierarchies, or only
for collections created with MKCOL?  A user can only figure out where he
wants to MOVE or COPY a resource if he can see the context he's operating
in.  We've made a stab at providing this with INDEX, but will it work for
all URI hierarchies, or only for collections created with MKCOL?  etc.

I think that every hierarchy level should be treated as a collection for two reasons

1. It obviates the need for some additional methods to map collection members to hierarchy
2. It would allow servers to be upgraded (in fact it would force WebDAV server implementors to take care of this in their installation scripts) to make use the new WebDAV capabilities without having to retrofit the documents and hierarchies already present.
