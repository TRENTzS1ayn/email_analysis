If the the whole hierarchy is not treated as a collection, you leave open
the possibility of some user confusion.  The namespaces of the URLs and the
collections overlap, but are not identical.  For example, if you have
collection /A you could have /A/B where B is an internal reference and /A/C
where C is not part of the collection, simply part of the URL space.  This
might be useful, but it will certainly be confusing.
