I have made all the changes suggested during the last call period, with the
exception of changing the name of the document from requirements to
recommendations.

To address Roy's concern that someone could misconstrue the document as a
set of compliance requirements on all Internet applications, I would like to
do two things:

1. Change the title to "Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and
Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web"

2. Change the abstract to say "This document presents a list of features in
the form of requirements for a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
protocol which, if implemented, would improve the efficiency of common
remote editing operations, etc., etc."

Yaron's concern about using the term "requirements" is a different one from
Roy's, I think. It is more that we don't want to get ourselves into the bind
of committing to doing things that turn out to be impossible, because of
schedule, resources, or the pure practicalities of implementation. I would
like to address it by changing the Introduction:

3. Add a disclaimer to the Introduction to make it clear that it may not be
possible to satisfy all of these requirements.  So the last paragraph of the
introduction would read:

"This document reflects the consensus of the WWW Distributed Authoring 
and Versioning working group (WebDAV) as to the functionality that should be
standardized to support distributed authoring and versioning on the Web.  As
with any set of requirements, practical considerations may make it
impossible to satisfy them all.  It is the intention of the WebDAV working
group to come as close as possible to satisfying them in the specifications
that make up the WebDAV protocol."
