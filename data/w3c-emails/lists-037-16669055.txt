A new revision of the requirements draft was submitted to the 
Internet-Drafts editor this morning, and should be available from the 
internet-drafts directory of ds.internic.net in a few days.  In the 
meanwhile, I have placed this latest revision on the WebDAV web site, at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/requirements/draft-ietf-webdav-req  
uirements-03.txt
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/requirements/draft-ietf-webdav-req  
uirements-03.html

This does not start the official 3 day final review period -- I am waiting 
until the draft is officially released before that period begins.  However, 
if you have any final comments on this draft, you may certainly air them 
now.
