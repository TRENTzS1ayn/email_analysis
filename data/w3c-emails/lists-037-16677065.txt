I see that section 5.10 says that the requirements on variants will be
addressed in another document. Fine. But, what about configurations and
configuration relative addressing. At a minimum, I would want to have a
section that has something similar to section 5.10, but that addresses the
issue of configurations and configuration relative addressing. The way the
requirement document stands, I take exception with this omission. (am I
missing something?)
