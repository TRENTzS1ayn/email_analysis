W3C Translation Index Based on RDF

   W3C thanks the volunteers who contributed thousands of hours
   translating W3C publications into more than 30 languages. Showcasing
   W3C Semantic Web, XML and internationalization technologies, data for
   volunteer translations of W3C technical reports and related documents
   is now maintained in RDF encoded in XML. Combining this metadata with
   other RDF, the translation index makes extensive use of Unicode,
   links to official versions, and can be viewed according to language
   or technology.

W3C RDF Validation Service Updated

   The W3C RDF Validation Service has been updated to support all of the
   specifications described in the RDF Last Call Working Drafts
   announcement. A new interactive graphical visualization of models
   builds on IsaViz. The RDF validator is based on the ARP parser
   version 2 alpha that is distributed as open source by
   Hewlett-Packard. New to ARP version 2 is RDF datatype support. Graphs
   are generated using Graphviz 1.8.9. The service runs under Jigsaw.
