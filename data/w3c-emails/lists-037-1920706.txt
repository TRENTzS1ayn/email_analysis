Happy Fifth Birthday to XML

   Celebrate the fifth birthday of the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   first published as a W3C Recommendation on 10 February 1998. Visit
   the XML home page. Read about XML's growth in this article by Dave
   Hollander and C. M. Sperberg-McQueen, participants in the W3C XML
   Working Group who wrote the original twenty-five page XML
   specification. The authors believe, "Just as interchangeable parts
   drove the Industrial Age, reusable information powers the
   Information Age."

XML Events Is a W3C Candidate Recommendation

   W3C is pleased to announce the advancement of "XML Events" to
   Candidate Recommendation. The specification defines a module used to
   associate behaviors with document-level markup for XML languages, and
   supports the DOM Level 2 event model. Comments are welcome through 5
   March. Visit the HTML home page.

RDF Validator Updated

   The W3C RDF Validation Service has been updated to deal correctly
   with a wide range of characters and character encodings for better
   internationalization and to support Last Call Working Drafts issued
   by the RDF Core Working Group. The RDF Validator is based on the ARP
   parser in Jena 1.6.1. Graphs are generated using GraphViz 1.8.9. The
   service runs under Jigsaw.

DOM Level 3 Validation Working Draft Published

   Based on feedback received during Last Call, the DOM Working Group
   has released an updated Working Draft of the "Document Object Model
   (DOM) Level 3 Validation Specification." The Document Object Model
   (DOM) allows programs and scripts to update the content and style of
   documents dynamically. This module of DOM3 ensures that documents
   remain or become valid. Comments are invited. Read about the DOM
   Activity.

OWL Use Cases and Requirements Published

   On 3 February, the Web Ontology Working Group released two updated
   Working Drafts: "Use Cases and Requirements" and "Abstract Syntax and
   Semantics" for the Web Ontology Language (OWL) 1.0. The first
   outlines six use cases, design goals, requirements and objectives for
   a language which can describe the semantics of classes and properties
   used in Web documents. The second draft is a high-level description
   of the OWL Web Ontology Language 1.0 and its sublanguages OWL DL and
   OWL Lite. Read about the W3C Semantic Web Activity.

OWL Guide and Overview Working Drafts Published

   On 10 February, the Web Ontology Working Group released updated
   Working Drafts of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) "Guide" and
   "Overview." The guide demonstrates OWL through an extended example
   and provides a glossary. The overview lists and briefly describes the
   language features. Automated tools can use common sets of terms
   called ontologies to power services such as more accurate Web search,
   intelligent software agents, and knowledge management. OWL is used to
   publish and share ontologies on the Web.
