XPointer Is a W3C Recommendation

   The World Wide Web Consortium today released XPointer as a three-part
   W3C Recommendation. The "XPointer Framework" is an extensible system
   for identifying regions in XML documents which provides for multiple
   addressing schemes. The "element()" scheme allows basic addressing of
   XML elements in terms of a document's tree structure. The "xmlns()"
   scheme is used to interpret namespace prefixes in scheme names and
   pointers. Read the press release and visit the XML home page.
