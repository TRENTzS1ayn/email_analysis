CSS 2.1 Last Call Published

   The CSS Working Group has released a Last Call Working Draft of
   "Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2 Revision 1" (CSS 2.1). The Cascading
   Style Sheets language is used to render structured documents like
   HTML and XML on screen, on paper, and in speech. A "snapshot" of CSS
   usage, the draft adds a few highly requested features, fixes errata,
   and brings CSS2 in line with implementations. Comments are welcome
   through 10 October.
