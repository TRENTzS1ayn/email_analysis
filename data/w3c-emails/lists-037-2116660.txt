W3C Letter Regarding Fee Proposal for ISO Codes

   W3C has written to ISO President Oliver Smoot to express deep
   concerns regarding a Commercial Policies Steering Group (CPSG)
   proposal to charge for the use of certain ISO codes, including those
   for languages (ISO 639) and countries (ISO 3166). The Unicode
   Technical Committee has issued a similar public position. ISO
   (International Organization for Standardization) is the largest
   standards developer with 97 national member bodies. W3C's letter is
   archived on the public mailing list of the W3C Internationalization
   Activity.
