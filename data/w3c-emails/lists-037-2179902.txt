XForms and XML Events Are W3C Recommendations

   The World Wide Web Consortium released "XForms 1.0" and "XML Events"
   as W3C Recommendations. The specifications have been reviewed by the
   W3C Membership, who favor their adoption by industry. Written for
   authors and implementers alike, XForms is the new generation of Web
   forms. XForms separate presentation and content, minimize round-trips
   to the server, offer device independence, and, using XML Events,
   reduce the need for scripting. Read the press release and
   testimonials and visit the XForms home page.
