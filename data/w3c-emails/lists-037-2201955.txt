W3C Requests '906 Patent Re-Examination

   Acting on the advice of the W3C HTML Patent Advisory Group, W3C has
   presented the United States Patent and Trademark Office with prior
   art establishing that US Patent No. 5,838,906 (the '906 patent) is
   invalid. W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee has written an unprecedented
   request to James E. Rogan, US Under Secretary of Commerce for
   Intellectual Property, to take action to remove the patent to allow
   operation of the Web. Please refer to the briefing.
