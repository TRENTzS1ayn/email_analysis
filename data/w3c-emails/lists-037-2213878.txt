DOM Level 3 Core, and Load and Save Are W3C Candidate Recommendations

   W3C is pleased to announce the advancement of two Document Object
   Model (DOM) specifications to Candidate Recommendations. With "DOM
   Level 3 Core," software developers and Web script authors can access
   and manipulate HTML and XML content. "DOM Level 3 Load and Save"
   allows programs and scripts to dynamically load the content of an XML
   document into a DOM document and serialize a DOM document into an XML
   document. Comments are welcome through 30 November. "DOM Level 3
   Events" was published as a Working Group Note. Visit the DOM home page.

W3C Workshop on Binary Interchange of XML: Report and Minutes

   The report and minutes have been published from the W3C Workshop on
   Binary Interchange of XML Information Item Sets held in Santa Clara,
   CA, USA on 24-26 September. All of the more than 40 position papers
   are publicly available. The workshop concluded that research is
   needed before W3C would produce any specifications in this area, and
   recommended that a Working Group be proposed to the W3C Membership.
   W3C thanks host Sun Microsystems, and all 60 attendees for their
   participation. Visit the XML home page.

Working Draft: Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented Anti-Robot Tests

   The WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group has released the first
   public Working Draft of "Inaccessibility of Visually-Oriented
   Anti-Robot Tests." Requests for visual verification of a bitmapped
   image pose problems for those who are blind, have low vision, or have
   a learning disability such as dyslexia. The draft examines ways for
   systems to test for human users while preserving access for users
   with disabilities. Comments are welcome. Read about the Web
   Accessibility Initiative.
