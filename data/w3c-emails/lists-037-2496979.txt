VoiceXML 2.0 and Speech Recognition Grammar Are W3C Recommendations

   The World Wide Web Consortium released two W3C Recommendations
   written for the world's estimated two billion fixed line and mobile
   phones. The "Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.0"
   uses XML to bring speech, touch-tone input, digitized audio, recording
   and computer-human conversations to the Web from any telephone. The
   "Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0" is key to
   VoiceXML's support for speech recognition, and is used by developers to
   describe end-users' responses to spoken prompts. Read the press release
   and testimonials and visit the Voice Browser home page.

W3C Launches Phase 2 of Semantic Web Activity

   W3C is pleased to announce the launch of phase two of the Semantic Web
   Activity. The W3C Membership approved two new Working Groups, the Best
   Practices and Deployment and RDF Data Access. They join the existing
   RDF Core and Web Ontology Working Groups and the Semantic Web Interest
   Group and Coordination Group. Participation is open to W3C Members. A
   continuation of the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web gives data precise
   meaning, allowing people and computers to cooperate fully. Visit the
   Semantic Web home page.
