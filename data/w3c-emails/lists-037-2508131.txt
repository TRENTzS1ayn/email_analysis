XML Schema Second Edition Is a Proposed Edited Recommendation

   The XML Schema Working Group has released a Proposed Edited
   Recommendation for XML Schema Second Edition in three parts: Part 0:
   "Primer," Part 1: "Structures," and Part 2: "Datatypes." The second
   edition is not a new version; its purpose is to correct errors in the
   XML Schema Recommendation. XML schemas define shared markup
   vocabularies and the structure of XML documents using those
   vocabularies, using a modular approach well-suited to distributed
   applications. Comments are welcome through 16 April.
   Visit the XML home page.

W3C HTML Patent Advisory Group Final Report Published

   The W3C HTML Patent Advisory Group (PAG) has published its final
   report. The PAG was chartered in 2003 to study HTML specification
   issues raised by the court case of Eolas v. Microsoft and US Patent
   5,838,906. The HTML PAG recommended that the W3C Director contact the
   US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and request a reexamination
   which is underway. The USPTO made a preliminary report rejecting all
   claims. Visit the HTML home page.
