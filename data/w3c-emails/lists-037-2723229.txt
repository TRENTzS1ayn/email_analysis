Well, _my_ interpretation of lock is that it's a notofication of intent to
modify a resource. I don't think (but not everyone agrees with me) that we
can specify a single policy for locking that will work for everyone: but we
can define operations the servers can interpret to "do the right thing"
based on the policies that they implement, and the clients can meaningfully
implement in way that will let them be used effectively with different
servers.

    I don't think (and intentionally avoided requiring) that we can
guarantee that the same client used with different server will work exactly
the same way with each server. But a client should be able to work with
different servers and make effective use of the policies that the servers
do provide.

    So an argument that CHECKOUT/CHECKIN are required separate from a
LOCK/GET/PUT/UNLOCK cycle would have to be a case where a server needed to
have _both forms_ of operation in place, _and_ have both forms operate
oaccording to different semantics. We want sufficient operations to span
the space of behavior, but I don't think that the different behaviors need
distinct representations in the protocol, unless they need to be
simultaneously implemented.

   I think we have to handle CVS too, which means we already can't
_require_ a CHECKOUT method.

If you don't need a lock, then LOCK followed by GET _is_ a checkout. Maybe
the name LOCK is bad. Maybe NOTIFY (of intention to write) would be better?

I don't have a problem with a server having a policy that passes out
multiple locks (as long as we can represent the state properly). I don't
see the problem with the client having to present the version number with
the document when reigstering an update.

Is the cookie a persisten session identifier? I'm still having trouble
understanding what it is, rather than what you wan tot do with it...

I'm not sure that this has to be the case. I'd rather relax the semantics
of lock, and keep a single protocol with access and update orhtogonal than
tighten the defintion, add more methods, and make client and server
implementation harder and more policy-dependent.

What is the context? If I understood that maybe I would undertsand
everything. I still don't see what the cookie is _needed for_.

MD5 was just an example... What does the cookie identify: a state of the
document, a granted access request, a bunch of session information, or
something else?

May be. I can see some use for session identifiers (So I can check out the
same thing 5 times and post a variety of variants).
   Couldn't non-exclusive reservation also be handled by some kind of
generic "attach meta-data" operation; I suspect we will need something like
this as a hook for specific config management strategies in the second
phase anyway?
