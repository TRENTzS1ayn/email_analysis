I think it is reasonable for us to assume that the versioning server is 
fully aware of the user's activity. This is especially true because of the 
need for a "Currently Checked Out" function that tells a user who has the 
document checked out.

The question of 'derived' entity is truly ugly. Different systems have 
different needs in this regard, especially when the 'derived' chain is more 
than one long. We normally think of 'derived' as being an HTML document and 
the source including things like server side includes. However I have seen 
longer and uglier chains. Rather than building in any assumption I am in 
favor of an arbitrary linking system where links have attributes. The 
attributes will then explain relationships.

I think the Check Out semantics handles this problem. Note that I am a 
proponent of having a locking system and a check out system. They are not 
the same thing and I do not feel they should be treated in the same way.

As I pointed out in my document we really need to accept directories as 
real entities. Just closing our eyes and repeating "URLS are a flat name 
space" won't make the problem go away.

I would agree with Jim. From the Microsoft point of view we would rather 
see versioning punted then locking.
