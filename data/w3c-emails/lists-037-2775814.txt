Hmmm, are you using the general computer meaning of "cookie", or
specifically the Cookie and Set-Cookie mechanisms?  The reason I ask
is that the Content-Version and Derived-From fields in earlier
HTTP drafts were intended to carry that information for versioned
resources, and there is no reason why this group cannot complete
their definition for HTTP/1.2 (in fact, that is what I am hoping).

I suppose that Cookie/Set-Cookie could be used, but there are a variety
of concerns (like which cookie, what is its realm, how do you deal with
normal cookie control for privacy, etc.) which would need to be addressed.
