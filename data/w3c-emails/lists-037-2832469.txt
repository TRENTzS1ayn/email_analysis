Nice work!

I've just been looking through the Document Management Alliance's
requirements papers for possible additions.  I notice a few things:

Need to be able to retrieve attributes for viewing or editing.

Containers (which I guess translate to URL hierarchy levels in the
terminology you use) can have attributes -- probably different ones from the
ones that attach to documents -- that need to be set and retrieved.

Need to be able to deal with compound (multi-file) documents that are not
HTML documents.  I'm not sure what all the implications of this may be, but
at least the document attributes get associated with the document as a
whole, not with any one of its files.

It should be possible to reference a single document from multiple containers.
