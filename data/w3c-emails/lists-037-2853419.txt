Right now, the read-only web doesn't support the notion of
containers; there are just some documents that contain more pointers
to other documents. I think the behavior of web/FTP proxy servers is a
good model for how the web currently treats directories.

To actually support containers, we might want to support the notion of
a new kind of object (not text/html) that is the actual 'container',
and then some operations for servers to generate unique names within
their name space.

I don't think it is right to translate containers to URL hierarchy
levels.
