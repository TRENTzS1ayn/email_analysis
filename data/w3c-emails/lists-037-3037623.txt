It reflects the contents of the Entity, which includes both the body
document and the entity-header fields (metainformation about the document).
If the server is providing different information per checkout, then it
is in fact changing the entity.

Checkout does not have meaning on all systems, whereas version has a generic
meaning (at times, too generic). It is intended to be as flexible as possible.
The "Content-" prefix is a requirement of MIME for what HTTP calls
entity-header field names.

BTW, I can set the www-vers-wg@ics.uci.edu list Reply-To at any time --
the reason it is not on by default is that many people find it annoying,
particularly when you have cross-list discussions (like this one).
