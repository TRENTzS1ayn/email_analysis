Talking about dead horses... When people say things like "Check Out the
Source" I get worried. As I mentioned previously there are cases where
the number of links between the final version of an entity and the
original version contains many nodes. Rather than trying to put together
a "GET for Edit" which will either only have one level and thus is not
very useful or will hack the hell out itself to support more levels we
should just support links which solve the problem very elegantly.
