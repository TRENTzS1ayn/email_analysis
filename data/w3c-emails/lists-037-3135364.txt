   As far as I can tell, Netscape Navigator gold just does a PUT as far as
I can tell. With a non-locking version server, this could be made to do the
"right thing" (eg create a new descendant, forking if necessary).  What I'm
worried about with a new content-type is that we would have a more-complex
implementation, not compatible with non-versioning "PUT"-style clients. I
guess the servers could implement 2 protocols, but is this the best way?
