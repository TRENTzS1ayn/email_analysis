Originally, there were several reasons for maintaining a separation between
the two lists:
  - The versioning and CM list had more of a CM crowd on it, who presumably
were not interested in distributed authoring issues
  - The versioning and CM list was anticipated to have heavy discussion of
CM capabilities, which presumably was not going to be of interest to people
on the distributed authoring list
  - The Distributed Authoring work is a short fuse activity.  I anticipate
the distributed authoring work will cease by the middle of next year (at
the latest).  I wanted a way to shut off this activity without affecting
the versioning & CM work, which I view as requiring more time to complete
due to the complexities of providing basic support for multiple CM styles.

However, I also recognize that the status quo of receiving two and more
copies of every message is ridiculous, and somewhat hypocritical in
discussions about efficient use of network resources. :-)

Here's what I propose:
- All discussion on versioning and distributed authoring will henceforth
take place on the w3c-dist-auth@w3.org mailing list, until further notice.
- The membership of w3c-dist-auth will become the union of the membership
of w3c-dist-auth and www-vers-wg.
- Subscription requests to either w3c-dist-auth or www-vers-wg will
automatically result in membership in w3c-dist-auth and www-vers-wg.
- www-vers-wg will remain active, for CM-only discussion, and also for the
day when the distributed authoring activity has ceased.

I will implement this proposal on Friday, unless I hear strenuous objection.
