Due to a problem with another mailing list hosted by the W3C, the
w3c-dist-auth mailing list was down for the past day and a half.
Unfortunately, many of the mail messages sent to the list during this
time are now trapped in a copy of the mail queue, awaiting manual
intervention.  I will attempt to recover these messages tomorrow, but
if your message was not cross-posted to www-vers-wg, you may wish to
repost it before then.

The mailing list *should* now be working.
