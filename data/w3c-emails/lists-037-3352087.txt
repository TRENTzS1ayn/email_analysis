I don't mean just file attributes, but metadata in general -- author, title,
publisher, subject, etc.  Most metadata stays the same whether a document is
MOVEd or COPYd, but there are exceptions.  URN, if implemented, is another
attribute that should never change when a document is MOVEd, whereas a COPY
of a document should get its own URN.  Although work on metadata on the Web
is very much "in progress" (URC, Z39.50, STARTS, etc.), I think it is an
important part of document management that should be encompassed by the Web.
It should be possible to set metadata using HTTP, however it turns out to be
expressed.  And the metadata should get updated properly when a document
gets COPYd or MOVEd.
