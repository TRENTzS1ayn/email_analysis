That is possible, but only when the resource can be moved as a
filesystem object in a single disk within a single server.  If we were
to limit MOVE to be only within a single server, that would be reasonable.

The reason why it can't do that is because we currently have no way for
the client to "lend" its authentication credentials to the server such
that the server could perform that action on behalf of the client.
Again, this is only an issue in cross-server MOVE methods.
[And it would be a PUT, not a POST.]

Yes, it does have an advantage in terms of atomicity.  However, it might
be better to just introduce a form of transaction support, since we
already need that anyway.

That too would be a reasonable solution, assuming that it is desirable
to have the comments be typed via the content-type/encoding mechanism
(I think so).  Naturally, you could also include comments in the form of a
Comments field.

If people do choose to use a new header field for the list of source
or destination URIs, then it is important to use a robust syntax.
In other words, the URIs should be <bracketed> or "quoted" so that
they are easily distinguished from adjoining commas or folding.
