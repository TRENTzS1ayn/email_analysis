I have now merged the membership of the www-vers-wg mailing list into the
w3c-dist-auth mailing list.  Discussion of versioning and distributed
authoring topics should now take place only on w3c-dist-auth@w3.org.  This
list is archived at:

http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/

The www-vers-wg@ics.uci.edu list is still active, however, and is the
appropriate place for discussion of WWW configuration management topics.

The merging of lists occurred due to the large number of posts which were
being cross-posted to both groups, causing duplicate emails to appear in
the inboxes of people who were on both lists.
