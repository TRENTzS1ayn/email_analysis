Well, in the constant triage of life, the revised text is going to the
group now. The IETF submission will have to wait until Fridaym or after the
meeting. Feel free to critique again. It's not even proofed yet, so
detection of howlers is great even if you agree w/ everything said within.

The follwoing is also available at:
http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/draft-versioning-req-00.html

The HTML is somewhat cleaned up for non-Netscape browsers.
