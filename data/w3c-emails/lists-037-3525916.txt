Jim,

a few comments just to show that I am back and working now:

I seem to remember this discussion appeared already in either one of the
working group, and was discussed by David Durand and me while drafting the
versioning requirements. Is my interpretation of the last sentence correct,
in that the lack of "direct access to the storage media" is *required*? I
mean, do we exclude support for non-HTTP access to the stored media (e.g.
direct file access, FTP, or even redundant copies (published and local
ones), or do we simply include both direct and HTTP access? If so, wouldn't
the sentence improve if it stated:

"...with or without direct access to the storage media"?

Should we include a discussion on synchronous vs. asynchronous
collaboration? (e.g. is notification out of this group?)

Ciao
