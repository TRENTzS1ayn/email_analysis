Here is the Management Summary for the  Superhighway Working Group
meeting which took place during the Customer Councils meeting in
Washington during week commencing 9 September.

   + Transactionality over the Web
     The paper on long-term transaction scenarios involving multiple
     servers accessed over the Web is being further extended to include
     effects of other (loosely-coupled) transactions over lengthy
     natural breaks in time, and use of transaction agents.

     ANSI have now proposed long-running transactions on the Web as a
     new work item in ISO, so it was agreed we should monitor its
     progress up to the next ISO meeting (Paris, 11-23 November).
