Here are the document management requirements notes I promised to circulate.
These are functional requirements that large corporations would expect a
document repository to provide.  So someday we would like them to be able to
get at this functionality in a standard way using HTTP.  

These are my notes on a long document (that I have only in paper form)
called "Requirements for an Enterprise Document Management System" published
by the Black Forest Group and AIIM in January 1995.  The Black Forest Group
was (is?) a consortium of large global corporations and academic researchers
with the aim of applying new technologies to business problems.  AIIM is the
Association for Information and Image Management.  DMA (Document Management
Alliance, a consortium of document management users and vendors) is
affiliated with AIIM and used this requirements document as the basis for
their work.

Our authoring and versioning requirements papers touch on some of the same
categories of requirements identified here (Versioning, Catalog,
Organization, Search, etc.) but not others (Workflow, Security,
Administration, etc.)  In the areas we do expect to specify, there are
interesting details here.
