Good points.

Security is an item we are going to leave up to other groups to provide for
us.  However, our draft charter should make this clear.

We have been operating under the assumption that MD5 authentication would
be sufficient for our needs -- if something better than MD5 comes along, we
would hope we could use it.  Again, the draft should state this.

Aside from locking, our work is *not* going to address access control or
permissions.  This is a huge issue, and I feel that we would never finish
if we had to produce a consensus access control draft.  This is an
important issue, and one which will hopefully be addressed by *another*
working group.  But, the draft should make mention of this.
