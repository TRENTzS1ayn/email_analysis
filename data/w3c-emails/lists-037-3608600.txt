As long as you're restating the assumptions, I'll add my bit.

MD5 is not likely to survive much longer and therefore should be
considered inappropriate. Claims of being close to breaking it are
beginning to circulate, including predictions of that event happening
yet this year.

As for a suitable replacement, SHA (aka, SHA-1) seems to be the likely
candidate. There is also a hash out of Europe that seems to have the
right attributes (but alas, I can't remember the name).
