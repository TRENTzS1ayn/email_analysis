The next technical meeting on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning is
currently scheduled for November 14-15 at Xerox PARC, in the SF Bay area.
Larry Masinter has graciously offered to host this meeting -- thank you!
Unlike the past meetings, this one is planned for two days to allow
sufficient time for discussion of draft specifications for achieving
distributed authoring and versioning capability.

Please let me know soon if these dates will not work for you.  So far these
dates seem good for most people, based on email contact with people, and an
informal show of hands at the Cambridge meeting.

More details on registration, etc. will soon be forthcoming.

- Jim
