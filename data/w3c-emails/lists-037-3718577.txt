I thought the main idea was to not only find the "key functionality"
but also to survey the implementation methods, by which this
functionality has already been implemented.

It's always better to start with something that someone has already
implemented (and in these cases, are already shipping) than to invent
something new!

This is a little puzzling. Entity tags were an invention of the HTTP
working group caching subgroup. I don't think there is any
"information" to "collect". Rather, there's been some speculation that
some of the requirements for referencing specific versions could be
met by a design that used a (new) request header to designate a
version, and an entity tag to distinguish versions. From the point of
view of HTTP/1.1, "version" is just another kind of request header
that content might vary on, using the standard content negotiation
tags.

This is a conjecture. The only thing to do now is to test the
conjecture against the requirements for version referencing.

All in all, it sounds like you had a productive meeting, and I wish
I'd been there. I'm looking forward to seeing the documents that
result. See you in November.
