I'll admit, I am extremely envious, and sorry I am the only european in the
group. Unfortunately, I cannot afford to take part to any meeting in the
States unless I find some funding on the way, which, at the state, seems at
best unlikely (Microsoft?).

I was wondering if there could be a willingness to organize one of our
meetings at the University of Bologna, Italy. Bologna is the oldest
universities of the western civilization, having been founded in 1088 (one,
zero, eight, eight) for lax and medicine studies. Besides being famous for
art and cuisine, Bologna is also 1/2 from Florence, Venice and Ravenna, and
has a good air connections with most European airports (Rome, Paris,
Brussels, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, etc.). I  could organize something
around December or January.
