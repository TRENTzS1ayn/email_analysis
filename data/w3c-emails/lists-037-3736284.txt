At present, the majority of active participants on this list are located in
the United States, with slightly more on the West Coast than on the East
Coast.  This has been the driving factor in keeping the meetings in the US.
I'm game for holding a meeting in Europe, especially since I've never been
to Italy, but I suspect that many of the people who have been coming to
these meetings would be unable to make it.  My fear is we would end up
losing several months, or end up with a result which did not reflect a
consensus view, if we were to hold a meeting in Europe at which there was
poor attendance.

On the other hand, I do realize that the web was invented in Europe, and
there are many people there who are knowledgable about the WWW, and
versioning issues.  It certainly would be nice if their knowledge could be
easily applied to this effort.
