I've been thinking about the exchange we've had about "distributed
editing vs reinventing file system protocol", and trying to extract
from it:

* Which requirements for distributed editing
  can NOT be met by a file system protocol?

* Are those requirements explicitly described in the "Requirements
  on HTTP for Distributed Editing" (an unfortunate title).

I think that most of the requirements are 'information hiding' rather
than 'capabilities' requirements (e.g., "clients need not be aware of
server's locking scheme in order to add a new version" is an
information hiding requirement.)
