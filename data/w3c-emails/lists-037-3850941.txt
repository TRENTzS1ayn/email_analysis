Dear Distributed Authoring WG members,

I have made available a document containing scenarios related to distributed 
authoring and versioning. Most of the scenarios have been adapted from the 
ones posted on the w3c-dist-auth mailing list.

There are still things missing from this document, especially in the area of 
locking. I would appreciate any comments or additional scenarios WG members 
can come up with.

The URL of the document is

  http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Authoring/draft-lassila-dist-auth-scenarios.html

Please send any comments to lassila@w3.org.
