The only issue I want to raise is the following -- must the distributed
authoring be done with a single protocol or can a collection of protocols
be employed to accomplish the task?

Is it an absolutely necessary to support traditional document management
systems?  If there is a solution that solves all of the problems being
addressed by a traditional DMS and does more, couldn't we skip the
traditional DMS solution?  This is not idle speculation on my part.
In my day-to-day activities, I use a distributed document management
system that has local file locks, but no global (remote) locks.
(Actually, there is one global lock, but it could easily be removed.)
