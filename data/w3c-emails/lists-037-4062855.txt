A DMS must have a lock that is persistent over time. The concept of a
non-persistent lock is only valid during an on-line editing session (as
opposed to a checked-out document). If we do specify lock time-out as a
property of locking we must also define what the behavior of the lock
will be if the document repository does not support a lock time-out
feature.
