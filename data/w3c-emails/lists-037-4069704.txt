Steve:

While some DMS systems out there are designed around file locking,
it is possible to have a fully functional remote DMS that does not
use remote file locking.  The Sun Teamware product is one such DMS.
While Teamware is layered on top of SCCS (which has local file locking),
the distributed authoring component of Teamware does not use remote
file locks.  Thus, the statement that "A DMS must have a lock that
is persitent over time." should probably be restated to say  "Some
DMS's need persistent locks."  Given the difficulty of managing remote
locks, it may be appropriate to investigate a dist. authoring
architecture that avoids the remote locking issue entirely.
