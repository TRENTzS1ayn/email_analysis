File locking assumes that the DMS is using the file system as the
underlying document storage system. Upscale DMSs will use some kind of
database facility that will provide lock services is a different way,
not via a file locking mechanism. The DMS sported by GroupWise 5 does
not use any native file system
but does provide for a persistent lock (plus much, much more).

Anyway, I don't dispute that my statement could be better stated that
"Some . . ." but I don't agree with your suggestion not to privide for
remote locking. If the DMS (or better stated, the document repository)
supports a lock then it will provide the appropriate functionality, if
not then an error message will be returned. As we were fond of hearing
during the meeting at MIT, "You always have the option to say NO!"
