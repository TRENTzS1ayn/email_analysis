Oh, well, I don't think that 'containers' are the reason that people
buy document management systems.
However, it would be very useful to standardize the web interface to
containers. This isn't so different than the desire to standardize the
web interface to 'directories', and from the web point of view,
perhaps 'container' and 'directory' aren't so different?

Many web servers offer a HTML view of a directory, and that (with some
additional annotation) would be a good start for standardizing.  Along
the way, new media type(s) for containers (which could be Accept:-ed
by clients that understand them) might also be useful.

I think this will be a separate activity from 'versioning and
distributed authoring', but the coordination is important, e.g., to
make sure that the query syntax is capable of querying for particular
versions.
