I've just been looking at the DMA specifications about locking.  I think it
uses more standard terminology than we have in our requirements paper.

DMA's Write Lock = our Write Lock
DMA's Read Lock = our No-Modify Lock

There is nothing in DMA corresponding to our Read Lock.  Can we find another
name for this?

DMA has an Existence Lock that prevents anyone from deleting the resource,
even someone who has a Write Lock on it.
