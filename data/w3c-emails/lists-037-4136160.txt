ANNOUNCE:

Technical Working Meeting on Distributed Authoring and Versioning

Meeting Date:  November 14-15, 1996
Location:
   Xerox PARC
   3333 Coyote Hill Road
   Palo Alto, California
Room: CSL Commons 
Cost: none, but come prepared to discuss technical issues

The third technical working meeting of the working group on WWW
Distributed Authoring and Versioning (webdav) will be held on
November 14-15, at Xerox PARC.  Many thanks to Larry Masinter for
graciously hosting this meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is to provide a detailed review of the
proposed specification for extending the web with distributed
authoring and versioning capabilities.  A rough draft of this
specification will be posted to the discussion list prior to this
meeting, ideally in the next 1-2 weeks.  It is expected that this will
be the key meeting for discussion of design issues concerning
distributed authoring and versioning extensions to the HTTP protocol,
and other appropriate standards.

Unlike previous meetings of this group, this meeting will take place
over two days, to provide sufficient time for a detailed consideration
of all issues.  At present I have tentative confirmation of attendance
by members from Netscape, Microsoft, W3C, HTTP WG, SoftQuad, with more
expected.

Xerox PARC is located in Palo Alto, California, which is in the
San Francisco Bay Area.  It is equally distant from the San Francisco
and San Jose airports.  For directions on getting to Xerox PARC,
