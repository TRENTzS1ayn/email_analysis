Enclosed is a copy of the call for participation for an upcoming W3C
Symposium on Distributed Authoring.

A couple of comments:
- This is a different meeting from the November Technical Working meeting.
The symposium is on December 4-5, the technical working meeting is on
November 14-15.
- The symposium is not a venue for the further development of
specifications, or other technical output.  This is reserved for the
technical working meetings.
- The symposium is designed to inform the W3C membership, and the general
web community, about the capabilities, issues, and potential involved with
distributed authoring.

I see there being two tracks of meetings:
Track 1: Technical Working Meetings:

San Mateo --> Cambridge --> Palo Alto --> ?

Track 2: Informational Meetings;

Sunnyvale Symposium --> WWW Conference(?) --> (?)

The intent of track 1 is to develop technical solutions.  The intent of
track 2 (informational) is to make sure people understand and are excited
about the output of track 1 (technical), when it is completed.

I am currently in need of a volunteer from the Document Management
community to give a presentation on the document management of a web site,
and the implications of distributed authoring on document management (and
vice-versa).  If you're interested in giving such a talk, please contact me
via email: ejw@ics.uci.edu.

Also, if you have an idea for another talk which fits the format of this
symposium, please contact me -- there may be space for one additional talk.

- Jim


CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

World Wide Web Consortium
Symposium

"Distributed Authoring: Present, and Future"

December 4-5, 1996

Sunnyvale Hilton Inn, Sunnyvale, CA

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPE

The past two years have witnessed the development of a new class of
distributed authoring tools which allow remote editing followed by a network
save. Unlike existing tools which save their work to the local filesystem
and ignore how web content is made accessible, distributed authoring systems
directly employ the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to put web content on
a server. This allows web content to be edited hundreds or thousands of
miles away from the server which distributes it, and gives users the ease of
pushbutton publishing.

Distributed authoring tools have many applications. Internet Service
Providers currently sell web page hosting services where a customer, using
an easy-to-use WYSIWYG tool on their personal computer, edits their home
page which is stored far away on the provider's host system. Within a
corporate intranet, employees are starting to use intranet-enabled word
processing and spreadsheet tools to save their work directly to a
departmental web server.

This symposium is an information-rich opportunity to be educated by key
technology developers about this exciting new class of web application.
Institutions with intranets will discover how distributed authoring tools
can help manage their web sites, and will become plugged-in to the dramatic
impact of the emerging intranet-enabled applications. Internet Service
Providers can learn about existing distributed authoring tools, and how they
can earn extra income or provide value-added service to their customers by
supporting them. Technology developers can learn about ongoing efforts to
develop interoperable distributed authoring and versioning capabilities, and
how to get involved.
