Technical Working Meeting on Distributed Authoring and Versioning

Meeting Date:  November 14-15, 1996
Location:
   Xerox PARC
   3333 Coyote Hill Road
   Palo Alto, California
Room: CSL Commons
Cost: none, but come prepared to discuss technical issues

The third technical working meeting of the working group on WWW
Distributed Authoring and Versioning (webdav) will be held on
November 14-15, at Xerox PARC.  Many thanks to Larry Masinter for
graciously hosting this meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is to provide a detailed review of the
proposed specification for extending the web with distributed
authoring and versioning capabilities.  A rough draft of this
specification will be posted to the discussion list prior to this
meeting, ideally in the next 1-2 weeks.  It is expected that this will
be the key meeting for discussion of design issues concerning
distributed authoring and versioning extensions to the HTTP protocol,
and other appropriate standards.

At present, the plan is to have meetings on both days from 9AM
until 5PM.  On Nov. 14, the meeting will begin with overview
presentations on all distributed authoring and versioning proposals
received to date, and an overview of open action items from the
previous meeting.  Some time will be set aside for discussion of
the charter of the working group.  All remaining time will be
dedicated to detailed discussion of proposed specifications.

Unlike previous meetings of this group, this meeting will take place
over two days, to provide sufficient time for a detailed consideration
of all issues.  At present I have tentative confirmation of attendance
by members from Netscape, Microsoft, W3C, HTTP WG, SoftQuad,
Xerox, America Online, NTT Labs, Canon, MKS, Web Tools Int'l, with
more expected.

Please note that this is a *different* event from the symposium
on distributed authoring, which is being held in December, in Sunnyvale.

Xerox PARC is located in Palo Alto, California, which is in the
San Francisco Bay Area.  It is equally distant from the San Francisco
and San Jose airports.  For directions on getting to Xerox PARC,
