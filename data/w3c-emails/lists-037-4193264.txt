You can't 'destroy' a URI. You can ask to have a resource destroyed,
and the argument is the URI.

The HTTP committee struggled mightily with the terminology about
resource/entity/variant, and came up with a set of definitions that I
hope you adopt rather than reinterpret. But it's important to be
clear about what the operations operate on.

I _think_ that all of the operations apply to a resource, not to
a URI which identifies a resource.

It is with some great difficulty tthat you will have to clarify
whether versioning actually applies to content-negotiated resources
(e.g., same URL but different renditions.)

Do the 'attributes' apply to the resource, to the variant, to the
version, or to some combination of them?

Why is the PEP draft mentioned in the references?
