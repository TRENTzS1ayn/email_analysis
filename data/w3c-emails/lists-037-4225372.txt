Since HTTP/1.1 allows GET with a body, why not use something like

GET <URI> HTTP/1.1
[...]
Document-Author: <ID>
Want-Source: yes
Authors-Credentials: <whatever>
Version-Number: 4
[...]

to retrieve a specific version (given proper credentials, of course, to
prevent general users from retrieving old versions). Alternatively, a new
method could be introduced like SGET to get source minus server side
includes etc., but that's an issue for another message.
