This is a matter for access control, surely? Why invent a new scheme when we
already have a perfectly good one? Don't forget that content developers are
just end users with extra privilege.

But if they don't have their own URIs you may not be able to determine how to
select them. Certainly not without new headers.

To expand the URL/parallel version model, you could do things like:

http://some.where.com/some/path/somefile

the file a "user" gets

http://some.where.com/some/path/somefile/!versions/1.2.3.4

version 1.2.3.4 of somefile (possibly including tagging information
for version tracking)

http://some.where.com/some/path/somefile/!versions/

a list of versions

http://some.where.com/some/path/somefile/!versions/latest

the latest version of somefile with version tagging

Of course, these can be protected with various levels of access control.

I'm sure I had some more to say but I'm being more than a little distracted by
the gale force winds currently blowing in London ;-)

Cheers,

Ben.
