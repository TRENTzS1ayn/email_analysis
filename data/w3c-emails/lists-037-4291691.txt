There is not reason not to version an opaque part of the URL just as is the
case with the media type, language etc. Anything else would make life
terrible for cache implementors. Note the "opaque" part - which should be
obvious. The server indicates where to find specific versions or a complete
history list using the "Link" header, for example

Link: <ListOfMyPreviousVersions.html>; rel="history"
