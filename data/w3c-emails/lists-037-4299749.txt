Absolutely, there is no need to define a global method for
specifying "the" version in a URL. The URL should carry the 
information but it should be opaque.

It is arguable that a serverr be able to state the lexical 
scheme it employs to form versions "i use fred's version hack",
but I dislike that plan since it opens the door for hardwiring
a simplistic notion of versioning into the Web we will later
regret.

Remeber what they did to the Accept: header !
