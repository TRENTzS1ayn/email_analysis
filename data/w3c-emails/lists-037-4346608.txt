I like the idea of placing the burden on the update method (this sounds a
lot like write-through) but I don't see how this method can guarantee that
a returned entity is up to date. The most obvious problem is that an update
can traverse an entirely different set of caches than a previous GET, thus
allowing for the possibility that some caches would not yet be aware that
its cache entry for the resource is stale. Of course, it everything works
fine as long as both paths hit the same cache at some point.
