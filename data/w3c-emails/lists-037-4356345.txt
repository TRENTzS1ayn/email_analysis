It is different because the French and English versions and semantically 
equivalent. You should get the same information in the French and English 
versions. This is similar to requesting a document in MSWord or PostScript 
format. The information should be identical, they are semantically 
equivalent, even though the syntax's are radically different. However 
Version 1.2 and Version 1.3 of a document are semantically different. That 
is, generally, the reason for having different version numbers, to indicate 
semantic difference.

PS Yes, I know, you can also use versions to indicate syntactic difference 
but that is picking nits.

But don't the Accept-*: headers allow selecting variants of a specific
URL?  I would argue that "Give me the French version" is not a request
unlike saying "Give me the Feb 14th version" or "Give me version 1.3"...

After all, a historical variant would (typically) be indicating what the
URL *once* pointed to...
