I like this idea - but it isn't very practical, I fear. If the request is
handled by a CGI, then how does the server know what's been updated? For highly
automated sites, the list of URLs could be huge. In fact, a set of URLs which
access a database is pretty much a one-way function as far as calculating
validity goes (though I did have this crazy idea about inverse SQL once...).

Cheers,

Ben.
