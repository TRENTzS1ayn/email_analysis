I think that is great idea but is this the group to propose it? We should 
raise flags with other groups but I think we need to keep the RFC tightly 
focused on distributed authoring and versioning.

I was thinking more of a return header from ANY request that
identified a set of other URLs whose cache entries should be marked
stale. So, if you POST a new entry to

       http://host.dom/container

you might get back a return header that it updated:

http://host.dom/container/3q96/by-date
http://host.dom/container/3q96/by-author

or (even)
http://host.dom/container/3q96/*

This puts the computational burden on the update method rather than
retrieval, and is predicated on an assumption that reads happen far
more frequently than writes.
