Of "entity" and "representation": pick one and stick with it.

But in this case, I think you meant resource, i.e. the gizmo associated
with a URL.

[Yaron]
No we mean representation(s), meaning one or more than one representations 
of a resource. Where representation is defined as in HTTP 1.1.

representation
  An entity included with a response that is subject to content
  negotiation, as described in section 12. There may exist multiple
  representations associated with a particular response status.

The key here is that we are not just talking about an entity, we are
talking about a content negotiated entity. I have removed all references to 
entity and replaced them with representation.
[\Yaron]

Of edit and update, pick one.

So I think it should say "... no longer intends to update a resource."
[Yaron]
Update is a loaded term. I prefer edit. I have modified the draft to use
edit.

"Versions of a URI"? URIs are immutable. They're just strings, kinda
like large integers.

I suggest:
The history of a URI U* is a list of URIs Ui where each Ui refers
to some version of the U* resource, plus some attribues related to
each version.
[Yaron]
This goes into the same bag as Destroy which is now defined as:
destroy
To destroy a resource is to request that the resource be permanently
removed from storage. This differs from delete in that some versioning
systems handle delete as a request to no longer make the specified resource 
editable.
I have also changed history to:
history
The history of a resource is a list of all the versions of the resource
along with related information.
Of course each version is also a resource. However I don't want to define
version as it would be nothing but an academic exercise.

[Yaron]
merge
A merge is the process whereby information from one or more resources is
used to produce a new resource that represents the content of the component 
resources. Merges can occur at the client or the server.

BTW, I know you can nit pick the merge definition. Please don't. I really

If you use update in the sense that I'm suggesting, don't use it for

Content description headers can be accessed with HEAD.
[Yaron]
Yes, but one can not specify which content headers will be transmitted.
Where we to use content headers for attributes and were we to use HEAD to
discover them, then we would have to transmit all the content headers with 
each HEAD request. As the number of attributes will be very large and as
the size of each attribute is likely to also be large, this is not
acceptable.

I have changed the paragraph to read:
It is often necessary to record meta data about a resource. The natural
place to store such meta data is in HTTP headers however this presents a
problem. HTTP headers, as defined in [HTTP11], are used either for content 
description or communication. Neither of these header types were designed
for remote setting and on-demand retrieval.
[\Yaron]

I disagree. Jigsaw supports setting and on-demand retrieval of
entity headers, for example.
[Yaron]
How? Does it allow me to selectively specify which header I want? Will it
let me perform a method on a header?
[\Yaron]
>What is needed is a third type of header, a header which provides

I suggest you merget the concept of attribute header into the
existing HTTP entity header concept.
[Yaron]
That is unfortunately not practical. The semi-practical solution to the
attributes problem is to define a new entity-header "attributes" whose
value is a URL. That URL then points to a file which contains a whole list 
of attributes, each of which contains a value, which could potentially also 
be a URI. If I wanted to find out what the name of the author of a document 
is I would send a HEAD request, then do a GET on the attribute URI. I would 
then read the response and see if the Author attribute is present. If so I 
would either read the associated value or, if the value is a URI, do a GET 
on the URI to get the Author information. This means that at a minimum
every request for attribute information would involve at least two HTTP
requests and would require the downloading of a potentially very large
file. In all other respects this new attribute means is as powerful as the 
one currently proposed. The problem is the two requests. That is too high
an overhead to pay.

Interesting... can attributes be links as well? In a draft I'm working on:
[Yaron]
ABSOLUTELY!!! This has been one of Jim's basic requirements since day one. 
He wants N-Ary links. We have a small disagreement on syntax but we are in

Latest version:
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Architecture/NOTE-link

I use the notation R(A,B) to refer to any number of similar structures:

link-relationship(source-anchor-address, target-anchor-address)
e.g.stylesheet(http://www.w3.org/, http://www.w3.org/houststyle.css)
header-field-name(URL, header-field-value)
e.g.Expires(http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xxx, "Wed Oct 19 15:34:54 1996")
attribute-name(URL, attribute-value)
e.g.hair-color(http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/, "brown")
two-place-predicate(arg1, arg2)
e.g.member(http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/,
http://www.w3.org/People/)

This URI notation combines R and A into one. So I might denote the above
examples by:
http://www.w3.org/<stylesheet> = http://www.w3.org/houststyle.css
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xxx<Expires> = "Wed Oct 19 15:34:54 1996"
http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/<hair-color> = "brown"
http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/<member> = http://www.w3.org/People/

The last example reminds me of an issue: Header fields and link
relationship are usually 1-1, but not always: the member relationship
is obviously many-many. I think HTTP header fields are multiply valued;
e.g. Accept: x,y is the same as Accept: x Accept: y. I can't think
of any multiply valued entity headers though.
[Yaron]
This brings us to N-Ary Links. When one does a request on an attribute
header the response is in the entity-body. As such the value can be
ANYTHING. In the case of N-Ary links the response would be something like:
Random-Headers1 #(URI Random-HeadersN)
I say "like" because Jim and I still need to talk. The idea is that you
would have a bunch of URIs, each of which would explain its particular
relationship. If all the URIs have the same relationship then
Random-Headers1 can be used to describe it. If one wants to specify special 
aspects of the N-Ary relationship then one can use Random-HeadersN. It is
totally generic. Furthermore I added a paragraph explaining why I put in
the pseudo-hierarchy:
By convention an attribute request which ends in a "_" and which does not
resolve to a specific attribute name SHOULD be treated as a request for a
list of all attributes in that hierarchy.

BTW, you should come out with a list of all the types of links you think we 
will need. That way we can include them with the document.

Nifty. Hmmm... I wonder if this could be used as a general URL

Hmmm... this answers my question above: in this design, links are
subordinate
to attributes, rather than being at the same level. That rubs me the wrong
way.

For example, to get the stylesheet of a document at U, I'd rather GET
U<stylesheet>
than GET U<link> and parse the results, looking fro a stylesheet link.
[Yaron]
What stops you from using GET U<stylesheet>? It can either return a URL
which points to the style sheet or it can return the stylesheet itself
(depending upon how the attribute is defined). Attributes are links, links 
are attributes.
[\Yaron]

This should return the address of the source, if you ask me. It's just a
typed
link, ala stylesheet.
[Yaron]
I agree:
Source
The URI of the resource as stored, without any processing by the server
(e.g. without processing of server-side includes).

Make "This may seem..." parenthetical. And do you have a citation for

Why should it be made parenthetical? Also the best reference I currently

This implies that there are "representations" that both the client and
the server can refer to, but not by name. Seems to me that in the
same way you consider attributes addressable, "representations" should
be considered addressable. In fact, it seems to me that in the HTTP
spec, representations _are_ considered addressable.

For example, if /foo is available in GIF and PNG, and the server ever
needs to export that fact to the client (e.g. for caching purposes),
it should make up names for them (for use in the Alternates: header,
for example). By convention, the server would probably pick /foo.gif
and /foo.png.

The bottom line: I suggest
A lock is assigned to a set of resources; one of the
resources in the set is the _primary_ resource;
the others are _alternates_. All resources in the set,
including the primary, are _variants_ of the primary.
In the case of zero alternates, the lock
may be further restricted to only a particular range
of the resource.

Using the above example, a lock could be assigned to the set:
{/foo, /foo.gif, and /foo.png}

with /foo as the representative. (Note that /foo.gif could be used
as the representative as well. It doesn't matter.) This lock
couldn't be a byte-range lock. But one could assign a lock
to the set
{/foo.gif}
and restrict that lock to a byterange. It's sensible (aka
well-defined) for a client to ask for a byterange lock on {/foo},
but depending on how a server manages the content, it might
result in a runtime error.
[Yaron]
We already provide this type of semantics but instead of using the exported 
names we use the headers. I understand your point regarding exported
headers but this isn't common practice. If it becomes common practice then 
the clients are free to discover the exported headers and place their locks 
on those. Until then we need to provide the content-negotation mechanism.
[\Yaron]

>Locks may be taken out either in exclusive or shared mode.

Add "shared mode" to the terminology section.
[Yaron]
SIR, YES SIR!
shared mode
Shared mode modifies a lock request such that the lock may be shared
between multiple requestors.
[\Yaron]


> In shared mode
>anyone with proper access may take out a lock. In exclusive mode only the
>user(s)

What term is used in the HTTP spec for thingies that participate in
authentication?  They're called principals in a lot of the security
literature. But "user" is OK, as long as it's used consistently.
[Yaron]
I don't like using the term user because sometimes the request may come
from an automated process.
[\Yaron]
It seems like you use client sometimes and user others. The notion of
client is definitely different from the notion of user/principal:
consider the case of the AOL proxy: it's one client making requests on
behalf of zillions of users/principals.
[Yaron]
Sigh... I will change user and client to principal if you provide a
definition of principal for the terminology section.
[\Yaron]

The word "current" gives me the willies. Unless you're in the context
of discussing a particular timeframe, strike it.
[Yaron]
I changed the language to "However a new user can be added to an exclusive 
lock if the holder of the lock token performs the addition."

"reused" in what sense? I think you can be more precise by saying "can
not be updated".
[Yaron]
I changed it from reused to edited.

seconds by whos clock? We're in a distributed system here. If you stick
to the time-frame-of-reference of the server, I think you'll be safe.
The implication is that clients can't exactly determine when a lock
times out. But I think that's just a fact of life.
[Yaron]
Yup.
[\Yaron]
>Finally, locks may be taken out for multiple clients in a single request.

That seems fuzzy to me: a request by definition involves exactly one
client. How do the other clients get involved? Or do you mean
multiple users?

Ah... looks like you mean users. Be consistent.
[Yaron]
As I said, I will fix client/user if you provide a definition of principal.

It seems to me that a smart server could detect this sort of thing. If
so, should it
(1) copy it anyway, cuz that's in the spirit of this spec, or
(2) signal an error to the client that requested the copy,
in order to prevent this sort of frotzed situation.

I think a smart server SHOULD to (2) if it can, and that we should give
that hint in the spec. I also think we should hint at whether a COPY
is indented to be a deep copy or a shallow copy, or explicitly say
that it may vary from resource to resource.

In short, I think the intent is to create a new resource that acts like
the old one, but doesn't share state with it (i.e. is updated
independently).
[Yaron]
Well (2) should be handled in the return message. I hearby nominate you to 
write that part of the spec, all in favor say "AYE". "AYE!" Well that takes 
care of that. As for deep copy, shallow copy, please be more specific. I am 
only familiar with that term in reference to recursive copying.
