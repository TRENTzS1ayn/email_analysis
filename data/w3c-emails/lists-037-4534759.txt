Should it be made explicit that it might be necessary to edit different
representations of the same reource separately?

Actually, an entity only exists in the context of an HTTP message, but the
representation has an existence independent of any such messages.

You mean negotiable representation of a resource. I know I'm being pedantic
but entities are parts of messages.

That's probably better. I think of update as a database operation.

I think of merge as an asymmetric operation which does not produce a new
resource (though a new version o an existing resource). To illustate, if A
and B are tables with the same scheme, mergeing B into A replaces A with a
table containing all relations present in either A or B. This would be
different from a JOIN which would produce an entirely new table.

No. Representations exist on the server. Entities are returned in messages.
