Yaron --

I'll take the action to look at the DMA spec in comparison with our work
here.  However successful or unsuccessful DMA turns out to be, it provides a
useful map of the problem space we are trying to cover.  I think that Dennis
Hamilton, who has contributed largely to the DMA spec, is planning to attend
our November meeting, so he'll be able to help with any discussion of DMA in
relation to webdav.

On the subject of containment, section 7 of the spec proposes to use
SiteMaps as the new content type to represent containers.  I'd like to
change the name of the mime type to application/container to emphasize the
fact that it can represent something other than a URL hierarchy.  For the
case where it's a document management system that stands behind the Web
server, it may be desirable for the location parameter of a node in the
SiteMap to be expressible as something other than a URL.

I think it would be very useful to be able to do recursive deletes,
undeletes, and destroys on resources referenced by a container.
