Could you elaborate on that claim?  URLs are not just filenames. They're
names for whatever you want to name.

Could you give an example of "the location parameter of a node" that's
not expressible as a URL.

Keep in mind that if you have any string S representation of "the
location parameter of a node", we can encode that string using %xx
syntax into S', make up a new URL scheme sch (if necessary), and write
the URL:

sch:S'

If using URLs is (1) sufficient to express location parameters and (2)
necessary to exploit the infrastructure that understands them, then
I suggest that allowing anything besides URLs unnecessarily complicates
the design.
