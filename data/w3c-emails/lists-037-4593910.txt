If there are cases where variants are NOT computed on the fly, what should
happen when someone creates a new version of the resource (by editing one of
the variants)?  I assume the user would normally prefer for the other
variants to be brought into synch automatically -- for new versions of them
to be generated from the one he submitted.  Do we want to do anything to
support this?
