I am very unhappy with this notion. Look at it another way: as I mentioned
in an earlier mail and Dan pointed out again, a representation/entity is a
dead bag of bytes - a resource has life. Please refer to my ealier mail for
details on the definition as pr HTTP:

If you say that distributed authoring is about editing entities and not
resources, the model breaks down when we step plain old outside file
systems. Stuff like editing a server side include or a data base entry
doesn't make sense any longer!
