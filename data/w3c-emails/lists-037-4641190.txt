Yes indeed. Whether representations are generated on the fly or not is an
implementation detail - not subject for protocol definition. The same is
the case for CGI-script outputs - you can't see on a URL what it produces
when you poke it (except from the cases where you peek into the URL and
find tokens like "cgi-bin" or "htbin" :-))

Not in response particularly to this mail but on the discussion on whether
a resource has a name or not, it goes beyond my mind to understand how I
can see something on my screen but I can't give it a name. There is no such
thing as nameless resources. HTTP allows two situations to occur:

1) The server does send a Content-Location with the response in which case
the client _may_ use this location for accessing this resource, for example
to replace it with a new version.

2) The server does not send a Content-Location in which case for all the
client knows the Request-URI _is_ the name of the resource. The client
_may_ want to use any entity tag to make sure that when it uploads a new
version in order to make sure that the server can identify the previous
version.
