I'm glad that you will be able to do a comparison of the work space.
Your first work space summary was very useful, as you will see in the
new draft, I have made several changes based on it.

Section 7 now reads:
7. URI Groups
Any URI, which has a representation of content type
application/container, is defined to be a URI container. Content type
application/container will use the SiteMap format. Members are listed,
added, or removed from the container by performing actions on
application/container.
The advantage of SiteMaps in this context is that they are designed to
point to other SiteMaps. In this way a hierarchy can be built and when
an operation is performed it will act recursively down the tree.

I should note that my use of SiteMap is preliminary. The specification
is in flux and may or may not eventually meet our needs. For now I am
using it as a placeholder so we can solve the truly hairy problems. In
the worst case we will just come out with our own definition.
