I didn't want to place any constraints on whether variants are persistent or
not.  I just wanted to suggest that we provide a way for a user who creates
a new version of a resource to say "Please generate for this new version all
the variants that existed for the previous version" or "Please generate the
following variants for this version".  If it turned out that variants for
the resource were always created on the fly, nothing would have to be done
for this request.  If the server could not satisfy the request, ... well,
we'd have to decide whether it should create the new version anyway or just
fail.
