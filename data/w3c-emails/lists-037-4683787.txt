It would be nice to just allow references to URIs as it simplifies the
BNFs. Furthermore the implementation of most servers, in so far as I am
aware, requires that each representation of a resource be individually
addressable even if they are accessable through a single URI.

However this does mean complicating the act of accessing a
representation. Instead of making a single request with the proper
headers to get to the desired representation we will either have to
provide an encoding of headers into URL space (probably through params)
or require that the user performs a HEAD and that the server must return
a content-location header. This sounds a bit messy.

I would like to hear some more discussion on this point before I alter
the spec.
