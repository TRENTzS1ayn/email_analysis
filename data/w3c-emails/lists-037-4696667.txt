I realize that my new ranges retrieval idea isn't very well baked but
let me give my motivation.

I want to retrieve the AttributeDirectory for a resource but the
directory is HUGE. My poor little WebTV box can't handle that much
memory. I need a way to just pull in a part of the document. I can't use
byte-ranges because I might end up retrieving half of an entry. Imagine
an entry in the AttributeDirectory is "sitemap = http:\foo\bar\blah".
However my byte-range request cut the entry so I only received "sitemap
= http:\foo\bar". The only way I can know there is a problem is if I
request another chunk of the file. This problem also applies to using
DAV for newsgroups or e-mail. The truth is that we are running into a
database problem. How do we retrieve specific records?

I have a feeling that this is a matter for another group. I know that
there has been a lot of talk about having standardized database access
over HTTP around here at MS. Has there already been a W3C or IETF
workgroup on the subject?
