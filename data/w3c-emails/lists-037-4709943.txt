I was just checking through the requirements papers to see what has been
covered so far, and what is missing.  It looks pretty good.

Aside from Relationships and versioning, which are known gaps, the following
requirements are not addressed:

Source retrieval -- Addressed briefly in 2.2 Standard Attributes, but this
would be easy to miss.  Although this strategy would work, it doesn't seem
very intuitive to treat source as an attribute.  The source is the resource.
