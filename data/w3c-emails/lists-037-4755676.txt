# When you register an attribute, you have to register with it a mime type (or
# specify an existing mime type that it uses).  The mime type would specify
# things like whether the value can be a list or must be single-valued, the
# set of valid values or range, length constraints, etc.

I think 'mime type' is not the right type space for attribute
values. Internet Media Types aren't a general typing mechanism, and
the kinds of things you want to say about attributes don't really fit
in, except in the cases where the attribute value really _is_ a piece
of media.

Since there's such a strong interaction between metadata and search,
perhaps we shouldn't try to specify too much in the 'versioning and
distributed authoring' domain except for the mechanisms by which
attributes get set.
