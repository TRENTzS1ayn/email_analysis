This group must define a fairly robust set of attributes. Else everyone
will invent their own and it will take forever before things sort
themselves out. A mechanism to set attributes is just that, a means. I
am much more interested in the ends. For that, we need to define the
attributes we defined the mechanism for.

MIME types are nothing more than data formats. There is nothing mystical
about them. We have a need for well defined data formats so we decided
to use the MIME mechanism.
