I am not going to go postal on this issue. But, we here in MS land will
define attributes which meet our needs if this group doesn't. We need
these attributes to do business. Of course Sun, Novel, Lotus, Oracle,
Netscape, and everyone else will do the same. The result will be a
billion attributes, none of which talk to each other, and the end of our
distributed authoring dream.

>2) The data format of the attribute must be specified to ensure
>interoperability of distributed authoring tools AND the data format for the
>attribute must not have been previously defined in an open specification
>AND the attribute must be in use in an existing Configuration Management or
>Document Management system.

>Examples:
>LockInformation - OK - satisfies requirement 1, since it is integral to the
>technical solution for satisfying the requirement for providing a means of
>discovering which locks are active on a resource.
>Date - OK - even though this is defined as part of the Dublin core, I could

>include in the spec. a  description of how DA tools should interpret the
>data of this attribute.  Many existing systems have a Date attribute,
>Continuus/CM is one.
>Author - NO - it is allright and interoperable to interpret this attribute
>as an opaque string, so it should not be included in our spec., especially
>since it was previously defined in the Dublin core.
