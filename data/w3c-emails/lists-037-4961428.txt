I'm not saying that DAV shoudln't have attributes. I just don't think
that a core set makes a lot of sense. If you want a core set, use
Dublin Core. If you can't use Dublin Core, then why do you imagine
that the core set you can use could have any broader applicability?
You might as well go for USMARC. And it still won't work for some
customers who will want to use HTTP and Versioning and Distributed
Authoring, but could care less about Author and Title but really want,
oh, Budget Center and Client and Brief.
