I have discussed this off line with Roy and frankly I think this is a
religious issue. Roy and I have fundamentally different visions of what
HTTP should become. As with the attributes discussion, I do not believe
this issue can resolved on this list in anything like a reasonable
amount of time. This is another issue that should be dealt with at the
November conference.

I realize that pushing stuff off to November sounds like whimping out
but I have seen these discussions roll on in e-mail and they take
forever and rarely resolve themselves. It is only when you get people in
a room that you can get any kind of resolution. These issues are too
fundamental to be argued out on an e-mail list.
