I suspect this is hair spliting but my understanding of "100 Continue"
is that it is meant to be sent while a request message is being
transmitted to indicate to the client that the request is being properly
received. Further, I thought that if the request has completed
transmission then all "100 Continue"s should be thrown out. I thought it
was introduced because of chunking.

What I am suggesting is that the server will send a continuous stream of
update messages, which will be formatted as responses, informing the
client of a request's progress. This would be used to create progress
bars and the like. If we wanted I am sure "100 Continue" could be tasked
to the purpose, we just need to make sure that each response contains
enough context so the client can unambigously determine which request
the response is in reference to.

This sort of asynchronous notification solves a problem so fundamental
it has been built into just about every OS known to humanity.
