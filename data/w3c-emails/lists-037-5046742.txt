I just looked into the rathole that is search. It is so deep that I got
sick just peeking at it. So I have decided to wimp out and specify that
we create an attribute header. The attribute header will point to a URI
which specifies a search resource. In most cases that will probably be a
HTTP URL which points to a search page, either a local one or something
like AltaVista/Lycos/etc.
Thoughts?
