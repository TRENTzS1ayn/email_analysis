Sounds familiar. In the DMA effort, we've defined a set of Microsoft COM
objects that express a query model that we think is pretty consistent
with
the thinking in the SQL III, ODMG OQL world.

It's been a pretty sizable undertaking, and we don't have complete
agreement 
within the group that our approach is the right one. I think you're wise
to 
avoid jumping down into this particular rathole, at least for this round
of design.
