We have an easy way to deal with dragons. Our standard allows developers
to ignore them. With the exception of attributes which are used to
implement a number of features, the entire standard is severable. So a
developer can pick and choose what features they care to support. If any
of our solutions do not meet their tastes they can feel free to not use
them.
