1. The problem with automatically sending update information is that it
will break many clients. HTTP 1.1 clients do not handle unsolicited
responses very well. HTTP 1.0 clients would probably go insane. So we
need a way for a client to indicate that they can handle unsolicited
responses. Hence the header.
2. As for building into OS's, Sockets come to mine.
