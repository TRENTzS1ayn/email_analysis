Oh, so it's a versioning issue, not a client capability issue. That
makes sense. Status might be signalled by a

    102 Processing

status code, probably with an entity body which contains the actual
status. This would signal the client that the server is still working
on the request and not to time out.

We could add a new request header which indicates a client's
willingness to accept such a status code, or else just bundle it in
with HTTP/1.2
  GET uri HTTP/1.2

would be the signal that '102 processing' responses are acceptable.

Right?

Larry
