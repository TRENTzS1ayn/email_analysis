# Is there a HTTP 1.2 group? I thought the HTTP group's charter ran out
# with 1.1.

The HTTP group's charter runs out when the HTTP group runs out of
things which it agrees are worth doing.  At one point that looked like
it was going to be sooner (December) but now it looks like there are
more things worth doing.

But don't confuse IETF groups with work items: you don't need a
working group to make, or extend, an IETF standard. The requirement is
that you have a process that insures adequate review, and usually that
process is 'form a working group'.
