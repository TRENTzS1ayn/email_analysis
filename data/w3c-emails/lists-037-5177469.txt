Yes, that's one of the reasons why 1xx codes were re-introduced.

Unnecessary. Any HTTP/1.1 client must treat all unrecognized 1xx responses
as if they were 100 responses.  Any client that doesn't is not using HTTP/1.1.
The only thing you have to remind people of is that they can't send or
forward any 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client.

.....Roy (and any implementer that screws-up on that part of the protocol
          is going to get a severe thrashing from me, since it is the key
          to status extensibility)
