When I was associated with DMA (Novell's Representative) I remember us working on a lot of infrastructure. What the Distributed Authoring folks are doing is developing protocols to make collaborative documents a reality. Surely DMA and the work of the wg will cross. I would hope that DMA would participate rather than be "amused" by the efforts of the working group.

As well, there are two DMA members sitting on the working group, Xerox and Novell. I can speak for Novell in saying that we hope to see the efforts of the working group make our DMS more globally available via standard IETF approved protocols.

Don't worry -- there are a number of DMA folks on this distribution
list, and we are also looking at how your work compares to and might
interact with ours.

Some of your recent discussions are amusing, since we've been through
those issues.
