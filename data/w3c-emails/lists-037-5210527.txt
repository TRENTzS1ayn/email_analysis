# Sending those headers involves overhead, a lot of overhead on slower

Since there's a way that servers can send these kinds of responses
when they see fit, and the servers are just as qualified as the
clients to know when it's a good idea and when it's a waste of
bandwidth, why don't we just put in the response notification and
leave the request-for-response-notification behind.
