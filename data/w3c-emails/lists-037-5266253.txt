Ah! Terribly good point: if we say that feature X is triggered
by using media type MX, then we've lost the ability to use
other data formats to do X; we've lost the traditional
'format negotiation' degree of freedom.

One way to address that is to make sure MX is a compound (aka
multipart) data format with a typed 'payload' subpart. But
that starts to get contorted Real Fast.

So I'm in favor of separate methods for COPY, MOVE, RENAME,
and other long-standing filesystem operations. My convictions
are less strong about less traditional idioms like BROWSE,
LOCK, etc., but my intuitions are in the same direction.

The only time I struggle with the issue is when the operation can be
piggy-backed on GET, PUT, or POST with 'carrier wave' headers; for
example, GET-with-lock could use a GET method with funky headers.
That reduces the:

C: LOCK R
S: 2xx OK, here's the lock
---or---
S: 5xx Huh? what's LOCK?
C: GET R
S: 200 OK, here's the document
conversation to:
C: GET-with-lock R
S: 2xx OK, here's the document and the lock
---or---
S: 200 OK, here's the document (doesn't grok with-lock)

Even that's a bad example, since consuming a resource like a lock
is a goofy thing to do in an idempotent[sic] method like GET.
