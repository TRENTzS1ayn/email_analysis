I'll trust you on the details, but this is exactly the sort of thing I
had hoped the DMA community would do with URLs. It seems like a very
natural use of the extensibility in URLs.

p.s. I keep a list of URL schemes at:

http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Addressing/schemes

That document also points to some notes on URLs from the IETF
applications area (where the URI WG lived). He and I like to be
notified of new URL schemes.
