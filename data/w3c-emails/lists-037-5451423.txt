All - 

In rummaging around the Web attempting to cure my ignorance regarding
Document Management Systems, I stumbled across the AIIM site at
http://ww.aiim.org/, and located a document there entitled "Open Document
Management API 1.5" The URL for the home page is 

http://www.aiim.org/odma/odma.htm

I'm hoping that someone from this working group can answer the following
questions: 

1) is this "standard" live? i.e., is the Document Management community
actually using this specification? 

2) if the answer is yes, then I would suggest that it might be a useful
exercise to determine whether the extensions proposed in "Extensions for
Distributed Authoring and Versioning for World Wide Web" are sufficent to
implement the functionality expressed in this API.

Just a thought ...

Charlie
