I believe Kim Woodward is the new ODMA chair.
Unfortunatly, Documentum's worldwide user conference is in
Florida next week...So, Kim, myself (I'm one of the web
products engineers) and others will not be 
able to attend next weeks meeting.  There are a few others
who are not going to the users conference, so I'm encouraging
them to attend the meeting in Palo Alto.  They say they'll
try to make it.
