I am going to speak some serious heresy here but the more I think about
it the less I like attributes. I am starting to get this horrible
feeling of impending doom and its name is LDAP. Might not providing a
means to access LDAP through HTTP (sorta of like what happened with FTP
over HTTP and Cern Proxies) save us a whole world of pain? It also
neatly solves our search problem. O.k. not neatly, but at least it
leverages a lot of currently existing work.
