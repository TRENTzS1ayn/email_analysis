Seems to me that any kind of URL markup is going to suffer from this kind of
problem. The simple solution (I think) is to require the "real" URL to be
escaped:

 http://foo.org/docs%3bid=27;attribute=author

Ouch. I guess you'll have to have a separate address space to solve this one,
as in:

 http://foo.org/DAV/docs%3battribute=XYZ

where DAV is chosen per-server.
