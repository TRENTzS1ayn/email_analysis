1. You need a PUT for every resource you create, HTML or not. Attributes
are resources, so every attribute you create will require a PUT. HTTP
Attributes have nothing what so ever to do with HTML.

2. It is not acceptable to have to download every single attribute every
time I do a GET. The overhead is huge. As for abusing the term header,
fine, call them attributes. Drop the word header. An attribute is
nothing more than a typed link. The semantics of this link is that when
a resource with attribute linked resources is manipulated the associated
resources are also effected. As for manipulating the name space, this is
a trade off. Performing two gets every time I want to get an attribute,
once to get the URI of the attribute and again to retrieve the
attribute, is not acceptable. Its too big a performance hit. Thus we
must have a means to refer to an attribute without two lookups. The URL
kludge is a legitimate way to do that. Though I suspect we will change
the semantics to use ? rather than the "<"...">" syntax.

3. There are no references in the document to HTML. HTML has nothing to
do with the document.
