Now that is totally unacceptable. If we are going to consider it as part
of this document then it must be publicly available. For the moment it
is just a place holder for "some sort of generic hierarchical format."
One day when the spec hits version 1 (not 0.1, 0.2, or the upcoming 0.3)
we will either have a reference or we will create our own.
