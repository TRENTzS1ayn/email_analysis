I haven't said anything about this because I've been relecutant to
criticize a proposal on aesthetic grounds. but the idea of using separate
media types for each action really bothers me. Why don't we introduce a
single media type application/webdav and then use a parameter for the
specific action, as in

application/webdav;action=delete
