I like this idea. In fact, I've been experimenting with the idea of using
multipart/related in another context to transfer database records. My only
question is whether the experimental status of the RFC will pose a problem
for us. If so, what do we need to do?

Probably not much. After all, both SMTP mail and HTTP use the same
messaging model(modulo details like Content-Transfer-Encoding, but that
shouldn't affect us.)

Or, as I suggested elsewhere, we could introduce a single media type and
use parameters. It just seems like we're asking for trouble by introeducing
a separate media type for each action we wish to support. Even with
methods, we could include the method in the RFC-822 header, perhaps as
X-WEBDAV-Method: or some such thing. (Not that I advocate this approach.)
