# I like this idea. In fact, I've been experimenting with the idea of using
# multipart/related in another context to transfer database records. My only
# question is whether the experimental status of the RFC will pose a problem
# for us. If so, what do we need to do?

The MHTML group has pushed multipart/related into standards track,
since they needed it for mailing around HTML documents with the
included GIFs and JPEGs. There are new versions in the internet drafts
directories:

Reply-to: iesg@ietf.org

 The IESG has received a request from the MIME Encapsulation of
 Aggregate HTML Documents Working Group to consider the following three
 documents for the  status of Proposed Standard:

 1. MIME E-mail Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML
    (MHTML)
        <draft-ietf-mhtml-spec-05.txt>

 2. Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators
        <draft-ietf-mhtml-cid-02.txt>

 3. The MIME Multipart/Related Content-type
        <draft-ietf-mhtml-related-00.txt>

 The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
 final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
 iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by November 18, 1996.
