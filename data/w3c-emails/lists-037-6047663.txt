This has been suggested by a number of people and I am starting to like
it. The only real argument against it is that it makes it more difficult
to parse requests. If a request is a copy I want to send it to program A
but if it is a delete I want to send it to program B. However as I
expect we will agree on a compromise to introduce new method names but
allow for the use of post and depend on the application/webdav mime
type, I think we can make everyone equally unhappy. Which, of course, is
the definition of compromise. =)
