MIME parameters are normally descriptive of the nature of the content,
and don't really express operations. What I was thinking of for having
actions be expressed as POST was really that the POST-ed data might be

multipart/action-request

 part 1: type = action-description
 part 2: related data
 part 3: related data

and that you could be backward compatible by supporting forms that
used multipart/form-data.
