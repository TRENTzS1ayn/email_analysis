I have created a web site for materials from the Palo Alto meeting, at URL:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/paloalto/

It currently contains the final agenda, a list of attendees, and Yaron
Goland's slides.  Once they are approved, the site will also contain the
final minutes.  Kenji Ota's slides will be added once I receive them.
