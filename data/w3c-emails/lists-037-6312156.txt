For those members of the working group who have expressed a desire to
use distributed authoring technology, we've set up a versioned,
distributed authoring server at <http://webdav.sb.aol.com/>

The good news is that you probably already have an account set up,
the bad news is that we had a warehouse full of home pages left over
from the NaviService Webfests, so you'll probably want to change yours :-)
