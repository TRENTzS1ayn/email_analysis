   I submitted a version of the requirements to the ID people, but an email
failure at my end made it too late for the deadline. I will resubmit once
the closed period is over.

   I have glanced over Judith's list of additional points, and I will
attempt to address them in the next draft. If anyone has issues with or
strong attachments to particular suggestions, it will certainly help me if
we can discuss them before I integrate them into the draft, in the case
that the discussion would have a significant effect on the wording. I am
have put the current draft on my home page:
  http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/draft-durand-versreq-00.html

I am also attaching HTML and text-only versions to a following message.

   There are almost no changes other than minor copy-editing and
spell-checking. The next revision will have a a lot more changes, as I
attempt to integrate the 2 requirements documents and Judith's comments
