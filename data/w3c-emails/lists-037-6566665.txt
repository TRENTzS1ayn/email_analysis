At the last meeting we discussed holding the next full working
group meeting in Irvine, on January 23-24.  Due to a local
scheduling conflict with the Conference on Software Process
Improvement (CoSPI), which our research group is also sponsoring,
we will not be able to hold our meeting on those dates.

Let me propose that we hold our meeting on the following
Monday and Tuesday, January 27-28, at U.C. Irvine.

Please let me know if this creates a schedule conflict for
you, or if you know of other, existing schedule conflicts.

I'll be finalizing the date for the next meeting by Dec. 18,
so please let me know about conflicts soon.

Thanks!

- Jim
