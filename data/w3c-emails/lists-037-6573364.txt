WEBDAV BOF Brief Summary

The BOF on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning was held on Wednesday,
December 11, 1996, from 09:00-11:30, with 79 people in attendance over the
duration of the meeting. Jim Whitehead presented an overview and history of
WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning, including information on how to
become involved in the work of the DAV group, which was followed by a
detailed presentation on the current DAV functionality requirements. There
was a lively discussion on the requirements, including such issues as lock
administration, use of public key technology, access control models, the
degree of intelligence of "move" functionality, and recommendations of
related protocols and systems to investigate (such as AFS, IMAP, and ACAP
for their models of access control). These issues will be discussed further
on our mailing list. At the end of the session, the attendees were polled
on whether they thought it would be worthwhile for the IETF to work on WWW
Distributed Authoring and Versioning. Overwhelmingly, the attendees thought
the IETF should pursue work in this area (the vast majority were in favor,
with 2-3 opposed, and a handful of abstentions).
