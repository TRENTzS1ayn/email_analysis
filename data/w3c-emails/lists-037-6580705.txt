Tying up some loose ends, I have placed an initial draft of the minutes
from the *Palo Alto* WEBDAV meeting at URL:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/paloalto/minutes.html

This text is almost entirely identical to the meeting overview previously
posted.  The deadline for comments on the minutes is Friday, January 3, at
which point the minutes (incorporating all comments received) will become
official.
