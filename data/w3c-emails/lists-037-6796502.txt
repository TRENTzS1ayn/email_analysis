I've only recently joined this list, and I missed the WEBDAV meeting at IETF 
due to a conflict, so I apologize if this comes out of left field.  Anyway, I 
saw the comments about a "difference" operation and thought I'd mention that 
there's a collaborative editing environment someone built in AT&T (pre-split), 
derived from "WikiWikiWeb", which presents the differences between versions of 
a page by marking up the HTML using a program "HtmlDiff".  HtmlDiff is also 
AT&T-internal but has been released for noncommercial use and might be 
released more widely given interest.  

I'm also interested in using the kinds of versioning you're talking about in 
order to send updates to pages over to browsers (to save bandwidth and 
transfer times).  Can anyone tell me if this has been discussed in this forum 
before?

For more info on HtmlDiff or the update-based transfers, see my home page:
