DAV is an HTTP protocol and thus is able to take full advantage of all
generic HTTP ACL and Security work. I would recommend that the
requirements only identify Security in general and ACLs in particular,
as areas of concern, and then explain that they are out of scope for DAV
because they touch on areas beyond DAV's limited authoring/versioning
scope.

Lets not fall into the trap of trying to solve the world's problems.
ACLs and security are best left to groups who are grabbling with just
those issues.
