Nice try, but... Distributed Authoring has different security
requirements
than Document Access. A DAV server must accept data and then express
the client's requested authorization policy in how the future web
server authorizes requests. This is a greater requirement than has
been addressed by HTTP security. 

I agree you should try to limit the scope of what you handle to
be "the minimum needed to build interoperable clients", but I believe
taht the minimum exceeds what has been done so far for DAV-less HTTP.
