I agree that there are certain requirements that are specific to DAV,
just as there are requirements specific to programmatic resources, file
handling, distributed resources, and every other group under the sun.
However, those needs should be addressed within the context of a working
group tasked to solve the general ACL problem. We should not try to come
up with a solution that only meets our needs and we should not presume
to dictate a solution to meet needs outside the scope of this group.
