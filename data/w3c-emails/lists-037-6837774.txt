There's a fine line between 'authoring a document' and 'managing a
server'. DAV necessarily crosses that line somewhat, but it's not
obvious to me that setting authorization policy on a document isn't too
far to the 'managing a server' side. A client might also like to be able
to set various cache control policies on a document that it authored,
but (so far at least) that hasn't been considered to be part of DAV. How
are these cases so different? I guess the real question is "How much
server management should DAV take on?" My gut answer is "As little as
possible", but maybe that's too naive.
