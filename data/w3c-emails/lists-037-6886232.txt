In the end, it doesn't matter what you call the groups; what
matters is whether the necessary work gets done. If you want
to "form an ACL working group", that's fine, but the first part
of "make sure we satisfy DAV needs" would be to turn back to
the DAV group & ask what those needs are.

If WEBDAV were to be explicit about DAV needs, we'd know what
it would take to be done.
