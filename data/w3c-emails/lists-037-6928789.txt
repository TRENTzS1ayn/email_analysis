Sometimes access permissions to a document are a function of the document's 
state.  When a document is being drafted the author has write access, and maybe 
nobody else can read it;  when the document goes out for review, others gain 
read access;  when the document is ultimately approved and vaulted even the 
original author may lose write access.  

This behavior can in some cases be modeled by moving the document from a private
directory to a public one, etc.  But if there is a large variety of review 
teams, the number of combinations of permissions to set up and maintain on 
individual directories may be prohibitive.  I really like to think of access 
control as being a function of the individual document's state, part of the 
meta-information about the file.

(I'm new to the mailing list, I hope this applies.  Enlighten me if it doesn't, 
please.)

I agree.  I think both are important, from general usability,
but I personally would be most concerned with privacy issues
where applicable.  To the extent that if such mechanism for
determining public/private weren't available it would limit
what I would put in the repository.  I think most folks may
respond similarly,
