I think the WEBDAV group is best qualified to determine the
nature of the minimum requirements for access control necessary
to build functional but interoperable authoring systems,
and that furthermore we'll do ourselves a favor by surveying
the minimum requirements of existing authoring systems.

It may be that all the 'access control' we can ask for is
for the WEBDAV server to give the user a web page that allows
them to change the default access authorization for a page
they just stored, for example.
