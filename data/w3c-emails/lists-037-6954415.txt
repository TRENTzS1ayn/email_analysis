Also the Andrew file system (if I remember correctly) also has
a good ACL implementation.

That's horribly insufficient, IMHO.  Again look at the ACL's
from the Andrew FS, that's more like it, I think.  At least
user and group access rights, similar to read write permissions
and the ability to specify basic logical op's too.
