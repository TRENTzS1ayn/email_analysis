A few clarifications.

Our intent was to push statements about which functionality is optional or
mandatory into the protocol specification.  The Design Team found that the
dependencies between features in the protocol specification changed as we
considered different designs, and these changing dependencies have some
affect on whether a feature should be mandatory or optional.   Rather than
hardwire statements about mandatory or optional functionality into the
requirements, which would then need to be changed based on changes in the
design, it seemed more prudent to treat the requirements document as a
series of MUST statements about what functionality should be in the
interface described in the protocol specification document, but let the
protocol document be the final word on whether a particular functionality
was mandatory or optional.

The view of the Design Team is that while audit trails are a good thing,
and should be supported in a WebDAV server, we found that requiring audit
trails had no effect on the interface for performing WebDAV operations
(it's a side effect of other operations).  Since we view the requirements
document as describing what should be supported by the interfaces given in
the protocol document, a requirement which doesn't impact any interface is
viewed as useless.  Hence our recommendation to remove the requirement.

Also, by audit trail we were intending an operation similar to the current
logging employed by servers.  So, for example, if you perform a move, the
server would record the move, along with the source and destination URLs.
We had been viewing the history recording operations of a versioning system
as being something different from this kind of audit trail, however, I can
definitely understand viewing them similarly.   Versioning operations will
definitely have to record predecessor and successor relationships, as well
as the principal who performed edits on a particular revision.
