-------------------

Or, worse, DAV-non-compliant tools.... it *will* be done, the question
is *how* and *by who*... I say we tackle it now, while there's little
contest by vendors [so far...]

I agree...

yes, I agree here also.  just don't make it the same as the system/
file system ugo and all's well [don't make sysadmins do yet more work].
I know of some code that's of dubious ownership, but was dev'ed under
govt contract and so might be available, I'd have to check, but it is
one implementation that addresses these issues, and might be helpful to
consider as this group looks at this [acl] issue.  If there's interest
I'll dig into the situation and see if I can contribute it.




More than good enough for the needs of this group. If implementors

-------------------------
yes, we need to set a *good* minimum req's level, and then product
competition should be able to take over from there...
