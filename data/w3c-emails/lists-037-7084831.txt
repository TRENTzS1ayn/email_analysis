This fits well with my mental model, as we have several security systems
in place (NT, Unix, Oracle, ...), while meanwhile we are evaluating
multiple access methods and "single login" methods.  So an interface
sounds like the right direction to me.  Once that is worked out, maybe
our W3C members could see fit to putting a simple reference
implementation into Jigsaw (the W3C experimental Web server).
