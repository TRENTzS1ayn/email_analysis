One area I'd like some clarification on (unfortunately I got into
WEBDAV a little late) is where the protocol is "positioned."  The
IETF description of the WG talks about developing new HTTP methods,
etc.

A concern I would have would be relying on Web server vendors to
provide the necessary capabilities "soon";  it should be possible to
implement the necessary protocols through (at a minimum) CGI programs
that could become extensions of the Web server.  That way we
effectively support the entire legacy infrastructure.  The existing
infrastructure of e-mail, Web browser and Web server products
should be capable of supporting the aims of WEBDAV by encapsulating
requests within multipart/form-data requests on the "input" side
and the current Web server infrastructure on the output side.  I'd
be concerned that extensions to the HTTP header would backfire and
would grant license to the big players in the server arena (Microsoft
and Netscape) to dominate the WEBDAV applications market.

This is either old ground or a holy war -- tell me which! ;)

Jon
