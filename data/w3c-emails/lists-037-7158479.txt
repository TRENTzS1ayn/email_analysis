Development of new HTTP methods and headers has been the technical approach
favored by this group since the Palo Alto meeting (see
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/paloalto/), where it became clear that server
implementors overwhelmingly favored a method-based approach over an
RPC-like system using POST with parameters in the body.

One of the environment variables passed to a CGI script is
"REQUEST_METHOD", hence it is possible to implement new WebDAV methods
using CGI scripts.

The current position on this is that email access to WebDAV functionality
is extremely desirable, but due to lack of interest on anyone's part to
become a document editor for a document that defines both requirements for
email access, and a mechanism for email access, at present the WG is simply
ensuring that any design they develop does not preclude future development
of a standard for email access to WebDAV functionality.

However, since there are many new members on the list, let me repeat my
call for volunteers to be a document editor of a document which gives
requirements and a proposal for implementing access to WebDAV functionality
via email.  I suspect that this task would require a commitment of anywhere
from 10-40 person hours per month for several months.

Please contact me personally if you are interested.

It's premature to predict market dominance of servers for a protocol which
hasn't been completely defined yet, no?  There are several communities
which have expressed interest in WebDAV a non-complete list of which
includes Web server developers, document management system vendors, and
configuration management system vendors.  There is some overlap among these
communities.  This, to me, is an indicator there will be a wide range of
vendors offering servers with WebDAV capability.
