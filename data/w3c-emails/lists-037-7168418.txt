In my opinion, CGI is a poor framework for meeting WebDAV's
requirements. NCSA is considering developing a WebDAV-compliant server
which would be released under our free-for-noncommercial-use licensing
terms. And other noncommercial efforts are likely too; luckily, server
development is not a closed shop.

On the other hand, your concern makes sense, and creates the
undesirable situation that people are doing state management within
their CGI subsystems which is redudant with, parallel to, and not
cleanly interoprable with their server's own management of state.
This is a waste of effort, since the more elaborate these systems
become the more they resemble servers and the less sense it makes to
talk to them through forms rather than an adequately flexible
protocol.
