------------------------------

I agree that CGI compliance is valuable for this reason, but I also
liked the idea of incorporating into jigsaw, as a 'native' implementation
would also be valuable and might help to steer the "giants"

------------------------------
Also worthy of consideration are the new web protocols  HTTP-NG and
HTTP-MUX (these are closely related to each other), as both of these
provide a mechanism for bundling arbitrary numbers of files, and more
efficiently than using MIME multipart bundling (at least I know that
HTTP-NG does provide this, and I believe HTTP-MUX does also but do
correct me if I'm wrong).  I'll copy Simon Spero, the author of the
HTTP-NG protocol, in case I'm lying ;-)

-----------------------------

I'd stay within HTTP-NG or HTTP-MUX, if working with the http protocol
or else I would say your concerns are quite valid...

A little of both?
