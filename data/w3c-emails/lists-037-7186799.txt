Based on this statements can it also be assumed that an intention
of WebDAV would be for it to be possible to perform WebDAV methods 
without new client software, e.g., use an HTML form to acquire 
information about desired methods and parameters which then feeds into 
the Web server a request which can be fulfilled?  In other words,
could the end-user interactive elements of the WebDAV infrastructure be
centralized at the server, utilizing the Web browser as simply a
communications channel?  Could I use IE?  Netscape 2.0?  Mosaic?
Lynx (only kidding).
