Is there anyone on the list who would be interested in creating and
maintaining a WebDAV FAQ list?  Given the significant number of new people
on the WebDAV list, and the difficulty of capturing and conveying
background information and past decisions, I think it would be really
useful to have such a list.

Any volunteers?  Time commitment is estimated at 20-40 hours to create the
list, and 5 hours/month maintenance.
