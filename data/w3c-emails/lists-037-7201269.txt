I suspect that you will be able to construct a server which exposes WebDAV
functionality via an HTML interface -- the BSCW system (http://bscw.gmd.de)
is one example of how this might look.  However, I don't think the WebDAV
group needs to be concerned about this case because this type of operation
does not require an interoperability standard.

In general, there hasn't been a major concern with preserving downlevel
client interoperability given the rapid turnover of client software, and
the small base of existing Web distributed authoring clients.
