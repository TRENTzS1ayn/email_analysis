I looked at http://bscw.gmd.de and thought their efforts were admirable,
and
they have the right idea as far as using the existing technology as the
interface.  WebDAV client programs should either work similarly inside
the browser or as extensions thereof.

Maybe there should be a set of proposed extension methods to Java that
help implement this capability within the browser.
