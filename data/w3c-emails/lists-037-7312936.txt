in today's systems ACLs provide the most common and secure access
controls, they are difficult to maintain and manage. I would like to be
able to encourage directory based access control techniques within
the DAV environment.

ok, yes I agree, acls should be accomodated, but I agree that the
solution shouldn't be limited to them.  Directory level specifications
of access properties would also be useful.
