It sounded like the earlier suggestion - an API to ask
"does X have permission on y" isn't limited to ACLs. A more sophisticated system
that checks to see that person X works for the company, has an advanced degree, 
and passed the company web authoring 101 course, could present the same API as 
an ACL manager and give a yes/no answer on permissions. (as an example, Bill 
Johnston at LBNL is developing such a system).

The point: I agree with Dave that ACL specifics shouldn't creep into a security 
API, and don't think they have to for DAV's purposes.

I believe that DAV should touch on security, but please do not insist 
on ACLs. The exact binding of security attributes to system 
implementation must be left to the application to allow alternatives 
to ACLs to grow.
