You're right. I was tacitly assuming people followed an approach similar
to ours. I suspect that the all or nothing approach to access control in
many current environments ha been a big factor in restrivcting write
access to the server. (Note that I'm talking as much of a
policy/administrative limitation as a technical one). I suspect that a
standardized method of access control would make the situation you
describe (everyone an author) feasible (and probably desirable, but fo
course, that isn't a technical issue).

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
