     I think it's the List part of ACL (Access Control List) that gets into 
     implementation. If I understand, everyone wants access control 
     specified, but doesn't want to restrict how it's done to lists,at 
     least in the design. Directory based, role based, ... , don't have a 
     list per se.

I agree that WEBDAV shouldn't become involved in specifying 
implementations, but I do think it is not only appropriate but necessary 
for us to specify requirements for access control. Perhaps the term ACL 
conjures up images Windows NT, OpenVMS and some flavors of UNIX. As such, 
it does sound like an implementation approach, but I think access control 
is a design issue and not an implementation issue. Or am I missing the 
point?

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come 
up with a better one.
