How can an interoperable client deal with an access control policy if it
doesn't have an implementation that fits the structure?

I think the answer is "policy is embedded in forms".

The "access control policy" for a resource is linked metadata, but there
is also a method for associating an access control policy with a realm. 

We need to define the realm, too.
