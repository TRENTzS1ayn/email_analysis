This is an important part of the design, to separate out the different
resources for 'control'. The IPP group seemed to run into this, in
having a separate URLs for "job data submit", "job status" and "job
cancel".

I think we're moving along in this direction by using links,
but perhaps there are some factorization that we've
not addressed that you see in your application?

Could you be more explicit about what needs to be factored?

As soon as you allow that kind of factorization, you have
to worry about access control which is currently realm-based.
It might actually solve, rather than create, problems, though.
