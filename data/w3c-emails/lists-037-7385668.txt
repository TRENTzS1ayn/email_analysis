So far, the WEBDAV effort has very much been concerned with producing a
protocol which avoids natural language bias in its field encodings, and
this has been a conscious goal in design efforts.  To date, our efforts for
trying to accomplish this have been to reduce as much as possible any
protocol elements which have a particular bias towards any natural
language.

I look foward to specific feedback from you on how well our proposals can
be internationalized.
