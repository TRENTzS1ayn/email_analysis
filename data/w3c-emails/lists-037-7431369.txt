Jim, there are a bunch of different questions:

1) is WEBDAV adequate for representing non-western scripts?
   This is now basic protocol design.
2) Can a single server support users who speak different languages?
   This is basically where there's something like accept-language
   negotiation or user profile or locale information kept & conveyed.
3) Can WEBDAV be used to maintain resources that have different
   language renditions, e.g., does it help with the problem of
   updating the English version and being able to find out which
   files need translation.

We might hope that we've covered (1) just by being careful.
(2) is less likely, and (3) is something we ought to think about
more generally.

Larry
