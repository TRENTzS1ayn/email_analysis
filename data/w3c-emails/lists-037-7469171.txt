The point: I agree with Dave that ACL specifics shouldn't creep into a
security API, and don't think they have to for DAV's purposes.

yes, I agree that specifics should probably stay out of the API,
and think that we should perhaps use a couple real world scenarios
to ensure that the API doesn't get too close to, say, ACL-specific
details, for example.
