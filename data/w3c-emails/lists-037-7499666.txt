The scope of the functionality to be included in this protocol is
given in the requirements document, which is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/webdav-req-00.html

The WebDAV WG Charter also gives a more high-level description of the
scope of the WebDAV effort.  It is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/charter.html

If you wish to extend or limit the scope of the current WebDAV effort
you may propose new requirements (or the removal of a requirement).
If the new requirement goes beyond the scope described in
our charter, I will have to renegotiate it with the Application Area
directors.
