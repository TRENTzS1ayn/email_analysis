I think most people are aware of the considerations, but might have a
different model for what the scaling issues are.

The general principle for scaling in DAV is that every object that
can be manipulated independently is a resource, and has its own URL.
The relationship between resources is always determined by operations
on (one of) the related resources, rather than, say, by string
manipulation of the URLs. (The only exception to this is the possible
relationship of a 'realm' to a partial URL string, in the same way
that HTTP authentication and cookies are tied to realms.)

Because resources are linked by URLs, resources need not reside on
the same physical machine.

At least, that was the general idea. It's up to you to evaluate whether
the design and its elaboration meets your needs.
