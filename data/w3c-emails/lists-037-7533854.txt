>Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,
>location-independent, resource identifiers. This document sets
>forward the canonical syntax for URNs.  A discussion of both existing
>legacy and new namespaces and requirements for URN presentation and
>transmission are presented.  Finally, there is a discussion of URN
>equivalence and how to determine it. This document is the product of
>the Uniform Resource Names Working Group of the IETF.
>
>This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
>
>This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
>Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
>improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
>Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state and
>status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
