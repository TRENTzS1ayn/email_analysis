Just to make sure that I am not misunderstood: The suggestions I am making
*are* implemented in our system and atleast one other research system and a
product that I am familiar with. So, these are not hypothetical requests.

I am not sure where we are going with this. *We need* the service
separation that I asked for. We have implemented such a system. A
client/server protocol that adds check-in and check-out methods does not
support our requirements.
