In our system we are able to establish "policy management" (i.e., workflow,
etc.) based on the type of meta-data associated with a document/folder. The
typing of the meta data is used to generate intelligent notifications
(which might then start the workflow process). Another use is to associate
"context" information about how a document was created and include its type
such that when the document is shipped with its context (as meta data) the
receiveing workspace can meaningfully work with the context information
(for example use the methods of the type to perform some operations not
available in the receiveing workspace - such as simple translation).

Arguably yes! But, I am not sure I know enough about this broad field to
affirmatively say yes.

The easiest thing to do is to leave the semantics of the typing mechanism
left unspecified, but provide a protocol for expressing the information.
Sort of like what XML does. 

So, in this context, why not use XML as the meta data protocol for WEBDAV.
Atleast the major browser vendors have committed to having XML parsers on
the client side. We can bootstrap off of this infrastructure.
