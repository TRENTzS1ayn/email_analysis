You should bring these questions up on the URN-WG list, not the
Web DAV list. The URN list is urn-ietf@bunyip.com. I have added it
to the CC list on this reply.

That will depend on the rules for the namespace foo. The URN syntax
is an attempt to be as liberal as possible so as to allow many
different namespaces to exist. The rules for particular namespaces
are intended to be much stricter. As an example, take a look at
the URN-WG's internet draft on using bibliographic identifiers as URNs.
Two of the namespaces in that document (ISBN and ISSN) disallow the use
of ':' and many other characters. The third (SICI) has much more
liberal rules because SICIs use lots of funny characters.

The URN sytnax RFC takes a strong position on the first two occurances
of ':'. After that, it is up to particular namespaces how ':' is or is not
used.

No, it is not taken as a negative criticism. However, one of the requirements
on URNs was the ability to grandfather legacy naming systems (such as SICIs).
If allowing ':' makes it easier to accomodate some naming schemes, then we
thought it would be worth some additional implementation difficulty. The
additional difficulty seems very small. The first two ':' characters are
required, so once one has stripped off the "urn:" prefix and the NID
field with its colon, no more special treatment of ':' is required for
a general URN parser. You will probably want to use the NID to lookup
special parsing rules for the namespace, but that is another story.

Single occurances of '%' are disallowed. '%' is supposed to ALWAYS mean
that the next two characters will be hex digits that are taken to
form an octet.
