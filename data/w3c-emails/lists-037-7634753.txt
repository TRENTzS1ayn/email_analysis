Two major issues for access control in authoring situations is 

a) the partitioning of users and the type of operations that these users
can perform, and
b) State of the objects and the transactions being performed on these objects

All of this should fall out from a better understanding of the
requirements. In any case, APIs have not been traditionally successful in
IETF like settings. Also, in the context of proxies, gateways, etc. dealing
with the protocol implicatin is lot more important. So perhaps we can focus
there first. File oriented specification is a start but web objects are not
just files.
