Announce: WebDAV Working Group Meeting

There will be a meeting of the WebDAV Working Group, on July 14-15, 1997,
to be held at the Novell facility in Orem, Utah.  Many thanks to Steve
Carter and Novell for hosting this meeting! The purpose of the meeting is
to provide a forum for focused, detailed discussion on the current WebDAV
protocol specification and requirements document (a preliminary agenda will
be posted in a few weeks).  This is an open meeting -- anyone is welcome to
attend.

What: WebDAV Working Group meeting
Where: Novell, Orem, Utah
When: July 14-15, 1997 (9AM-5PM both days)

This meeting is being held in addition to the upcoming Munich IETF meeting,
August 11-15, 1997, at which there will also be detailed review of the
WebDAV protocol specification, but over a much shorter time span.

Registration:

If you are planning on attending this meeting, please send an email to
Steve Carter <srcarter@novell.com> with a subject of "WebDAV Registration"
giving your name, and corporate affiliation (if applicable) by July 9.
This allows Steve to plan food amounts, and to notify Novell security that
you're coming.

Orem, Utah:

Orem is 45 minutes south of the Salt Lake City International airport, and
is right next to Provo.  Hopefully Steve will post some hotel
recommendations -- my list from when I visited in December is:

  1) Marriott Courtyard, 1600 N Freedom Blvd, Provo
      tel (801) 373-2222, Reservations: 800 228-9290
  2) Provo Park Hotel, 101 W 100 N Provo
      tel (801) 377-4700, Reservations: 800 777-7144

I have stayed in the Provo Park Hotel, and it was very nice.  I believe the
Courtyard offers a free shuttle to the Novell campus (double-check this,
though).

The Novell facility has stunning views of the mountains -- it's a real treat.
