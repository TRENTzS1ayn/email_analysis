I would add
3) how does an author DISCOVER the access policy of a resource
4) how are principals identified

BTW a forms based solution is not sufficient. As specified in the design
principals, all DAV mechanisms must be fully machine processable. HTML
forms do not meet this definition. Still, simpler is better. We don't
need to solve the world's problems, we just need to solve DAV's problems
in such a way that others can come along later and build upon our work
to solve the world's problems.
