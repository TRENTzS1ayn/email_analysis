I agree that our approach to access control should not imply a set of
roles which are too specific to a particular application or document
management strategy. Instead, I think we should adopt a general scheme
such as UNIX-style groups, VMS style privileges and rights, or our system
of keys. Any one of these schemes would suit our needs without locking us
into a specific set of roles.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
