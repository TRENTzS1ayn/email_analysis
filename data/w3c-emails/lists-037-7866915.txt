H:I agree that our approach to access control should not imply a set of
H:roles which are too specific to a particular application or document
H:management strategy. Instead, I think we should adopt a general scheme
H:such as UNIX-style groups, VMS style privileges and rights, or our system
H:of keys. Any one of these schemes would suit our needs without locking us
H:into a specific set of roles.

H:

a silly question perhaps (excuse me if this has been discussed previously):

is there some reason why something vaguely like the "certificate"
systems being used in electronic commerce couldn't work in this
context?  That is, the "document-set-owner" issues "tokens" to
authors who need to be allowed to access/modify documents in the
set.  When one of those authors wants to "check in" a modified
document or document-part, he or she must be able to accompany his
work with the proper "token".

Note: I'm not saying anything about the complexity of the token, nor the 
protocol for issuing or recognition nor any of the details.  
I'm just sketching a model.
