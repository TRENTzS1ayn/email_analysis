Not that I can think of. In fact, one example that comes to mind is the
standard file system for Amoeba (a distributed operating system). In many
ways, it reminds me of HTTP (immutable files and such), and uses
essentially this scheme for file access. Basically, the file server
(called the "bullet server" in Amoeba) issues what it calls capabilities
which are then required for file access. I quite like this idea.

I understand. The basic architecture and the security model are more or
less orthogonal.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
