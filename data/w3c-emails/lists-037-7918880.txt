It should be possible (where supported) to obtain the old version of a document while the new version is being modified and edited.

I'd like to throw out for discussion a "minimalist" view of access control.
My hypothesis is the only access control necessary in the client-server
WebDAV protocol is a method which temporarily changes the access rights of
a resource such that only (write) lock holders may read the resource, and
another message which reverts the access rights back to their original form
once editing is complete (or perhaps this happens automatically once all
locks are released).  This limited access control provides document privacy
during editing, so authors are assured that others will not be reading
their preliminary work.
