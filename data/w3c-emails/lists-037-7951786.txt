>Remote Passphrase Authentication provides a way to authenticate a user to a
>service by using a pass phrase over an insecure network, without revealing
>the pass phrase to eavesdroppers. In addition, the service need not know
>and does not learn the user's pass phrase, making this scheme useful in
>distributed environments where it would be difficult or inappropriate to
>trust a service with a pass phrase database or to allow the server to learn
>enough to masquerade as the user in a future authentication attempt.

>This scheme was inspired by Dave Raggett's Mediated Digest Authentication,

>This specification is divided into five parts. Part Zero contains an

>explains the mechanism. Part Two explains how to incorporate the mechanism

>Part Four explains the GSS-API token formats. Feel free to start with Part
>One; Part Zero provides background information and is not a prerequisite
