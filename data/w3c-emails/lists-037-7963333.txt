Different editable resources might might have different policies
associated with them, and the difference might not be 'server'
based. Designs that go from 'attribute of server' to 'attribute
of resources served by the server' aren't scalable.

As for how to identify a resource, it's useful to use a uniform
resource identifier, aka "URI", rather than "a token string
established by the Web server's administrator", since of course
the server itself might generate such a thing without the
administrator's actions.

WEBDAV need not be involved in the naming of policy resources, unless
you mean the location of them, and might not need to specify
the interaction with them, other than that they're network resources
to be interacted with using the web.

An individual policy ("students cannot check in changes to their
grades but can check in changes to their home address") has a structure
("class X of users can/cannot make change Y to part P of resource V").
A policy structure might have a "name" before it is assigned to a 
resource, but in general, a particular instance, like any other kind
of metadata, may not exist outside of the resource to which it applies.
I think the standard way of associating access policies should be the
same as the standard way of associating other kinds of metadata.

In general, the structure of access policies are fine grained
enough in some situations that they may not be determinable 
a priori While it's useful to have the precondition ("how would
you react if I tried to change my grade?") or even the elimiation
of all actions in a given class ("can user X change the metadata
of resource V"), I don't think the protocol should require that
the access policy fit the general case in order to have an efficient
and simple implementation.
