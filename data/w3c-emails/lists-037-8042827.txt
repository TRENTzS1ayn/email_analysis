Consider this issue from the client's point of view.  The client asks 
the server to save a document as a new version.  The server generates 
a new version id.  The client now wants to reference the new version. 
 How does the client find out what the new version id is?

(5.9.2.8)

This does look strange.  I think the best course is to delete 5.9.2.8 
since 5.9.2.9 adequately describes the behavior we desire (a client 
can specify an identifier, which the server does not have to use, in 
which case the server generates its own version identifier.)
