While it is not mandatory for a server to support an audit log, it is 
very common.  Most document access clients provide a "Show History" 
feature.   Therefore I need a standard way to ask for audit log 
entries pertaining to a particular document, user or date-time range. 
 I didn't see audit log access anywhere in the WebDAV requirements.  I 
would consider this a requirement for a useful WebDAV server.
