Perhaps there's a way of rewriting the requirement so that it
focuses on the intent rather than the mechanism:

"A simple client should be able to create new versions and reference
 the new version in a way that is transparent to the way in which 
 version IDs are generated, coded, or parsed. For example, if a client
 saves a document as a new version and the server generates a new
version
 ID, the client should be given or be able to easily discover the
 version ID of the  newly generated version."
