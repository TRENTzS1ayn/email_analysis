For versioned resources, there is a requirement (5.9.2.7) which states that
the version topology for a version graph must be retrievable.  This gives
you predecessor and successor relationships for each member of a version
graph.

What type of information is typically included in an audit log?  What are
the use scenarios for this information?  Why do you feel there needs to be
an interoperability specification for this information?
