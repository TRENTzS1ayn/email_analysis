The "methods" I'm talking about here aren't HTTP methods.  It
is probably closer to the AOLserver model in that there are
"security permission methods" such as read, mody, etc.

I'm not proposing that we work on a CORBA spec;  simply that an
object-based approach with security methods would support this
type of encapsulation model.

I agree that we are probably drifing into too many areas of
proposed design, but I think it may be helpful to expose weaknesses
in going down particular paths with respect to the requirements.
We don't want a requirements document which is unworkable either
within our charter or from a techno-political standpoint.
