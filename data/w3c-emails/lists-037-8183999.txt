System administrators can often submit queries against an audit log, like
"What resources has user X accessed in the past month?" "Who has modified
the metadata of resource R in the past month?" "How many users have accessed
resource R in the past month?" This kind of information can be useful for
billing, depending on what service is being provided.  It seems to be more
in the area of site administration than authoring, though.  I'm not sure
whether it's really in the scope of WEBDAV.
