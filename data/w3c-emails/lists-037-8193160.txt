I believe people writing clients would be well served with a variation 
of Larry's suggested requirement:


?"A client with appropriate access rights shall be able to save a 
document on the server using a standard request. The server may use an 
existing URL or generate a new one to uniquely describe the saved 
document.  In either case, the server must provide an easy, standard 
way for the client to discover the URL of the document that was 
saved."

We can't even be sure there will be version IDs. There is absolutely 
no
requirement for one in DAV because all versions are required to be
uniquely identified by URLs. This is the sort of issue that needs to 
be
argued out in implementation. The requirement is that Versions must 
be
identifiable by a URL, it is up to the spec to decide if having two
identifiers is useful.
