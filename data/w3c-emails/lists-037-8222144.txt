E-mail actually has some advantages over HTTP in some circumstances:
  1) Email penetrates firewalls, virtually everywhere, allowing kinds and
types of collaboration that would be difficult without it.

  2) Email is a "batch mode" type of interaction much better suited to laptops
and situations without permanent IP connectivity.  It is also better
suited to certain types of automated updates done by tools, which
then don't rely on the server being up to do (certain parts of) their
work.

The interesting question is not whether there are advantages, but how big they
are, and how difficult it is to support both types of interactions.  It is also
possible that the e-mail interface could be defined in terms of an email=>HTTP
gateway scenario, such that mail messages could then become HTTP operations.

Such a transformation could be defined in terms of a MIME type, and be an
e-mail attachment:

From:"Alan Robertson" <alanr@bell-labs.com>
Mime-Version:1.0
To:"WEBDAV server" <webdav-server@mail.w3.org>
Content-Type: application/webdav-request
Content-Length:2794

WebDav-Version:1.0
HTTP-Operation:PUT
Return-Mail:alanr@bell-labs.com
Return-Subject:Desired Subject
Operation-ID:12345 {or suitable
suitable string}
HTTP-URL:http://webdav.w3.org/gawdawfulurl...
HTTP-Operand:(some method of indicating which attachment to use
as an operand).

With such a request, you also need a response type:
To:"Alan Robertson" <alanr@bell-labs.com>
Mime-Version:1.0
From:"WEBDAV server" <webdav-server@mail.w3.org>
Subject:Desired Subject
Content-Type:application/webdav-response
Content-Length:356

WebDav-Version:1.0
HTTP-Operation:PUT
Operation-ID:12345
HTTP-URL:http://webdav.w3.org/gawdawfulurl...
HTTP-Operand:(some method of indicating which attachment to use
as an operand).
HTTP-Result:200

Such a gateway could be defined easily strictly in terms of such HTTP semantics
as we are defining elsewhere.  Again, the issue for the spec is:
Is it worthwhile?
Will anyone implement it?
Would anyone use it?
What is it "just the right approach" for?

If it's worthwhile, then the questions about how it might be used come up.
Things like: What kind of management entity is going to be looking at these
results?  What do they need to do their job?, etc.
