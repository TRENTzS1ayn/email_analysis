The advantage of allowing an email form of access is for people trying to
work in disconnected situations. If I can check out a bunch of documents
to my laptop and work on them at 30k feet, this is nice. It would be
even nicer if I could queue up the edited documents for check-in by
way of my mailer when I next connect. So, there are times when an email
version of DAV would have advantages.

Having said that, I think those situations are in the minority. Further,
nobody has yet said that they are going to implement DAV in email. So,
I think the WG's approach of trying not to preclude DAV in email, but
not working on that particular problem right now, is just about right.
