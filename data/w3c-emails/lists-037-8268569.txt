I read your note about E-mail and HTTP, and for a moment
I couldn't tell if I was in WEBDAV, IPP (Internet Print Protocol)
or IETF-FAX.

I think the issues are the same. For many 'remote operations'
it makes sense to have an 'operation' media type which is
POSTed to the resource that performs that operation, whether
the operation is located by "http" or "mailto".

However, this issue was debated at great length in early
WEBDAV history, and there was no interest in taking it on.
(IPP is using HTTP POST too, but IETF-FAX is pushing
on mailto because a fax is a message but printing is an operation).

Distributed authoring is more operation oriented, too.

If you want to encapsulate HTTP POSTs in an email message,
send a message with message/http content-type.

(Does that work? I suppose we need to know).
