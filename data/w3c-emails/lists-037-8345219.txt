I'm trying to get a block of rooms at the Provo Park Hotel with a corporate
rate. In order to pull this off I need an indication of who will be attening
the meeting. Please reply to this if you plan to attend so that I can get a
count. This is not the only hotel that is available, but it is the nicest.

Look forward to hearing from you.
