Not exactly. we trust the developer of /bin/mail (or procmail, or whatever
MDA I use) to properly lock my mailbox and respect existing locks so that
my mailbox does not become corrupted by multiple incoming messages. It is
true that the locks are advisory, but we only trust the underlying
software to respect those locks. This is something quite outside the
control of "mailbox authors" (i.e., the pople sending the mail.)
