What is expressed in the latest locking draft is that *all* locking
capability should be optional.   Since some replicated storage systems
cannot enforce the semantics of a lock, and since people are interested in
building WebDAV servers on top of these replicated stores, we can't have
mandatory lock capability without excluding this very important type of
back-end.  As I recall, Mark Day was a major proponent of not having lock
functionality mandatory, so perhaps he could expand on this.
