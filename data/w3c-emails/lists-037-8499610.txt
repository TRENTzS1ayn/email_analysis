There is a new version of the WebDAV Scenarios document available as
Internet-Draft <draft-ietf-webdav-scenarios-00.txt>.

Many thanks are due Ora Lassila, the Scenarios Document editor, for his
work adding Judith Slein's access control scenarios, and resubmitting this
document as an Internet-Draft.

The document can be accessed at the following URLs:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/scenarios/draft-ietf-webdav-scenarios-
00.txt
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-scenarios-00.txt

I have also put together a version history for this document, which is
available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/scenarios/

This Internet Draft replaces the existing <draft-lassila-http-edit-dist-00.txt>.

At present, our Charter lists the scenarios document being  submitted as an
Informational RFC in August, 1997.
