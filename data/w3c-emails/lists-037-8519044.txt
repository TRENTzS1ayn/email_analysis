Reminder: WebDAV Working Group Meeting

There will be a meeting of the WebDAV Working Group, on July 14-15, 1997,
at the Novell facility in Orem, Utah.  Many thanks to Steve Carter and
Novell for hosting this meeting!  The purpose of the meeting is to provide
a forum for focused, detailed discussion on the current WebDAV protocol
specification and requirements document (a preliminary agenda will be
posted soon).  This is an open meeting -- anyone is welcome to attend.

What: WebDAV Working Group meeting
Where: Novell, Orem, Utah
When: July 14-15, 1997 (9AM-5PM both days)

This meeting is being held in addition to the upcoming Munich IETF meeting,
August 11-15, 1997, at which there will also be detailed review of the
WebDAV protocol specification, but over a much shorter time span.

Registration:

If you are planning on attending this meeting, please send an email to
Steve Carter <srcarter@novell.com> with a subject of "WebDAV Registration"
giving your name, and corporate affiliation (if applicable) by July 9.
This allows Steve to plan food amounts, and to notify Novell security that
you're coming.

Steve is currently working on arranging a block of rooms at the Provo Park
Hotel, so if you are planning on attending this meeting, please let Steve
know soon so he can provide the hotel with a good estimate of the number of
rooms needed.

Orem, Utah:

Orem is 45 minutes south of the Salt Lake City International airport, and
is right next to Provo.  My list of local hotels from when I visted last
December is:

  1) Marriott Courtyard, 1600 N Freedom Blvd, Provo
      tel (801) 373-2222, Reservations: 800 228-9290
  2) Provo Park Hotel, 101 W 100 N Provo
      tel (801) 377-4700, Reservations: 800 777-7144

I have stayed in the Provo Park Hotel, and it was very nice.
