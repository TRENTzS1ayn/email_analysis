I would like to see some slightly better international support

1)  The server should support the notion of document language versions (similar in concept to renditions) and should always produce the language version corresponding to the language of the user's client, the explicit language version requested by the client (i.e. it should be possible to explicitly address a particular language version) or the default language.
2)  The client should be able to specify its preferred languages in order of preference and the server should present from the existing language versions the one highest on the client's list. Failing this the default language should be presented.
3)  It should be possible to specify to the server which language version is the default (master version)
4)  When asking for a list of objects in a collection it should be possible to obtain a list of all the different language versions of each resource (the default should simply return the list of default language resources)
5)  It should be possible to lock only a particular language version of a resource or all languages
6)  There must be a way of indicating which nodes in the version graph for each language can be considered equivalent (there might be a different number of versions for each language version)

Cheers
Dylan

>We definitely need some words on this topic, however my lack of experience
in this area hinders my ability to construct a good requirement.  Something
along the lines of, "All fields which might be displayed to a human user of
client software should be fully international."  I'd appreciate some
assistance for good wording of "fully international" -- something along the
lines of "supports iso character set standard XXX" might work.
                                       
How about "nothing in this specification shall be interpreted to
inhibit internationalization".  As for the character set, the IAB
view is ISO 10646.
