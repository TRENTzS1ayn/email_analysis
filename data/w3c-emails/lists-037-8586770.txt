WebDAV participants --

When making your plans to attend the WebDAV Working Group meeting in
Orem this July, please note that you are welcome to stay over and attend
the DMA Technical Committee meeting the following two days.  The
Document Management Alliance (DMA) is an AIIM Task Force with the
charter to develop a uniform programming model enabling enterprise-wide
interoperability among document-oriented applications and document
management systems from different vendors.

The DMA 0.9 specification is now in trial use through October of this
year.  DMA member companies are working on prototype implementations
during this period.  The first prototype was completed and demonstrated
at the AIIM Show this past April.  The second prototype is underway now,
with a third prototype following later this summer.  The DMA 1.0
specification will be produced and voted on late this year, based on 0.9
plus refinements from the trial use experience.

For more on DMA, including the 0.9 specification, see the Standards area
on www.aiim.org.  See below for more on the July DMA TC meeting
opportunity.

Subject: DMA TC meeting in Orem, Utah, 7/16/97-7/17/97
Date: Tuesday, June 10, 1997 5:22PM

This is a reminder that the next DMA Technical Committee meeting will be
held July 16th and 17th at Novell facilities in Orem, Utah, 9 am to 5 pm
both days.

WebDAV Meeting Beforehand:

Thanks to a generous offer from Steve Carter and Novell to host DMA the
same week that they're hosting the WebDAV Working Group, this will be a
unique opportunity for the two standards groups to mix and explore the
synergy between the two efforts.  The WebDAV Working Group will be
meeting the preceding two days, July 14th and 15th, in the same Novell
facilities.  (See Jim Whitehead's message on that meeting below,
including travel arrangements information.  Jim is the WebDAV chair.)

Attendance and Voting:

The DMA TC meeting will be open to everyone, especially those attending
the preceding WebDAV meeting.  Note that the AIIM DMA Task Force
Agreement stipulates that only full DMA member companies can participate
in formal votes in the TC, however.

Goals of the Meeting:

The proposed goals of the TC meeting are to

1. Come to an understanding on the similarities, differences,
    and synergy between DMA and WebDAV
2. Review the results of the Trial Use Subcommittee
    -- review the progress of the second prototype
        (and see a demonstration, if possible)
    -- review the plans for the remainder of the trial use period
    -- discuss and act on proposed changes to the spec
3. Discuss and act on the Conformance SC's proposal
4. Discuss the status of the Java binding (subject to AC vote)
5. Discuss and act on the TC process proposal
6. Set the final schedule and process for publishing the 1.0 spec

Registration:

To register for the DMA TC meeting, please send email to Steve Carter
<srcarter@novell.com> and Chuck Fay (cfay@filenet.com) with a subject of
"DMA TC Registration" giving your name and corporate affiliation by July
9, earlier if possible.  If you plan to attend the WebDAV meeting as
well, send a second message as described below by Jim Whitehead.

Reminder: WebDAV Working Group Meeting

There will be a meeting of the WebDAV Working Group, on July 14-15,
1997,
at the Novell facility in Orem, Utah.  Many thanks to Steve Carter and
Novell for hosting this meeting!  The purpose of the meeting is to
provide
a forum for focused, detailed discussion on the current WebDAV protocol
specification and requirements document (a preliminary agenda will be
posted soon).  This is an open meeting -- anyone is welcome to attend.

What: WebDAV Working Group meeting
Where: Novell, Orem, Utah
When: July 14-15, 1997 (9AM-5PM both days)

This meeting is being held in addition to the upcoming Munich IETF
meeting,
August 11-15, 1997, at which there will also be detailed review of the
WebDAV protocol specification, but over a much shorter time span.

Registration:

If you are planning on attending this meeting, please send an email to
Steve Carter <srcarter@novell.com> with a subject of "WebDAV
Registration"
giving your name, and corporate affiliation (if applicable) by July 9.
This allows Steve to plan food amounts, and to notify Novell security
that
you're coming.

Steve is currently working on arranging a block of rooms at the Provo
Park
Hotel, so if you are planning on attending this meeting, please let
Steve
know soon so he can provide the hotel with a good estimate of the number
of
rooms needed.

Orem, Utah:

Orem is 45 minutes south of the Salt Lake City International airport,
and
is right next to Provo.  My list of local hotels from when I visited
last
December is:

  1) Marriott Courtyard, 1600 N Freedom Blvd, Provo
      tel (801) 373-2222, Reservations: 800 228-9290
  2) Provo Park Hotel, 101 W 100 N Provo
      tel (801) 377-4700, Reservations: 800 777-7144

I have stayed in the Provo Park Hotel, and it was very nice.
