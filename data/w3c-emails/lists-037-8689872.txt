Please remember to preregister with srcarter@novell.com so that I can have
your badges and security clearance preprocessed. I also need the count for
ordering food and stuff. Please, please preregister!

Attached is a list of hotels (Provo Park is the best and has a block of
rooms available at a corporate rate). Tell them that you are with the
WebDAV/DMA conference at Novell.

Also a map showing how to get from the airport to here and a map of the Orem
campus.

See you all there

***Dennis Hamilton*** I could not see the list server address on the AIIM
home page for DMA. Would you please forward this message out there. Also,
tell me how to subscribe so that I can communicate directly.
