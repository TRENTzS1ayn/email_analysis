Thank you for your comments on the namespace draft, and also on the
properties draft.  Just a couple notes of clarification.

I have been in contact with Tim Bray, a co-editor of the XML draft, who
states that there will be a new XML draft available on or close to July 1.

Agreed, which is why the Depth header can take the value 0 (the collection
itself), 1 (the immediate non-collection members of the collection),
infinity (go as deep as you can).  Do you see problems with this approach?
