Right.  INDEX is defined to return a listing of the members of a
collection.  In the example below:

  A
 / \
J   K
|
Z

Depth of 0 would be just A (and hence a very boring listing).  Depth of 1
is A, J, K.  Depth Infinity is A, J, K, Z.  So, INDEX was limited to Depth
1 and Infinity so it would actually return something (Depth 0 would only
report information about the collection itself, perhaps its human-readable
title).

The intent of "immediate member resources" is the Depth 1 non-collection
resources, but the proposal should be more explicit in its language.

Urrr, I think this is a problem with the wording of the proposal.  The
intent is certainly to return a listing of external members during an
INDEX, but I agree with you, the proposal does not clearly indicate this is
the desired behavior.

Yes.  I agree, "noncollection member of the collection" is a really awkward
term.
