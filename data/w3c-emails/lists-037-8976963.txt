With regard to i18n requirements

RFC 2068 does not specify the structure of the URI tree (i.e. does not specify that the german version of text.html is text.gr.html or gr/text.html or anything else) it is therefore not possible to write an authoring tool which hides this structure from the author unless we make additional specifications w.r.t #1, #3, #4, #5 and #6.

Cheers
Dylan
