Hmm.  I think I like this even better than the original requirement -- I
think this provides a good tradeoff between wanting to assign individual
access permissions to resources, but still have some way for a resource to
receive its initial, default permissions.
------------------------
I like this better also, I must admit there is a good point raised about
the potential complexity.  Having the inheritance provide defaults (or
some similar scheme) seems a good tradeoff to me as well...
