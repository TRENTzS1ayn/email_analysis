I think it is one of the core tasks of producing a requirements
document to identify various perceptions and requirements and
see how and how much they vary.

There is definitely some degree of variation as to how much
support, e.g. for parallel documents in various languages, is
needed. But this is something that depends on the application,
and just because one web site doesn't need it doesn't mean
it's not very meaningful, or even crucial, for another site.

Before we try, we don't know.Regards,Martin.
