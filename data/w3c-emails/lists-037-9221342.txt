I tried posting this a week ago, but due to a mailing list problem, many of

ANNOUNCE

The next meeting of the Working Group on Distributed Authoring and
Versioning on the World Wide Web will take place January 27-28, 1997, on
the campus of U.C. Irvine, in Irvine, California.  The meetings will take
place over two complete days.  The purpose of this meeting is to perform a
review of the current WEBDAV protocol specification.

WHEN: January 27-28, 1997  (9AM-5PM, both days)
WHERE:  University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA (exact location on
campus will be posted)
COST: None
WHY: Review of WEBDAV protocol specification

The WEBDAV protocol specification is currently undergoing significant
revision based on the results of the authors meeting held December 18-20,
1996.  A summary of this meeting, and the updated WEBDAV protocol
specification will be posted shortly.  The purpose of the review being
performed at this meeting is to ensure that the design developed at the
author's meeting is technically sound, meets the requirements (or the group
agrees to relax its requirements), is consistent with the design of the
HTTP protocol, and does not adversely affect the installed base of Web
technology.  The meeting also provides a forum for the potential discussion
of high-quality alternative proposals.  Please let me know if you would
like to present an alternative proposal at this meeting.
