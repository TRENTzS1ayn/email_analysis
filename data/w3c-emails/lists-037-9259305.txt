I'm somewhat surprised by this idea. Firstly, is it really the group's desire
to be sponsored by W3C? I've seen no opinions expressed either way. Secondly,
is the Web not part of the Internet? Are you suggesting that W3C members do
not take IETF standards to be definitive?

I'd also suggest that since W3C operates in a way which is contrary to the
IETF's practices, that it is not necessarily in the IETF's best interests to
endorse W3C in this way.

Cheers,

Ben.
