The opinion of the group, as expressed at the Palo Alto meeting, was that
we should pursue joint sponsorship by the IETF and the W3C.  This was
written in the minutes from the Palo Alto meeting (Day 2, 2nd paragraph).

I view sponsorship of the DAV activity as endorsement of the goal of
developing a standard way to perform remote authoring and versioning of Web
content, rather than any statement about the IETF endorsing the W3C, or
vice-versa.
