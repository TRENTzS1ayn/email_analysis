Hmmm. I can't find these minutes, but my records are far from perfect. Was this
meeting a W3C meeting, by any chance?

I notice that the recent meeting seems only to have been asked about IETF
sponsorship.

I don't know. I suppose its because W3C doesn't tell me what its up to, which
makes me sceptical about its dedication to open standards, combined with my
surprise that joint sponsorship was contemplated.

That may be the way you view it, and very possibly the way I view it, too. But
is it the way the world views it? Furthermore, I am not convinced that W3C adds
any value to the IETF process.
