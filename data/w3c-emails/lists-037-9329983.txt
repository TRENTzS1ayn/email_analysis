This has been an area of open debate. We all realize that we are getting
dangerously close to creating a transaction oriented system. Our current
solution is to take all three commands and wrap them in a
message/multi-part w/the atomic switch activated.

However it should be pointed out that currently there is no way for the
user to perform the third action. We do not support redirect in DAV.
This decision was made at the last technical meeting. So the best the
user could do w/DAV is send an atomic message/multi-part locking the two
files. Then send two messages making appropriate changes. The
redirection would have to be performed through another mechanism.
