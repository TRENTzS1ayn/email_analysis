If you are planning on attending the upcoming WEBDAV meeting being held
January 27-28, 1997, in Irvine, California, on the campus of U.C. Irvine,
here is some information on hotels local to U.C. Irvine, and close to the
Orange County/Santa Ana/John Wayne (1 airport, 3 names) airport.

Holiday Inn Select           (714) 863-1999  +- $70.00
Orange County Airport Hilton (714) 833-9999  +- $85.00
The Irvine Marriott          (714) 553-0100  +- $100.00
The Sutton Place Hotel       (714) 476-2001  +- $105.00

These hotels do have a shuttle service within a 5 mile radius of
the hotel. The airport and the UCI campus fall within that 5 mile radius.

The rates I have quoted are the most recent information I have, this might
be a little outdated.  If you should need any further information please
contact the hotels directly, or Chris Leiker <chris@ics.uci.edu>.
