Since there has been some discussion about using the multipart/related
media type within the DAV spec., you may find the following documents to be
of interest.

- Jim


The IESG has approved the following Internet-Drafts as Proposed Standards:

 1. MIME E-mail Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML
    (MHTML)
        <draft-ietf-mhtml-spec-05.txt>

 2. Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators
        <draft-ietf-mhtml-cid-03.txt>

 3. The MIME Multipart/Related Content-type
        <draft-ietf-mhtml-related-00.txt>



These documents are the product of the MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate
HTML Documents Working Group. The IESG contact persons are Keith Moore
and Harald Alvestrand.


Technical Summary

 These documents together form a well-defined mechanism for sending
 sets of objects that contain pointers to each other, for instance a
 Web page with its associated images and sub-pages, in an E-mail
 message.

Working Group Summary

 There was complete WG consensus on the solution documented here.

Protocol Quality

 There is already one implementation that sends and receives such
 E-mail messages. Others are planned. The spec has been reviewed for
 the IESG by Harald Tveit Alvestrand
