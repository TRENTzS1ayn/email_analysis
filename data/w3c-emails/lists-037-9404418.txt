There will be a second Design Team meeting held January 13-17, 1997, at
Redmond, WA, hosted by Microsoft.  It will be attended by: Stephen Carter,
Novell, Asad Faizi, Netscape, Yaron Goland, Microsoft, Del Jensen, Novell,
Andre van der Hoek, U. Colorado, Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine.

Topics for discussion:
  - Versioning
  - Collections
  - Status codes
  - Review of text generated from first Design Team meeting

Note that the WEBDAV protocol draft being worked on during the Design Team
meeting only reflects the opinions of the participants at the meeting.  The
entire WEBDAV group, including meeting participants and members of the
mailing list must form rough consensus on any protocol draft before it
represents the view of the working group.

I am still working hard to issue meeting notes from the first Design Team
meeting.

I expect that after this second Design Team meeting we will be able to
develop a high quality draft protocol specification which can be thoroughly
reviewed by all WEBDAV participants at the January WEBDAV meeting.
