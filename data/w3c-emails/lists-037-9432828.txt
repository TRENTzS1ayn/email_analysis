While it is okay to choose not to use some attributes of the HTTP/1.1
description of Link, it is not okay to build a protocol that is incapable
of using such links.  For example, the light link proposal does not
include a Title attribute, whereas we already know that a title is
necessary for links to be presented in a human-readable menu.  I think
you will find that each of the attributes of Link are necessary for at
least one system, and that some future systems will need attributes that
we haven't thought of yet, so limiting the protocol to any notion of
a minimal link is a mistake.  Furthermore, it is totally unnecessary.

The protocol can exchange lists of Link header fields just as easily
as lists of triplets, and without the fear of becoming obsolete as soon
as a new requirement is realized.
