ANNOUNCE

The next meeting of the Working Group on Distributed Authoring and
Versioning on the World Wide Web (WEBDAV) will take place January 27-28,
1997, on the campus of U.C. Irvine, in Irvine, California.  The meeting
will take place over two complete days.  The purpose of this meeting is to
perform a review of the current WEBDAV protocol specification and to review
progress towards becoming an IETF working group.

WHEN: January 27-28, 1997  (9AM-5PM, both days)
WHERE:  University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA
       January 27: UCI Student Center, Room: Emerald Bay A
       January 28: UCI Student Center, Room: Monarch Bay A
COST: None
WHY: Review of WEBDAV protocol specification

The WEBDAV protocol specification is currently undergoing significant
revision based on the results of two Design Team meetings. The updated
WEBDAV protocol specification will be posted shortly, hopefully on January
22.  The purpose of the review being performed at this meeting is to ensure
that the design developed at the Design Team meetings is technically sound,
meets the requirements (or the group agrees to relax its requirements), is
consistent with the design of the HTTP protocol, and does not adversely
affect the installed base of Web technology.  The meeting also provides a
forum for the potential discussion of high-quality alternative proposals.
Please let me know if you would like to present an alternative proposal at
this meeting.
