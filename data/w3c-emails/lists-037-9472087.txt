Parking
=======

You must have a permit to park at UCI. The attendant at the parking
structure entrance will have a list of names of people attending this
meeting. Give the attendant your name, and they will give you a Full Day
parking permit (marked Irvine Research Unit in Software). You DO NOT
need to purchase a permit. These permits enable you to park in spots
with Red AR signs as well as unmarked spots. Even when the parking
structure gets filled, there are still usually Red AR spots available.

(Red AR spots are reserved - students cannot park in them, so they
usually don't fill up as quickly.)

You MUST mark the day of the week and the date on these permits. Check
the box for the day of the week, and write in the date in the space
provided. The permit should be left on the dash of your car.

Plan to arrive _at least_ 20-30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space (on Monday, classes start on the hour, so the structure will fill
up by 8:30 for 9:00 a.m. classes). If the structure is full (including
red AR spots), the attendant will direct you to near by parking lots. If
you have to park in an alternate lot, you can still use these permits to
park in the red AR spots in the alternate lot.
