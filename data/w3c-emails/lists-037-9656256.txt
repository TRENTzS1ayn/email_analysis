I have made some modifications to the agenda, mostly to organize
presentations together, and to make room for a presentation on a mechanism
for discovering the allowable entries (and their allowable values) within a
method-specific content type for a particular server.  This has been termed
"schema discovery."

This agenda is also on the Web, at:
