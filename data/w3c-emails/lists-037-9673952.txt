I don't think this ever got circulated, but there's a version of the
proposed DMA 1.0 spec available online:

http://www.aiim.org/dma/vote1.0/


I think DMA is trying to solve a different problem than WEBDAV and
thus I am _not_ proposing that DMA = WEBDAV. On the other hand, I
think it would be useful to try to see what it would take to build a
WEBDAV -> DMA/API gateway, and similarly a DMA/SPI -> WEBDAV gateway,
as a way of doing a cross-check of functionality.
