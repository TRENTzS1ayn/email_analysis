What can you tell me about existing products that support LINK/UNLINK? I'd
like to have a URI such that a GET on that URI would return a
multipart/related mesage containing those documents LINKed to a given base
document. I also want to be able to dynamically change this list by issuing
LINK and UNLINK commands to the same URI.

Basically, when I got interested in WEBDAV I saw this as a key ingredient
in a patient record system. Now, much to my (pleasant) surprise, one of my
coworkers just returned from an HL7 conference and independently expressed
an interest in the same functionality. They even planned to discuss web
maps at the conference but ran out of time (or so I am told)!

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
to come up with a better one.
