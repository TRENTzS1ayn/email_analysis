The DAV.Versioning.DefaultPublished link should only be an attribute
of the document tree not of each of the individual versions.

Symantically this makes sense because the published version is more of
an attribute of the Versioned collection of documents than of the
particular documents themselves (except for maybe the one document
that is pointed to by it). Also many systems (ours in particular) will
use the setting of this link to trigger some server side processes that
are involved in the actual publishing of the document. Copying it from a
private development server to a public one is a typical example of this.

Setting and maintaining this link for all of the versions seems
like a lot of unnecessary overhead as well.

Setting it only on the one version that is published instead of on the
version tree would mean that anyone wanting to find out which version 
is published would need to do a walk of the tree to find it.
