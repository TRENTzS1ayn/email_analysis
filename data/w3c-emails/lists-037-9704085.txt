We've been using "dublin core" as an example of a kind of metadata.

http://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-hamilton-dcxl-00.txt

"Representing the Dublin Core within X.500, LDAP and CLDAP"

not only is a useful document that shows how Dublin Core might be used
for "document-like objects" which are closely aligned with things that
might be authored distributedly, it's also a good source of references
for other external representations. 

I think it would make a good addition to the WEBDAV home page.
