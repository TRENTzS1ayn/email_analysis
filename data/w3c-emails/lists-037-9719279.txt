Good pointer, Larry.  There is also a proposal in the works to
extend PICS values (dropping the values are rational number
restriction) specifically to be able to use PICS as a transfer
syntax for Dublin Core -- and other -- metadata.  See

(This is just a set of slides with no accompanying narrative,
unfortunately, but the significant points should be evident.)
