Unfortunately, I recently received an email from David Durand stating that
due to his work on the XML specification and his desire to finish up his
Ph.D., he would no longer be able to carry on his duties as editor of the
WEBDAV requirements document. :-(

Due to her insightful posts on the relationship of WEBDAV to DMA efforts,
and her commentary on the existing WEBDAV requirements documents, I
immediately thought to ask Judith Slein <slein@wrc.xerox.com> to take on
this responsibility.  After discussing the editor role with her and Keith
Moore at the Irvine meeting, I am very pleased to announce Judith Slein as
the new editor of the WEBDAV requirements document.

Judith will begin the task of merging the existing Distributed Authoring
requirements document (which I wrote), and the Versioning requirements
document (which David Durand and Fabio Vitali wrote).  She will also be
taking a look at where there are differences between the spec. and the
requirements, and will bring these differences up on the list.

The current drafts of the two requirements documents are available off of
the WEBDAV home page:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/

Please forward your comments on these requirements to Judith (and cc the
list too).  The role of editor is to collect the consensus of the group,
which is impossible if the group does not express itself.  Thanks!

- Jim
