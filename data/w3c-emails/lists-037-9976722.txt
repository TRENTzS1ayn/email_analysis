MEETINGS:

* Design Team Meetings.  The design team met on December 18-20, 1996 in
Orem, UT, at Novell, and on January 13-17, 1997 in Redmond, WA, at
Microsoft.  In attendance were Steve Carter (Novell), Asad Faizi
(Netscape), Yaron Goland (Microsoft), Andre van der Hoek (U. Colorado, 1/13
and 1/14 only), Del Jensen (Novell), Jim Whitehead (U.C. Irvine).  The
design team developed a design proposal at this meeting, which was written
down in webdav-draft-06.html, and discussed at the Irvine WEBDAV meeting.
