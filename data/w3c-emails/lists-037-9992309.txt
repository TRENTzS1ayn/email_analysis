A PEP Internet-Draft is now available.  This is of relevance to the WebDAV
group because it is hoped that PEP can be used by clients to determine if a
server supports DAV functionality, and also perhaps as a mechanism for
discovering method interfaces.

It would be very helpful if someone could post a summary of this draft, and
their views on its applicability to the WebDAV draft protocol
specification.
