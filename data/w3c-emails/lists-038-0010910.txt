With respect to the recent discussion concerning adding configuration 
support, I would like to see if there are others lurking who also share 
Sankar's views.  Therefore, I ask:

Are there any members of the working group who strongly support adding a 
requirement for providing configuration support to WebDAV?

If you do, could you please give a brief description of your rationale?

Thanks.

- Jim
