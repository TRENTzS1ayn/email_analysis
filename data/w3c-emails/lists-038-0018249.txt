A new draft of Section 3 ("A Proposal for Collections of Web Resources and 
Name Space Operations") of the protocol specification has been completed, 
but not yet incorporated into the main protocol document (Del received the 
new draft today, and is starting the job of incorporating it into the 
protocol draft).

If you are interested in getting a "sneak preview" of the new section, I 
have placed a PDF version of the spec. on the WebDAV web site at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/collections.pdf

While I realize this is a proprietary document format, there are free PDF 
readers available at: http://www.adobe.com/
