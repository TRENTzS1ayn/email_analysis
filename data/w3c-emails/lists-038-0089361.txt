Why are collections not sufficient to provide configuration support? 
I can think of many different ways I would like to maintain a 
configuration, but I would not want WebDAV to build-in every single one. 
Collections are a grouping mechanism, configurations is a grouping 
mechanism. 

I say that unless there are very specific reasons to include onfigurations,
i.e., collections are not sufficient, we should not address them.
