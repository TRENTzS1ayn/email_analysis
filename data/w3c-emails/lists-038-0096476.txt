At present, since each version of a resource is a separate resource, 
retrieving a member of a collection retrieves just the resource itself, 
which may be a member of a version tree.
[Dylan Barrell]  Surely this should read - when retrieving the member of a collection it retrieves the default version of the resource - otherwise what is the use of the default version in the version tree?

Cheers
