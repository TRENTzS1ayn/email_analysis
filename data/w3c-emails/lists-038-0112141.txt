I have a few questions and comments.

Section 1.1.1, last paragraph.
        I agree, but there are cases where it does not make sense
        (i.e. the cgi example in the protocol document.)  Would something
like "SHOULD
        for the part of the namespace that it makes sense" be reasonable?

Section 1.3.2
        This seems to be a copy/paste error.  The description belongs to
another property.

Section 1.4.8 Example
        What are the parameters on the IsCollection start tag in the Members
element?

Section 1.5.3
        My understanding is that a PUT of a non-collection resource adds it
to the namespace
        and also adds it as an internal member of the parent collection,
assuming that the parent
        is a collection.  Is this correct?  If so, could this be said
explicitly?

Section 1.6.3.3
        The paragraph references a conflict between between source and
destination
        properties, but the next section (1.6.3.4) says that if the
overwrite is set
        then it must DELETE the destination collection.  I thought that if
the overwrite
        was not set, that the copy would fail.  This suggests that there can
be no conflict
        between the properties.

        There also seems to be something wrong with the last couple of lines
of text.

Section 1.6.5.1
        The overwrite header is missing on the first example.  Or does it
default to true?


General Copy/Move question about non DAV space
        Should there be some comment to the effect that a MOVE or COPY on a
non DAV part
        of the server has undefined results?
