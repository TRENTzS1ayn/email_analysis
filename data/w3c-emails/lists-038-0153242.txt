Based on the discussion on the list, the document, "Requirements for a 
Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web," in 
its authoritative form at:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-03.txt

Represents the rough consensus of the WEBDAV working group.  I will request 
the IESG to consider publication of this document as an Informational RFC, 
on the recommendation of the WEBDAV working group.
