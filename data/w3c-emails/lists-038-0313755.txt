A new version of the protocol draft is available!  Thank you Del for 
incorporating these changes into the draft.

The current version of the draft is: draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-03.txt, and 
is available at:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-03.txt
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoco  
l-03.txt

Please submit any comments you may have on this draft to the list.

The changes in this draft are primarily limited to Section 3, which has 
been extensively re-written.  Major changes from the last draft include:

  - removal of recursive copy and move capability
  - modification to the format of the XML elements returned by INDEX to 
allow recursive INDEX descriptions
  - the hierarchy of internal member resources is enforced by methods
  - objects which are collections should be WebDAV collections
  - many changes to language and wording to make the draft more precise
  - incorporation of feedback from the mailing list, Orem, and Munich 
meetings.

- Jim
