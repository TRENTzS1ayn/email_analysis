Hi,

I'd like to introduce to you Howard Palmer <hep@netscape.com>, who has 
volunteered to be the editor for the access control requirements and 
protocol specification.  He will be picking up Jon Radoff's last 
requirements document and will move it forward.

I am very pleased that Howard has volunteered for this task, and I think he 
will do a great job!  So I don't steal his thunder, I'll let Howard 
introduce himself more...

- Jim
