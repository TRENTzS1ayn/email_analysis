A new draft of Section 5 ("Locking") of the protocol specification has been completed, 
but not yet incorporated into the main protocol document (Del is starting work on incorporating this draft into the main protocol document).

If you are interested in getting a "sneak preview" of the new section, I have placed a PDF version of the spec. on the WebDAV web site at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/locking.pdf

There are freely available PDF readers for most platforms available at: http://www.adobe.com/
