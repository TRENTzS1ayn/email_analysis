I'm not really sure what you men by a "qualified GI", but I suspect your 
question can be restated as: do you intend to produce a spec. which uses 
the more standard SGML/XML type syntax for specifying the numerous XML 
elements used in the spec.?  To date we haven't done this, not due to any 
technical reasons, but more due to lack of knowledge of how to specify 
elements using the SGML/XML format.  Given that this is the more standard 
way of specifying those elements, I think it best if in a future release of 
the protocol spec. we switch over to this format.

Given this, can you recommend a good source which explains the SGML/XML 
specification mechanism?
