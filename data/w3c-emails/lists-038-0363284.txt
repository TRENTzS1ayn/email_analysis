   I've not been able to keep up with this list recently, butI happened to read
the request for information on XML syntax and declarations. You can read any
introductory SGML book, or just stick to the drafdt XML standard -- it's still
a big longer than would be ideal (25 pages or so, I think), but that's not
very long, and the relevant information is less than the whole thing.

You can find public drafts at the W3C site (in the SGML section off the homepage
last I checked). You can also find in-progress drafts at
http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/

   If you already know about DTDs, XML is even easier to learn since you can
learn it by a process of subtraction.
