   As one of the people working on the definition of XML, I can say that
Yaron's comment about the deprecation of XML DTDs is science fiction. I can
also point out that you can manitain _one_ definition, in the form of a
DTD (which is almost exactly like BNF actually). You even get the ability
to validate your examples without writing any code, since Microsoft (among
others) has made a validatiing XML parser publicly available.

   The point of standards is to be used.
