XML documents may be either well formed (the tags are correctly nested)
or valid.  If valid, there must be a DTD that describes the ways in
which they may be nested (among other things).  I can't think of 
anyone in "the XML community" experienced in the processing of SGML/XML
documents who deprecates DTDs.

If WEBDAV is using XML, it's as much a part of "the XML community"
as "the HTTP community".  

Given that a DTD is necessary for validating an XML document,
and that your XML isn't that complicated, it would be far clearer
to present what is now given as prose in the form of a DTD, and it
would also allow early implementors to validate their attempts
to implement the WEBDAV spec.  As it stands now, there is no
machine-readable syntax in the spec, yet it could be provided.  That's 
a serious fault.

(By "qualified GIs" I meant element type names that use the colon
syntax to indicate derivation of an element from another DTD/schema/
name space, as "D:PropertyUpdate.)
