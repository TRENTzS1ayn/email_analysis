Let me put this another way.

1) 99% of the people who read our specs do not understand DTDs, they do
understand BNF.
2) The main XML rallying cry was "NO MORE DTDS!!" DTDs are a deprecated
syntax which is to be replaced by the XML Schema draft.
3) DTDs are NOT required to validate XML syntax. DTDs are not required
for ANYTHING having to do with XML.

So given that we MUST provide a BNF definition and that DTDs are old
news, I see no reason to waste valuable time trying to maintain two
separate definitions of the same material. If and when the XML Schema
group produces a usable finished product I will be the first to support
its adoption, until then, time is a scarce resource and there is no
reason to waste it trying to write DTDs which only a tiny fraction of
our community can use.

That having been said, if someone would like to volunteer their time to
write up the DTDs and have them inserted into an Appendix in the draft I
am sure the authors will be happy to let this person see the draft
before we submit it as an ID so this volunteer can write up the DTDs and
we can submit them as part of the draft.
