I can easily justify it, the number of people in the HTTP community who
can read DTDs is tiny. Our goal is to produce a specification for the
HTTP community, not the HTML community nor the XML community. We
leverage a tiny part of XML to let us create structured data. I am
beginning to wonder if the cost of doing so isn't too high.

PS My experience working on IE 3.0 and IE 4.0 leads me to believe that
the number of people in the HTML community who can read DTDs is also
tiny. That is why HTML parsers have to be so forgiving. In the real
world people learn HTML by looking at examples because no one can read
the specs.
