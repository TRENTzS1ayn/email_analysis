  On a less-histrionic note, I'd like to point out that the (probable) use
of XML in the RDF effort is likely to raise the profile of XML significantly.
Also, the use of a DTD, as Terry pointed out, provides a machine-checkable
syntax definition for which several tools are already available, thus reducing
the chance of bugs in the spec, since you could check your examples and
cases with a tool. Seems like a win to me.
