Is anybody volunteering to help out the overworked design team?

I for one would like to see the discussion turn in a positive direction.
And, the way I see that happen is by some XML experts volunteer their time
in taking the current draft and specifying it correctly using DTDs. Perhaps
the design team can take that output, use it as an example, and go from
there.
