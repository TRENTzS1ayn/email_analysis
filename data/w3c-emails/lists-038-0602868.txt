So there are no properties that are "supported but not set"?  All properties
that are supported have a value by default?  Does this mean then, that all
properties in all supported schema will be returned (name and value as
appropriate) when PROPFIND is made with either allprop or propname?

Thanks got it.

Other than the table of contents, this section has the first use of the term
token in the document.  This will make it difficult for new readers.  Also,
the Mandatory header is not described here, and I could not find it in
RFC2068, is it defined somewhere else?
