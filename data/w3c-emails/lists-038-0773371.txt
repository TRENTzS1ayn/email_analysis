Why aren't State Tokens XML? - This is actually something we had looked
at and even came up with a syntax for. The real answer to the question
is that it turned out to be huge and hard to handle, for humans. We
could specify them as a URI in about ten lines of text or as XML in
three pages. Still, it is definitely worth looking at again.

If-None-State-Match - Because If-None-State-Match, by its very
definition, is an AND operations. It is defined as meaning "If none of
these state tokens match the current state of the resource then
execute." So what would an AND/OR switch determine?

Citing ACL draft - That is difficult because it doesn't currently exist.
However it will be released this week so we can put in a citation at
that point.

5.2.4 Interaction with other methods - Yup, typo. =) Thanks for pointing
it out, I will fix it.

5.2.10.2 - The answer is that the reset can only be performed by the
lock owner. I will fix the language.

5.2.11.3 - Will fix if not already fixed.

5.6.1.3 - I suspect this is an error that occurred in turning off
automatic hyperlinking in Word. I will see that it is fixed.

DAV and the naming conventions for its XML tags - I absolutely agree. I
am actually preparing a new proposal to the authors about how to name
properties so that it looks more like XML and so that the naming is
consistent.

Thanks for the excellent comments,
Yaron
