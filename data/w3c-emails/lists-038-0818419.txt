How about putting this in the webdav spec, in a paragraph:
"Relationship of WebDAV to external metadata representations such
as W3C RDF"

> ... RDF will simply "plug and play" with the WebDAV property 
> system.  A WebDAV property is a (name, value) pair, where the name is a 
> URI, and the value is a well-formed XML document.  Since an RDF description 
> is a well-formed XML document, an RDF "serialization" block can be placed 
> within the value of a WebDAV property, and hence a WebDAV property may 
> contain an RDF description.  WebDAV does not affect the semantics of these 
> RDF serialization blocks -- this is defined by the RDF specification.  What 
> WebDAV does provide is a mechanism by which RDF description blocks can be 
> stored and associated with web resources.  In a sense, WebDAV provides the 
> "how": how are descriptions stored; while RDF provides the "what": what is 
> the syntax and semantics of the description.
