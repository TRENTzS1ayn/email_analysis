Bob,

Just to echo what Jim said, I (and several others) have been involved in
both the DAV and RDF areas. I am fairly confident that we will not have any
problems with different models between the two, since we have been designing
with this sort of thing in mind. This is just one of the reasons why I think
the DAV community will really appreciate the payoff of using XML (including
the XML syntax & namespaces).
