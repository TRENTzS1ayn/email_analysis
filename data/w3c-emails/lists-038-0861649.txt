There is a new version of the protocol document available!  This revision 
finishes the task of incorporating comments from the Orem and Munich WebDAV 
meetings, as well as feedback from the mailing list.  The major changes to 
this document are in Section 5, locking, which was significantly edited.

The new protocol draft will be available from the IETF Internet Drafts 
directory in the next 1-2 days, and is available now at:

l-04.txt

Many thanks to Del for creating this document version.
