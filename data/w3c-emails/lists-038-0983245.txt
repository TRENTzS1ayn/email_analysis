I'd just like to follow up on one point.

I'd claim that the examples should not use this feature.  You can't assume
that DAV readers will be XML experts.  DAV may be their first exposure to
XML, and they will be applying "common sense" when reading the spec.  This
XML feature is not totally obvious on first glance, therefore it adds
complexity to the reading of the examples, and it only saves two characters
per use, which is not worth the confusion in users.

Given that one can already abbreviate the URI prefixes to a single letter,
I would hope that anyone writing XML would write fully qualified names, and
not rely on XML namespace scoping to make thier tags unambiguous.

best regards

Jim
