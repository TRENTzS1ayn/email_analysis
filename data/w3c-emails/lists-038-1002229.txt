Just a confirmation of David Durand's point.  The namespace proposal
that we will be releasing for review this week does not support scoped 
values.  You will need to explicitly use the namespace qualifier on 
each element from that namespace.

The other option is to experiment with application specific conventions 
about scoping.  I would strongly suggest that you do not experiment 
with something like the WEBDAV spec because it is likely that the scoping 
rules will be reexamined by the XML WG in a latter version.
