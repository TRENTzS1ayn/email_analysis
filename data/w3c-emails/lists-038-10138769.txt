|I have a resource called http://a/b/c. I delete http://a/b. Is http://a/b/c
|deleted?

Is this a trick question?

   DELETE instructs that the collection specified in the request-URI
   and all its internal member resources are to be deleted.

So whether deleting http://a/b deletes http://a/b/c by dint of this
rule depends on whether http://a/b/c is or isn't an internal member
resource of http://a/b.

For the most part, WebDAV works fine without the assumption that
resource membership hierarchy is mapped onto URL syntax.

Of course, if we allow a resource to be an 'internal member' of multiple
collections, why, we might have to resort to reference counting! Or even
garbage collection!
