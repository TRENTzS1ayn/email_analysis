For the most part, WebDAV doesn't define things in terms of the
URL syntax.  The only thing it does is internal members, and that's
because people did want to require that http://a/b/c be deleted whenever
http://a/b/ is deleted.

I am all for a member of a collection that may appear in multiple
collections and does not act like an external reference.  However, that
thing is called a direct reference (or alias) and not 'internal member'.
And yes, you might need reference counting and garbage collection to
keep track of aliased resource disposal, but not for internal members.

Calling both things an 'internal member' makes it impossible to describe
the requirements of internal resources that do not exist independent
of the collection.
