The justification for the syntax requirement that internal members be scoped
by URL hierarchy is that the overwhelming majority of existing hierarchical
storage devices can not implement DAV otherwise. They can not deal with the
concept that deleting http://a/b does not also delete http://a/b/c. Most of
these systems can also not handle having http://a/b/c exist but not
http://a/b.

Furthermore COPY/MOVE become undefined if http://foo/bar is treated as an
"internal" member of http://a/b.

Additionally, the overwhelming majority of hierarchical clients could not
display a storage where http://foo/bar is an "internal" member of http://a/b
and that deleting http://a/b could somehow still keep http://a/b/c around.

Finally, we have already demonstrated that the DM community can implement
their namespace the way they want with the features they want inside the
existing WebDAV framework.

So it seems the WebDAV group has managed to come up with a rule that neatly
allows the vast majority of existing systems to implement DAV without
impeding the higher end systems from using DAV as well. Looks like everyone
won.
