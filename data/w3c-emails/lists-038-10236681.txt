Sankar:

I objected to the assertion that versioning was "not very
useful" without configuration management, since there are
many contexts where that is not true, including in
software development and web-site management.

For example, many contexts use version management only
for auditing or editing 'backup', and use manual, rather
than automated, configuration management. In situations where
the versioning system maintains timestamps for operations,
for example, and the number of simultaneous users is small,
simple configuration management can be done by users themselves
without any additional assistance, even in software development
and web-site management.

Since it seems that DA-SL-V-CM is attempting to build a layered
architecture (Distributed Authoring + Search Language +
Versioning + Configuration Management ), it might well
make sense to separate the Configuration Management layer
from the Versioning layer.
