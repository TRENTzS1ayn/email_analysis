From a "functionality" based argument, I support what you say. I was not
involved in the debate, so it is hard for me to say what the rationale of
others were. However, from a protocol perspective, I cannot wrap my mind
around how versioning is going to be supported independent of configuration
management when Web-DAV allows nested collections with members. Isn't
configuration management really about addressing the problem of members and
collections evolving independently of each other (i.e., be versioned)? Maybe
somebody can help answer this question.
