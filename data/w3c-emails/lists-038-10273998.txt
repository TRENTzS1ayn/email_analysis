I think that it makes sense to have configuration management as an optional
layer on basic versioning, however, the mail below would make one think of
CM and versioning as inherently different beasts.  I do not believe that is
true, and if you look at many of the versioning products available today,
the line between CM and basic versioning is hard to draw.

Fair enough.

From a "functionality" based argument, I support what you say. I was not
involved in the debate, so it is hard for me to say what the rationale of
others were. However, from a protocol perspective, I cannot wrap my mind
around how versioning is going to be supported independent of configuration
management when Web-DAV allows nested collections with members. Isn't
configuration management really about addressing the problem of members and
collections evolving independently of each other (i.e., be versioned)? Maybe
somebody can help answer this question.
