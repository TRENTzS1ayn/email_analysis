John,

My note was probably confusing. I actually wanted to know how versioning and
configuration management could be separated in the context of Web-DAV
collections and advanced collections. As you say (and as my note says),
there are existing products which make this distinction and hence it could
be argued that configuration management should be a layered functionality on
version control (see note below). However, I need clarification on (by
perhaps the version control design team) how this separation is to be
achieved if the plan is to allow versioning of collections and members of
collections when a member could be part of different collections and could
evolve independently of the collection.

Note: A similar discussion to this happened long time ago in the list. At
that time, Jim Whitehead also mentioned the fact that configuration
management is actually achieved in different ways in different
products(configuration relative naming, labels, etc.). This issue might also
have to be considered.

Personally, I would actually like to see both configuration management and
version control to be designed together because of Web-DAV collections and
advanced collections. Whether we make configuration management optional is
an orthogonal decision.
