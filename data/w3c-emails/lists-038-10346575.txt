We haven't determined that yet.  The design team is faced with two vastly
different approaches: (a) do versioning on individual resources, and implement
CM on top of versioning; (b) do CM on workspaces, and version individual
resources as singleton workspaces.

Yes, but that's a big if; we're still, ah, discussing whether core DAV should
have that capability.  IIRC, it had not (re?)surfaced at the time of the
versioning meeting, so we didn't get into it.  At this time, I would still
consider it iffy, and would rather not spend cycles designing around
it--although it might be worthwhile to figure out how it would impact the
versioning design if adopted.
