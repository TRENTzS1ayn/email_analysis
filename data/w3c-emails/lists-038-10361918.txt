In a private side thread, it has come out that this parenthetical remark (which I believe I must have added in an attempt to summarize several sentences) is completely inaccurate.  Firstly, Jim did not say any such thing in the meeting; I drew on what he'd said at dinner the night before in order to summarize.  Secondly, he didn't even say that at dinner; I misunderstood something else he said.  I apologize for misrepresenting Jim and Xerox, and misleading the group.

This is probably why (as was pointed out to me this morning) meeting minutes are supposed to be mere summaries of what was discussed, rather than point-by-point accounts.  :-)
