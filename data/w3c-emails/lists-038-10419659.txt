The concern is that protocol-07, as written, doesn't allow interoperable
implementation with a server that employs aliasing, and makes some requirements
on servers that wind up being (false) assumptions that clients will make.

I think that it's simple to fix the protocol by adding a "parent" property,
and removing the language that requires clients to munge 'the' URL for
a resource in order to find the parent. With this fix, the 1-1 relationship
between 'resource' and 'resource locator' wouldn't be mandated for all
implementations (although it would be allowed).
