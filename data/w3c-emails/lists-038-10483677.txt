FYI.  Dublin Core is significant for WebDAV, and especially DASL, since it
defines a common metadata set for bibliographic metadata.  WebDAV servers
which define Dublin Core metadata on their resources will be amenable to
searches on that metadata using DASL searching.

The Dublin Core Metadata Workshop Series began in 1995 with an
invitational workshop which brought together librarians, digital
library researchers, content experts, and text-markup experts to
promote better discovery standards for electronic resources.  The
Dublin Core is a 15-element set of descriptors that has emerged from
this effort in interdisciplinary and international consensus building.
This is the first of a set of Informational RFCs describing the Dublin
Core.  Its purpose is to introduce the Dublin Core and to describe the
consensus reached on the semantics of each of the 15 elements.

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.
