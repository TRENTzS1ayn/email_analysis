When will the minutes of the WebDAV Versioning and
Variants meeting in North Caroline be posted to
the WebDAV mailing list? Did I somehow miss them?
I assume Sam and Jim got my supplementary notes.

Also, I would like to confirm that the e-mail
discussions for versioning and variants are taking
place in the WebDAV mailing list, not a separate
mailing list for versioning and variants only.

Thanks.

Alan Babich
