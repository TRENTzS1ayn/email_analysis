# Don't base HTTP clients need it for relative links?

First of all, relative URI processing is independent of the
protocol. Relative links work for "ftp" and for "gopher" and
for "urn" and for "vnd.blablah".

Relative URI processing is entirely syntactic. It merely
performs a string manipulation of a "relative URI" against
a "base", without regard to any of the semantics. There
is not an operation for "going up the parent tree", there
is only an operation for performing relative URI processing
of the ".." form.

Relative URI processing is entirely under the control of
the data form or context that is providing the URI in the
first place; e.g., an author of a HTML document may or
may not choose to provide relative links within it. Since
DAV does not restrict itself to authoring HTML documents,
any particular form of document at all, there is no particular
reason why DAV resource processors need to deal with relative
forms at all.
