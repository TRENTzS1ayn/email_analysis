Sure, if they don't mind taking on extra pain when they try to
maintain their site.  It's a scalability thing: someone who
authors a large-scale corpus has pretty much got to use relative
links.

I disagree.  Since relative links are so important for the way
people write content for the Web, it is vital that DAV
accommodate them.  Making DAV collections correspond to the
syntax that relative links depend on will make it easier for
people to organize their content into DAV collections and write
relative links accordingly.
