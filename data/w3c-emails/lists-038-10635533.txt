Sam:

Please e-mail ASAP whatever you have to Jim Whitehead
and take him up on his offer to produce the minutes
of the last Versioning SC meeting in North Carolina.
I'm sure you're very busy, but it has been far to
long since the last meeting. We need to get the
minutes out to the WEBDAV mailing list, so that e-mail
discussion can be started. The lack of the minutes
is acting as a log jam. We need people's input now,
not at "Last Call".

If you already posted the minutes and I missed them, 
please accept my sincere apology. I'm very behind in my
e-mail.

Thanks.

Alan Babich
