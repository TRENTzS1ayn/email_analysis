Opaque Principals - I will add language making it clear that principals
are opaque to the protocol and potentially opaque to the client.

Append Right - Hum... I would like to restrict the rights listed in the
draft to those that are considered absolutely essential. The problem is,
how do we define what "essential" means? My intention is to make the
rights listed in the spec required. Without a minimal subset of required
rights, interoperability becomes a joke. So, is append an essential
required right or is it something that would make a good parallel spec?

Side Effects - Currently, setting the ACL property sets the ACL. As I
have previously discussed, this will be changed to an ACL method.

effect vs affect - Sigh, you and Jim have been talking haven't you? =) I
am unfortunately known for this screw up. I will fix it.

2.1.1, 2.1.2, 5, bibliography reference - Added to the to-do list, will
be fixed in the next version of the draft.

3 - The other choice is no inheritance at all. The ACL and the owner
property are completely independent of each other. So a resource can
have an owner but no ACL. In that case all rights are denied to
everyone. However, the definition of the owner property is that the
owner ALWAYS has the right to set the ACL, regardless of the current ACL
settings. I will clarify this issue in the spec.

7.3 - Locking and ACLs have totally independent discovery mechanisms.
They also have independent errors. So there should be no confusion. I
will however put in some language on this topic. I will also clarify
that the behavior I am talking about is what methods are affected by a
write lock and nothing more.

As always, thanks for the comments,

Yaron
