If you are interested then you may want to have a look at my Web Commander
[1] which is a Win32 app based on libwww [2].

I have just released a new version that shows how to avoid the lost update
problem when saving documents based on HTTP/1.1 PUT with etags, HEAD, and
persistent cache.

It's available in both binary and source form.

Hope this helps,

Henrik
