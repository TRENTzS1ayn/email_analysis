Yaron and Jim seem to disagree on the nature of the requirement,
so it sounds like this needs to get worked out.

Must the intermediaries also be DAV compliant? Well, for one level
it doesn't matter, but suppose:


1)  http://foo/bar is DAV compliant
2)  http://foo/bar/a/b/c/blah/ exists and is DAV compliant
3)  then must http://foo/bar/a/b be a (DAV-compliant) collection?

This would leave out the possibility that http://foo/bar/a might
be some kind of mapping? Or is it that "exists" needs elaboration
to except that case where it's a redirection?
