Based on my experiences as a webmaster, I'd agree.  I really don't see any
prospect of webmasters wanting to have only root-based subtrees (like
<URL:http://www.foo.com/bar/>) be DAV-compliant.  DAV will work and play
better with others if it can be restricted to non-root-based subtrees.  Not
that some servers won't want to be set up using DAV for all document
management -- just that some (probably the majority) will not use DAV for
all document management, for various political/social/technical reasons.
