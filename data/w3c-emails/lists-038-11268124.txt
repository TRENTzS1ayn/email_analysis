It should be possible to configure a DAV server to have a document root
contained in "collection" that is not DAV compliant. For example, I use the
Java Web Server's doc.root of c:\some-path\public-html and set the doc.root for
my authoring web server to be c:\some-path\public-html\dav. This keeps the
authoring server and the production server out of each other's way, but uses
the same file system root for both. Other configurations are possible. The -08
spec does not prevent this, it only leaves it as a server option.
