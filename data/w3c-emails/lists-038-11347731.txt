I could also probably come up with some fairly convoluted example where you
could use an untagged If header with an e-tag on a Depth Infinity method but
that would be besides the point. The real point is that we generally don't
ban something unless we have a reason to. Since we didn't have a compelling
reason to keep e-tags out of untagged lists and there is occasion that they
could actually be useful in an untagged list, we decided to just allow them.
