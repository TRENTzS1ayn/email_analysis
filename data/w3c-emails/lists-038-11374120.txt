That could be very difficult to implement, though.  If http://foo/bar/baz.cgi
is a CGI script, then http://foo/bar/baz.cgi/quux.html is a perfectly legal
URI as far as the protocol's concerned.  If descendants of DAV collections
must be DAV, then baz.cgi must implement all DAV methods in order for
quux.html to be compliant.  Of course, the server's DAV implementation can
provide helper code for baz.cgi to use, but it could still get pretty nasty.
