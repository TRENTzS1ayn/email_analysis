This seems right to me.  At least indirect references are resources,
with their own URLs, to which HTTP and WebDAV can be applied, which bear
properties, etc.  So access control should certainly apply to them just
as to any other resource.

Direct references are less clear, but they get created independently of
their targets, deleted independently of their targets, and some subset
of HTTP / WebDAV methods affect them, so it seems as if they, too,
should have access control separate from their targets.

This is not so clear.  The discussion of Strong References at Redmond
revealed some security risks that might lead us to conclude that we want
access control on the creation of references.  For example, one way for
a server to preserve referential integrity for DELETE operations is to
refuse to delete the target as long as there are any references to it.
On a server that uses this approach, the owner of any resource who
wanted to be sure he could always delete it might want to restrict
permissions to create (strong) references to it.
