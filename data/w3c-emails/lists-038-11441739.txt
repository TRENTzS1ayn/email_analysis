I think the answer is that the target URI itself might be sensitive data.
For example, suppose I were running a startup out of my home while working
for Netscape (I'm not :-), and wanted to keep it private.  Say the
startup's pages are under http://foo/myStartup/ (bit of a giveaway), and
there's a single page in there that I want to show to a Netscape co-worker,
so I create an indirect reference to it.  I don't want them to be able to
see the target URI.
