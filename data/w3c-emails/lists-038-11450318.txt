There has been no discussion following Jim Davis's mailnote "Proposal:
optional backpointers for ACR" of August 19.  Unless there are
objections, this proposal will be incorporated in the Advanced
Collections protocol specification, and a corresponding requirement will
be added to the Advanced Collections requirements.

The requirement will state:

There is an interoperable means of navigating from a resource that is
the target of multiple references up the collection hierarchies from
which it is referenced.

The protocol specification will include:

The definition of a new, optional property DAV:references, which
provides backpointers from a target to all resources that refer to it.

This property is live on servers that choose to support it.  It may be
present on resources on other servers, but in that case will be dead.

Clients can use this property to discover which resources reference the
target resource, and by parsing the URLs of the references, can discover
the collections where those references reside and navigate up the
collection hierarchy.
