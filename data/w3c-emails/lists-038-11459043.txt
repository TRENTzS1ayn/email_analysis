At IETF 42 it was suggested that the semantics of the DAV MOVE operation
need to be modified for servers that support referencing.  This change
will be made to the Advanced Collections protocol specification unless
objections are voiced.  The change is as follows:

Servers that support referencing MAY insert an additional step, called
UPDATE, between the COPY and the DELETE of a MOVE operation.  The UPDATE
step updates the DAV:reftarget property of any references to the MOVED
resource, if possible, to reflect its new location.
