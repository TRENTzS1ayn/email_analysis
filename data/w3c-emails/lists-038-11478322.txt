However:

1) the property is optional. If it is tough for a particular
implementation, then they can choose to not implement it

2) if the perf is too much, then a server can avoid it

3) if the property is implicit, then an real update may not be required.

Given that some implementions can handle back-references without much
problem, then it would be quite nice to be able to extract them.
Especially if the server keeps telling you that you can't delete it
because of other references. Without this, it would be quite a bear to
find those other refs.
