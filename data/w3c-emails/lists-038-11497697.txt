There are capabilities that can be optional, and others that if optional
compromise the notion of a standard and render the protocol effectively server
dependent. Providing optional back pointers (among many others in WebDAV) I
think is going too far. This is too low-level and fundamental to be optional.
Client applications will be impossible to write if not only do they have to
deal with low-level protocols, methods with semantics hidden in control couples
(headers), XML documents that must be parsed for results, etc., but they'll
also have to adjust themselves to a myriad of server peculiarities. Too much of
this will limit WebDAV's appeal due to the complexity of building servers to
support it and clients to use it let alone a user's ability to understand those
that are built. WebDAV should keep it simple and leave the complexity to the
user's problem domain. My rule of thumb is when in doubt, leave it out. Another
rule of thumb: if you have to describe the semantics of something in a series
of special cases, there's something wrong with your abstraction. WebDAV is
starting to reach this boundary.

However:

1) the property is optional. If it is tough for a particular
implementation, then they can choose to not implement it

2) if the perf is too much, then a server can avoid it

3) if the property is implicit, then an real update may not be required.

Given that some implementions can handle back-references without much
problem, then it would be quite nice to be able to extract them.
Especially if the server keeps telling you that you can't delete it
because of other references. Without this, it would be quite a bear to
find those other refs.
