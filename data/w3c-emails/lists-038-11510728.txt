This will require ACLs on individual properties, something many servers may not
do as it presents a significant administration burden compared to simple CRUD
ACLs. ACLs for every user, on every resource, for each resource property, for
every WebDAV method is not tractable. We are rapidly reaching a scaleability
problem.

I don't believe that has to be a problem.  The ACLs can be set up so that they
specifically permit the backpointer property to be updated by the server.  (Come
to that, it's a live property, so write access may not mean very much in the
first place.)
