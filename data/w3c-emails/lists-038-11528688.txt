Yet another special case. Pile all these up and you start getting problems.
What if the target resource is versioned? Are you saying we can now add more
special cases to let this property be changed on a versioned resource? Again,
if the semantics have to be specified as a series of special cases, that's a
good indication something is wrong, and usesr aren't likely to be able to
remember all these cases.

Nope.  The backpointer update doesn't have to pass through the same code path as
PROPPATCH; it can call directly into the code that PROPPATCH calls, but bypass
the
ACL check.
