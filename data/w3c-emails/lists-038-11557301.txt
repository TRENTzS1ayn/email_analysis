It was pointed out at IETF 42 that LOCK can create a new resource in a
collection.  Consequently LOCK should have been in the list of methods
that can have the Position header, to set the position of the new
resource in the collection's ordering.

This oversight will be corrected in the next revision of the Advanced
Collections protocol spec.
