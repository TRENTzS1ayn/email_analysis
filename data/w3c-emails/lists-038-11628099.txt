It's a *live property*.  That's the only special case here.  It doesn't have the
same semantics as a dead property; it doesn't even have to be *stored* like a dead
property; it can be generated on the fly, like a CGI script.  If the resource in
question is a frozen revision, fine; the "preserve all properties on frozen
revisions" requirement doesn't make sense for live properties, certainly not ones
which are derived from the states of other resources.
