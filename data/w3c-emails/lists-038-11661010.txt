The client applications using backpointers know what the property is and that
it is a live property supported by the particular server. Clients that don't
use backpointers would ignore or just not use the property even though that
particular server was maintaining them. This is typical of any client
application that uses some specific meta-data of its own. The only thing unique
is that the server is maintaining it as a live property.

Choke.  And what happens when one of these clients tries to coexist with a
client
that doesn't support backpointers?
