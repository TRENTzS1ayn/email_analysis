I agree if you meant to say *even direct* references need separate access
control lists.  As long as there are any operations that affect the
reference itself (and we are proposing that DELETE, MOVE, and COPY do affect
the reference itself, even for direct references), access control makes
sense for the reference.

We distinguished references along 2 axes: direct / indirect, strong / weak.
Strong / weak has to do only with whether the server undertakes to insure
referential integrity.  I don't see how the strong / weak distinction has
any implications for access control lists.
