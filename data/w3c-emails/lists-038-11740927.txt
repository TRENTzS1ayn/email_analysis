Could you be more specific about the kinds of scalability problems you

You are thinking the query would be:

Find the resources on server S that have DAV:reftarget = T?

This is certainly possible in cases where the client has a certain list of
servers that it cares about.  This includes the case that motivated the
suggestion about backpointers in the first place -- DMSs. It's less useful
for more open-ended cases like the client just trying to find out who would
be affected if it deletes a resource. 

It does seem to me that the property should be live if it exists at all.
Otherwise the property value will just be unreliable, since some clients
that create references may maintain it while others do not.
