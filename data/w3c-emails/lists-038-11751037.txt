Give me a break, John.  The Source URL is a link provided by WebDAV.
If you are doing authoring on a resource, the user agent is already
aware of both the retrieval interface (seeing the results) and the
source interface (seeing the content from which the retrieval is derived).
If they are the same thing, then it may be the same URL, or it may not.
If they are not the same thing, then it won't be the same URL.  Either way,
the browser is going to be told to retrieve "a URL" by the Composer.
This can all be done automatically by any sensible implementation of WebDAV
once at least one of those two URLs are entered by the user to start
the authoring process.  The server will tell you the rest.
