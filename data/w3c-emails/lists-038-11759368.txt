A resource can be referenced by any collection anywhere on the web.
Maintaining backreferences to such collections requires that you are
both notified when a reference is made/unmade and have the ability
to store an unbounded number of backlinks in the repository, which is
an area of concern when they may come from other (untrusted) administrative
domains.  The continual cost of maintaining such links is not worth the
occasional use.

This is, of course, not the case for most DMS.  They would undoubtedly
restrict the mantenance of backlinks to collections held within the DMS.

Yes.

It would be live in the same sense that the members of a collection
are live (determined by the server and not directly set by the client).
