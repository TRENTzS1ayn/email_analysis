How could that be? The HTTP client issues a request to the server (by definition:
the client is the one that issues a request), and then either (a) the server
applies that request to the reference's target, or (b) the server tells the
client what the target is, and the client reissues the request for the new URI.
Case (a), the reference is dereferenced on the server side; case (b), it's
dereferenced on the client side.
