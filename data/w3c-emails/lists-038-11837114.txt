Depending on their usage. I don't use backpointers for anything, and thus
a DASL search is always more efficient.  Likewise, a WebDAV client has no
direct need for backpointers other than as a means for information discovery,
which is also more efficiently performed and scoped by a search query than
via a PROPFIND request.  How that is implemented on the server side is
none of our business.

The uses that you gave for backpointers in your system are only relevant
for behind-the-server-curtains types of operations.  That's all fine and
good, but you don't need a DAV property to do that, nor do you need any
extra client-to-server interoperability.

I don't particularly care whether a backpointer property is defined
or not, just so long as people understand that it isn't necessary.
