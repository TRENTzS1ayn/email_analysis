Roy, perhaps I misunderstand the context of your statement, but I might
disagree with your statement that "a WebDAV client has no direct need
for backpointers..."   I know that I, as a human client using WebDAV,
might like to know what is referencing a resource.  Perhaps that's
what you meant by "information discovery".  Feel free to clarify.

I could imagine finding backpointers using a DASL like query might be
very slow relative to an architected property/mechanism for
maintaining backpointer info.  Perhaps you could explain why you say
DASL is always more efficient for you.

I agree that it's not *necessary* to be REQUIRED and even mentioned
in the protocol, but I think I agree with the person that said that it
seems like it would be good to standardize how this info is accessed.

Jason.
