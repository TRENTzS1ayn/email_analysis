Not necessarily.  It's up to the server implementer: if the customers want
backpointer-like functionality, then the server can maintain backpointers
under the covers and use them to respond to the DASL query.  Other servers
which don't expect this to be a common request can just calculate the
response on the fly, and the client won't care which way it's working.  Just
like some servers will implement full-text search via an index, and others
will just grep the files.

I think I prefer the DASL approach; it's just as optional as the property
approach, but it behaves better in the downlevel server case.

He means that it's more efficient not to have a feature than to have a
feature that never gets used.
