Well, yes.  Isn't that where we are? The "CM must be an optional feature"
requirement, which came out of the Chicago meeting, takes the "versioning is
the degenerate case of CM" approach out of the running.  Given that, the only
proposals on the table are Vgraph-based.

And, for some people, one of those needs is to be able to use their existing
repositories, so they can apply DAV to content they've already developed.

Because all that #2 says is that there exists a URI for each revision; you may
have to issue a request to find out what it is.  Being able to build a URI
directly makes it possible to publish links to revisions.

Note, also, that we're talking about two different URIs here.  I expressed it
poorly, but my view is that the one in #5 is a URI to a resource inside the
Vgraph, which is a reference to the real revision; that reference can then have
versioning properties (e.g., log entry) distinct from the properties on the
revision itself.

I don't know; what do you mean by "search version history"? Is it equivalent,
in a Vgraph-based case, to "search the Vgraph"?

Mmm, true.  Anything else? I don't think so.

No.

No, I forgot about it.  (Not having minutes from Raleigh has been making this
work harder; my own notes weren't complete.)

Motherhood & apple pie, isn't it? We certainly aren't going to go out of our
way to make things harder; otherwise we'd be expressing the protocol elements
in ASN.1, layering on top of three other complex protocols (of which two would
be copyrighted and one would be incompletely specified), and demanding
interoperability with the Dewey Decimal System.  But this isn't the ITU.  :-)
