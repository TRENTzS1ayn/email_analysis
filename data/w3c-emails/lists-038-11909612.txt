Uh...how would it not? Chris's "versioning is the degenerate case of CM"
proposal uses CM as the core functionality, and does versioning by having a
configuration set with only one resource.  The requirement from Chicago, on the
other hand, is that it must be possible to do versioning without doing CM.
Sure, it might be possible to implement a system based on such a backend, and
emulate Vgraphs based on the backend's data; but that says nothing about the
protocol--there must be a Vgraph (or something similar) for each resource.
