Yes, that's what I meant by information discovery.  I place it in that
category particularly because of the scoping issues, since I may want
to search for all the references on server A that refer to a resource
on server B.  There is no difference in performance if I am checking only
for a single resource within the scope of its own server, since the
DASL engine internal to the server can just translate that to a retrieval
of the backpointer property without the client needing to be aware of
that property.

John's answers to your other questions were right on the mark.
