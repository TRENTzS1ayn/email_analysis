On the other hand, this is one of the things that I was very concerned that
the initial version requirements _not prevent_. The change-oriented
approach to collaboration is rapidly becoming mainstream in the CSCW
research world (5 papers in the upcoming conference this November).

Web collaboration should be at least as suitable for document editing as
software versioning.

This is a second level comment -- I've not read the new goals document, but
I strongly disagree with mandating a non-"additive" approach in WebDAV.

If this graph can have multiple ancestors, and can (if the server supports
and wants) be discontinuous, withsome versions unrelated to the others,
then it's very convenient, and not pernicious.

In the additive case the relationships may all be implicit or purely a
result of user assertion as to the _intended_ place of a revision including
multile changes from many other versions, and perhaps undoing some but not
all of the changes actually in some of those versions.
