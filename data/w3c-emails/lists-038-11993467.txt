One of my major concerns with a change-oriented approach is that it tends to
assume the system has a lot of content-type-specific knowledge, and it tends
to assume you're dealing with text-like objects.  This is contrary to one of
the underlying design principles of the Web, which is that operations are
media-type independent.
