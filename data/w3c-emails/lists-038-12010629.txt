I have three reactions to this:

One is to agree with Sankar's points. (But I'll actually belabour them a
bit in my own words)

The second is to point out that any object stored in a computer can be
treated as a sequence of octets, and changes to those sequences are
_always_ a possible, if sometimes far from optimal, way to represent
changes. So, on the face of it, your assertion is (trivially) false.
"Text-like objects" is a term that makes a fundamental fact of computer
encoding look like special pleading for a favored data format.

The third is to say that the notion of sequence of characters is in fact a
significant special case deserving of meaningful treatment (as, for
instance the MIME standard's attempts to provide useful rules for the
text/* types). So, even if you don't believe my argument that there is no
special pleading for text, I think that there's a very good claim that such
special pleading is legitimate anyway. The possible need (or desire) for
content-type-specialized change formats is a separate issue, and has
exactly nothing to do with the accomodating change-set style versioning,
especially given the existence of a lowest-common-denominator chnage
format. There are many possible ones that would work for arbitrary octet
sequences (as for instance, the as yet unreleased VTML 2.0).

Even for text, there is a lot to be said for an octet-sequence approach,
given the variety of modern character encodings. I can think of
single-octet character codes, varying length codes like UTF-8, 16-bit
codes, 16-bit codes plus the use of "surrogate characters" to map pairs of
16-bit characters to a larger portion of the ISO character space. And
someone somewhere will evantually want some other variation for some
reason...
