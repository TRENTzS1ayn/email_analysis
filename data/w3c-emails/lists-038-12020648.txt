Chris Kaler has finished combining the two existing versioning proposals
(draft-kaler-webdav-versioning-00 and draft-whitehead-webdav-versioning-00)
into a single draft, which is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/versioning/draft-webdav-versioning-00
.txt

It is also available in Word 97 format:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/versioning/draft-webdav-versioning-00
.doc

This document has intentionally not yet been submitted to the
Internet-Drafts directory.  The intent is to discuss this document at the
design team meeting this week, then submit it as an I-D if there is
agreement that it forms a good starting point for discussions on this
protocol.
