In HTTP, a variant may or may not be a separate resource. However,
for the purpose of WebDAV, I would propose that any variant than
can be authored independently must be a separate resource.

There are a variety of cases for variants. The most common case
for variants in use in the web today seems to be to have different
variants of the page depending on which version of browser your
User-Agent string reports. Other variants may depend on other
factors. Content may 'vary' on any of a variety of request headers.

This isn't 'obvious' at all.

The design of versioning needs to account for the relationship
of versions of a resource and versions of its variants for
all of the cases of uses of variants. Since there are several
cases, a case analysis is necessary. You've analyzed only
one of the cases.

This is one use of 'variant' but not comprehensive.

Variants are defined in HTTP/1.1. Variants are used by web servers.
WebDAV's goal is to support distributed authoring and versioning for the
Web. Thus, WebDAV needs to define distributed authoring and versioning
for variants, since they are used in the web.

This is unworkable in the case of computed variants.

Having this in the 'goals' document will just give you trouble,
since it can be interpreted in so many ways.
