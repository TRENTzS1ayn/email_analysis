Your last paragraph sounds like a good requirement statement. Has this been
discussed at all in the versioning group. The reason I ask this is because I
am confused about earlier discussions on configurations and change sets in
the context of this requirement. I can see two inter related ways of dealing
with the variant requirement that you express. It involves using
configurations and derivations to address this problem. Therefore, I am
surprised that earlier discussions on versioning mentioned configurations as
an optional requirement. If configurations indeed are optional requirements,
it seems to me that the above also might be an optional requirement.
