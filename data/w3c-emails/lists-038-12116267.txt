This makes sense to me, since we have defined the 409 Response for MKCOL to
be:

"A collection cannot be made at the Request-URI until one or more
intermediate collections have been created."

So, the spec. should be changed to add similar language for trying to COPY
or MOVE to a location whose parent collection (DAV or non-DAV) does not
exist.
