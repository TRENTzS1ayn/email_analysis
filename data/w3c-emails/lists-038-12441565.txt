At the versioning design team meeting last week, Jim asked
if we wanted to express the revision history (version graph)
in RDF; it's a natural format for it, but there was concern
that we might be tying ourselves to a doomed non-standard--a
few people expressed the opinion that RDF seemed to be dying
on the vine, ignored by the W3C and abandoned by Netscape.
We agreed to come up with a more specific format; I don't
want to reopen that discussion, but I just wanted to let
everybody know that I talked to Ramanathan Guha (Mr. RDF),
and he says it's going to Last Call in a couple of weeks.
(Mind you, I don't know enough about the W3C to know whether
that's a comparable state to the IETF's Last Call.)
