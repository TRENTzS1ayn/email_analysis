Those who who may have expressed the view that W3C could be
abandoning RDF are sorely mistaken.  The RDF Model and Syntax
Working Group continues to refine its specification based on
comments on the most recent public working draft (dated
19 August).  See http://www.w3.org/TR/

We hope to declare a 'Last Call' review for the RDF Model and
Syntax specification in a single-digit number of days and for
the RDF Schema specification shortly thereafter.
