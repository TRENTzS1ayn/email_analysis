Section 24.4 defines namespaces according to a very old draft of XML
namespaces. In particular, it still uses a PI for the namespace
specification. Is there a plan to update that section with respect to
the current namespace specification? (at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xml-names)  It would seem inappropriate to
demand conformance to this outdated spec (the first paragraph of 24.4.1
requires this conformance).

Also, the spec does not explicitly discuss the fact that "DAV:" is a
valid URI that has been reserved for DAV. It implies it when it
discusses each element, but it would seem appropriate that if DAV is
going to treat the (short) string "DAV:" as a URI, then it should call
that out explicitly.
