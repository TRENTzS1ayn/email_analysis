You are correct -- Section 24.4 is currently out of date w.r.t. the current
XML Namespaces proposal. However, the current XML Namespace proposal is only
a W3C Working Draft, and is not yet completely stable. While I don't expect
there to be massive changes to the XML Namespaces spec. between now and its
final approval, there will be some changes, and hence I am loathe to update
the DAV draft until XML Namespaces are finalized.

But, it is my recommendation that the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol
be updated to reflect the new XML Namespaces draft once it is approved, or
near approval. Once it is at Proposed Recommendation status, I'll feel
comfortable moving forward.

But, I'm also unwilling to have approval of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring
protocol be held up by the XML Namespaces work.  This raises some issues on
how exactly the revision of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring specification
will occur.  There are many possible cases here -- I prefer to wait until
the XML Namespaces draft proceeds to Proposed Recommendation before
committing to any particular course of action.

If I were implementing the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol, ideally I
would make sure I could understand both types of XML Namespace.

Section 17, "IANA Considerations" clearly states that we are defining a new
URI scheme, and that it has been reserved for use by WebDAV.
