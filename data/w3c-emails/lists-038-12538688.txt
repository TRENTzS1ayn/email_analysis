I would submit that a massive change has occurred (moving from a
PI-based namespace definition to an attribute-based system). This kind
of disparity can't really be a Good Thing(tm).

Nevertheless, I do understand the feeling of not wanting to change
something that will simply change again. However, moving it from about
20% to 90% of "correct" (before final approval of DAV) seems better, if
this is a possible option.

Cool... I'm glad that an update will occur at some point. I'll just hold
out hope/argument for sooner rather than later :-)

I can understand this. Doesn't a revision require a completely new RFC?
Also, during this revision process, wouldn't the whole thing bog down
because people would say, "hey... it's being revised. Let's get our pet
features in on this round!" ?

Would it be very disruptive to the current approval process to cut/paste
a new section in? Or is it a matter of somebody needing to spend time
(which is usually non-existent :-) to re-author that section?
[ I'm not very clueful about the mechanics of the process here and what
disruption might occur ]

"icky" is a good word here. :-)

Ah. I had missed that (sorry). Thanks for the pointer.
