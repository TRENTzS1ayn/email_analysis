How about looking at it this way...

A reference can be referring to one of two things.

A. It is referring to a location in the URL namespace (consequentially
referring whatever resource is available there)
B. It is referring to a specific resource (consequentially it should follow
that resource as it moves)

Type A corresponds to "weak" references. Type B is what we have been calling
"strong".

We can throw out the strong/weak/integrity characterization. I think this
more closely matches what servers/clients actually want to use references
for.

Type A references cannot be "dangling" since they reference a specific
location irrespective of the existence of a resource there.

If a reference of Type B loses track of the resource it is referring to,
then it can revert to a Type A reference to the last place it knew about the
resource. Thus what "dangling" is also handled for Type B. 

Also creation of Type B references would be server optional, it should be
possible to decide to make Type A references non-optional.

Typically only Type A references will be possible across servers since we
don't yet have a standard way of tracking resources independent of URL.

How about the terms "location reference" and "resource reference".

Note that these would be orthogonal to direct/indirect references.
