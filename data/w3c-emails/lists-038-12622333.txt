What ever happened on the issue of whether a DAV 'resource'
can have more than one 'URL'? I think the only compromise
is to say 'only one URL per resource' but then you'd need
to require that operations on aliases mainly pass through
and that DAV compliant servers SHOULD provide a "location"
header if the URI passed isn't the canonical one. You say
that for http://a/b/c == http://a/b/c/ so it shouldn't
be so hard.
