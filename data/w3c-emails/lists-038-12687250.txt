But this applies to any structured DAV property.  The DASL group has discussed
the possibility of searching structured properties, and (as far as I can
tell) has not given up yet (there's a proposal on the table from Alan, though I
don't see any responses on the list).

But this will make things even less searchable, and much less manageable.

What's wrong with defining <ol> in a property (or at least a Dublin Core
property) to have the meaning we need?

OK, I'll add it.

I disagree--the DAV server just sees them as separate dead properties; it doesn't
have to know that there's any relationship among them.

OK, here's your straight line: Why?
