The traditional way of dealing with this in systems that support
ACLs doesn't match the web's way of dealing with this. In this case,
the user trying to access information has many attributes, only
one of which is their authenticated identity.

Now, this can get arbitrarily complex, and I'm not asking that
it be arbitrarily complex, but at least complex enough to implement
the *very common* authentication policy on the web: everyone
from site *.blah.com has access, but users from any other site
have to log in.
