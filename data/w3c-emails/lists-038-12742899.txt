That sounds reasonable.  Any guess on how long it'll take to get ratified?

I'm not sure what you mean by implicit identifiers.  An XML document stored
as a WebDAV property does not have a URI--WebDAV properties are not
resources.  Does that answer the question?

OK, then probably the best move is for WebDAV to store the properties in
whatever format DC uses (since RDF is expressed in XML already).

Actually, WebDAV properties can be any XML you like; the <ol><li> in my
Draft is specific to the Draft.

That's why the Draft says:

     Since subelements are not yet standardized, this document cannot
     yet give a definitive answer on how to integrate them into
     WebDAV; a future document may be needed.

I'm pretty sure WebDAV itself doesn't really need new capabilities here; we
just need to define a way of expressing DC elements in the framework we've
got.
