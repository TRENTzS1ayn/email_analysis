On September 1, 1998, Jeffrey Ricker asked:
> Has anyone built a webdav server yet? Does anyone have one in the works?

Yesterday, Microsoft publically announced broad product support for WebDAV:

http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1998/Oct98/WebDAVPR.htm

This was picked up in the press:

http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?98107.wiowebdav.htm

Some salient quotes from the press release:

"Microsoft plans to incorporate support for WebDAV into the Microsoft
Windows NT 5.0 Server operating system and Office 2000."

"Microsoft shipped support for the WebDAV specification with the beta 1
version of Office 2000 and the beta 2 version of Windows NT 5.0 Server..."
