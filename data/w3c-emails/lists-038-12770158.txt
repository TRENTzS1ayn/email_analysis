This release did say beta 1 of Office 2000 has WebDAV support, but in examining the product we can't see any evidence of it.  Any clarification from the MS people on this list?

On September 1, 1998, Jeffrey Ricker asked:
> Has anyone built a webdav server yet? Does anyone have one in the works?

Yesterday, Microsoft publically announced broad product support for WebDAV:

http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1998/Oct98/WebDAVPR.htm 

This was picked up in the press:

http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?98107.wiowebdav.htm 

Some salient quotes from the press release:

"Microsoft plans to incorporate support for WebDAV into the Microsoft
Windows NT 5.0 Server operating system and Office 2000."

"Microsoft shipped support for the WebDAV specification with the beta 1
version of Office 2000 and the beta 2 version of Windows NT 5.0 Server..."
