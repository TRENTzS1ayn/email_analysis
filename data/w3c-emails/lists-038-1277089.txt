DOCUMENTS

* Requirements Document
  "Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol for the 
World Wide Web"
  Judith Slein, Fabio Vitali, Jim Whitehead, David Durand
  <draft-ietf-webdav-requirements-03.txt>, September 24, 1997.
  Editor: Judith Slein <slein@wrc.xerox.com>

The requirements document was submitted to the IESG on October 1, 1997, for 
publication as an Informational RFC, and is awaiting consideration.


* Protocol Document
  "Extensions for Distributed Authoring and Versioning on the World Wide 
Web"
  Yaron Y. Goland, Jim Whitehead, Asad Faizi, Steve Carter, Del Jensen
  <draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-04.txt>, October 13, 1997.
  Editor: Del Jensen <dcjensen@novell.com>

The protocol document is currently under review by the working group.  The 
-04 revision contains revisions based on feedback from the Orem, and Munich 
meetings, as well as feedback received from the mailing list.  The protocol 
draft is proceding very close to the schedule I posted on September 12, and 
I am confident we will begin a working group last call on this document in 
early January.


* Access Control Requirements
  "Proposed Requirements for Access Control within Distributed
  Authoring and Versioning Environments on the WWW"
  Howard Palmer
  <http://people.netscape.com/hep/webdav/ac/acreq-hp.html>
  Editor: Howard Palmer <hep@netscape.com>

The access control requirements document is currently in a rough draft 
form, and is being discussed by the working group.  Howard is working on 
generating an initial Internet Draft which incorporates comments on the 
rough draft.


* Tree Document
  "WebDAV Tree Operations"
  Yaron Y. Goland, Saveen Reddy
  <draft-ietf-webdav-depth-00.txt>, October 8, 1997.
  Editor: Saveen Reddy <saveenr@microsoft.com>

The initial version of the tree (recursive methods) document is currently 
being discussed by the mailing list.  A new revision, based on comments 
from the mailing list, will be submitted by the IETF submission deadline, 
November 21.


* Scenarios Document
  "HTTP-based Distributed Content Editing Scenarios"
  Ora Lassila
  <draft-ietf-webdav-scenarios-00.txt>, May 31, 1997.
  Editor: Ora Lassila <ora.lassila@research.nokia.com>

This document is in hiatus, in need of revision to ensure that for every 
requirement in the requirements document, there is at least one scenario. 
 Since this document expires next month, it will need to be resubmitted 
before the last call deadline for the December meeting.


* WebDAV XML Elements DTD
  John Turner
  <http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/wedav3.dtd>, October 10, 
1997.
  Terry Allen's condensed version:
  <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1997OctDec/0057.html>

This document gives the document type definition (DTD) for the XML elements 
used within the WebDAV protocol document.  Issues raised by this draft need 
to be resolved an incorporated into the next version of the protocol 
document.  This DTD needs to be incorporated into the WebDAV protocol 
document.


* Access Control Protocol Submission
  "WebDAV ACL Protocol"
  Paul Leach, Yaron Y. Goland
 
 <http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/leach_goland_acl_draft.  
txt>
  October 19, 1997

This draft was submitted to the mailing list, and is currently being 
discussed by the mailing list.  The draft needs to be revised, and 
submitted as an Internet Draft.
