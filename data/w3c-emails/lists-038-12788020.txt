If you have an opinion about whether DASL should support queries on
structured properties (e.g. for Dublin Core) *please* speak up in the DASL
list. There have been several posts there asking for opinions on this
point, with little or no response.

As a result of this silence, the current DASL requirements ID does not
include a requirement for queries on structured properties.  We need to
hear from you on this.

The DASL home page is http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/dasl/

(Archived) mail messages of greatest relevance are:

Structure criteria for DASL queries
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webdav-dasl/1998JulSep/0087.html
(tries to  "make (or reopen) the case for defining a structure criteria
(also called "structured query") in DASL.")
 
Should DASL have structure queries?

(Attempt to provoke discussion on the need for structured queries)

If you want to contribute to the design of DASL structured criteria, there
are two proposals on the table right now, or you can add your own.

Please see
