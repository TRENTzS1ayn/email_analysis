Why do you need a special mechanism for incremental update of
collections? You can just work on the collection members--PUT to /foo/bar is an incremental
update of /foo/.

If you're talking about some way of patching a whole collection at once, I think we've
punted the question of diffs (incremental updates) as being a more general problem; httpext
should work on diffs before we can apply the technology for patches.
