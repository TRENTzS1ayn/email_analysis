The client may make such a request, but it's likely that most servers will
refuse it as this is a very difficult problem to solve in the general case. I
think we should defer the requirement, and see if customers demand it, can't do
their authoring without it, and server vendors indicate they can support it.

Subject: RE: Client Option for Strong References

This is a very appealing approach, but at the moment there is a requirement
for strong references:

"3.1.18 It is possible to request creation of a referential resource that
the server will guarantee to have referential integrity."

The rationale is that there are some applications for which dangling
references are unacceptable, and these applications must be able to insure
at the time they create a reference that it will never be broken.

If the group could be persuaded to give up this requirement, we would no
longer need the weak / strong distinction.
