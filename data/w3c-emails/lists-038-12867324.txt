Subject: [Moderator Action] W3C RDF Model and Syntax Specification
enters Last Call


On behalf of the W3C RDF Model and Syntax Working Group it gives us great
pleasure to announce "Last Call" for comments on the RDF Model and Syntax
Specification, version 1 [RDFMS].

With the publication of this draft, the RDF Model and Syntax Specification
enters "last call." The last call period will end on October 23, 1998.

Comments on this specification may be sent to www-rdf-comments@w3.org.  The
archive of public comments is available at
http://www.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments.

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a foundation for processing
metadata; it provides interoperability between applications that exchange
machine-understandable information on the Web. RDF emphasizes facilities to
enable automated processing of Web resources.
