Subject:Last Call: IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages to BCP


The IESG has received a request to consider the following:

 o IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages
   <draft-alvestrand-charset-policy-02.txt> for publication as a BCP.

 o IANA Charset Registration Procedure
   <draft-freed-charset-reg-04.txt> for publication as a BCP.
  

 o UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646
   <draft-yergeau-utf8-rev-01.txt> for publication as a Proposed Standard.


These items have been reviewed in the IETF but are not the product of
an IETF Working Group.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by November 22, 1997.
