I'm not sure that's the case.  If a client PUTs to a direct reference that it
thinks is a nonexistent resource, the results can be surprising.  Consider
this scenario: I have a dangling direct reference into another user's
directory tree; I don't have write permission on the target.  I come along and
find that my direct reference is reporting 404; I forget that it was a
reference, so I think I must have deleted that page.  So I find/create a
replacement for that page and try to PUT it, only to be told I don't have
write permission.
