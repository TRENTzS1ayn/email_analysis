I checked back through the archive and didn't see anything, so I figured
I'd report it:

7.1.1 has an example with a multi-status response. The second <propstat>
element contains a <responsedescription>. According to the DTD (and
under the propstat element description), this is not allowed.

Cheers,
-g

p.s. I didn't see any other mis-examples re: responsedescription.
