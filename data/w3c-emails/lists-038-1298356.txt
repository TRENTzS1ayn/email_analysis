First, with my security hat on:

Basing ACL decisions on unauthenticated information of the kind this
example implies is pretty worthless from a security standpoint, even if
it is common practice. Plaintext passwords are also common practice. We
don't have to continue either, and shouldn't.

If you have strong authentication, then you don't have to rely on hacks
based on the IP address or DNS name of the source host. Or, if we have
to for backwards compatibility, we can not include them in the ACL model
-- aren't they often at the "virtual root" level, and not on individual
files, anyway?

Second, with my ACL hat on:

I don't see your example as a counter-example. The principal is just a
pair (user, source). In your example: (*, *.blah.com) is the principal
-- any user from *.blah.com.
