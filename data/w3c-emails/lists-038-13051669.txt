Note that RFC 2413 includes a URL to DC's site; would that be enough?

Gack.

We don't write anything that would suggest a client might dereference a
namespace URL, do we?

I'm pretty sure server-to-client is meant to be sufficient.  Existing SSL
clients (well, Navigator, anyway :-) have to deal with this problem when
running through a proxy.  Navigator connects to the proxy and issues a CONNECT
request, which tells the proxy to open up a connection to the server and relay
bits untouched.  If man-in-the-middle were a problem, the proxy would need to
be trusted, in which case we wouldn't need a CONNECT; we could proxy https:
just like http:.

That being said, I don't know the details of SSL, and still less those of TLS;
I may be missing something.
