I assumed based on the DASL charter and the requirements that it would be
possible to query on any property that could be exposed through WebDAV.
That would certainly include structured properties.

Aside from meeting expectations, DASL would be dramatically more useful if
it could accept queries on structured properties.  The arguments already
presented on the DASL mailing list are compelling: There are already
structured properties in the DAV: namespace, and there will certainly be
more when the rest of the WebDAV specifications are in place.  Just finding
out basic information like what resources I have locked would require a
structured query.

Imagine an application that lets users construct queries.  It presents the
user with a list of queryable attributes, and a lot of the properties that
the user knows exist are not on the list.  Why not?  Because they are
structured.  I would find this extremely frustrating.  Why can't I query on
creator?  Because it's a list-valued property.  Why can't I query on
resource type? Because its values are XML elements rather than strings.
