Referencing RFC 2413 will be fine for our purposes.  Since it was published
in September, 1998, and the -08 draft was submitted in April, we didn't have
an opportunity to cite the RFC intitially.  It's a non-normative reference,
anyway, and the RFC is informational.  This shouldn't have any impact on the
DAV properties binding draft you're working on, John.

I believe this is based on the XML Namespaces that is currently copied
by-value in the DAV spec., which has the "src" attribute.  This attribute
had been intended for use in retrieving a machine-readable description of
the namespace schema, and hence Keith's comment addresses this.  The problem
was if you have a million copies of some application released which all go
to this URL everytime they process XML.  The new namespace proposal doesn't
have an equivalent capability, and so this comment goes away, I believe.

I think the problem is exactly as Keith stated.  It is possible to have a
TLS connection with weak ciphers in use, and hence this security isn't very
strong, since someone could theoretically capture each packet, decrypt it,
and put together the message stream.
