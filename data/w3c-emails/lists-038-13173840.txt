A new mailing list has been created for the discussion of Web versioning
within WebDAV.  This is a public list, with Web and FTP archives, open to
all.  The name of the list is:

ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org

To subscribe to this mailing list, send a message with subject "subscribe"
to ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org

For example:

To: ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org
Subject: subscribe

A big THANK YOU to the W3C for graciously hosting this mailing list.

Archives for the mailing list can be found at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-dav-versioning/

For those of you who have been on the list a *long* time, you'll remember
that in 1996 there were two lists, one for distributed authoring
discussions, and one for versioning discussions, which were combined to
create the Distributed Authoring AND Versioning group.  One of the initial
reasons for creating the single list was to prevent cross-posts between the
versioning and distributed authoring lists, since there was nearly 100%
overlap between them.

To avoid this problem, I am going to always assume that the versioning list
is a subset of the members of the main list, and hence threads should either
be discussed on the main list, or on the versioning list.

Since the versioning list is a subtopic discussion list, the main WebDAV
mailing list, w3c-dist-auth@w3.org, remains the sole arbiter for consensus
on any WebDAV specification.  Hence the versioning list is best seen as a
convenient way to avoid overloading the main list with detailed versioning
discussions, while still leaving the discussion open and transparent, so
anyone can participate.
