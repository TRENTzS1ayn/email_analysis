Hi,

Has anyone given any thought to how WebDAV resources will be bundled into a
MIME message?

What I am looking for is a standard way of collecting both the properties
and body of a resource into a single MIME message. As more and more
interesting data is put into the properties of a resource, it becomes quite
important truck them around as a single unit.

Ideally this MIME type could be requested in a GET and the server will
provide the complete MIME message. This removes several round trips needed
and will make it much more standard since there are far fewer server than
clients. Server could also accept this in a PUT to do an atomic body and
property update without needing locks.

Also, this could form the starting point for inter-server communications.

Marcus.
