Subject: [Moderator Action] Update to versioning goals doc


I have updated the versioning goals doc at
<http://www.thibault.org/dav/version-goals.html>.  The update is not yet
complete; the doc is not yet a replacement for 5.9 of RFC-2291.

Sorry about the delay; I got pulled off on something high-priority that
I have to get done before I leave on my sabbatical.
