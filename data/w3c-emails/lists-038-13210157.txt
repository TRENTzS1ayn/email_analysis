We have two ways of sending structured data: MIME and XML.

One could easily imagine defining an XML DTD that allowed you to bundle
both the properties and the body of a WebDAV resource into a single XML
construct.  Even further, one can equally easily imagine bundling an entire
(nested) collection (with all the properties) into a single XML construct
as well.

Once such a WebDAV DTD was defined, one can equally easily imagine
defining (at least the outer layers of) a mapping of this DTD into
the appropriate MIME constructs (I assume the widespread existence of
MIME knowledgable tools makes a pure XML-only scheme a non-starter?).

Cheers,

   Has anyone given any thought to how WebDAV resources will be bundled into a
   MIME message?

   What I am looking for is a standard way of collecting both the properties
   and body of a resource into a single MIME message. As more and more
   interesting data is put into the properties of a resource, it becomes quite
   important truck them around as a single unit.

   Ideally this MIME type could be requested in a GET and the server will
   provide the complete MIME message. This removes several round trips needed
   and will make it much more standard since there are far fewer server than
   clients. Server could also accept this in a PUT to do an atomic body and
   property update without needing locks.

   Also, this could form the starting point for inter-server communications.

   Marcus.
