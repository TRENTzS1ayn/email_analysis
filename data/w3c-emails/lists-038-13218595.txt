A new revision of the WebDAv Distributed Authoring Protocol has been
submitted to the Internet Drafts editor, and will be available in the
Internet Drafts directory in the next few days as
draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09.

This revision addresses Keith Moore's comments on the previous (-08)
revision, and resolves problems submitted to the list.

While a detailed list of changes to the specification is currently under
preparation, major changes include:

 * changed to be in agreement with newer XML namespace proposals,
specifically WD-xml-names-19980916
 * changed status code 425 (Insufficient Space on Resource) to 507
(Insufficient Storage)
 * added language to clarify meaning and requirements for namespace
consistency
 * added charset attribute to Content-Type headers for text/xml bodies in
examples
 * added charset encoding attribute to XML examples

The authoritative revision of the specification is always the text version,
which is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-0
9.txt

A more readable variant of the protocol is available in PDF at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-0
9.pdf

(Note that the PDF variant still needs to be checked for widows and orphans,
have the headers and footers formatted right, and make sure examples fit on
one page, etc.   As a result, expect a new PDF version in the next few
days.)

A variant of the protocol which has all changes marked is available as a
Word 97/98 document at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-0
9-tracked.doc

(Note: the page numbers are incorrect in this variant, due to complications
with change tracking.)

If you find any problems with these documents, please report them to the
list quickly!  After a brief last call for comments
draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09 will go before the IESG for approval as a
Proposed Standard.
