*** WORKING GROUP LAST CALL FOR COMMENTS ***

DISTRIBUTED AUTHORING PROTOCOL

This is the final call for comments from the working group on the document,
"HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring", by Yaron Y. Goland, E. J.
Whitehead, Jr., Asad Faizi, Steve Carter, Del Jensen,
<draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09>.  This last call for comments period begins
immediately, and ends Friday, October 30, 1998 at midnight Pacific time.
This allows 1 week for comments, and is intended to allow working group
members to detect obvious errors in the specification.

If necessary, at the end of the last call period, a new draft will be issued
(revision -10), containing any changes based on comments received during the
working group last call period.  Unless there are significant technical
problems raised during the last call period, this document will be
immediately forwarded to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for
approval as a Proposed Standard RFC.

If there are any procedural questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to
contact me, or raise an issue on the list.

- Jim Whitehead
Chair, IETF WEBDAV Working Group
