It's not at all clear to me that one can do that:
Either you are allowed to put arbitrary XML in properties, or you are not.
If you are not, then that should be specified (and we could relax the
restrictions later). If you are, then servers must choose _some_
XML-preserving implementation (perhaps literal storage of the string, or
portions thereof).

One of the "properties of properies" is that people can make them up to
solve their representational problems, and so they need to know what the
syntax is).

Right, this is one of many. Jim's example about namespaces is another case:
and it's also a case where serer rewriting is _only_ appropriate if the
client and server are both assumed to have XML processors.

I don't think that XML data handling is so hard that restricting it is
worthwhile.

One table "other_attributes" with columns "attname", "elementreference" and
"value" will handle any number of arbitrary attributes, even in a
relational system.

Fortunately that's not _in_ the standard, is it? The standard defines a
protocol, not a data model. The protocol either allows XML properties, or
some undefined subset of them. The latter is bad (unless we define the
subset) and the former says nothing about how properties must be stored in
the engine.

That's fine, but if you're going to use the syntax, you need to say
something if parts of that syntax are potentially ignored by servers!

Frankly, accepting full XML properties seems like a no-brainer to me: the
parsers are small, and the data model is simple. (RDBMs are going to have
much more trouble handling nesting than they ever will with attributes).

This supports Jim Whitehead's assertion that there is no consensus, but
denies that this is acceptable. If we want to outlaw all attributes other
than a small fixed set, that is OK, though I'd be surprised if anyone can
present an argument as to how that makes a significant savings.
