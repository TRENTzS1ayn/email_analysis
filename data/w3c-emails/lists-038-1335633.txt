If I want to restrict access to my file server so that only "Paul Leach"
can read it, well, I probably am willing to accept that I can't authenticate
that it's really you, and not just someone who learned your password.
All information is authenticated only to a degree. It's a policy 
decision as to what information to trust in order to make access
decisions.

As for user perception of the complexity of booleans: we're talking
about the PROTOCOL here. Whether you let the user's see the booleans
directly or have some kind of check-box interactive display is an
interface issue.
