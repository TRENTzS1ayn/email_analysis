A little clarification here. I knew this was a sticky issue and is
obviously raising some good discussion, but my main question related to
the properties associated with the property-name elements, rather than
the internal markup.

If you want to use properties INSIDE, then I'd think that is fine. The
main question revolved around whether the attributes of a property-name
element are considered part of the value that must be persisted.

<prop>
  <propname>contents</propname>
</prop>

We save all attributes on markup within the "contents", but what about
attributes on the "propname" element?

So far, I've heard "implementation defined [since we'll omit it in the
spec]" (although I'm not sure I read EJW's response right), and that if
an xml:lang attribute is present, then it must be persisted.

There have also been some ruminations about namespace handling; in
particular, whether the server might rename the prefixes that are used.

IMO: only the contents and its markup are property values. Namespace
prefixes may be rewritten at will by the server (based on the
requirement that it is well-formed XML, then I believe we can assume it
is allowable to manipulate it as long as the well-formed-ness and
semantics are maintained). I don't know enough about xml:lang to
comment.
