Jim Davis is right -- my post should have mentioned explicitly that WebDAV
processors are expected to persistently store language tagging information
found in the xml:lang attribute.  I did not mean that the new requirement
added to section 12.13.2 on persistently storing xml:lang would be removed.

The xml:lang attribute also can profitably be manipulated to minimize the
amount of on-the-wire traffic.  If a property is submitted with the same
xml:lang attribute on every element, a server can quite reasonably replace
this with a single xml:lang attribute on the enclosing element, in this case
the <{propname}> element.

There are several cases where the server must rename the prefixes in order
to guarantee uniqueness.  For example, if I use a PROPPATCH method
invocation to set property A, with prefix P="http://foo.org/" and then
another PROPPATCH to set property B, with prefix P="http://bar.org/", then
use PROPFIND to request properties A and B, the reponse will have to change
1 or both of the prefixes for these properties.  The server has to act to
ensure the prefixes are unique in the XML stream.

I think it makes a lot of sense to allow xml:lang to be set on the
<{propname}> element, since many properties will be uniform in their
language and charset, and requiring either the addition of extra elements,
or duplicating xml:lang attributes seem like undesirable solutions.
