Mark,

Obviously it is going to take some time to respond to your massive set of
comments.  However, given that this WG last call was made so that WG members
could examine the changes made going from the -08 to -09 revision, and since
many, many of your "objection" comments are criticisms of design choices
made long ago (in some case over a year ago), or ask that design decisions
be explained in the text, please don't be surprised if you get many answers
along the lines of "thank you for your comment, the spec. stands as-is."

In fact, for the type of comments you're making, the last call for comments
was January-March, 1998.  We held two 3.5 week long WG last calls, and then
held another 2 week IETF-wide last call.  This spec. wasn't a secret, and we
went out of our way to solicit comments.

The rough consensus of a working group of ~300 people begs to differ.

This is why your comments will be examined.

Nevertheless, empirically this specification has formed the basis for
interoperability between client-server pairs implemented to it.
