I have never understood your position that collections are not compound
documents.  Collections can be used for many different purposes, and one of
them could be the representation of compound documents if only we added
ordering to their capabilities.

In fact, they are ideal for representing compound documents, because the
main features of compound documents are:

1. You can manipulate the document as a whole
2. You can manipulate each of the component pieces independently
3. Several compound documents can share the same component pieces
