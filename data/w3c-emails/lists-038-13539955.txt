I'd like to make clear that the issue that worries me is not that we _must_
use exactly XML (or any other) semantics. But, we must define what a client
can count on a server to do when a property is submitted, and when it is
retrieved.

Any number of explicit solutions that I don't care for meet that standard.
Not defining this is a recipe for servers that corrupt property values, and
remove their utility as an extension mechanism, except for _exactly_ those
properties defined in the standard.

This seems to me to violate the point of the whole exercise.
