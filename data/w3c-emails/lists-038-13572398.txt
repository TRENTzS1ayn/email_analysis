This may be reasonable in some other context; but right now, it looks me,
like WEBDAV intends to treat dead properties as containers which can be set
to arbitrary (internationalized) string values, with no further knowledge
of data type and symantics.

Bringing in the "XML Data" datatypes you refer to would be a significant
change to WEBDAV.

Server's _don't_ always know what people know; that's what makes this an
interoperability minefield.

If one client assumes that properties are character by character the same,
and another client or server "knows" enough to transform them into
"equivalent" forms, you might get _some_ interoperability, but you might
also get strange things happening.
