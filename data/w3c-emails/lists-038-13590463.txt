I happen to agree with Albert Lunde and David Durand here, and have
interpreted the WebDAV drafts as having that meaning. Nowhere have I
read or have been lead to believe that a WebDAV server has semantics for
all properties that are placed into it. Nor that a server is free to
rewrite the content within a property value.

My initial question which created this thread was more about how far the
property value extended within the XML framework which carries it,
versus what the semantic nature of those properties are. Obviously,
people seem to have plenty to discuss on the latter :-).

Allowing a server to rewrite properties that it knows nothing about
would seem quite dangerous. I would much rather see the server reject
the unknown property, than to believe that I can store the property
without fear of losing my (application's) semantics on that property.

Cheers,
