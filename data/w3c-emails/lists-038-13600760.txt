I am assuming that whether the server knows the data type of a property is
a "contingent fact." Some some servers will know some properties and some
will not. Some servers could refuse to accept properties that they don't
know about.

However the standard leaves open the possiblity that some properties are
not manipulated by the server... That seems to me to be useful: I can't
imagine anyone creating any finite list of properties that would meet all
needs for all time -- therefore we need extensibility. Unless we state how
that extensibility works, we are in trouble, because then it can't be
safely applied.

Pragmatically, I think it's very clear that servers won't be omniscient
with respect to the properties set by clients -- and therefore, they need
to make some level of guarantee so that the client can express whatever it
needs, and get that back dependably.
