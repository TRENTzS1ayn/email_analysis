If we are to require that such schemas be used, then we can design the
protocol ont he assumption that they will be used. If not, we need to be
able to assume something about the properties. I suggest that the choice of
XML (and it's wide adoption by a host of data interchange groups) gives an
obvious choice of data types: that of the language we are using to express
them. The fact that most of the applications of XML that are in the news
right now were _not_ targets of the standard-writing effort are supporting
evidence that this is not a crippling decision.

WebDAV can express that the data represented by a property is the result of
processing that document, in accordance with the schemas associated with
the tags inside the property element.

This allows future use of RDF, or whatever comes down the pike, the use of
plain old DTDs for the conservatives among us, or the use of DTDless
tagsets with informal prose specifications by the adventurous among us. All
these communities are served by knowing what level of data is stored when
an XML property is transmitted.

We probably _do_ want to allow servers to strip comments, for instance. I
suggested James Clark's proposal because he has good judgement, and more
experience of SGML/XML parsing than anyone else I can think of.

The XML data model that scares people so much is strings with labelled
bracketing and attached lists of (property, value) pairs. It can be
_preserved_ by preserving the byte encoding of the data, if processing is
beyond the reach of a server.

It can be sliced, diced, searched and spliced by servers that _do_ parse
the data and _can_ store it.

Right. But this is possible if DAV servers preserve the semantics of
XML-expressed properties -- not if they allow arbitrary rewriting at the
whim of the server.

well-defined rewriting by the server need not be a problem, though of
course eliminating an XML distinction might compromise the ability to apply
some layered standard that uses that distinction.

Right, and it's why we shouldn't make cryptic decisions like using XML to
express properties, but not expressing how much of the XML semantics are
part of the "real" WebDAV property model (to be defined at some future
date). Standard layering works best when whole standards are applied, and
not some Frankenstein's patchwork of selected "good bits".

right. But the pieces that do come out need to be defined clearly enough
that implementing them today won't cause interoperability disasters
tomorrow.
