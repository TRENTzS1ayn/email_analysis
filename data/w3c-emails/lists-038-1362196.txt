What happens if you DELETE a compound document on a server which models
compound documents as a collection but does not support TREE methods?
That is why modeling compound documents as a collection is just wrong.

Simply PUT the document to the server. If the server understands the
structure of the compound document then INDEX will work on the document.
You can even PUT into its namespace to add members. At that point you
add headers to specify ordering information. This works on ALL DAV
servers, does not require support of TREE methods, fully supports
ordering, and doesn't require we change a line of the DAV spec.
