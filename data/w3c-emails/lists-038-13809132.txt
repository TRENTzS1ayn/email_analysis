In addition to the recommended changes for addressing the URI to resource
mapping issue, there are some additional, minor changes that have been made
to the -09 specification.  These changes are editorial, with one exception.

The list below gives the mnemonic name of the change, the type of change
(editorial or functional change), a brief description of the problem with
the change made listed in brackets [], and a reference to a list message
which raised the issue, if one exists.


RDF_NAMEEditorial

Discussion of RDF in section 4.2 incorrectly calls RDF the Resource
Definition Framework.

--------------------

REFSEditorial

There are two references to [Lagoze, 1996], yet this reference is not in the
references section. There are also two references to [Fielding et al., 1996]
which should be [RFC2068]. Section 24.4.3 references [RFC2141] yet this
isn't in the references section.
[Changed [Lagoze, 1996] to [WC] and added a reference for it in the
References section. Changed references to [Fielding et al., 1996] to
[RFC2068]. Added reference to RFC 2141 in references section.]

None.

--------------------

UUID_NOT_GUIDEditorial

The ISO RPC specification uses the term UUID, not GUID.
[Changed all GUID to UUID.]

None.

--------------------

XML_MIMEChange

XML can be transported using text/xml and application/xml MIME types.  DAV
applications must be able to accept either.
[Added new requirement to section 14: " Since XML can be transported as
text/xml or application/xml, a DAV server MUST accept DAV method requests
with XML parameters transported as either text/xml or application/xml, and
DAV client MUST accept XML responses using either text/xml or
application/xml."]

That's all.
