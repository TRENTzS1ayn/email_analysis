I can see what you mean, but it isn't what the spec says. The spec
says it's a constraint between "collection" and "internal member".

But you're saying that a "collection" as a resource will have different
"internal member"s (as URIs) depending on the URI with which the collection
is referenced.

Frankly, you'd probably be better off if you defined "internal member"
as a resource, not as a URI, and then note that the internal member
must be accessible using a URL that is a direct relative URL of whatever
resource used to access the collection.

You'd also be better of saying that an 'internal member' can only
occur twice, that is, if http://host/coll/ is the collection and
http://host/coll/mem and http://host/coll/MEM are both URIs of the
same resource, that the resource is a member only once.
