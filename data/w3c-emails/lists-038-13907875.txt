A URL is a kind of URI. Normally we talk about URIs in WebDAV,
because the use isn't restricted. However, there is a controversy
around the use of relative links with URIs that aren't URLs.
So, when talking about relative links, I slip into using "URL"
instead of "URI". For the purposes of WebDAV, the two terms are
interchangable.
