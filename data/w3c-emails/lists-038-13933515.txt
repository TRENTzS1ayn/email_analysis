This is mainly an editorial issue; the use of "URI" vs "URL" in the
current draft is, actually, pretty sloppy. There are some places
where "URL" is most appropriate since what is being discussed is
the "location" of the resource, and others where "URI" is more
appropriate, because any kind of resource identifier would work.
However, draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09.txt is pretty inconsistent.
