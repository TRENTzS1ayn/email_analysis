New versions of the Advanced Collections Requirements and the Advanced
Collections Protocol Specification have been posted on Internet Drafts.  

ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-03.txt

Here is a summary of changes from the previous versions.

Changes to Requirements:

1. New "direct reference" and "redirect reference" terminology is used.
2. Deleted the requirement that references be resources.  Issues about
whether references can have properties and about what methods can be applied
to references are addressed in other requirements.
3. Added 3.1.4 It is possible to set and retrieve the properties of a
reference, distinct from those of its target.
4. Added 3.1.6 For any target resource, it is possible to request a list of
the references to it.
5. Added 3.1.12 For any target resource, it is possible to discover what
collections contain it by reference.
6. Added 3.1.19 When creating a direct reference, it is possible to request
that the location of its target be hidden.
7. Added 3.1.21 It is possible when creating a reference to request that the
server not enforce referential integrity for that reference.

Changes to Protocol Specification

1. New "direct reference" and "redirect reference" terminology is used.
2. Added support for direct references (significant changes throughout
Section 3).
3. Added 3.11 optional backpointers.
4. Added Hide-Target header.
5. Replaced Pass-Through header with Ref-Type header.
6. Added Re-Direct header.
7. Changed the values of the Ordered header and the DAV:orderingtype
property, and added recommendation that URI values of DAV:orderingtype *not*
be followed.
8. Changed ORDERPATCH to allow multiple changes in a single request.
9. Changed the mechanism for capability discovery to follow the model used
in versioning and DASL, rather than the one described in WebDAV.
10. Added security considerations.
11. Sorted out which referencing headers are required on which responses.
12. Revised status codes.
13. Added DTD.

Note that both documents assume that members of collections are resources,
that references are resources, and that the targets of references are
resources.
