Hi Jim,

You are right, this memo got a lot of mindshare. I guess the best way to
show that WebDav is not so complex is to use is to show what it is and make
it public (yes guys PR is useful).

To all participant. We are currently writting a WebDav client on different
platforms, on of them is obviously Windows (you know, even if they play hard
with everybody they still have the desktop monopoly - I guess you
understand) the second one will be Linux (with a new resource browsing
tool). To test our work, we need a WebDav server. Is the Appache server the
only one? If anybody is working on a server, we may cooperate by doing cross
testing sessions (test the server with our client and the client tested with
the server). If you already have a running server, you can e-mail me to set
how we can exchange testing results and a DNS or IP address to reach the
server.

Of course, doing a concrete implementation helps to debug specs doesn't it?
So in the process, we'll give feedback to the group from the implementation
point of view.
