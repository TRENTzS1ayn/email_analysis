   Suppose I have two unrelated resources A and B, version graphs VA and
   VB, where A belongs to VA and B belongs to VB. Now, if I derive a
   version C from A and B, what happens ? C is inserted in both VA and VB
   and a new version graph VC containing C is created ? Since a resource
   can be in multiple version graphs, does exist a kind of a default
   version graph for a given resource ?

Good question.  Although allowing a revision to be in multiple
versioned resources is an explicit "nongoal" in the current WebDAV
"Versioning Goals" document (nongoal #1, in fact), this doesn't fully
address your question.  We should add a statement that "the
predecessors and sucessors of any revision of a versioned resource
must also be revisions of that versioned resource".  This is implicit
in the current draft of the proposed protocol (where the predecessors
and successors are specified in terms of revision-id's instead of URI's),
but it would be clearer if it were explicit in the "goals" document.

Cheers,
Geoff
