As a matter of public record, the next Versioning and Variant Authoring
Design Team meeting will be held December 2-3, 1998, in Beaverton, Oregon.
Brad Sergeant and Intersolv will be hosting this meeting.

The Versioning and Variant Authoring Design Team was convened to allow a
small group to gather and have high bandwidth discussions of design options
for versioning and variant authoring capability.  Note that decisions made
by the design team are always subject to approval by the main WebDAV WG
mailing list (w3c-dist-auth@w3.org), and the WebDAV WG is the final arbiter
of consensus on any drafts produced by the design team.

Current members of the design team are:

Jim Amsden (IBM)
Alan Babich (Filenet)
Geoff Clemm (Rational)
Bruce Cragun (Novell)
David Durand (Boston Univ./INSO)
Chris Kaler (Microsoft)
Sridhar Iyengar (Unisys)
Brad Sergeant (Intersolv)
John Stracke (Netscape)
Jim Whitehead (UC Irvine)

Note that discussions of versioning have been taking place on the mailing
list ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org, which can be joined by sending a message
with Subject: subscribe to ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org   This mailing
list is open to all who wish to subscribe, and has public archives available
