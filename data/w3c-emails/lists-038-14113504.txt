Urk! That wasn't what I was complaining about. The requirement I
don't understand is the requirement that a resource not appear
twice in a collection. I don't understand the reason for the requirement.
If I understood the reason for the requirement, then I might know
why it should be OK for the same 'resource' to appear in a collection
twice if that resource is named with different URLs.
