OK, but from a protocol standpoint, there is no way to talk about resources
without using identifiers (URLs).  As a result, I cannot see how to
meaningfully discuss the membership of a collection without using URLs.

But PROPFIND returns a URL, identifying the resource on which properties are
defined.  The requirement would have to be written "any URL which identifies
R will no longer be seen in the result set".

OK, to make sure I understand, this is an argument against strict
consistency for DAV resources, right?
