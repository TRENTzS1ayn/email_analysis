It wouldn't mean you couldn't mention URLs, but just that you couldn't say
that URLs are members of collections, or design the protocol so that
anything depends on URL syntax for figuring out collection membership.  Now
that I sit down to look at it, I see that this would require changes to the
protocol, so never mind.  For example, MKCOL now determines the parent
collection as well as the name of the new collection from the request-URI.
And of course there would have to be a new method for navigating up.

Right.
