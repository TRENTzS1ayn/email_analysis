My understanding of the problems DocuShare was encountering was they were
using URLs similar to:

http://demo.opentext.com/livelink/livelink?func=doc.browse&nodeid=22278

For access to all of the content in their repository.  Presumably this was
because they employed an implementation strategy of using a single CGI which
acts as a gateway to the DMS.

But, according to RFC 2396, everything to the right of the "?" in a URI is
to be interpreted by the resource, which is identified by the text to the
left of the "?".  My interpretation of this is that there is a single CGI
resource which interprets the text to the right of the "?" as a query on a
DMS, and returns the desired document.

But, WebDAV assumes that if you're editing a resource, that each resource
has a URL.  This condition appears to be violated by the use of "?" in the
DMS query URLs, since there is really only one resource here, the CGI
resource.

To me, this suggests that a DMS which previously to employed a CGI script as
a gateway to the DMS will now also need to add a module which maps URLs to
DMS items.
