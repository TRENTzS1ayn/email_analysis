The DAV spec. follows the convention of the HTTP spec. for DELETE, which is
that DELETE doesn't just break the mapping between URL and resource, it also
deletes the resource as well.  As a result, it made sense, when extending
DELETE to collections, to delete all resources as well as breaking the
mapping between URLs and resources.
