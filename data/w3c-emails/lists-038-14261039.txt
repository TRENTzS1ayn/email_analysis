Actually, DocuShare would have no problem whatsoever, provided the WebDAV
server supports the advanced collection features that Judy has designed.
Since DocuShare controls the server, they can implement these features, if
they like.  This will suffice.  No client support of any kind is needed.
Even plain HTTP 1.1 clients will work.

One can make many criticisms of WebDAV, but it is false to say that it will
not support document management systems such as DocuShare.
