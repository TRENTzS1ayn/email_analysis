The basis for the decision was a recognition that the majority of clients
who were likely to use WebDAV needed guarantees of a hierarchical namespace
because they did not have the capability, nor did they wish to develop the
capability, to display non-hierarchical namespaces. Recognizing that
standards never lead but always follow, the WebDAV working group obtained
consensus on the design principal that WebDAV would require namespace
consistency in those parts of the namespace that only contained WebDAV
resources. 

A second argument in favor of this decision was the realization that meeting
Ted Hardy's design principal that "I won't execute a command unless I know
what the result will be" we would have had to muck up DAV with extra gunk to
allow clients to demand namespace consistency or have the method fail. This
caused interoperability issues since it meant that any arbitrary WebDAV
client would not be able to effectively interoperate with an arbitrary
WebDAV server since the majority of WebDAV clients would always demand
namespace consistency.

A third argument in favor of this decision was the realization that the
absence of the consistency requirement would have required the working group
to spend a bunch of time essentially inventing "search" to allow clients to
figure out exactly which resources in the namespace were WebDAV resources
since they couldn't count on enumerating the namespace from a known WebDAV
compliant root. While there is still such a requirement since WebDAV allows
fully mixed namespaces (that is, a WebDAV compliant resource can have a
non-WebDAV compliant child who can have a WebDAV compliant child) it was the
consensus of the working group that the consistency requirements as they
stood were sufficient to meet the majority need and thus additional
namespace enumeration features to map inconsistent namespace could be left
for later. 

Finally, as Judy recently reminded us, we would have had to add features
such as "declare your parent" for collections which had performance
ramifications that were unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of the
working group. These concerns are similar to the ones that lead to PROPFIND
instead of making properties into resources and requiring two round trip
value resolution.

Right.  But this is exactly the behavior that Roy was concerned with.  Do
you think WebDAV needs to require this constraint?
