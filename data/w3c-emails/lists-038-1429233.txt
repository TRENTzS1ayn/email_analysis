You are right that no security (or authentication) is perfect -- it's a
truism.

You are also right that whether or not to accept any particular level of
security is a matter of policy. For example, the IESG has made a policy
that it won't accept any new protocols that rely on weak authentication
mechanisms such as plaintext passwords -- and I would argue that this is
just as weak, and hence not allowed by that policy.

However, as I said before, this needn't violate the model of "principal
IDs".

If you can show me at least one UI design that hides this complexity,
I'll buy it. Until then, it will be true that I've never seen a UI that
can make anything simpler than the underlying intrinsic complexity --
it's the law of conservation of complexity.
