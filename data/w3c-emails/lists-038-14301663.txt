Hmmm. I thought RFC 2396 appears to be pretty clear on this point.  In
Section 3, "URI Syntactic Components", it states that the generic URI syntax
is:

     <scheme>://<authority><path>?<query>

Section 3.4, "Query Component", then states:

3.4. Query Component

   The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by
   the resource.

      query         = *uric

   Within a query component, the characters ";", "/", "?", ":", "@",
   "&", "=", "+", ",", and "$" are reserved.


This implies to me that if it is to be interpreted by the resource, it
cannot also be identifying that resource.  My rationale is the resource
needs to be identified first, before the query component can be passed to it
for interpretation, hence the query component cannot be part of the resource
identifier.
