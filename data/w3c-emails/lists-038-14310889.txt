Yes, I do still feel that deletion of the resource is the correct behavior.
The editors of the HTTP spec. were well aware that the URI to resource
mapping could be more than 1:1 when they wrote the language for DELETE for
individual resources.  I feel that if different semantics are desired, then
a different method should be defined -- perhaps one called UNMAP, which has
the semantics of removing the mapping between a URI and its resource,
leaving the resource unaffected.  But, I don't think such a method should be
introduced into the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol.

If you wish, you could write up an Internet-Draft describing this feature.
