I just noticed a few uses of single quotes rather than double quotes in
some of the examples. Specifically, Sections 8.9.6, 8.10.8, and 13.8.1
define namespaces as: xmlns:D='DAV'.

Also, at the end of 5.2, there are two property names with lower-cased
"DAV:" (dav:resourcetype and dav:collection). These should be
upper-case.

Separate note: the spec does not state whether a DAV server should
assume a default namespace of "DAV:" for namespace processing. Jim
Davis' server and mine seem to differ in this respect, so it might be
nice to make it explicit one way or another.

Cheers,
