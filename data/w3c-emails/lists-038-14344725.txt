According to the XML spec
(http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#charsets) use of single quotes
for attributes is fine.

[10]  AttValue ::=  '"' ([^<&"] | Reference)* '"'  
   |  "'" ([^<&'] | Reference)* "'" 

Other the other hand, the lowercased dav: sounds like a bug, since namespace
identifiers are case sensitive.

There is no default namespace without declaring one.

Again, all of these rules pretty much come from XML itself.

Thanks,

Alex
