RFC 2396 says it in an oblique way because that is a scheme-specific
definition and isn't universal for URI.  For http (and any URL coming
out of the WWW project), those two are the same resource.  It isn't
required by the protocol because it is an implementation requirement
on an HTTP origin server and only subject to interoperabilty issues
when a user agent uses some algorithm to derive an identifier
(there are many such algorithms).
