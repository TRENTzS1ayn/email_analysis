This seems to be fairly useful -- of course, the ACL protocol does allow for
extension of the access control rights by adding XML namespacse, if the WG
as a whole doesn't want to do "execute" rights.  Any other input on this
one?

Would it be a good idea to add 'execute' rights to the ACL protocol, to
indicate whether a principal is allowed to execute a resource (e.g.
CGI scripts).

Or should this be implemented as live properties? Seems more appropriate
in the ACL protocol to me.
