seem to imply that in order for DASL to be useful and effective, it must
support structured searches. If DASL doesn't XQL probably will. Also, the
content searches for HTML and XML documents would have to be structured to
be useful. So the same mechanism can be use to search structure properties
since they are XML elements (on the wire) too.
