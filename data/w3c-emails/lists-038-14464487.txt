I disagree with this statement.

DASL as currently specified supports all sorts of useful queries. There are
also some sorts of things that it can't do. Future versions SHOULD
incorporate technology such as XQL, XSL, etc, in order to provide more
sophisticated types of searches.

The fundamental issue is- Given the many sorts of useful queries that DASL
1.0 as currently published can support, do we really want to wait for the
W3C groups to solve the more complicated structured query problem, or should
we move our current simple syntax forward without adding extra complexity
and take advantage of our extensibility to do a 2.0 later once the various
X*L technologies are finished?

As an IETF activity, obviously we need the rough consensus of the community
to proceed with this decision, so I'd like to continue this discussion to
make sure as many people as possible are happy with this. Please let me know
what your concerns are.
