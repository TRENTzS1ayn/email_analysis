I am pleased to announce the results of interoperability testing between
the PARC Python WebDAV client and Greg Stein's Apache DAV module.

The client is a WebDAV client side library in Python.  Almost everything
worked perfectly. 

I report the following bugs, some of  which may actually be bugs in my
understanding of the protocol

1. mod_dav does not allow one to set the dav:getcontenttype property, or at
least the value one sets is ignored.  I created a file 
http://msdav.lyra.org/dav/foo.html and set the content type to text/plain.
But the server is returning a content type of text/html.

In my opinion, this should not be a read-only property.  After all, how
could a client set a property value for a type the server did not even know?

2. An attempt to set a read-only property such as DAV:creationdate returns
a 500.  It should return 409 conflict I think.  (see 7.2.1)

3. I was not able to set a property value that contained an attribute.  (At
least the xml:lang attribute should be supported)

Request:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<A:propertyupdate xmlns:A="DAV:">
  <A:set>
    <A:prop>
      <B:author xmlns:B="http://example.com/" xml:lang="nl">h van der
kaas</B:author>
    </A:prop>
  </A:set>
</A:propertyupdate>

Your browser sent a request that

An undefined namespace prefix was used.<P>

<ADDRESS>Apache/1.3.3 Server at kurgan.lyra.org Port 80</ADDRESS>

Other than these three errors, I was able to do PUT, MKCOL, DELETE,
PROPPATCH and PROPFIND to good effect.  Of course, mod_dav has no locking,
so I could not test that.

If someone will tell me where I can find an instance of the MS WebDAV
server I will test it, too.

Has anyone tried any other client with either the PARC or Apache DAV servers?

best regards

Jim
