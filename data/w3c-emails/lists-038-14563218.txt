This afternoon Jim Whitehead and I tried MSIE 5 with PyDAV.  I regret to
say that it didn't work, and we don't know why.  Perhaps someone from MS
can shed some light on it.  At present, we can't tell whether it's
deficiencies in PyDAV, relative misinterpretations, or bugs in MSIE.

All we know is that MSIE didn't successfully connect.  it did not utter any
diagnostic or complaint.  on the PyDAV side, we see in the logs that MSIE
did am OPTIONS, followed by a GET, then a POST, then said nothing else.

PyDAV does not support POST.

Note that an earlier version of PyDAV responded to POST with status 500,
which is not the right way to show that POST is not supported.  It now
returns 501.

Here's the log trace.  Note that all the headers are coerced to upper case
in the log.  Comments in between request/response pairs are mine.

[Does MSIE inspect either the Public or the Allow header?  PyDAV returns
Allow, but not Public.  I modified it to also return Public, but that did
not change things any.]

[Note that the only mime type in ACCEPT is auth/sicily.  As it happens,
PyDAV ignores the Accept header anyway, but if it did try to obey it, it's
not clear how it could have returned a resource of type 'auth/sicily'.
Besides that, what is "sicilian" authorization?  A request you can't say
"no" to?  :-)]
