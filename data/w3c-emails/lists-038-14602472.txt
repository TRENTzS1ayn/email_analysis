mod_dav will return a 404 on the POST, which (I presume) allows IE5 to
proceed further. I saw the same OPTIONS, GET, then POST. After the POST
fails, then IE will issue an OPTIONS followed by a PROPFIND. *then* it
goes belly up :-)  (well, just sits there with a dialog open)

I've already traded a couple rounds of email with the IE5 team. They
were quite helpful and pointed out a couple problems in mod_dav that
have been corrected in the 0.9.2 release. They've run some tests against
the new release, but I haven't heard any feedback yet.

For now, I'm assuming they're correcting some issues on their side, then
we get to do another round :-)

Sicily was the code name for Distributed Password Authentication (DPA).
DPA is the primary authentication mechanism used by the Microsoft
Membership System (part of MCIS and Site Server). Basically, it is an
enterprise-scale authentication/authorization system for Internet sites
(e.g. MSN and Compuserve).

See if you can return a 404 as a temporary hack and whether that gets
IE5 further along. It would appear that IE5 may have a logic error in
that a 5xx error affects the process (a guess based on the processing
after my 404 return vs. your 501).
