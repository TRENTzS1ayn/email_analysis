I've been concentrating on the WebDAV spec and am not as fully versed
with XML as I should be. There have been a couple other XML issues that
I missed (e.g. can the server imply a default namespace, or must the
client always specify it explicitly, and the single vs double quote
issue).

Thanx :-) ... the issue is that a WebDAV implementor also needs to be
*fully* versed in the XML specification(s). I'd also state that you must
be intimately familiar with the HTTP/1.1 spec and the URL
specifications. It is quite a pile of stuff to grok and pull together in
your head :-)

Not from me, although I think it could be useful to add a section on the
Working Group home page that details the other RFCs and Drafts that a
person should be familiar with. (i.e. pull out the references section
and list them as "required reading" on the WG page)
