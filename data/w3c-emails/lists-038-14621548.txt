BTW Greg's point is one that has been giving a lot of us some pause. You
really do have to know way the hell too much to implement these systems.
XML+HTTP 1.1+URL and then you can go do WebDAV. Ick....

A couple of folks in the IETF have been looking at coming out with a
re-written version of the HTTP spec. It would, of course, be non-normative.
The current spec bundles together a lot of features that are not necessarily
related. We figure we could write a spec on the absolute minimally compliant
HTTP/1.1 server in about 10 pages. Client is a bit harder because caching is
something of a nightmare. All though I bet we could identify the 90% useful
features in a page or two and just leave out the rest. I think this
simplification would be really useful but obviously it requires time. I
can't speak for the rest of humanity but I for one have absolutely zero
cycles at the moment.

URLs are just... well...evil. The spec seems soooooo simple. The code you
actually need to implement it however has taken use several years and
thousands of test cases to develop and as I'm sure Larry will point out
about 3 seconds after he gets this e-mail, we are still buggy as hell.

As for XML.... well... as momma says, if you don't have anything good to
say....

I've been concentrating on the WebDAV spec and am not as fully versed
with XML as I should be. There have been a couple other XML issues that
I missed (e.g. can the server imply a default namespace, or must the
client always specify it explicitly, and the single vs double quote
issue).

Thanx :-) ... the issue is that a WebDAV implementor also needs to be
*fully* versed in the XML specification(s). I'd also state that you must
be intimately familiar with the HTTP/1.1 spec and the URL
specifications. It is quite a pile of stuff to grok and pull together in
your head :-)

Not from me, although I think it could be useful to add a section on the
Working Group home page that details the other RFCs and Drafts that a
person should be familiar with. (i.e. pull out the references section
and list them as "required reading" on the WG page)
