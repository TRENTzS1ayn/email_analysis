Several people seem to have trying to test against the server on
http://sandbox.xerox.com:80 this morning.  I regret that I installed broken
code at about 9:30 am PST and just now fixed it.  So if you were testing
this morning and got bad results, please try again.

Also, the server now supports the xml:lang attribute.  (Adding this support
is what broke the server for a few hours.  Sorry about that.)

I'm still hoping to figure out why MSIE 5 does not work with PyDAV.

Is anyone else working on a WebDAV *client*?  

Jim
