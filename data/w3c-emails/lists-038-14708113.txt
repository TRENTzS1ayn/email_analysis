Subject: [Moderator Action] C/C++ implementations of XML?


I'm in the process of putting together a WebDAV implementation for
the next version of Glyphica's InfoPortal software, and have been
hunting the Web for XML implementations for C and C++ to evaluate.  I've 
found plenty for Java, but the only C/C++ implementations that
I've discovered are expat (at http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html )
and LT XML ( http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/xml/ ), neither of which
explicitly deal in namespaces.  Are there any other implementations out
there?
