There was work done in this area to support the use of the range header and
the LOCK method. However just trying to support byte range locks turned into
a bottomless pit. What was worse was that we quickly figured out that byte
range locks wouldn't be sufficient. As such the group wisely decided to skip
this rat hole.

There is no way to do this in DAV today. In the future I expect that DAV
will be able to accomodate looking at a single document as a collection, in
which case you might be able to support locking individual parts.
