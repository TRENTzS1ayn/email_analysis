The Advanced Collections breakout session at the Chicago IETF was very
productive, very worthy of a successor.  I am organizing a breakout session
at the Orlando IETF for Advanced Collections.  This is not an official
meeting of the WebDAV working group, and all decisions made during the
breakout session are subject to approval by the list.  At present, a good
time for this session is Tuesday, from 13:00 to 15:15.  Applications area
meetings which conflict are NNTPEXT (13:00), and LASER (14:15).

What: Advanced Collections breakout session
When: Tuesday, December 8, 1998, 13:00-15:15
Where: TBD -- look for email, or posting on the message board, or me
Why: Discuss open issues in the advanced collections requirements and
protocol spec.
