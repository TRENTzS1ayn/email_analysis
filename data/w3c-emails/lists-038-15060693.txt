What I believe we have specified to date is that there are "conceptually"
two graphs.  There is a graph that the server maintains and asserts is
correct and there is a graph that is specified by the client that may be
incorrect.  The former is created by checkin/out operations and the later
using the "Merged-From" header/property.  My assumption is that in your
example, you would checkout B and merge the changes from A to created B'
which you call C.  (or vice-versa).  The client would specify that B' is
derived from A and B.  The server would track this as a new revision of B.

   From: "Bruno C. Muniz" <muniz@inf.puc-rio.br>

   Suppose I have two unrelated resources A and B, version
graphs VA and
   VB, where A belongs to VA and B belongs to VB. Now, if I
derive a
   version C from A and B, what happens ? C is inserted in
both VA and VB
   and a new version graph VC containing C is created ?
Since a resource
   can be in multiple version graphs, does exist a kind of a
default
   version graph for a given resource ?

Good question.  Although allowing a revision to be in
multiple
versioned resources is an explicit "nongoal" in the current
WebDAV
"Versioning Goals" document (nongoal #1, in fact), this
doesn't fully
address your question.  We should add a statement that "the
predecessors and sucessors of any revision of a versioned
resource
must also be revisions of that versioned resource".  This is
implicit
in the current draft of the proposed protocol (where the
predecessors
and successors are specified in terms of revision-id's
instead of URI's),
but it would be clearer if it were explicit in the "goals"
document.

Cheers,
Geoff
