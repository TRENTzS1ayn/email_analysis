I guess I think of it a little different.  There is an "un-modifiable" list
and a "modifiable" one.  The first is managed by the server and represents
what the server knows to be correct.  The second is managed by the user and
could be totally wrong.  

I think both of our points are valid and true and that we are essentially
saying the same thing.

Cheers,
Chris

   What I believe we have specified to date is that there
are "conceptually"
   two revision graphs.  There is a graph that the server
maintains and
   asserts is correct and there is a graph that is specified
by the client
   that may be incorrect.

I disagree.  It is not an issue of correctness or
incorrectness, but
rather an issue of modifiable and non-modifiable predecessor
relations.  The reason to maintain a tree of non-modifiable
predecessor relations is just a recognition of the fact that
many
implementations of branching and delta storage make it very
expensive
or even impossible to move a version from one branch to
another.
Logically, the predecessor in this tree is no more "correct"
than
the modifiable predecessors created by the MERGE method.

Cheers,
Geoff
