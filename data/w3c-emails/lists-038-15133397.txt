'namespace consistency requirement' is perhaps misnamed, it's
a 'namespace hierarchy requirement'.

The 'optional backpointers' discussion in advanced collections
seems to have some interdependence with this issue; it might
do well to handle old business before new.

Is there room on the agenda to discuss the procedural issues
around revising the document before Draft Standard?

In particular, some of the issues that are 'too late' for Proposed
Standard might be addressed as you go to Draft, especially as they
are clarifications and fixes to address problems discovered while
attempting to build interoperable implementations.
