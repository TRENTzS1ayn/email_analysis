Or perhaps there are two issues here.  I'll put both names down on the final

Noted -- I'd like to leave the ordering as-is for now, though, unless it
becomes painfully obvious we can't make progress on backpointers without
addressing namespace hierarchy/consistency.  They seem to be somewhat
separable, at least in my mind.

I'll make some room.  I'm certainly very interested in working to make sure
that the Draft Standard revision clears up any known issues, especially
problems encountered while implementing the standard.
