The reason for 3.3.1 was strictly to keep MKREF analogous with PUT, but I
agree that this is not satisfactory if the resource that's being replaced is
a collection.  It also raises a sticky issue about whether MKREF on a direct
references gets passed through.  I like your suggestion that we just forbid
MKREF on an existing resource.  So that's what I'll do unless anyone
objects.

As I was looking through the spec for problems this change might cause, I
noticed another change that probably should be made.  In the section on
dangling direct references, I said that PUT, MKCOL, and MKREF should
succeed, but that really doesn't make sense.  PUT should succeed.  But MKCOL
and MKREF should fail, I think.  MKCOL would fail for a healthy direct
reference, and it would be odd if the fact that a reference was broken could
make it succeed.  The same holds for MKREF if it gets passed through; if it
doesn't get passed through, it should fail because it's being applied to an
existing resource.
