After hearing from some people that they are interested in having some
face-to-face discussions on access control at Orlando IETF, I am planning on
holding a breakout session on WebDAV Access Control Wednesday afternoon,
from 1530-1730 (opposite ldup, LDAP Duplication/Replication/Update Protocols
WG).  This is an unofficial meeting, and any decisions must be approved by
the mailing list, which is the sole arbiter of consensus on this, or any WG
proposal.

The location of the breakout will be sent out to the mailing list, and
posted on the message board at the meeting.

What: Access Control Breakout
When: Wednesday, December 9, 15:30-17:30
Where: TBD (look for announcement or post)
Why: discussion of access control for WebDAV
