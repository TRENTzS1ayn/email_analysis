These might better be considered client application responsibilities that
use the protocol to implement their own specific requirements and work
flow.

Subject:  Properties and enforceability




Is it possible to require certain properties be supplied when creating a
resource using WebDAV?  For instance, in a CM world, requiring that
every new source file revision have an accompanying comment.  Or in the
DMS world, that every document have an author and document type?  How do
you enforce this if it requires a PROPPATCH that is separate from the
PUT or CHECKIN?
