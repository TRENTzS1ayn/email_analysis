Random thought: there is a weird correlation here between this
No-Passthrough header and the "source link". For example, could
No-Passthrough potentially be used to grab an ASP file rather than its
execution result?

Just popped into my head, so I thought I'd mention it. The source link
does seem a bit nicer for security issues (because you secure based on
URL rather than the presence of a header), but No-Passthrough seems
handier for grabbing source (text or binary).
