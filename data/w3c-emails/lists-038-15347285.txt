WebDAV Working Group -- December 10, 1998
=========================================

The WebDAV WG met on Thursday, December 10, 1998, from 1300-1500, with 42
people in attendance.  Three main topics were discussed: advanced
collections goals and protocol (<draft-ietf-webdav-collection-protocol-02>
and <draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-03>), versioning
(<draft-ietf-webdav-versioning-00>), and issues from the distributed
authoring protocol (<draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-10>).  There was a brief
discussion at the end of the meeting on additional properties (draft was not
submitted in time for the meeting). Prior to the main meeting, two informal
breakout sessions were held on the topics of Access Control and Advanced
Collections.

Judith Slein led discussion on Advanced Collections, discussing the issues:
 - What mechanism should be used to disable the referential capabilities of
reference resources
 - Optional backpointers
 - Enforcement of referential integrity

Geoff Clemm led discussion on versioning.  A versioning goals document will
be out soon. During the meeting these issues were discussed:
 - Data model for a versioned resource
 - Whether checked-in resources are mutable/immutable
 - Semantics of checkout
 - Use of lock as a mechanism for checkout

Jim Whitehead led discussion of the following issues from the distributed
authoring protocol document.
 - URI vs. URL distinction in draft
 - Storing attributes submitted in XML properties
 - Namespace consistency
