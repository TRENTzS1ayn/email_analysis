I was recently contacted by Peiya Liu, the standards section editor for IEEE
Multimedia magazine.  Peiya is interested in having an article on WebDAV
appear in a future issue -- hence my call for volunteers.

If you're interested in writing an article on WebDAV for IEEE Multimedia,
please send me an email at ejw@ics.uci.edu, and I'll tell you more details,
and put you in touch with Peiya Liu.
