I would like to schedule weekly conference calls on the advanced collections
specification, to try to move it along more quickly.  if you would like to
be a regular participant in these calls, please send me e-mail with
days/times that would work for you. Then we can try to find a meeting time
agreeable to all interested parties.

Thanks.
