There is no question that all of the functions backpointer provide are
desirable. However, support for referential integrity is required to
implement them. This is in general quite difficult to implement, especially
across servers and multiple repository managers in the same server. So it
will be hard for client applications to depend on them in any generally
way.

I continue to believe that this is functionality that should not be
included in this version of advanced collections. Any facility that raises
this much doubt or controversy should be deferred.
