1 The WebDAV Book of Why

V.Alpha - 12/27/98 9:54 PM

1.1 Introduction

Over the last few years I have answered a number of questions about the
history of the WebDAV standard as well as put out several position papers
regarding what I believe we did right and wrong in WebDAV. I have collected
here the ones I like best.

Nothing said here is official, binding, normative, a standard or
representative of working group consensus. The official history of the
working group is contained in the meeting minutes, the mailing list and the
untold drafts the working group produced. The final word on all standards
issues is the RFC and failing that, working group consensus.

As a side note, I have included a brilliant posting by Jim Whitehead on the
FORK mailing list regarding the levels of HTTP Nirvana. Well worth reading
for anyone interested in the POST vs. New Method debate.
