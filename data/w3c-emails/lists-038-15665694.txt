I'm suggesting that we declare client dependence on non-standard operational
live properties as "bad design" and declare such dependence as
non-conformant.

This will allow us to move forward carefully without large-scale
deployment of non-interoperable software which purports to be
"WebDAV" but in fact requires some dialect that isn't universally
understood.
