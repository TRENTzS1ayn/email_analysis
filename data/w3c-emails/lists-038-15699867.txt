Without addressing the epistemological issues you raise (between
"structural" and "real" metadata) it's not clear to me that the
DAV:resources (backpointer) property would be any more confusing to a
generic client than any other non-standard metadata property.  Suppose, for
example, one constructed a hypertext system of arguments, refutations, and
justifications, where resources stored the text and the argument structure
was represented as (link) properties.  While I am unsure whether a
(hypothetical) "RHET:refutes" property is 'real' or 'structural' metadata,
it seems reasonable to use WebDAV in this way.

But to a client ignorant of the RHET properties there is no important
differences between RHET:refutes and DAV:references.  Both contain a set of
DAV:href elements.

So please explain how DAV:references will confuse clients.

I believe you are mistaken.  The spec says "identicially behaving". 

Suppose resource R is a references to target T.  If you copy T to (new)
resource S, then there are no references whose target is S, so the
DAV:references property will be empty on S.  It's the same behavior as before.
So the COPY of T will succeed fine.

Or suppose you COPY resource R. This is just the same as if you had done a
second MKREF, and hence the DAV:resources property of S will now have a new
item.

It seems to me that either resource may copied without a problem.

Please explain how you think this is paradoxical, confusing, or impossible.

best regards

Jim
