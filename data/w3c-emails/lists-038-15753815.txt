Hello everyone!

     It's been a busy first week for the CyberTeams WebDAV test server,
with some excellent interoperability testing by Joe Orton with sitecopy.
That testing pointed out a couple of issues with our WebDAV support and
yesterday we updated our WebDAV test server to address those issues.

     That test server was not available during the past weekend, however.
The server was rebooted on Christmas Eve and since we hadn't yet set up our
WebDAV server to start automatically it remained down until Monday.  If any
of you tried to access our test server or request access to the server over
the weekend, I apologize for the inconvenience and ask that you give it
another try.

     To help share interoperability testing results among people using our
WebDAV test server, we have set up a new mailing list for discussing
testing results, suggestions, feedback, and ideas regarding our WebDAV
support.  The address for the new mailing list is
"webdav-list@cyberteams.com".  You can subscribe to the list when you sign
up for an account on our WebDAV test server by using a new checkbox on that
signup form.

Regards,

Randall Severy
