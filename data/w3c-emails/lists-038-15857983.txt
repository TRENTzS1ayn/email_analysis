While I deeply respect your intuition and judgement, I would rather see
someone propose an actual scenario that breaks.  Since we know the current
definition is no good, how could we be worse off?

Bear in mind, this problem could only arise when a resource is copied to a
location where some property are not live.  This has never happened yet,
because no WebDAV server in existance supports copying to a different
server.  So there can't be a compatibility issue with an existing
implementation.

How can you throw away all live properties without breaking locking?
