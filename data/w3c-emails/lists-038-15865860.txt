The topic of sharing interoperability results was discussed at the WebDAV
meeting at the IETF and the general consensus was that the WG would very
much like to encourage implementers to not set up separate mailing lists to
discuss the specifics of their interoperability tests. Rather the WG would
like to host these discussions on the main list.

The lessons CyberTeams is learning are most certainly of general benefit to
the community and thus merit their posting directly on the main WebDAV
mailing list.

As such I would like to ask CyberTeams to please consider directing people
to the main WebDAV mailing list for the purpose of discussing
interoperability and other protocol specific issues associated with
CyberTeams WebDAV implementation.

Thanks,
Yaron
