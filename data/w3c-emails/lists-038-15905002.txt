I get 404's from any DELETE's now (I can GET them, they are there).

MKCOL with non-existent parent collection returns 409 correctly now.
Successful MKCOL returns 200 OK, spec 8.3.2 indicates this should be 201
Created.

Successful PUT works now with correct status code.

PUT into a collection which doesn't exist returns 201 created, and is a
bit screwy:

PUT /joe/foo/bar

where foo doesn't exist creates /joe/foo as a non-collection resource and
plonks the entity body into it.

Happy new year,

joe
