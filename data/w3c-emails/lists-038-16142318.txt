Don't hold anything back, tell me what you *really* think about it :-)

One rationale is that the design group identified that this was a problem in
earlier versions of the XML Namespace specification, and developed a
mechanism for addressing the problem which worked, and would ensure
interoperability across the wire. There was a perception that this wasn't a
major problem, and that it was better to rapidly develop a mechanism that
worked, than to spend a lot of time on it.

Another rationale is that we wanted to stay true to the property model where
a property is a name, value pair, where the name is a URI, and the value is
a well-formed chunk of XML.  Viewing an XML namespace + element as a
namespace, element pair is different from saying they are concatenated, and
hence capable of forming a URI.  Since we wanted to marshall property names
using a namespace + element pair, the concatenation approach better
supported this marshalling.
