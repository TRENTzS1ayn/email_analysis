Probably.  Although, reflecting on it, I can't recall why these were made
SHOULDs, and not MUSTs.  I seem to recall a conversation where we felt some
embedded servers might not want to provide storage for these properties, but
this doesn't seem to be an especially strong rationale.

Well, I'm opposed to copying the requirement over (it leads to problems down
the road editing the requirements), but a cross-reference back to 6.6 seems
to be in order.
