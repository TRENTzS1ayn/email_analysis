A server could probably implement it by acting as a proxy.  (An optional
feature, like cross-server COPY.) Do we want to permit that? We'd probably have
to specify that the server would have to implement all the behavior which
HTTP/1.1 mandates for proxies (I seem to remember that there were some
difficulties in having a proxy that isn't); I'm not sufficiently familiar with
RFC-2068 to know if that's going to be possible on a per-resource basis.
