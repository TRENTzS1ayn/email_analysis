Radical proposal: the binding is truly a separate name for the same resource, and there is no discernable distinction between the two different names (just like a Unix hardlink).  Then the sequence "BIND A to B, UNBIND A" (or the other way around) would be equivalent to a MOVE.  In this case, it is clear that a LOCK on one name must lock all names, since they're all the same resource.
