I agree with John (and others). Collections are very powerful mechanism to
implement applications whose user accessible items are selected by their
attributes and not by their names. Messaging forums are one of the obvious
case of this sort of an application (some argue that file system like
hierarchical namespaces should have been implemented this way). When items
are selected by their attributes, for performance reasons, the servers would
like to maintain some order (i.e., index). Therefore, allowing the client to
discover the order is a very useful functionality. Allowing for this
functionality supports the need for application writers to develop
application that we have never imagined using DAV as the platform.
