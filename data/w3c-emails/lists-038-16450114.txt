I have a couple of questions about the consequences of interpreting DELETE
in advanced collections to mean remove the binding to the request-URI.

What do HTTP servers currently do when they get a DELETE request?  Remove
one binding or remove all bindings?

Would we be asking servers to keep track of which bindings were created with
BIND and which were created in some other way (say with PUT), and interpret
DELETE differently depending on how the binding was created?  Or are we
saying, any URI binding that claims to be compliant with Advanced
Collections (no matter how that URI binding was created) must interpret
DELETE as . . .

If we rework the definition of DELETE, what impact does this have on the
meaning of MOVE?
