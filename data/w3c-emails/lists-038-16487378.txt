mod_dav implements DELETE for Apache. There is an old mod_put that also
implements DELETE. In both cases, only a single binding is removed.

Depending on the link style, the other bindings may be dangling (a 404
will be returned, but the remaining garbage in the filesystem will cause
other effects like a PUT return 200 rather than 201). For a hard link,
the other bindings will operate normally.

Definitely. There is no way to back-trace a BIND (to deal properly with
them) without the server keeping track of all URIs that were created
with a BIND.

Depends on the reworking :-)  John Stracke had some good points here,
tho.
