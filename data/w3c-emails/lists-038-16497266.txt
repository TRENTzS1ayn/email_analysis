   I have a couple of questions about the consequences of interpreting DELETE
   in advanced collections to mean remove the binding to the request-URI.

   ...

   Would we be asking servers to keep track of which bindings were created with
   BIND and which were created in some other way (say with PUT), and interpret
   DELETE differently depending on how the binding was created?

The "BIND" proposal says that all internal members of an advanced
collection are bindings, whether they are created by PUT, BIND, COPY,
MOVE, or any other means.  So the semantics of DELETE on an internal
member of an advanced collection would not be dependent on how that
member was created.

   Or are we
   saying, any URI binding that claims to be compliant with Advanced
   Collections (no matter how that URI binding was created) must interpret
   DELETE as . . .

Yes.

   If we rework the definition of DELETE, what impact does this have on the
   meaning of MOVE?

I don't see any significant impact.  The critical change for MOVE is
that bindings let us state explicitly what is the "fixup" stage after
the COPY and before the DELETE.

Cheers,
Geoff
