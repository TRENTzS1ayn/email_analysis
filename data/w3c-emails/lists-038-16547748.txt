Mmm, but this approach requires the server to know that it's being a message
forum; it has to include code to render these ordered collections.  A
general-purpose sorting facility would allow clients to store their messages, set
the Date/Author/Thread properties (OK, so Thread is tricky :-), and have the
server sort by specified properties; this could be done with any server that
supported server-ordered collections.

Assuming the human speaks English.  Anyway, I wasn't intending that the sorting
mechanism be exposed to the user; you'd click on a sort criterion and see your
messages get reordered, much as in an ordinary mailer.

On the other hand, if this functionality can be done with DASL, perhaps it should
be.  (A nice DASL extension might be a way for the client to tell the server, "I
expect to make this query frequently; you might want to keep an index for it.")
