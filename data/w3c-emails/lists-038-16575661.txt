(This is exactly the same issue as the one Yaron raised earlier, about
whether creating a direct reference creates a forest of new references,
except expressed in terms of binding.)

Suppose you have two existing collections, C1, and C2, where C1 contains
C2, and the 
name bound to C1 is A/, and the name bound to C2 is A/B/, and that
collection C2 contains R.html.  Then we have the following mapping from
names to resources

URL            resource
A/               C1
A/B/            C2
A/B/R.html   R

Now suppose one binds the name X to C2

A/               C1
A/B/            C2
A/B/R.html   R
X/                C2

Does this also create a binding for X/R.html to R?

If Yes, does this impose an unreasonable storage burden on the server?
(Perhaps not.  The bindings for the "contents" of collection C2 are stored
with C2, not with the name X/)

if No, then what does a server do with X/R.html?
