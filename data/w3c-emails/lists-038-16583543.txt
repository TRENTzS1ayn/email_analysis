I think it has to--X is supposed to be indistinguishable from A, after all.
(If X/R.html didn't exist, then what would be the point of creating X?)

I don't think so.  It may have some performance penalties (having to
dereference the bindings for each parent collection), but i's a tradeoff.
People who don't like the performance don't have to use bindings.
