Concerning Jim's first point about it being just as easy for the client to sort as for the server:  I have two objections to that comment.

1. The server will often have indexes that allow it to get a sorted list without having to actually perform a sort.  The client won't have this ability.

2. If the server has such indexes, not only can it produce this sorted list faster than the client, but ALL clients can take advantage of this server-sort instead of every client having to come up with their own implementation.

True--either way, you're going to bring down the entire results of PROPFIND.

Absolutely.  :-)
