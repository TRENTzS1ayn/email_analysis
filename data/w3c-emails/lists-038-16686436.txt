I am unsure whether I understand your email.  Are you questioning the
requirement that PROPPATCH be atomic?  I do not recall the design rationale
-- perhaps it is in the WebDAV book of Why.  But in any case, one can't
argue against it on the basis of difficulty, since 
the PyDAV server implements PROPPATCH as atomic.

Apologies if I misunderstood you
