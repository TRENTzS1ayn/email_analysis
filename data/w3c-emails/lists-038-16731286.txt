mod_dav is going to have it RSN, too. Unfortunately, it is a bit
tougher... I don't have a nice transactional DB or an easy language such
as Python :-( ... (interesting note: both PyDAV and Zope are written
using Python(!)). Anyways, the work was started in 0.9.8 and rollback
should be implemented in mod_dav 0.9.9.
