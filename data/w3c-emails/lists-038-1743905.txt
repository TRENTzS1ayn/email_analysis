I have spent 50 minutes writing responses to this letter. Every one
comes out mean spirited. So I am going to make one point and then I am
going to steal a step from Larry Masinter.

Your cache implementation would not help improve performance because the
underlying storage, be it a file system, a database, whatever, is
usually accessible through multiple independent protocols. As such the
cache file would have to be revalidated upon every use, negating its
usefulness. There are additional problems, such as the relatively large
size of index, the cost of efficiently implementing the cache file (it
would effectively have to be a database), etc.

Now for a page from the Larry Masinter handbook of IETF discussion lists
- Please submit a draft proposing the alterations to the DAV protocol
you would like to see adopted. We are arguing in the air and there are
so many vague assertions being made that it is difficult to give
concrete responses.

Anyway, it is 1:30 in the morning and I am going to sleep. I will be
happy to continue to participate in this thread once a draft has been
submitted.

Good Night,
Yaron
