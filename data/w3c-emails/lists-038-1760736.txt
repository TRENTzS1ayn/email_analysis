I have what I hope is a set of simple questions.

Given: a typical webpage with text and inline graphics.

 Is it "a compound document" by default or must it be declared as such??
 Before anyone answers, let me further ask

a. suppose I want to edit/replace one of the graphics.  Under
    the WEBDAV protocol, do I request/lock just the graphic?

    a1.  If yes, does this also request/lock the document containing it?

    a2. If no, what happens when someone requests the enclosing doc?

b. suppose the graphic in question is referenced by more than one
document (like a background, or "line" glyph).  

    b1. Does my having "checked it out" affect requests to any or all
 of the documents which reference it?
