I dunno, Yaron... We have 3 document management systems around here,
with 2 on relational database systems and the 3rd (a Web system, our
"Corporate Technical Memory" you may have heard me talk (email?) about)
due to be switched mainly to a relational database system later this
quarter.

I don't really see the problem, as the actual file data should be able
to be cached (and I would think offhand the order should be too).  The
caching software would need to know that these documents have an order
to them.  You would likely need caching software specialized for DAV.

I look forward to it.
