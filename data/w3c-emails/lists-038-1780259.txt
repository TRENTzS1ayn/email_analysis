BTW we are also moving our repositories and other systems to RDBS.
Actually, getting the file system onto a DB has been a holy grail at MS
forever. I certainly don't want to stop what many of us see as the
inevitable outcome of this endeavor. More than that, we will be having a
WebDAV Search BOF at the December IETF where sort will be on the agenda.
I realize Jim was only asking for a single sort but a lot of folks need
arbitrary sort.

The reason for the fixation on file systems is that for some time to
come the majority of WebDAV servers are likely to be file system based.
As such we need to be sensitive to their needs and make sure we don't
craft a standard which is too onerous to implement. 

I think we need to keep the lesson of HTTP 1.0 in mind, it was, I
believe, such a success because it was so brain dead easy to implement.
I also think a lot about X500, which actually had a lot going for it,
but it was so mind blowingly complex that a very select group was
willing to implement it. It is all about finding the right balance. I
don't claim to know where that balance is, I can just do my best to
provide my opinion in the hopes of helping to find it.

I think that sorting is an important issue but it is one that I think is
more appropriately addressed in the WebDAV Search BOF than in the WebDAV
base spec. As the authors like to say "DAV is done when there is nothing
left to cut." =)
