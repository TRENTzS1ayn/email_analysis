Strange for someone who had been arguing for configurations which many of
you thought as esoteric - but I agree with Yaron. If simplicity and minimal
options are the goal, then compound document requirement is in variance of
those goals.

On the other hand, we could all agree to support PEP and then we have an
extensible way of adding anything we want to add ;-).
