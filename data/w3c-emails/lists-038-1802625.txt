I don't think DAV has any concept of "compound document".  There is nothing
to declare.   You might store the page and its graphics in a collection,
but that says nothing about the relationship amongst the pieces.  And it
has nothing to do with the topic of whether collections might have an
optional order.

As for your other questions, I am no expert but here's my answers.  If I am
wrong someone will correct me.

Yes.  No need to lock the others.

No.  If you lock a member, the other members remain unlocked.

Requests, as in GET?  The spec says that GET is entirely unaffected by
LOCK.  This should answer the remaining questions as well.
