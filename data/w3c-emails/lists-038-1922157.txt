A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV Tree Operations
Author(s): Y. Goland, S. Reddy
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-depth-01.txt
Pages: 10
Date: 11-Nov-97

   The WebDAV protocol specification [Goland et al., 1997] defines the
   DELETE, COPY and MOVE methods. However these methods have a scope of
   a single source resource. It is common for principals to wish to
   perform a DELETE, COPY or MOVE on a collection and all its internal
   members. This specification defines the DELETE-TREE, COPY-TREE and
   MOVE-TREE methods that perform the equivalent of DELETE, COPY and
   MOVE across a collection and all its progeny.

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-depth-01.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
