As a matter of public record, there will be a Design Team meeting held this 
Thursday and Friday, 11/20-11/21 at the offices of Netscape.  In attendance 
will be: Steve Carter, Asad Faizi, Del Jensen, Yaron Goland, Alex Hoppman, 
Howard Palmer, and Jim Whitehead.

Topics of discussion will be: access control, issues on the protocol draft, 
versioning.

The purpose of holding Design Team meetings is to have a *small* gathering 
of people to discuss design proposals which are then subject to review and 
modification by the mailing list, which is the sole authority which can 
determine "rough consensus" on a draft.
