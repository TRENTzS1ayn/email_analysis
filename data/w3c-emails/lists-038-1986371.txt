We are releasing to the public an alpha version of a cross platform
distributed version control and configuration management system built on top
of HTTP 1.1 (yes, the ugly way !!).  Those of you interested in distributed
version control where the service maintains the identity of documents as
documents move between clients and servers may want to download it and see
what it does.

Of course, you can also use it. The server currently runs on Linux and the
client runs on NT/Windows.
