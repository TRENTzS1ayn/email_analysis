I've been reviewing the collections section of the draft and have
a few questions:

What does this mean (from section 4.1)

                        "An internal member resource MUST have a URI that
     is immediately relative to the base URI of the collection, that is,
     a relative URI in which "../" is illegal, which MUST begin with "./"
     and which SHOULD contain a "/" at the end of the URI if the internal
     member resource is itself a collection.

     An external member resource MUST be an absolute URI that is not an
     internal URI.  Any given internal or external URI MUST only belong
     to the collection once, i.e., it is illegal to have multiple
     instances of the same URI in a collection.  Properties defined on
     collections behave exactly as do properties on non-collection
     resources."

Could you provide some examples. This sounds to me like internal members
of the collection must have a './' in the URI. Examples further on on 
the spec show that this is not the case. 

How are external members named? For example suppose I have a collection
called /collection1/ and it contains the external member /mydocs/foo.html.
How is this member addressed within the context of the collection, or is
it?

Steve
