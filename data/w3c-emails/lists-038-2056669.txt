New versions of the protocol draft and the access control requirements 
draft were submitted last week, and are now available as Internet Drafts.

Protocol Draft:

The protocol draft is now at revision level 05, and is available in ascii 
and HTML (thanks to Jim Davis) formats.

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-05.txt
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoco  
l-05.html

Access Control Requirements:

The access control requirements draft has been submitted as an internet 
draft for the first time, and is now available at:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-acreq-00.txt

These documents are also available off of the WebDAV home page, at:

As with all of the documents produced by this working group, your feedback 
is an essential part of moving these drafts from initial proposal to RFC. 
 Please submit your comments either to the list, or to the authors.
