Hyphenation? I'm sorry, I don't know what you are referring to. Could you
please provide an example?

opaquelocktoken - I believe section 5.3 addresses all of your concerns. I
repeat it here:

A lock token is a URI that identifies a particular lock.  A lock
token is returned by every successful LOCK operation in the lock-token
response header, and can also be discovered through lock discovery on a
resource.

Lock token URIs are required to be unique across all resources for
all time. This uniqueness constraint allows lock tokens to be submitted
across resources and servers without fear of confusion.

This specification provides a lock token URI scheme called
opaquelocktoken that meets the uniqueness requirements.  However resources
are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the uniqueness
requirements.

However, at the author's meeting, we discussed the problem with the GUID
draft having expired. Alex Hopmann will be writing up appropriate language.
Basically, however, opaquelocktoken is just one scheme, as specified above,
ANY scheme may be used, so long as it is unique across all resources for all
time. However the IESG gets unhappy when you make a requirement like that
without providing at least one mechanism that someone can use to meet the
requirement, hence the introduction of opaquelocktoken.
