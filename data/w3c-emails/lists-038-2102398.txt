Hi,

I have asked the W3C to revert this mailing list back to postings from 
members only.  I really do not wish to do this, but since we have received 
two spams in the past 24 hours, I find there is no other choice.  If you 
send email from a different address than you receive email for this list, 
please make sure you send your posts either from the list email address, or 
forward them to me, and I will post them for you.

- Jim
