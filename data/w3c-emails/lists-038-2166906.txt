To:"'WEBDAV WG'"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

In mid-September I posted a schedule for completion of the WebDAV protocol 
specification, which can be found in the archives at [1].  I am pleased to 
report that this working group is still on schedule.  At present, I feel 
very confident we will be able to hold a working group last call on the 
WebDAV protocol specification in early January.  This is the final action 
this working group takes prior to having a call for rough consensus, and 
then sending the draft off to the IESG for their review.

The current schedule is:

December 8-12, Washington, DC IETF
Resolve final issues
Informal poll to determine if we're close to consensus

Dec. 19
New draft (-06) incorporating feedback from December IETF meeting, and 
Design Team meeting.

Jan. 5
Start working group last call (a 3 week period)

Jan. 26
End working group last call

Jan. 30
New draft incorporating changes identified during the WG last call
Call for consensus

At this point, either iterate through another WG last call period, or
forward specification to the IESG.  Either way, the protocol specification
will be sent off to the IESG in February.
