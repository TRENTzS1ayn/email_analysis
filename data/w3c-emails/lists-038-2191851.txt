1. There is currently no way to get just a list of URLs without any
properties. As this information wouldn't even contain an indication if a
resource was an empty collection or a normal resource this wasn't considered
a compelling requirement.

2. You WILL get the href for every member, even if it doesn't have the
property you are looking for. This is a limited search so knowing that a
resource doesn't have a particular property is just as important as knowing
its value for resources that do. I will put in language to make this
clearer.
