This was an excellent summary, and I endorse it all, except for:

which I do not agree with.  I feel it would be nice, but it's not
necessary, by analogy with MKCOL on an ordinary collection.  No one has
claimed that "if you want to suport MKCOL, you need to allow the creation
of compound documents in one action".  It might be more efficient, but
surely it's not crucial?

I would be very supportive of efforts to define means of specifying initial
contents of collections, e.g. by MIME multipart bodies, or some set of
properties.

During the discussion I agreed to produce a formal specification for
ordered collections, which I will do in my next message.

Best regards

Jim
