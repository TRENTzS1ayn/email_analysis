The proposal to change the name of the these methods was put by me in
the last DAV Design meeting, and accepted graciously by fellow designers
from Microsoft, Novell, and our chair Jim Whitehead, with a an
undestanding that, in HTTP paradigm, method names are mere opaque tokens
and has no real meaning attached to them (case in point POST), and are
the most insignificant part of the design exercise, specially for those
who are "DOING THE RIGHT THING" by not implementing anything till the
spec finalizes.

It is not a technical issue, not even a matter of backwards
compatability for Netscape, since there are many ways to implement DAV
with or without names conflicting with previous versions of Netscape's
Web Publishing servers. It only makes it cleaner for people to implement
it both on the server and client sides, with almost no cost or impact to
WEBDAV design.

Having said that, the last thing Netscape wants to do is try to shove
anything down the throat of WEBDAV community. As much as I believe that
method names are completely insignificant, opaque tokens, with no real
meaning attached, if there is general dissent in WEBDAV community, I am
very much willing to withdraw my proposal. Believe me this will not make
or break Netscape.

As far as hitting the roof is concerned, I don't know about that. I
don't recall hitting the roof anytime Microsoft proposes changes to the
design which have far bigger impacts on WEBDAV than some method name
changes. Now,  when they start messing with the Java Virtual Machine!!!
that's when I hit the roof  (same to you Yaron)  ;-))
