Asad,

In the name of general dissent, I respectfully oppose a modification to the method names.  Changing the holy trinity of COPY, MOVE, and DELETE to DUPE, RENAME, and DELETE seems clusmy.  I also agree with Jim Davis that using RESERVE/UNRESERVE instead of LOCK/UNLOCK is semantically confusing.  I find no good reason to change the spec now in its latter stages simply to conform to some prototype Netscape extensions.  AOLPress and IIS have non-standard proprietary extensions as well but I don't think WebDAV should go out of its way to prevent method name collisions.  WebDAV already has enough to worry about by making sure its methods and status codes don't conflict with HTTP 1.1 (actually some status codes conflict but that's another email...).
