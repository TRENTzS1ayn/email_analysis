Mark,

Thank you for reading the specification, and for pointing out this status 
code conflict.  We based the status codes on the rev-00 version of the HTTP 
spec., and submitted our -05 specification before the rev-01 HTTP version 
was submitted. But, since obviously the HTTP working group has first dibs 
on the status code name space, we'll definitely have to change the status 
codes in the -06 revision of the WebDAV specification.

Also, I noticed that the PEP draft, which is being recommended for 
experimental, uses the 420 and 421 status codes, so we'll rewrite the draft 
around these as well.

Conflict"

Yeah, this is a bug -- it should be 409 Conflict.
