Jim,

Thank you for posting this proposal for ordered collection support in the 
WebDAV protocol.

While at first read, this proposal appears to adequately provide for 
ordered collections, I wonder about its hidden assumption: that one 
ordering for a collection is all you need.  I wonder whether it might be 
desirable to support multiple simultaneous orderings instead.

A brief sketch of how this could be accomplished is to have a predefined 
"ordering" property defined on a collection.  This property could then have 
multiple orderings defined within it.  A client which was interested in the 
ordering could read the "ordering" property, and then make use of one of 
the orderings in the property.  Each ordering could be supported by a 
different schema. Modifying the ordering is accomplished by modifying the 
property.

An example "ordering" property is:

<?XML:NAMESPACE HREF="http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/" AS="d"?>
<?XML:NAMESPACE HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/davprop/" AS="j"?>
<?XML:NAMESPACE HREF="http://www.parc.xeroc.com/davprop/" AS="x"?>
<d:ordering>
  <j:alphaorder>
     <d:href>http://foo.bar.com/collection/body.html</d:href>
     <d:href>http://foo.bar.com/collection/conclusion.html</d:href>
     <d:href>http://foo.bar.com/collection/intro.html</d:href>
  </j:alphaorder>

  <x:compound>
     <d:href>http://foo.bar.com/collection/intro.html</d:href>
     <d:href>http://foo.bar.com/collection/body.html</d:href>
     <d:href>http://foo.bar.com/collection/conclusion.html</d:href>
  </x:/compound>
</d:ordering>

This could also be accomplished using the RDF data model and XML 
representation.
