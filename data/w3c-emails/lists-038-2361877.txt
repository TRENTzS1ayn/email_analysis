For the applications that I am aware of, one ordering is indeed all that is
needed.  One example is scanning, where the page images of a document have
a natural order.  The WebDAV protocol would be more useful to a scanner if
it could guarantee that the server would preserve the order of page images
within a document.

I can imagine that there are other applications that could use multiple
orderings, although they don't come to mind now.  On the other hand, I
would be wary of introducing multiple orderings into WebDAV, for fear that
it would lead down a slippery slope, because the next logical thing to ask
for is sorting (by name, size, etc) and then after that, sortings that are
induced by invoking an arbitrary sorting predicate (specified by Java).>>

I agree with Jim that this may be a "slippery slope."  However, examples handily come to mind.  For example, consider a collection of images, where one might wish to establish metrics in both the spatial and frequency domains.  Some of these metrics might be highly idiosyncratic, perhaps based on different human perceptual models,  and it could be very important that one use the "foo" metric as opposed to the "bar" metric according to circumstance.
