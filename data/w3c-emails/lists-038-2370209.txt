Thanks to the hard work of Jose Kahan at the World Wide Web Consortium, the 
WebDAV mailing list archives are now available via FTP.  The archives are 
organized by month, and are gzip'ed mbox-format files.

The archives are available at:

   ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/ietf/w3c-dist-auth/

They are also mirrored in Europe at:

   ftp://ftp-eu.w3.org/pub/ietf/w3c-dist-auth/

This is a good opportunity for me to again publically thank the W3C for 
hosting the WebDAV WG mailing list -- given the number of people on the 
list (over 225 now) and the bursts of messages that sometimes fly on the 
list, this mailing list runs very well.

- Jim
