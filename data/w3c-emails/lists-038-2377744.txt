I hope we don't arbitrarily limit collections (such as the ordered
collection proposal under consideration does). Just as Xerox needs ordered
collections for compound documents we need a different type of ordered
collections for configurations and for alternates.

I like Jim's proposal (atleast conceptually) in this regard.
