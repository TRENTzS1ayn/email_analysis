Another way to support ordering (and other desirable features
as well) is to allow a specified set of properties to be
associated with all members of a particular collection.

One such property could be an index value which could be
used to determine the "order" of the collection.
(though, admittedly, inserting or deleting members would
be more cumbersome without special support)

Multiple properties allow multiple orderings.

Member properties would also add considerable value to
external references.  In particular, a name property
in conjunction with external references would yield the
equivalent of Unix (soft) links.
