In the DAV spec, the examples of XML all show the XML processing instruction
as 

<?XML version="1.0">

Shouldn't that be

<?XML version="1.0"?>

with a trailing question mark?

Reason I ask is that I'm actually trying the examples in the spec and get
an error with that processing instruction.  But it could be that my XML
parser is flaky -- it is not from any known-reliable source.
