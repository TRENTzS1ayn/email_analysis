These are all typos and nits.

8.1.1 example retrieving named properties.  Shouldn't the properties in the
Propfind header be written as empty tags?

8.1.2  example of allprop.  Shouldn't this return code 207 multistatus, not
200?

8.13.11 - example of multi-resource lock

the XML document in the request body is an <d:href> , but it should be
<d:owner>

in the Addlocks header, the hrefs of the second additional resource should
be written as an empty tag.  Also, the Addlock header is malformed, it
should have a colon not an equal sign.

The Timeout header here uses a comma to delimit list elements, but the
description of timeout header in 9.15 says to use a SP.  The example in
8.13.10 uses a semi-colon.  Let's pick one.

9.9 Lock Info request header syntax says that additional locks are passed
in the header, but this is not what 8.13.11 (multi-resource lock) shows.

Likewise, is Lock-Tree part of the Lock-Info header?

13.1 creationdate property.  This says the date and time must be given in
ISO 8601, and cites it, but it does not appear in the References.  (But
also, why use ISO 8601 instead of RFC 1123)

13.13: typo: "he have" should be "he has"

13.16.  supportedlock property: The Values description has "LockEntry" XML,
should be "lockentry"

13.16.4 Example of Propfind should use the Propfind header not the propfind
XML element, and hence there should be no Content-Length or Content-Type
headers either.
