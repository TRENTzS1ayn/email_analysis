For any serious document management application of WebDAV there is a need
for the documents to be well protected.  In addition, it is important to be
able bring forward the security models from existing or underlying products.
A simplistic security scheme would not meet these needs and would force us
to ignore or go outside those specified by WebDAV.  This would obviously
hurt the goal of interoperable WebDAV applications.
