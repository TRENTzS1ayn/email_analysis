Speaking for myself only, I don't agree.  I don't see the need for naming
or numbering external members (as opposed to ordering *all* members, which
I have argued for) and I also believe that external members are quite
useful even without any naming or numbering at all.  As evidence for the
latter, there is a Xerox product called DocuShare which is a Web-based
repository for documents.  In the DocuShare model, a "collection" (they
don't call them collections but that's okay) can store both external
members (URLs) and internal members.  There is no ordering or numbering.
(Everything has a name, it's true, but DAV already provides a name in the
form of the displayname property.)

So I must respectfully deny your assertion.  We need external members, and
we don't need numbering.  Removing external members would hurt, and I see
nothing to gain by holding out for "numbered" external members.
