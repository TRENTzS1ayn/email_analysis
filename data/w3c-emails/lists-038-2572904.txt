Ideally, we leverage everything possible from those ongoing efforts (
ZStarts, the LESSOR group, etc. ) and existing standards. DASL's goal is
to search (DAV) internet repositories, and I think that existing within
the DAV framework places constraints and requirements on the problem:
the resource model DAV defines (how it models collections in relation to
non-collection resources and properties), its use of arbitrary XML as
property values (opening up the potential for arbitrarily complex
values), variants, DAV's versioning model, DAVs use of namespaces for
property values, the relationship of the source link to resources being
searched, typing of values in XML etc.
