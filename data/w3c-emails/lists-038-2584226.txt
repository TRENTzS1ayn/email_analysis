Subject:[Spam?] RE: creationdate format

The ISO format provides a locale independent date time representation.
While ISO 8601 specifies various ways to describe dates, times and
combinations thereof, the AIIM DMA effort has utilized the following:

DMA utilizes a locale-independent date/time format. DMA clients are
expected to transform DMA date/time values into locale and platform
specific representations as required for user presentation. A
DmaDateTime is a specialization of a DmaString with the following syntax
derived from ISO 8601: 
YYYYMMDDThhmmss[,f]Z 
where: 
YYYY represents a four-digit year number according to
the Gregorian calendar
MM represents a two-digit month in the range 01-12
DD represents a two-digit day in the range 01-31
hh represents a two-digit hour in the range 00-23
mm represents a two-digit minute in the range 00-59
ss represents a two-digit second in the range 00-59
f represents decimal fractions of a second to arbitrary
precision 
The literal "T" separates the date and time components. The optional
literal "," (comma) separates the time and fractional seconds
components. The literal "Z" is mandatory and indicates that the time is
represented in Coordinated Universal Time (also known as UTC or GMT). 
Midnight is represented by a time (hhmmss) of 000000 and indicates the
start of the specified date. Applications desiring to store only dates
using DateTime properties should specify a time component of midnight.
