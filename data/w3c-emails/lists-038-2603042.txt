Can someone please describe some scenarios of use for ordered collections? 
 Not only will this be needed for the scenarios document, but it will help 
me shake the niggling feeling that we still don't have a solid rationale 
for inclusion of ordered collections capability.

I'd really like to be able to finish the sentence that begins:

  "The WebDAV protocol needs capability for ordered collections because 
..."

To date, the best rationale I've heard is:

The WebDAV protocol needs capability for ordered collections because it 
makes certain document management and versioning functions significantly 
easier to perform using the protocol.

If this is indeed true (and I suspect it is), then it should be easy to 
briefly describe one or two of these functions (and existing products which 
perform such functions). Jim, Mary, Ellis (others?) - care to take a stab 
at this?
