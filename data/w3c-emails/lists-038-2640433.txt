An example for ISO 8601 is

  1997-08-15T11:12:00-0400

More information can be found, for example, at
<http://www.netspot.unisa.edu.au/html/compendium/datetime.htm>.

BTW, PEP (HTTP extension draft) mentions WebDAV in
Section 17.1, "Client Queries Server for DAV" in
the draft-ietf-http-pep-05.txt (expired 21 Nov 97).
However, I could not find a link in the WebDAV drafts
or on the web site to PEP. Is PEP obsolete?

Yours,
