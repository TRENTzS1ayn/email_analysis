No, PEP is not obsolete.  At the Washington, DC IETF meeting, a movement 
was started to create a new HTTP Extensions (EXTEND) working group, whose 
chair is Josh Cohen, and whose document editor will be Scott Lawrence. 
 This working group is charged with further development of PEP, OPTIONS, 
and to creation of a draft which gives do's and don'ts for extending HTTP.

The HTTP Extensions group has a mailing list. To subscribe, send a mail 
containing the following:

To: ietf-http-ext-request@w3.org
Subject: subscribe

The group also has a web page:

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/ietf-ext-wg/

The WebDAV specification does not reference PEP for two reasons.  First, so 
far we haven't needed the capabilities PEP offers.  Second, PEP is 
currently not a stable enough document to reference from within a proposed 
specification. However, I can and will put a link from the WebDAV web site 
to the HTTP Extensions working group.
