Hi,

I am pleased to announce an upcoming WebDAV Working Group meeting on the 
topics of versioning, advanced collections, and access control, with a full 
day alloted to each topic. This meeting will allow us to make solid 
progress towards achieving our remaining goals in the WebDAV group. Over 
the coming weeks drafts on all of these topics will be released which will 
form the basis of discussion in June.

When: June 15-17, 1998
Where: Microsoft Campus, Redmond, Washington, USA

Many thanks to Yaron Goland and Microsoft for sponsoring this meeting.

I'll be posting details on how to register for this meeting, some local 
hotels, and directions in an upcoming message.

It's time to put the V back in WebDAV! :-)

- Jim
