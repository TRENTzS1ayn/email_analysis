lock_null_propWe need to clarify that lock-null resources must define all
mandatory properties

Another clarification is that a lock-null resource must return all the
mandatory DAV properties. The purpose is to make lock-null resources walk
and talk as closely as is reasonable to normal DAV resources, especially
because they appear in the collection namespace.

6.3Write Locks and Null Resources

It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order to
lock the name.

A write locked null resource, referred to as a lock-null resource,
MUST respond with a 404 Not Found or 405 Method Not Allowed to any HTTP/1.1
or DAV methods except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS, PROPFIND, LOCK, and UNLOCK.
A lock-null resource MUST appear as a member of its parent collection.
Additionally the lock-null resource MUST have defined on it all mandatory
DAV properties.  Most of these properties, such as all the get* properties,
will have no value as a lock-null resource does not support the GET method.
Lock-Null resources MUST have defined values for lockdiscovery and
supportedlock properties.

Until a method such as PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on the
lock-null resource the resource MUST stay in the lock-null state.  However,
once a PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on a lock-null resource the
resources ceases to be in the lock-null state.

If the resource is unlocked, for any reason, without a PUT, MKCOL,
or similar method having been successfully executed upon it then the
resource MUST return to the null state.
