To:"'WEBDAV WG'"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

A new version of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol document,
"Extensions for Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web -- WEBDAV," is
now available off the WebDAV home page:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/

This document is draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-08.txt, and is directly
available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoc  
ol-08.txt

This document has been submitted to the Internet Drafts editor, and should 
be appearing in the Internet-Drafts directory in the next 1-3 days.

I'd like to thank Yaron Goland and the members of the working group who 
sent us feedback during this second review period.  Your hard work is 
reflected in the draft.

A list of all changes made to the draft can be found at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/protocol-08-edits.html

I will place a nicely formatted version of the draft on the web site once 
it is available.

It is my opinion as Chair that this draft reflects the rough consensus of 
the working group.  Furthermore, since there are prototype implementations 
of this protocol on both client and server sides, this initial evidence 
indicates the protocol is technically sound.  Therefore, as previously 
announced 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JanMar/0284.html>, I 
will be sending this draft to the IESG for approval as a Proposed Standard. 
 This process is described in RFC 2026, "The Internet Standards Process -- 
Revision 3".

Chair, IETF WebDAV Working Group
