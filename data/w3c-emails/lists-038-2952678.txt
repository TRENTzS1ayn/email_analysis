FYI,

From now on, in the "Status of this Memo" section of Internet-Drafts, the 
section describing where to go to download the internet draft should now 
read as follows:

To view the entire list of current Internet-Drafts, please check
 the "1id-abstracts.txt" listing contained in the Internet-Drafts
 Shadow Directories on ftp.is.co.za (Africa), ftp.nordu.net
 (Northern Europe), ftp.nis.garr.it (Southern Europe), munnari.oz.au
 (Pacific Rim), ftp.ietf.org (US East Coast), or ftp.isi.edu
 (US West Coast).

The change is to replace ds.internic.net for US West Coast, and replace it 
with ftp.isi.edu. This is due to ds.internic.net no longer being in 
service.

- Jim
