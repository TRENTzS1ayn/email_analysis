Subject:[Spam?] pointers wanted

Hi Everybody,  I am doing a survey of systems that uses either WEBDAV,
TIP or any other protocol to do concurrency control on the web.  If you
happen to know of any such systems, say, the one you are developing,
would you please send me some pointers?

Thanks a bunch.

-Jack
