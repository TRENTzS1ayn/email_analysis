I agree with Judy, and would add only two things:

1) While it is true that "It would certainly be possible to construct the
two hierarchies you describe, which reference all of the same resources but
organize them in different ways" this would provide only static multiple
hierarchies.  You'd have to do additional work to ensure that any document
inserted into one hierarchy was also inserted into the proper place in any
others.  Such work falls outside the scope of WebDAV, however.  (Perhaps
the workflow concepts recently mentioned in passing in this list would be
useful though.  One might ask for a notification to be sent when a resource
was added to a collection, and then compute the other collections where it
should also be added.  Likewise for deletions.  But I digress.)

2) The most recent draft of DASL protocol does provide for orderings.  So
one could achieve the desired dynamic multiple hierarchies by varying the
sort parameters.  How do so such and still get good performance remains to
be seen.

Oh, I should also say that the dynamic multiple hierarchy scenario is a
very interesting and relevant one, and I am grateful to have such a clear
example of it.  I think it will be useful in the DASL work.

Best regards

Jim
