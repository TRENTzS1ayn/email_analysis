I believe this should not be published as an RFC until the "text/xml"
media type is registered with IANA according to the procedures in RFC
2048, section 2.1.1.

The is more than a simple procedural complaint because the security
considerations for text/xml need to be documented and the XML
specification is silent on the issue of security.

I have not reviewed the WEBDAV specification for other issues, but felt it
was important to raise this issue sooner rather than later so it causes
minimal delay.

[Note: I'm including w3c-dist-auth@w3.org, with the hope that someone
 there can adopt this as an action item.  I am not subscribed to that
 list.]
