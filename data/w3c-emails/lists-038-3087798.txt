Based on the minutes of the April 2 WebDAV meeting, it sounds as if there
needs to be more discussion of circular references in the context of the
advanced collections requirements.

Once we support referential members of collections, there is potential for
circular references unless we do something to prevent it.  Earlier DAV
drafts explicitly stated that servers are not required to detect circular
references.  It is probably unrealistic to expect a server to prevent
circular references, since references can cross servers.

What do people think?
