Title: Requirements for Event Notification Protocol
Author(s): M. Fisher, S. Reddy
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-enpreq-01.txt
Pages: 7
Date: 05-May-98

   This document describes the requirements for an Event Notification
   Protocol.  The objective is to provide a simple, scalable and highly
   efficient notification protocol while also providing the appropriate
   flexibility to meet the needs of both the Internet and enterprise
   environments. Intent of this document is to collect all notification
   requirements in one place and leverage the work already done in other
   working groups.
 
   This document is one of a set of documents which together describe
   all aspects of a new Event Notification Protocol (ENP). ENP is an
   application level protocol that can be used for distributed event
   notification. The full set of ENP documents include:

      (1). Requirements for Event Notification Protocol
 
      (2). Model and Semantics Event Notification Protocol
 
      (3). Protocol Specification for Event Notification Protocol
 
      (4). Rationale for the Structure and Model for the Event
           Notification Protocol

Send a message to:mailserv@ietf.org.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-enpreq-01.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
