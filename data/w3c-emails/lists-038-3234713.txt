WEBDAV TUTORIAL

A tutorial on the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol will be offered at
the Hypertext'98 Conference. Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine, and Josh Cohen,
Microsoft, will be the presenters for this half day tutorial.  Tutorials
will be held Sunday, June 21, at the Marriott City Center, Pittsburgh, PA.

Note that this is *not* an official meeting of the WebDAV WG, and no
official business will be conducted.  The tutorial offers an opportunity for
people to learn about the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol, and I
imagine people who are newcomers to WebDAV, or who are considering
implementations of WebDAV would find this tutorial to be of interest.

Since the tutorial is being held in conjunction with Hypertext'98, there is
a charge of USD$150 associated with the tutorial.  This fee is about an
order of magnitude smaller than equivalent commercial offerings.

The Hypertext'98 Conference is the premier academic conference for research
in hypermedia, and this is the ninth conference in the series, which started
in 1987.

(Note that at present, this lists the WebDAV tutorial as tentative -- this
is incorrect, and should be fixed shortly.)
