I've submitted a new draft of the collection requirements to
Internet-Drafts, so they should be available in a few days.

I made the following changes, mostly in response to Jim Whitehead's recent
comments:

1.  I added a paragraph discussing server-maintained vs. client-maintained
orderings, and stated explicitly that the requirements are only for
client-maintained orderings.

2.  I added a requirement (3.2.2) stating that collections are not required
to be ordered.

3.  I added a requirement (3.2.4) stating that each collection member must
appear in the ordering exactly once.  I added some text explaining the
implications of this for server behavior.

4.  I added a requirement (3.2.5) stating that orderings must not contain
resources that are not members of the collection, and again discussed the
implications of this for server behavior.

5.  I strengthened 3.2.6 to say that a server must return listings of
collection members in the order specified by the collection ordering.

6.  I added a requirement (3.1.15) stating that a referential member of a
collection is itself a resource.  I think this was already implied by the
requirement that referential members be able to carry their own properties,
but it needed to be made explicit.  As Jim noted, this has implications for
3.2.4.
