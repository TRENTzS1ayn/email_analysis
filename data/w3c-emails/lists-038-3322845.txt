Caught by the spam filter.  I have asked to have this email address for Mike
added to the accept list for the WebDAV list.

Subject: [Spam?] question on "charset"s


In IETF jargon, a "charset" encompases: (1) an abstract set of characters,
(2)
an association between numeric codes and abstract characters, and (3) a way
to
encode those numeric codes in byte sequences.  "Unicode" is about (1) and
(2),
and XML recognizes the need for (3) as well.  My question is this: does a
WebDAV server preserve (1), (2), and (3), or just (1) and (2)?  That is, if
I
write entity bodies or properties or other metadata in one particular
encoding,
are read operations required to return that content in the same encoding?
