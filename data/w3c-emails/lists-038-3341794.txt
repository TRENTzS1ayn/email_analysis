That's starting to answer the question for entities; HTTP/1.1 doesn't have
properties.

HTTP/1.1, at the start of section 9.6, says ``The PUT method requests that the
enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI''.  I'd say the most
natural interpretation of this is that the entity body be preserved
byte-for-byte.
