Section 14.2 of
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03.txt
defines the accept-charset header that allows charset negotiation. This
would apply to any method it is used with. Thus sending accept-charset with
a PROPFIND does cause negotiation over the charset used in the PROPFIND
response.

Section 15 of
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-08.txt
specifies that all DAV systems MUST support the charset requirements of XML.

Section 2.2 of http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#syntax specifies that all XML
systems MUST support UTF-8 and UTF-16.

Therefore you are guaranteed that that all DAV servers will be able to
accept properties in UTF-8 or UTF-16 and be able to return properties in one
of those two charsets.

I hope this clarifies matters,

Yaron
