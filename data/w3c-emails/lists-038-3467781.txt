No, it's probably not necessary, but might still be a good idea. The notion
of
a version could indicate that something changed in the in the meaning of the
resource, its semantics. Variants might be different views of the same
meaning
for different audiences. With XML, the content and views are separate
allowing
each to change independently, either with versions of variants.
