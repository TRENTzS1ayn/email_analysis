Jim,

Thank you for this information!  I've added it to the lodging information
page for the Redmond meeting, available off of:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/redmond/

I believe that all phone numbers in Redmond, Bellevue, and Kirkland are now
425 area code, rather than 206 area code.

- Jim
