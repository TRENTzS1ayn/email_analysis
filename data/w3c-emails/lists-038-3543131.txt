Yes, this is a mistake left over from an earlier draft.  Since 3.1 now says
that a referential member has no content, 3.5 needs to be changed to agree
with that.  The request to create a referential member puts the target's
URI in the Ref-Target header, so presumably the response to a GET would
have no entity body, but would include the Ref-Target header.
