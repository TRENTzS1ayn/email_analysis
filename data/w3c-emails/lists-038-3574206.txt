           Workshop on Internet-Scale Event Notification (WISEN)

                              July 13-14, 1998
                   McDonnell Douglas Auditorium, UC Irvine
                           Irvine, California USA
                     http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/wisen/



WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES & AGENDA

WISEN aims to gather participants from industry and academia who are working
on or researching event notification systems or protocols for use on the
Internet. Communities interested in notification such as web authoring,
instant messaging, buddy lists, workflow, and internet printing should find
this workshop highly relevant.

The goals of the workshop include developing a better understanding among
the different communities of interest, improved definition of requirements
for an event notification service, a better appreciation of the application
domains that will benefit from an event notification service, and
suggestions for fruitful research directions.

The first day will feature a single track of presentations from invited
speakers. The second day will feature presentations from invited speakers in
the morning, and parallel breakout sessions in the afternoon. The workshop
will end with participants gathering for a summary of the breakout sessions.

Breakout sessions are currently planned on the topics of:

   * What are the requirements for internet scale event notifications?
   * What set of technologies can be leveraged to create an internet-scale
     notification service?
   * What are the scaling factors for internet event notifications?
   * What applications most benefit from an internet notification service?
   * What are the security considerations for notifications?
