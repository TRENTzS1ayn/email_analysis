Title: WebDAV Advanced Collections Protocol
Author(s): J. Slein
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-collection-protocol-00.txt
Pages: 11
Date: 03-Jun-98

        The base WebDAV protocol [Goland et al., 1998] provides basic
        support for collections.  It defines a MKCOL method for creating
        collections and specifies how other HTTP and WebDAV methods
        interact with collections.  It supports only internal members of
        collections, which it defines as members whose URIs are
        immediately relative to the URI of the collection.
 
        Many applications, however, need more powerful collections.  There
        are two areas in particular where more powerful functionality is
        often needed: referential members and ordering.
 
        This draft specifies extensions to the base WebDAV protocol to
        support these more powerful collections.

Send a message to:mailserv@ietf.org.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-collection-protocol-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
