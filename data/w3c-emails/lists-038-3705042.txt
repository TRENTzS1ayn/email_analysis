There may be a snag here: if the image is compressed (as it probably is), then a
diff on the bitstreams may not be all that small, since changing that pixel may
change much/all of the downstream data.

One possibility would be to permit type-specific diffs; if you make small changes
in an image, you can send a diff that says "patch the image by changing this
region", sort of like the interframe compression in MPEG.  Similarly, if you've
got a compiled Mac application under versioning, and you change a single string
resource, you could send a diff that says, "change 'STR ' resource 1717 to
'foo'".

I'm not sure I'm actually advocating this approach; the complexity might not be
worth the bandwidth savings.  I would certainly not advocate putting any
type-specific diffs into the required protocol; I would say make each diff format
a negotiable extension.
