Comments on the excellent draft, ctd..

If you are going to use the syntax proposed in the ID "Mandatory Extensions
in HTTP" for the method names, you may as well also use the namespace
syntax they propose (even though it's ugly) where the Man header specifies
not only the URI of the extension set but also a unique (for each extension
set within the current method call) prefix for the headers added by that
extension set.  So e.g.

M-PUT /~whitehead/dav/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Man: "DAV:Coll-headers"; ns=259-
259-Referential-Member: spec08.ref
259-Ref-Target: http://www.ics.uci.edu/...
259-Ref-Integrity: T
259-Position: After requirements.html

This will ensure that there is no collision with names of headers
introduced by orthogonal extensions.

Note also that Nielsen et al recommend that any header-prefix be at least
three digits.
