I think you are right.  So the example request to create a new referential
member of a collection would look like this:

M-PUT /~whitehead/dav/spec08.ref HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ics.uci.edu
Man: "DAV:Coll-headers"
Referential-Member:
Ref-Target: http://www.ics.uci.edu/i-d/draft-webdav-protocol-08.txt
Ref-Integrity: T
Position: After requirements.html
Content-Length: 0

The Referential-Member header is no longer really necessary, since the
server can tell from the presence of the Ref-Target header that it is
supposed to create a referential member rather than an internal member of
the collection.  But it might be worth keeping Referential-Member from a
human-readable point of view and to avoid using one header for two purposes.

I'm a little uncertain still whether it makes sense to use the Mandatory
Extensions to accomplish what we want.  The Mandatory spec says the server
should first process the extension headers, then process the PUT as usual.
I don't know how to make sense of this for our case.  What we are asking
the server to do is create an (empty) resource, and then put some DAV
properties on it, where the properties are specified by the extension
headers.  So the order of processing specified in Mandatory seems backwards
for us.
