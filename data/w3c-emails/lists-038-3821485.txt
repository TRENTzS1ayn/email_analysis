Yes, I can change the examples to do that.  I think this affects only the
examples, not anything substantive said in the specification.  I don't
think we need to say anything about whether clients should use the
Mandatory Extensions namespace syntax or not -- they make their own
decisions about that based on the Mandatory Extensions spec, whether they
are using multiple extensions in the request, whether they anticipate other
extension headers being added to the request somewhere along the way, etc.
