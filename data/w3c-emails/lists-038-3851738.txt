Your proposal uses a single URI, DAV:Coll-headers, to indicate that the
client expects the server to understand the headers that implement either
referential members or ordering or both.  Since servers are free to
implement either set of functions without the other, a client could send a
message that uses headers that are not implemented.  So either you need
some language that states that any server that implements at least one of
the two extensions MUST understand all headers defined in either extension
(and reject if not supported), or you need to use two separate URIs, one
indicating support for the Referential headers, one for the headers having
to do with ordering.

The latter seems a little better to me.

You know, it's too bad that we defined DAV levels as numbers, not URIs.  If
they were URIs, they could just be the same URIs that one provides in the
Man header.
