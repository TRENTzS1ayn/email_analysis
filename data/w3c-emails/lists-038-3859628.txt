The discussion about Mandatory suggests (to me) that we return to using
ADDREF as the means of creating a referential member.  Then we can dispense
with the Mandatory Extensions stuff altogether.

* Servers that don't understand referential members will just fail the ADDREF.

* DELETE will delete referential members, just as it can delete collections
and "plain" resources.  So there's no need for DELREF

The only thing we'd lose is the ability to MOVE or COPY a resource while
*changing* the value of Ref-integrity.  Servers are already requires to
preserve properties, thus an attempt to MOVE a strong reference to a server
that can't enforce it would fail anyway.  We only needed M-MOVE to ensure
the server noticed the Ref-integrity header.

On the other hand I think we still need mandatory headers for ordered
collections, otherwise there's no way to do a PUT (or ADDREF, if you take
the suggestion above) to a designated location.  Rats.

By the way how can one change the order of members in  an ordered
collection?  Presumably one does PROPPATCH on the dav:ordering property,
but is there also a way to do it with MOVE (e.g. MOVE x After y)
