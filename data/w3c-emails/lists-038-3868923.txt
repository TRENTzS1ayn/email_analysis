I see now that I didn't say anything in the Collection Protocol Spec about
MOVE or COPY for collections that have referential members.  Here's a
proposal: To stay analogous with what was said in the base DAV spec, if the
server cannot copy / move a referential member of a collection, it MUST NOT
copy / move any members (internal or referential) of that collection.

What about MOVE or COPY for an ordered collection?  Can we specify that a
server MUST fail a request to move an ordered collection to a location that
does not comply with the ordered collections part of WebDAV?

On the one hand, since clients can directly access and update the
DAV:ordering property, it might still be valuable to move / copy the
collection with its ordering, even though the ordering would be dead.

On the other hand, it would be somewhat misleading for the DAV:ordering
property to be present on a collection where the Position header is not
supported, and the server does nothing to insure that each collection
member appears in the ordering exactly once, etc.
