I have some general confusions about DAV: properties.

1. Can a client create a DAV: property using PROPPATCH?  Could a client
create DAV:ordering on a collection at a location that doesn't comply with
the ordered collections part of WebDAV?  Could a client create some DAV:
property not defined in any WebDAV specification?

2.  Copy / Move behavior for properties in general depends on the value of
propertybehavior in the request.  Does this apply to DAV: properties?  What
would happen if the request specified "omit" and DAV:reftarget was present
on the source resource, but the target location is on a basic DAV server?
Would the DAV:reftarget property be missing from the new resource, or would
it be present but dead?  What would happen if there was no propertybehavior
specified? Would DAV:reftarget just become a dead property at the new
location?
