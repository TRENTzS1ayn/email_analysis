Thanks for the explanations and advice.  The changes I would make based on
your comments are:
 
1. to specify a new ADDREF method for adding referential members to
collections.

2. to get rid of all mentions of M-PUT, M-COPY, and M-MOVE that are
currently scattered through the spec, and instead add an implementation
note for clients suggesting that they use the Mandatory Extensions Spec for
cases where they want to be sure that the request fails if the headers are
not understood.
