Here are some details for people attending the Interim WebDAV WG meeting
next week.

The meeting will be held on the Microsoft campus, in building 27, "Cafe 2".
Attendees should plan on arriving a few minutes early (8:45AM) at the
building 27 receiption to pickup their badges. A map of the Microsoft campus
showing the location of building 27, as well as vicinity maps can be found
on the meeting web site at:

Light morning snacks, lunch and afternoon cookies will be provided for all
three days. All attendees will receive a Microsoft Company Store coupon, and
a break will be scheduled for people who want to visit the store.

Also, at past WebDAV meetings we've done something as a group the first
night of the meeting, so please leave your Monday night plans open.

The agenda for the meeting can be found at:

A big thank-you to Yaron, Alex, and Microsoft for hosting this meeting!
