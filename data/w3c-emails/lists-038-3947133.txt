Nothing in WebDAV prohibits it, so I would say yes to all three.  In
general, dav properties are read-only, but nothing says that *all* dav
properties must be read-only.  

If your concern is that a client might set a property, expecting it to be
live,  on a server that does not understand it?

I think it would become dead.  The result would be zero-length resource but
it would presumably have both the dav:resourcetype set to dav:refmember and
the dav:reftarget set to the target.    This should work fine.

On the other hand, doing a  COPY that explicitly allowed dav:refintegrity
to be omitted would mean one was taking a risk.  No reason to forbid it
though.
