A client, written in Java that utilizes the WebDAV protocol, is available from 
the following URL:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/

In this website you will find general information about the functionality
of the WebDAV Explorer.  This information includes a brief introduction on
what the application does, and download and installation instructions.
In addition, the site provides an e-mail address to which you can either
send bug reports or feature requests.

The client was developed at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) by:

Gerair D. Balian
Robert Emmery
Mirza Baig
Tu Le
Thai Le

from UCI under the guidance of Jim Whitehead.

The WebDAV Explorer provides a graphical view of the resources available on
a WebDAV server.  In addition, the WebDAV Explorer allows you to execute all
the commands made available by the protocol on a particular resource.
The WebDAV Explorer (currently version 0.3.1) implements version 08 of the
WebDAV protocol specification.
