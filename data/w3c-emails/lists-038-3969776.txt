FYI, Keith Moore has set up a new mailing list for discussion of
Applications Area-wide topics.

The mailing list is called discuss@apps.ietf.org.  To subscribe, send a
message to discuss-request@apps.ietf.org asking to be added to the list.

Anyone may join this mailing list.

The welcome message from the list is:

Congratulations!  You're now subscribed to the discuss@apps.ietf.org
mailing list.  If you want to be removed from the list, or you
want your address changed, send mail to discuss-REQUEST@apps.ietf.org.

This list is for discussion of matters related to the applications
area of IETF.  In particular, discussions of area-wide concerns
or technical issues, and ideas for new applications area working groups,
are appropriate.

This list has been created as a result of the observation that many
issues discussed in certain applications area working groups, have a
much wider effect, and need a wider audience, than that particular group.
I'm hoping that this list will facilitate more cross-wg discussion.

At present anyone can post to the list, though there is a spam filter.
However, the apps area directors reserve the right to moderate the list to
filter inappropriate messages, or to automatically filter messages from
those who habitually post inappropriate messages.  Inappropriate, here,
means either 'abusive' or 'wildly off topic'.
