The protocol is currently schizophrenic in its approach to maintaining
orderings.  For some things it relies on direct manipulation of a
DAV:ordering property.  For others, it uses methods and headers.  Since the
value of the DAV:ordering property will be very long if the collection has
many members, direct manipulation of this property is not a very scalable
approach.  It is not a good idea to have clients use PROPFIND / PROPPATCH
on this property whenever they need to modify an ordering.  

I believe that there was consensus at Redmond to use methods for all
modifications of an ordering.  There will no longer be any mention of a
DAV:ordering property in the protocol specification.  This has the
additional benefit of allowing servers to implement ordering any way they
wish.
