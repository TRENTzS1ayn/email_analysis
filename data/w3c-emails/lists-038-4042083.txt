The current draft of the Collections specification depends in many places
on the draft "Mandatory Extensions to HTTP" specification being developed
by the HTTP Extensions working group.  "Mandatory Extensions" provides a
way to define new headers for use with existing HTTP methods, and force old
servers that do not understand these headers to fail the request.  

The primary use of "Mandatory Extensions" in the Collections specification
is to allow the HTTP PUT method to be used to create referential resources.
 Based on Roy's advice, the group at Redmond agreed that it would be
simpler and more appropriate to define a new MKREF method to perform this
function.  

Other uses of "Mandatory Extensions" in the Collections specification are
optional and up to the client.  These uses add unnecessary complexity and
an unwanted dependency on a draft specification.  The group at Redmond
agreed that all references to "Mandatory Extensions" should be removed from
the Collections specification.  Clients that want to use "Mandatory
Extensions" to force old servers to fail requests with unrecognized headers
are free to do so without any advice from us.
