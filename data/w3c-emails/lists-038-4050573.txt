The current specification allows the Position header to have any of the
following values:

"After" <URI>
"Before" <URI>
"First"
"Last"
"At" <sequence number> 
 
There was controversy that was never resolved as to whether "At" <sequence
number> should be allowed.  I would welcome help in reconstructing this
discussion.
