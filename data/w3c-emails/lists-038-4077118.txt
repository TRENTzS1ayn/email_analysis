That is only one of the two possible things an author might want
to happen, the other being an internal redirect that makes it seem
like the resource has a "copy" at that URI.  For example, Apache supports
both internal and external redirects in its namespace configuration,
with only the latter being visible to the client.

This would seem to indicate that such a feature should be an option
for the MKREF method, rather than being artificially restricted by
the protocol.

You should elaborate as to why there needs to be any such distinction.

It would be nice if a reference-only resource had a property that
distinguished it as such, but I doubt anything else is necessary.
