My feeling is that the WebDAV variants stuff may not be an apporiate place
to handle this issue. The notion of multiple processing specifications is
inherent to XML, and XML will need (and define) mechanisms to associate
stylesheets, default stylesheets and so on with XML documents. Since the
data sent on the wire for an XML document probably won't vary, and the
stylesheets won't, I'd say that we're into very media-type specific stuff
here -- and also in a zone where XML will have to make its own policy
decisions anyway, so that DAV should (at least) wait until those have been
made.

It is true that the renditions may well vary in information content (with
hidden/changed data masked or added by different XSL specs), but since the
HTTP data streams should be the same, I think this isn't a DAV issue.

Yes, content negotiation may be one way to solve the stylesheet variation
problem, and maybe even the XSL association problem.

PS I'm going to CC this reply to the XML-sig list as a piece of useful
input to their process.
