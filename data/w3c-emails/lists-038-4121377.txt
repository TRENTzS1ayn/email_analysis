Mmm, that's possible (in the case of references on the same server), but it
doesn't sound very desirable, for two reasons.  First, if the target
resource is HTML, then relative links will be relative to the wrong URI.
Second, it would result in the resource being cached separately for each URI
that references it (the target URI and each reference).  (A 302 is not
cachable by default, but it can be marked cachable with Cache-Control:; a
DAV server could declare its referential resources cachable just like any
other document.) Caching N copies of the same document is a Bad Thing.

The only advantage I could see to an internal redirect is in cutting down on
a round trip; but, if it breaks the cache, then we have a net increase in
round trips.

Mmm, because a DAV client should be able to tell the difference between
references it can manipulate and ones it can't.
