I agree that this is the direction the discussion in Redmond seemed to be
pointing.

There are several things that worry me about the proposal.

There is a requirement (3.1.4) that operations on a referential member not
affect the resource it references.  The rationale for this requirement is
that there needs to be some way to operate on the referential member
itself.  If requests were automatically redirected to its target resource,
this would not be possible.

So for GET and HEAD, the client might really be wanting to see the headers
of the reference (not its target).  It looks to me as if this is not
possible if we require a 302 response.

Similarly for PUT, the client might be wanting to replace the content of
the target resource, but on the other hand it might be wanting to replace
the reference with an ordinary resource that has content.  I'm a little
fuzzy on what happens for PUTs.  Is there a way for the client to say, this
is really the location that I want to overwrite, not the redirect?

As far as indicating the type of resource, I would be more inclined to
define a new Resource-Type header that contains the value of the
DAV:resourcetype property than to reuse a different header for a purpose
other than its intended one.
