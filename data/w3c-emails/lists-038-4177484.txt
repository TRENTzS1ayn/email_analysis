There is nothing automatic about the 302 response.  A client can decide
whether to chase the link or not.  And so what if it is automatic?  By
hypothesis, the client does not understand DAV, so there's no choice it can
make.  Is there any operation that John's proposal makes impossible?  I
think not.

I don't think John proposed that a PUT do redirection.  Don't we already
say that PUT on a referential resource is an error, just as PUT on a
collection is an error?

It's not even clear to me it would do anything.  (e.g, if you do a PUT with
Netscape and it gets a 302 response does it retry the PUT at the new URL?)
 
I see nothing to object to in John's proposal.
