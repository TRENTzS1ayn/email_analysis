Mmm...<dig, dig>...yeah, actually, I did; I proposed it for GET, HEAD, PUT, &
POST.  But now I'm not sure.

OK, so why is it an error? If it's just because we think that PUTting onto a
reference instead of the target is a Bad Thing, then we can return 302 instead
of an error code, and then the client will PUT onto its target.  Or do we have
some deeper reason?

Of course, if someone really wants to PUT an entity where the reference is,
they can do a DELETE first.

Well, according to HTTP/1.1, it's not supposed to, without checking with the
user.  Let me try it out, though...yes, it does (admittedly, we don't actually
do HTTP/1.1, and /1.0 doesn't warn against this behavior; it doesn't define
PUT).
