Urk.  You're right.  Apologies.

To prevent the client from converting a resource from 'plain' to
'referential' by doing a PUT.  This was more important when we had strong
referential integrity as a possibility.  Probably less important now.

Hmm, so does PUT onto a referential resource change the resource from
referential to ordinary, or does it return 302 so that the client can
redirect?  Both seem useful.  As you point out, if the client wants to
change the resource type it can do a DELETE, then a PUT.  So I guess 302 is
the right behavior.

Okay, I'm convinced.
