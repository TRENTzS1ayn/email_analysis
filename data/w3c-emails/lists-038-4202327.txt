I was not assuming that the client doesn't understand DAV.  A client that
does understand DAV may have occasion to do a GET or HEAD on a referential
resource in order to see the headers for the referential resource.  Do
those headers come back with a 302 response? (I was assuming not.)  If not,
then how does the client ever get access to them?

At the moment the spec says that the referential resource will be replaced
by whatever was in the PUT.  (That is, it will not be redirected, and it
will not fail.)
