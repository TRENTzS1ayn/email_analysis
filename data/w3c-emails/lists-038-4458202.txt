The purpose of the external member mechanism is to provide a place to record
a set of URIs that are associated with a collection, that is it. Attempts
were made in the past to give them additional semantics but after months of
debate all these proposals were resoundly turned down as completely
unworkable. Please refer the copious, nearly endless, discussions on the
topic in the mailing archive for further details. You can also refer to
previous versions of the DAV spec which contained various proposals to
extend the functionality of external members beyond a simple storage
mechanism.
