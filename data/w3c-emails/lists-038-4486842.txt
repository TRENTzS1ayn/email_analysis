I would say so.

We have found it useful in our product thinking to see there as being a
distinction between intrinsic document properties (last modified, content
length, content type, etc.) and what we call "item properties" which it has by
virtue of its relationship to a collection (a name, a position in the ordering,
a bunch of other product-specific things).  When you set a document property,
then surely it doesn't matter which collection it is 'in' -- and for an
external URI, surely it can exist 'in' no collection at all -- and therefore,
yes, one rational position to take is that it changes everywhere.  On the other
hand, clearly item properties are collection-specific.  However, we have also
found that indeed it is disquieting to people to have someone changing a
document property in their collection also changing it someone else's
collection.  

In summary: I think it is possible to argue it both ways, and the spec should
allow for either.
