A new revision (-06) of the protocol specification is now available!  This 
version is draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-06, and contains changes based on the 
list discussion, the Netscape Design Team meeting, and the Washington, DC 
IETF meeting.

The document can be retrieved via:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoc  
ol-06.txt

It is also available via the WebDAV home page:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/

This document has been submitted to the Internet Drafts editor, and should 
appear in the Internet-Drafts directory in 1-3 days.  Once there, it will 
be accessible at:

ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-06.txt

Unfortunately, the UCI ICS web server (www.ics.uci.edu) is down today 
(1/19), and should be back up tomorrow.  If you would like the spec. before 
the UCI ICS web server is back online, please send me an email, and I'll 
send you a copy.
