An HTML version of the distributed authoring protocol draft is now 
available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoc  
ol-06.html

Note that the text version of the document is the authoritative 
representation. In case of differences between the HTML and text variants, 
the text version always has precedence.

Many thanks to Jim Davis for performing this conversion.

Also, I neglected to thank Judith Slein and John Turner for their work in 
rapidly reviewing the protocol spec. last week to catch final errors before 
release.  The spec. is much improved for their contributions.
