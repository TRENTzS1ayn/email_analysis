   Jim,

Under Section 7.1
PROPFIND
"The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined ..."

Can we rename this method to GETPROP-- that's what is does? Are there any
specific reasons for this naming? Though method names are opaque token,
GETPROP/SETPROP explains its operation by its name.

similarly, under section
7.2 PROPPATCH
" The PROPATCH method processes instructions specified in the request body
   to set and or remove ..."

to SETPROP.


   Regards,
   -Surendra
