  Sorry for sending these comments in batches:

 Here are some more corrections required in the document:

12 DAV Properties:

Section 12.1

Remove ";" before "The time and date ...." or provide a missing value
identifier like ISO8601-date

Section 12.2

Purpose:   "Provies ...."  change to "Provides ...." ( typo )

Section 12.8

getlastmodified

Value:HTTP-date ; defined in section 3.3.1 of [....]

rephrase this as same as  12.1 value. 
Note: creationdate and lastmodified properties should have the same value
types. Correct me if I am 
wrong.

NOTE:Do we have a property that retrieves the author/owner of the document.
Unless we define document ownership, how does ACL
is going to work? Also,  how do we get  "annotations of the document"?
Don't we need a property that defines document
annotations.

Can we add these TWO properties? Any comments or suggestions?
