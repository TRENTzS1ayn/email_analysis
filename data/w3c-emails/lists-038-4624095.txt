So am I. ;-) [1]

I am probably not an expert on WebDAV, but I hope that I have
grasped enough of it to be able to contribute some thoughts.

I have several question below,I donot know whether it should =

I do not think that WebDAV will be able to accomplish that.

I could think of at least three ways to get this functionality:

 (1) setting up a push channel (could also be a custom udp or
     multicast mechanism) for update notifications
 (2) polling the web server for changes at certain intervals
 (3) using a session-based protocol (such as e.g. IRC =:-) that
     offers update "channels" where changes are "broadcast"

While I will probably try the last solution, the first (and
possibly second) alternatives might be "cleaner" solutions
from a protocol design standpoint.

Actually, WebDAV can be used to store and
retrieve any type of document content.

The versioning working group might come up with some ideas as to
how to calculate differences (diffs) between revisions - this might
help to implement some mechanism for displaying changes incrementally.

There are other protocols such as RTP and RTSP that are designed
specifically to deal with conferencing. You might want to use something like
Java or browser plug-ins to allow conference windows to be embedded in a
browser frame. Conferences are usually based on "streaming" data, while HTTP
is based on (more or less) atomic transactions, so it is usually advisable
to use a more specialized protocol for video conferencing.

Markus.
