   Yaron,

   Adding properties: documentowner, annotations and documentretention

Document Author/Owner and annotations are most important properties as one
defines
who created the document and one carries review annotations -- 

I agree with your decision of choosing properties only for proper
functioning of the protocol.
At the same time, we should also look at the basic document authoring
requirements. In a large
scale corporate document repositories at least one should know who authored
the document, all changes
that has undergone since its first version and when to expire the document
from the repository.
Also, these properties are fundamental for document management. From this
stand point of view 
I strongly argue that we should include document owner/author, annotations
and expiry/documentretention 
properties. 
[Dylan Barrell]  I agree with the sentiments outlined here. I agree that author/owner is essential for DM but disagree with the other two properties.

Document creation date is less important than lastmodified date. When the
document is first created, 
creation date and last modified date will be the same.These properties are
not only useful for authoring 
purposes but also more useful in perfoming the other admin/repository
admin. tasks. 
[Dylan Barrell]  I also agree with this statement.
