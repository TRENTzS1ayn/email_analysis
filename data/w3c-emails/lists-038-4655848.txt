I agree with Markus Fleck's response -- some amplifications below:

Please keep me (and the list) informed of your progress implementing the 
WebDAV protocol.  The IETF procedures are set up such that we need multiple 
independent implementations of the protocol to advance from Proposed 
Standard to Draft Standard, and even having implementations going to 
Proposed Standard helps a lot.

I have also heard people discuss using email (SMTP) or netnews (NNTP) for 
sending notification messages.  One current solution to this problem is 
employed by the BSCW group (http://bscw.gmd.de/) which created a separate 
notification protocol, which is received by a helper application.

Very, very true.  WebDAV is based on the HTTP protocol which has no 
restrictions on the type of content it can transmit.  For example, it would 
not be difficult at all to implement a word processor which uses the WebDAV 
protocol for remote storage of word processing documents.

Jeff Mogul (and others, including Yaron) have recently submitted proposals 
on delta encoding and instance digests which address transmission of 
changes between versions of a resource:
