A PDF variant of the -06 draft is now available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-06.pdf

This variant has been formatted using proportional fonts, bolded section 
headings, etc., so it looks (and should read) much better than the text 
variant of the -06 spec.  While this variant should be identical to the 
text variant except for formatting changes, remember that the text variant 
is the only official document of this working group.
