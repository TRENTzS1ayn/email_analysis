Hello Yaron,

Many thanks for your answers.

There are two steps to achieve the goal. The first one is to write the spec
so that the goal is achievable. You have definitely done that. The second
one is to make sure that implementors understand what kind of implementations
will let them achieve the goal, and what others will not. The i18n section
could definitely be clearer on this.

Many thanks for these clarifications.

Sorry, in my case, it's not a spam filter, but the fact that I have moved.
I am changing my subscriptions to the various lists one-by-one, but keeping
an overview is not always easy.

Anyway, thanks a lot for your help.


Regards,   Martin.
