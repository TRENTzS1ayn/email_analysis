I agree.  As I recall, you made this comment when you reviewed the spec. 
right before it was released.  I'm not sure why it wasn't addressed then, 
but language to this effect will be added to the next draft.

I agree.

Hmm.

Right now we use the link element in the source property, which is defined:

<!ELEMENT source (link)* >

Combined with the definition of link:

<!ELEMENT link (src+, dst+)>

This allows the source property to contain multiple links, each of which 
can have multiple sources and multiple destinations, as is shown in the 
example in Section 12.11.1.  It seems that there is a slight advantage to 
keeping the definition of link singular (i.e., only one single link) since 
this way you can specify a property to only include a single link.  If link 
was defined like:

<!ELEMENT link (src+, dst+)*>

It would be impossible to specify only a single link without creating a new 
production.

So, my inclination is to leave the specification as-is. Do you agree?

Agreed.

This one is moot.  I think that i.e. is OK here, but the best solution is 
to rewrite the sentence so i.e. isn't needed.
