   Jim/Judith,


    I am little bit confused with COPY, MOVE and DELETE operations. 

    I have gone through the scenarios document, and protocol document. I
would appreciate if someone can explain to me
    how the following scenarios are handled using the current protocol spec.
I am not trying to take whole group
    back to use case analysis stage, but, my objective here is to make sure
that current protocol has all definitions and
    explanations to have a clean implementation. Otherwise, to overcome some
of the limitation each implementor will choose
   their own way of interpretion and which lead to interoperability issues.

    Scenario A:Jane directs that the page P and all subordinate objects be
deleted from the web W.
Joe directs his web browser to retrieve page P from the web W.

Issue here is: If deletion of page P and associated subordinate objects
from the Web W
takes sometime to process, then Joe requests this page and by that time
some references
to that page might have deleted already and hence joe sees broken links on
page P. This throws an
integrity issue.  Or in other case, assume joe had already started editing
this page P. Jane deleted
this and when joe gets into publishing stage there is no matching
properties associated with the same
document. 

   Scenario B:     Jane directs that collection C be moved to collection D.
While this move
operation in progress. joe directs his editor to take a write(exclusive)
lock on Collection D.
This request will succeed as MOVE operation hasn't taken any explicit lock
on Collection D.
If this assumption is right, then, rest of the move operation will fail as
EXCLUSIVE WRITE lock has acquired
by joe on collection D and jane cannot be completed either server will be
WAITING for lock release
on collection D.

   I think, to make the spec more clearer, good add some more explanation on
COPY, MOVE and DELETE methods, how
   locks are issued on source and target resources for these operations and
impact of this on relevant methods.

   Regards,
   -Surendra

Yes, you are right about the definition of link.  Keep it the way it is.
