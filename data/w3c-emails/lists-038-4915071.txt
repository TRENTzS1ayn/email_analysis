7.1 says "In the case of allprop and propname, if a principal does not have
the right to know if a particular property exists then a a 404 Not Found
MUST be returned"

This is silly, as it reveals more information about the hidden property
than simply being silent.  This response is correct when the caller
explicitly provided a property name, but not for allprop and propname.  The
v5 spec said that allprop and propname returned only those props the
principal had access to, and we should revert to that definition.
