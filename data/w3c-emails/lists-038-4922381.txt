12.9 says "The server is free to withhold any or all of this information if
the requesting principal does not have sufficient access rights to see the
requested data."  

If the server does not wish to inform caller of, say, the owner, then
should it generate an empty owner or should it leave it out of the
activelock altogether?  The latter would violate the syntax of activelock,
as only depth is optional.  I am not sure whether all the other elements of
activelock are defined to allow them to be empty.  If any of them are, then
we have an inconsistency.  If all of them allow empty, then the spec should
add language telling what to do.
