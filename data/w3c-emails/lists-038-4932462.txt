I'd like to suggest that the examples not show the Authorization header, as
it is irrelevant to the WebDAV methods, and hence a distraction.  While I
understand that DAV makes support for Digest mandatory, surely the details
are orthogonal to WebDAV per se.  If they are not, then I missed something,
and hence language needs to be added to say what and how.

Putting the Authorization header in requires language explaining "the
nonce, response, and opaque fields havs not been calculated"

Why show the Authorization header only in the LOCK and UNLOCK methods, if
it actually matters?

This affects 7.12.9, 7.12.10, 7.12.11, 7.13.1
