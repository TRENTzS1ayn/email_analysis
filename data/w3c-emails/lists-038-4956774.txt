Do we still need 102 Processing?   Can *any* method return 102?  or only
some?  If only some, then those that can return it should list it the list
of possible status codes.  If all can, then there should be some language
that says that the list of status codes with each DAV method is not
exhaustive.

The explanation isn't sufficient to understand how 102 works.  An example
would help.  I mean, I can guess, and I might guess right, but I might
guess wrong, too.

If I do e.g., a MOVE, and get back 102 Processing, will I eventually get a
MultiStatus?  Will I get a stream of 102s every 20 seconds or so, until I
get that 207?
