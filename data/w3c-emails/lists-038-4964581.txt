A collection of minor typos, hopefully none controversial

7.1.2 text following the example talks about the "get-*" properties, should
be "get*", and about "get-content-length".

7.1.3 likewise in the response itself, as well as the text that follows

7.2.1 Status Codes

does not list 207, Multistatus.  By the way, I don't understand how
PROPPATCH can return status such as 403 or 409.  Shouldn't these be inside
the multistatus?

Likewise for 7.10.5  and 7.11.2

7.12.8 Status Codes.  Shouldn't 200 be included?

12.9.1 
 the request is missing a D: for lockdiscovery in the XML entity

 the 'depth' property is capitalized in the response, and also in the text
that follows

12.12.1

The Response has many capitalization errors, e.g. "Write' and 'LockEntry'
