Where as

LOCK and UNLOCK use the lock-token header

and

without authentication information an unauthorized principal could perform a
PROPFIND on the lockdiscovery property and obtain a lock token in use by
another principal

and 

the unauthorized principal could then perform actions they are not allowed
to perform

and

the only way to prevent this is to authenticate that the principal is who
they say they are

Therefore

The examples include the use of authentication information in order to make
absolutely clear that digest is MANDATORY and REQUIRED in circumstances such
as LOCK/UNLOCK.
