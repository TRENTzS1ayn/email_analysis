7.1.2 - Fixed.

7.1.3 - Fixed.

7.2.1 - The source of the confusion is that these status codes are meant to
be used inside of the multistatus. I have changed the title of the section
to read "Status Codes for use with Multistatus" I have also changed the "not
enough space" error to a 423. I also changed the 204 No Content response
code in 7.10.5 to 200 Success. I also changed the titles of 7.10.5 and
7.11.2 to the same as 7.2.1. I also changed 204 to 200 for 7.11.2.

7.12.8 - Good point, I have added it.

12.9.1 - Yikes, both are fixed. BTW, I want to stress how important it is
that errors like these get found. Implementers, as we have found out, tend
to rely very heavily on examples. In fact we have found more than a
comfortable number of cases where implementers will ONLY rely on the
examples and give scant attention to the surrounding text. Thus ANY error in
the examples can have very serious repercussions.

12.12.1 - Sigh.. we REALLY need to feed the examples through an XML
processor with our DTD. It would have caught those errors. Hasn't someone
already volunteered to take the DTD along with the examples and run them
through?

21 - D'oh!

Thanks again,
Yaron
