Now Jim, be nice, saying things are silly just makes folks get all riled up.
In this case what you have found is a typo. Somebody was clearly typing too
late at night and screwed up.

I have changed the paragraph to what it was originally meant to say:

In the case of allprop and propname, if a principal does not have
the right to know if a particular property exists then the property should
be silently excluded from the response.

The reason why I say "should" and don't capitalize it is that the server
should have the maximum flexibility in how it handles this type of
situation. The point of the sentence is just a friendly note to the
implementer that they don't have to feel required to return even the name of
a property which the client isn't supposed to know about.
