You are assuming that the authentication information is being exchanged
within the HTTP protocol and not within some underlying protocol.

You are assuming that there is a need to prevent this in all cases.

This would be a *very* big mistake.  Extensions to HTTP survive only
when they can coexist with other, orthogonal extensions to HTTP.  WebDAV
is not dependent on strong authentication when used within a strongly
authenticated environment, and support for Digest is not necessary for
both secure environments and intentionally non-secure (anonymous
collaboration) environments.

WebDAV should only require strong authentication when it is appropriate
for the application using WebDAV.  Strong authentication (of which Digest
is only one example) should only be listed as required for WebDAV
applications when performing principal-specific operations using a
transport layer that does not already provide an authenticated principal.

If I implement and deploy an SSH-based authenticating server, or even an
SSH-based AA mechanism in HTTP, should WebDAV be considered obsolete?
