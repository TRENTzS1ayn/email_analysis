I agree -- it does appear that a server-to-client protocol for transmission 
of notification events would be a nice complementary protocol for WebDAV.

My understanding of most existing Push technologies is that they involve a 
list of resources (the set of resources is called a "channel"), which a 
client retrieves at periodic intervals.

I think this question requires some further refinement -- you're asking a 
question similar to: "Which is better, an internal combustion engine, or a 
snowblower?"  Well, the answer depends on what you want to do with the 
tool.  Your question asks which tool is best, without also asking, "for 
which usage context."

Although this does give a use context, the question is still too broad. The 
CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) label encompasses email, 
collaborative authoring, video conferencing, configuration management, 
workflow, air traffic control, and systems which integrate several of these 
capabilities.  DCOM might be a good infrastructure technology in some 
domains, but not others.
