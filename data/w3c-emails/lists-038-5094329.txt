 Section 5.5:Write Locks and COPY/MOVE
Language in this section does not explain how locks are aquired on source
and destionation collection(s)
when collections are copied/moved. Does it not required to aquire a lock
the source 
collection when collections are moved? Or, may be my understanding is
wrong?
