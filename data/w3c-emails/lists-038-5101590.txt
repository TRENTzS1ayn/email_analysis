Maybe I am assuming too much, but if I was a user of a commercial-grade
WebDAV system, I would just assume that appropriate locks were taken out
automatically on the subordinate objects, so that Joe could not access P
or its subordinate objects once Jane had set the deletion in motion.  I
would assume this without it being in the spec, as this has been
standard practice in the relational DB world for a number of years, and
this problem is nearly (maybe exactly) isomorphic to the "SQL DELETE on
related tables" problem.  (For a non-DBA, it seems like I've spent a lot
of time on DB-related issues...)  However, other users might make a
different assumption.

(For a freeware WebDAV system, it might be acceptable to let Joe look at
a page with broken links while a deletion was in progress.  One of the
major strengths of Tim BL's approach to hypertext was breaking out of
the Dexter hypertext model, where every link was guaranteed to work --
Dexter-based hypertext would never have worked over the Internet, which
is never all working at the same time.)
