Funny, I just started working on a protocol for event notification
(called Event Notification Protocol -- clever, eh :)), using XML as the
common notification data format.  I can probably let both of you get a
look at the spec (I am having it reviewed now internally for the most
egregious blunders in protocol design).  There just didn't seem to be
any protocol designed just for event notification (X events would be
very heavy for our application). Let me know if either or both of you
are interested.
