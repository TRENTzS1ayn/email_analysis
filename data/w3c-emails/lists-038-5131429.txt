This assumption is false.  The spec says explicitly that GET is unaffected
by locks.

Perhaps this indicates the need for a sentence or two in the spec to
explicitly call out this possibility for integrity violations.  I
acknowledge in advance the need for a balance between tutorial/cautionary
material and straightforward exposition, but if this is a plausible
misunderstanding then perhaps it is good to try a little harder to fend it
off.
