Whether it's called a "collection" or not aside, in my view is the WebDAV notion
of a collection *should* be treated as a pure namespace.  There is a need to be
able to structure the URI namespace, and the current WebDAV collection does
that.  When the notion of a collection (really a namespace) is expanded to
included unnamed external members, it suggests that a collection is more than a
namespace, but does not specify what it actually does represent.  It seems to me
that this opens the possibility that different DAV implementations may use
external members for different purposes, which might hurt interoperability.

Certainly there are any number of other possible notions of "collection",
including compound documents and versioned documents.  Each one of these needs to
specialize the namespace concept of a collection in some way.  I believe that
each of these specialized forms of a collection ought to be modelled as a
different resource type.  That is, if you want a compound document container,
define it as such, with ordered and repeated members as desired.  It would also
be wise to consider the possibilities of compound documents with versioned
members, and versioned, compound documents.

That being said, I don't object to inclusion of external members in the spec, if
that's what it takes to get it through the process.
