This sounds OK to me, with one addition.  I think that in the case where 
the underlying storage system has a non-WebDAV lock, the owner element 
should indicate this (e.g., by saying "repository lock" or somesuch).  This 
would give a person a minimal chance of figuring out what is going on. 
Without this, their chances are nil.
