By my reading, Section 10.1 of RFC 2068 doesn't really address Jim's 
questions in any substantive way.  I think the DAV spec. would be improved 
by noting that any method can return a 102, and that the server must 
eventually return a non-1xx status code response which will typically, but 
not necessarily be a 207 Multi-Status.
