Hold it, the spec does not state that GETs are unaffected by locks. It
states that GETs are unaffected by WRITE locks. This is only one kind of
lock. I know that a read lock spec will be released in the near future
(mostly because I have to write it). Additionally our syntax allows for one
to request multiple lock types simultaneous so one could, for example, ask
for a read/write exclusive lock. This would create the sort of atomicity
that has been asked for.
