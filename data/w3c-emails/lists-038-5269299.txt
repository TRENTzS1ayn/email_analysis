There's a standard for event notification in email which is
a 'report', as encapsulated in multipart/report, and sent
as part of a message disposition notification or a delivery status
notification.

It would be good if any design for an "Event Notification Protocol"
had a clear mapping of those formats and their semantics.

The IPP group was intending to define event notification for
Internet Printing ("notify me when the file was printed"), and
so this would be of general applicability.
