I agree with the comments that the current external member mechanism is
broken.  I also agree with Judith's summary and her conclusion that some
sort of "internal name resolves to external member" naming mechanism is the
basis for the proper solution.

At the same time, however, I feel that one can build a very useful DAV
server without support for external members. Additionally, based on mail on
the list, I believe consensus exists that one can also build a very useful
DAV server without support for ordered collections. This indicates to me
that these features are optional value-adds and thus can be safely placed in
their own specification. 

Additionally by putting these features in a separate specification we can
move on with the Distributed Authoring last call and thus also begin the
work of creating the Versioning, ACL, and schema specifications, all of
which are completely dependent upon the Distributed Authoring specification.
In fact the reason why the versioning features were separated out is that we
found that any change to the distributed authoring features necessitated a
change to the versioning system. Rather than play a hopeless game of "patch
the problem" we decided to get the distributed authoring features
standardized and then use that foundation to build versioning, ACLs, etc. I
believe the same logic applies to both external members and ordered
collections.

I realize that there is some hesitation in having a separate spec for
ordered collections and external members but I would like to assure everyone
that a separate spec in no way deprecates these features.

Just as the Distributed Authoring protocol specification is built on top of
HTTP/1.1, and the versioning functionality of WebDAV is built on top of the
Distributed Authoring protocol specification, so features like ordered
collections and external members can be built on top of DAV.

As such I would like to propose the creation of a new specification to
define both external members and ordered collection functionality. I offer
myself as a co-author if it is felt that my services are needed. I am
interested in co-authoring because I know that products such as Microsoft
Site Server will need both ordered collection and external member
functionality. I also invite Jim Davis, Ellis Cohen, and Judith Slein to be
co-authors as they have repeatedly demonstrated a solid grasp of the issues
and a strong motivation to see them resolved.

If this proposal is accepted then ADDREF, DELREF, and the externalmembers
property would be removed from the Distributed Authoring specification. No
further changes would be needed as external members will have internal names
and thus appear completely normal to Distributed Authoring compliant
clients.
