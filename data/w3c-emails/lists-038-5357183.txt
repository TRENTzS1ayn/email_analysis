There is an interesting new internet draft (not surprisingly,
written by someone who works at Lotus Development Corporation)
for a group event notification protocol.

It is called "Simple General Awareness Protocol" (SGAP), and the
name of the draft is <draft-day-sgap-00.txt>, available by FTP
at ds.internic.net or a mirror server near you.

This SGAP protocol might be exactly what you (what we ;) need
to bring synchronous notification into WebDAV.

The creator of the draft, Mr. Mark Day, was
(is?) subscribed to the WebDAV mailing list.

There seem to be some further papers about Lotus's efforts
at <http://www.lotus.com/home.nsf/welcome/research>.

Viele Gruesse,
Markus.
