A new revision of the XML namespace draft, "Name Spaces in XML," is 
available from the World Wide Web Consortium.

This version:
      http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119
      http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119.xml
      http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names-0119.html
Latest Version:
      http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xml-names

This current revision has the status of a W3C NOTE, which is similar in 
status to an Internet-Draft.  However, it is my understanding that the XML 
group is working hard to develop a Working Draft version in the near 
future, 1-2 months out.
