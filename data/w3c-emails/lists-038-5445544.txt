I agree, a small section on the integrity concerns is probably worthwhile. 
 On the other hand, describing all of the possible interactions between all 
methods is a combinatoric nightmare, and I think this isn't a good idea.

[Dylan Barrell]  I agree. Add to the above examples the fact that a user may have a lock on a resource which is part of a large tree which is being operated-on (e.g. DELETED) and there is no good solution for all cases (with the current spec).
