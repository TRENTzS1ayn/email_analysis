namespace extension. The form of that extension is <namespace name=DAV:xxxx
href=http://www.foo.bar/blah as="dav">. The name attribute is required and
is the unique name of the namespace, it MAY be a resolvable URI but does not
have to be. The href attribute is completely optional but if used it MUST
point to a resolvable URI which can provide the schema. Thus when the IANA
schema registration group is up to full speed it can issue URLs that can be
used with any DAV compliant system, new or old.       

There is no XML name space extension mechanism such as described.
