There is a very good article in the January, 1998 issue of D-Lib magazine 
which gives a summary of the work to date on the Dublin Core bibliographic 
metadata set.  The Dublin Core is often referenced in discussions of this 
working group, and this article is the most comprehensive overview of the 
Dublin Core effort to date.
