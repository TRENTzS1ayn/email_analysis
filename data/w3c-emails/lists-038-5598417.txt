This text doesn't deal with the scenario where program A takes out a lock, the disk gets trashed and the system crashes, and the user wishes to perform an operation on the locked resource from another machine or after restoration of a backup made before the lock was granted.

It also doesn't deal with a situation where the user takes a lock out with program A and wishes to manipulate the resource with program B (after a dialogue asking the user whether the operation should be performed even though the lock was taken-out by another system).

We need to guarantee that the user can do this withour administrator interference.

Cheers
Dylan

Please refer to section 5.7 of the 05 draft for an entire section dedicated
to explaining the very principal you mention and section 5.6 for a
particular example. I will change the order of these two sections in the
next version of the draft because of the reverse dependency.
