I find the working group has come to consensus on the proposal:

a) remove ADDREF and DELREF and the externalmembers property from the 
WebDAV specification, with the understanding that external members will 
have internal names;
b) develop this functionality in a companion specification to the 
Distributed Authoring protocol specification currently in working group 
last call;
c) this companion specification will also define the semantics for ordered 
collections.

Yaron began this thread on January 27, 1998 [1]:

As such I would like to propose the creation of a new specification to
define both external members and ordered collection functionality. I offer
myself as a co-author if it is felt that my services are needed. I am
interested in co-authoring because I know that products such as Microsoft
Site Server will need both ordered collection and external member
functionality. I also invite Jim Davis, Ellis Cohen, and Judith Slein to be
co-authors as they have repeatedly demonstrated a solid grasp of the issues
and a strong motivation to see them resolved.

If this proposal is accepted then ADDREF, DELREF, and the externalmembers
property would be removed from the Distributed Authoring specification. No
further changes would be needed as external members will have internal 
names
and thus appear completely normal to Distributed Authoring compliant
clients.


Jim Davis [2], Judith Slein [3], and Ellis Cohen [4] all agreed to this 
proposal, and all agreed to be co-authors on the external members and 
collections specification.  I hereby commission these authors to begin 
development of this specification, to be called 
draft-ietf-webdav-collections. I suggest that it might be helpful to 
develop a short list of requirements, especially for collections, since 
there were some divergent viewpoints among the authors, especially for the 
semantics of collections (e.g., listing a member multiple times).
