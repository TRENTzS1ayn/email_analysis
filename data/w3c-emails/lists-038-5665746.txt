I would prefer to require that a server MUST return a confirmation of the success of the operation rather than the client simply assuming that the operation succeeded if absolutely no response is received.

Cheers

..... 
If an error occurs with a resource other than the resource identified in the
request URI then the response MUST be a 207 Multi-Status.  424 Method
Failure errors MUST NOT be in the 207 Multi-Status.  They can be safely left
out because the client will automatically know that the ancestors of a
resource could not be deleted when the client receives an error for the
ancestor's progeny.  Additionally 204 No Content errors MUST NOT be returned
in the 207 Multi-Status.  The reason for this prohibition is that 204 No
Content is the default success code.  As such the client may safely assume
that a resource was deleted successfully if no response is returned.
