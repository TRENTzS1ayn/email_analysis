Dylan, we provide a very specific example for why we believe that lock
tokens are absolutely required. If you would please address that example and
explain why it is that example is wrong you would go a long way toward
helping convince others of your view.

As for your concerns regarding servers, I am remiss to overly constrain
servers. A good standard allows people to do the right thing but no standard
can prevent them from doing the wrong thing. Furthermore I personally
dislike "motherhood and apple pie" requirements. I believe that a
requirement along the lines of "A server SHOULD allow the owner of a lock
token to see the lockdiscovery property containing that lock." is so self
evident that it can only be considered content free.

Furthermore I would like to understand how you feel that the current
language, from section 12.8 is insufficient.

Yaron
