You can say what you want I still don't like the fact that the paragraph ends with the sentence ".....As such the client may safely assume that a resource was deleted successfully if no response is returned.". This implies that a client could send a delete request, the server cuts the connection and the client has to assume that the delete request was successful (or am I missing something reading this paragraph out of context).

BTW, I actually changed the "MUST"s to "SHOULD"s. Thus a server has the
right to return 424 and 204 but shouldn't unless they have a damn good
reason.

As for requiring confirmation of success, that would be unreasonably
verbose. If you copy 10,000 files you will end up with 10,000 success
statements. Given that we have defined, in an absolutely deterministic way,
the result without requiring extra bytes on the wire, I think we have done
the whole world a favor.
