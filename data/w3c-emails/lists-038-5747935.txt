Ahhh.. now I understand. Yes my dear Dylan, you are missing something by
reading the paragraph out of context. The sentence is included in a
paragraph explaining the format of a 207 Multi-Status response. Thus the
client HAS received a response, it may not contain any PROP elements, but it
is a full, properly formatted response. Note, btw, that if everything works
just perfectly the server should send a 200 Success and call it a day.
Either way the client does get a response. If the client gets no response
then it can assume nothing.
