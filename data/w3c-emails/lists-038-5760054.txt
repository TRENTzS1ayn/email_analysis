More often than not users don't even know that a program they are running
has locked a file or that it will want to lock a file. 

For example, which word processors lock files they are working on? Think
carefully because not all of them do it. 

Furthermore when a user is interacting with the system through other
mechanisms, such as backing up the system or copying a directory, it is
quite likely that they may end up effected a locked file without knowing it
before hand. 

Given that programs often lock files or effect locked files without the
user's knowledge it is therefore self evident that a user may have no idea
of the ramifications of their actions until a program politely points it
out. Hence the lock token requirement.
