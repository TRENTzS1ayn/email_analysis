working group last call for comments on the Distributed Authoring protocol 
specification.  This document is available at:

It is also available in many forms (text, HTML, PDF) from the WebDAV home 
page:

Note that the text variant of the draft is the only official one, and takes 
precedence over all other formats.

Pacific time (US).
