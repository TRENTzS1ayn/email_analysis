Caught by the spam filter.  My apologies to David, as I was slow in asking 
for his name to be added to the accept2 list (which I have just done).

As Terry said, the dependency of DAV on the experimental namespace 
facilities
seems foolhardy in a document on the standards track.

Some form of non-DTD schema association may well come into existence, but 
XML
namespaces may or may not look anything like the facilities in the recent 
W3C
note.

Since the same effect can be achieved by simply using the attribute 
facilities
in XML, I suggest that all the namespace stuff be removed from DAV.
