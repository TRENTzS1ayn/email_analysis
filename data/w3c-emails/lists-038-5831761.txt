David,

Thank you for voicing your concern about XML namespaces.

I'd like to assure you that the WebDAV Design Team is working hard on this 
issue, and we are not taking your concerns lightly.  Since you well know 
this is a complex issue, I hope you will permit us a few days to develop a 
coherent approach towards these issues for the DA specification.  Since 
this is an open discussion forum, and since no specification can proceed 
from this working group without the rough consensus of the WG members, you 
will definitely have to opportunity to comment on any approach the Design 
Team proposes, and in fact, I look forward to your insightful feedback.

- Jim
