okay .. let me pose this simple one (and I apologise in advance
if I'm repeating something already gone over) ..

suppose a user gets a "lock token" and subsequently loses/misplaces it (and it
has to be something discrete, so that he/she can "affix it" to 
different requests/commands ..) ..

.. can he request the server to "remind" him of it?
.. can he instruct the server that the lock should be 'forgotten'
 and all things it is used on are now "free"?  Can he/she do so
without specifying the specific lock to "forget"?

Like any kind of identifier or key, unless it is so intimate (like your
name or a scar or tattoo) .. it can be lost or accidentally deleted.

What are teh provisions for this?
