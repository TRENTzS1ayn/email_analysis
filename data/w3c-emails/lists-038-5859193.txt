Jim,

I have already conceeded on the lock token issue, however I must say in response to the statement below that I am not against complexity, simply against complexity which, I believe, will bring little or no positive benefit to the success of the standard or the systems which implement it.

Cheers
Dylan

In any case, I must say that lock tokens are only a small portion of the
WebDav spec, and are, I think, expressed fairly clearly.   If you take
complexity of the specification as an argument against a feature, then you
will surely have even more objections when DASL (search), access control
lists, or ordered collections come down the line.

Best regards

Jim
