Hi,

maybe this is a slightly different issue, but shouldn't users also be
able to request a listing of all locks owned by them, not only all
locks pretaining to a specific resource.

If, for example user A has locked resources X and Y and forgot all
about having locked X, shouldn't he be able to ask for a list of all
ressources he locked. This would enable him to release X (or carry on
working on it)?

As far as I understand the current mechanism it only allows A to ask
for a list of all users having locked Y. If he doesn't know -- or
remember -- that checking for locks on X would be a good idea for him,
he won't be able to find out, would he?

Greetings from Germany
