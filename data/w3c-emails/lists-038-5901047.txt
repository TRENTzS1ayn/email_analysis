A new revision of the document, "UUIDS and GUIDS," authored by Paul Leach 
and Rich Salz, has been submitted to the Internet-Drafts directory.  This 
document describes the format and generation algorithm for UUIDs.

For us, this document is relevant because the Distributed Authoring 
protocol uses UUIDs for lock tokens.

Due to the maturity of this document, I plan to ask Paul Leach to submit it 
to the IESG as a standards track item at the same time we submit our 
Distributed Authoring protocol document.  Although this draft is not an 
official work item of the WebDAV working group, please feel free to comment 
on this draft here (and to the draft's authors) if you feel there is some 
issue regarding WebDAV's use of this technology.

This document is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/uuid-guid/draft-leach-uuids-guids  
-01.txt

It should also be available from the internet-drafts directory within 1-3 
days.
