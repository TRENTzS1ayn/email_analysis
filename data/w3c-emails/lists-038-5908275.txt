Sorry if my mail was a bit blunt. I'm not trying to be cranky..

The only thing that was worrying me was the "last call" message in
conjunction with the relatively light on-list discussion of this issue. I
just wanted to make sure that the public discussion represented a viewpoint

As long as the issue is under consideration, and an alternative and/or
rationale will be presented here for discussion, I'm happy.
