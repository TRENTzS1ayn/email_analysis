section 5.4 states that a write lock must not be moved when a resource is moved. This is not the way that DMS systems should behave. There are generally different sets of users respnsible for server structure and content. The users responsible for the structure may like to move resources around. Users who are editing these resources will not be happy if their lock gets revoked.

It also causes problems because it allows a user to release a lock on a resource by simply moving a tree structure which contains the resource in question - whether their permissions allow this. It is therefore an implicit restriction on the permission model of the WebDAV server.

It is furthermore problematic because it requires a server which has to comply with this to scan the tree structure of an entire collection hierarchy which is being moved and release all locks on all children. This will make efficient move impossible to implement. If this requirement does not have-to be met then moving a very deep collection could be done by simply moving the parent collection entry from the current parent to the future parent.

This requirement MUST go.
