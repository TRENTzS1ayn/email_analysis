Based on consensus created in this group since the release of the last
version of the specification the DTD for activelock is now:
<!ELEMENT activelock (locktype, lockscope, depth, owner?, timeout?,
locktoken?) >

locktype, lockscope, and depth are not optional because if all are not
specified then the lock information will be inaccurate. As such if a server
does not wish to return one of those three elements then it MUST NOT return
the activelock entry at all, which of course, is its right.
