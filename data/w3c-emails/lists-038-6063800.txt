FYI,

The submission deadline for Internet-Drafts for the Los Angeles IETF 
meeting is March 13, at 1700 EST.  Since Internet-Drafts submitted on the 
deadline date actually appeared in the repository *during* the IETF meeting 
at Washington, it is highly recommended to submit drafts at least a week 
before the deadline.
