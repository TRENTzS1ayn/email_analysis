I have serious reservations about the usability of a server which requires locks to be removed when moving a collection.

I summarise your arguments as follows

1) We do not want anything optional in the spec.
2) In moving resources across server boundaries it might be impossible to preserve the lock
3) Both solutions require the same effort
4) The destination could be locked before the move

I accept the restriction that we do not many optional functionality in the spec. This restriction should not however force us to design a spec which will result in an unusable system. In large organisations with large Intra- and Internet sites, not allowing the web administrators to re-organise the structure of the web site without adversely affecting the work being done by the authors of the individual pages is unacceptable.

I would prefer to require that resource be copied across server boundaries than restrict the power of the MOVE command. It is intuitive for COPY not to replicate any locks. Also as you said the server could always lock the destination before copying the resource thereby achieving the same effect (argument 4 negates argument 2). It is not practical for the client to do this for various reasons 
1) The principle might not own all the locks involved which would result in the target locks belonging to the wrong person.
2) The client would have to perform lockdiscovery for all resources involved and perfomr the individual lock methods to lock the destination
3) The client might not be aware that the namespace is on another server.

The argument that both solutions require the same effort is not valid. I can think of many ways of implementing collections whereby a move of an entire subtree could be performed by updating only one database row/directory table and many more which would require only two updates.

Cheers
Dylan

If the functionality is optional than it need not be in the specification,
it can always be placed in a separate specification. One would indicate
support for the optional feature through the OPTIONS method and then use a
header declaring that the optional feature is to be used on a particular
command.

One of the decisions made early on in the DAV working group is that there
are two kinds of features, mandatory and not in the spec. The reason for
that decision is that we realized that the combinatorial complexity of
optional features in such a large spec would make it impossible to have
interoperable implementations. The chance of a random client and server
being able to communicate would fall rapidly to zero. That is why the spec
only has two compliance settings, the second of which requires all of the
first.

The result is that the spec has roughly 158 MUSTs, 22 SHOULDs, and no MAYs.
Of those roughly 102 MUSTs belong to level 1, 14 SHOULDs belong to level 1,
39 MUSTs belong to level 2, and 5 SHOULDs belong to level 2.

Yaron

P.S. The reasons the numbers don't add up is that I am using a compliance
spreadsheet which combines some of the requirements on the same line. So a
single entry in the spreadsheet may have two or three MUSTs listed because
they appear in the same sentence.
