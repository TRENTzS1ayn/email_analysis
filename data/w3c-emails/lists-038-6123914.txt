This conversation has inspired me to finally speak up about MOVE.

Could someone point me to the discusion of the rationale for designing the MOVE
method so that it is not atomic.  By atomic, I mean that it either fully
succeeds or fully fails.  -- I come from the mindset of DOS and Windows  The
DOS MOVE command (which can be used to move a directory tree by just moving the
directory at the root of the tree) is my mental model of "move" and I feel that
WebDAV's "MOVE" seems a lot like a variant of XCOPY /S followed my a variant of
DELTREE.   (My apologies to those folks who aren't familiar with these DOS
commands.)  -- In the current WebDAV draft, is there a way to request a server
do the MOVE atomically?

I guess I also find the possibility that the move can destroy something at the
destination to be unsettling.  Once again, DOS/Windows is my model.  The
drag/drop GUI's that I use are also my model... and those UI's can be expected
to be used in authoring clients.    Of course, as far as I know, this behavior
can be achieved with the current protocol with some extra steps taken by the
authoring client code.  Right?

Thanks,

J.
