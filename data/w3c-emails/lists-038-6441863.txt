File systems are not a good collaborative authoring infrastructure. WebDAV 
is supposed to provide this infrastructure. Surely we can do better than 
this 20 year old metaphor?

For a WebDAV client to handle resources being moved out from underneath 
them would either require some form of notification, or the client 
submitting an If-Match or If-State-Match header to indicate what the client 
thinks the current state should be.  For the client to know the new 
location, the notification message would have to indicate the new location 
of the resource, or the request on the old location would have to respond 
with a "Moved Permanently" message.  Neither of these solutions depends on 
the lock remaining current.

It seems to me the requirement you are proposing, Dylan, is that the client 
must be able to determine where a resource has moved after a move (this is 
a new requirement for WebDAV), and that the client must then be able to 
continue editing at the new location as if the move hadn't occurred.  Is 
this right?
