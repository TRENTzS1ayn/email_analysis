Well, as the main proponent of the "octet-for-octet" language, I seem to be 
taking it on the chin here.  Let me explain my rationale, and why I thought 
(and still think) the octet-for-octet language is OK.

Once the octet for octet language has been removed, there is no way to 
verify that a copy operation has performed correctly.  If you allow the 
server to modify the state of a resource during a copy, then you run into 
the following case:

1. copy A to B
2. copy B to A
A in (1) does not equal A in (2)

If I write a compliance test suite, and I'm trying to verify that a server 
has implemented copy correctly, there are very few assertions which can be 
made about the body of the destination after the copy.  For example, a 
compliance test suite could check for a non-null body on the destination, 
but it couldn't check for matching lengths, or matching contents.

I know (and truly do sympathize) with those who want to perform an 
intelligent move or copy to perform link maintenance.  This isn't a case of 
me not "getting it."  My concern is developing a spec. where the definition 
of copy is more precise than people's intuition of copy.

That said, I do note that the growing consensus of the working group is in 
favor of removing the "octet-for-octet" language from COPY.
