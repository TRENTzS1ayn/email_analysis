I actually like the 'octet-for-octet' language.  I am not particularly
sympathetic to having an 'intelligent' copy that rewrites resources.

For starters, I think there will always be a need and desire for a
byte-for-byte literal copy.

One example:
 
Suppose I determine that a resource is misbehaving in some way.  It might
have some bad links in it, it might be a buggy program.  Whatever.  I want
to copy it away so I can analyze the problem.  (I often visit Web sites,
see broken links, look at the source so I can either send a detailed bug to
the maintainer, or, when I am lucky, guess what the link was supposed to
be, and get on with my real desire.)

In such a case I would *not* want the server to alter the resource in any
way whatsoever when copying.

So any COPY that claims to be 'intelligent' will need a way to optionally
turn this off.  This to me says that it needs a new header to control such
'intelligence'.

I claim that anyone who wants to support intelligent copying had better
write an extension to WebDAV.

Let's keep DAV simple, and require copying be literal.
