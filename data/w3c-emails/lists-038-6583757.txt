To:"'WEBDAV WG'"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

Although we are now a week past the deadline, I'd like to call an official 
end to the last call for comments on draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-06.txt.

This *does not* mean you should stop discussion on current active threads 
on the mailing list.  In particular, there are still active discussions on:

  - semantics of copy
  - behavior of move on locks
  - potential for lost updates with non-locking clients

I'd like to see these threads come to a speedy conclusion.

Also, in general, criticism and discussion of the WebDAV spec. is always 
welcome on the list. But, in the interest of making progress, comments on 
the -06 spec. made from this point forward (with the exception of ongoing 
threads) will very likely not impact the -07 spec.

Due to the significance and number of revisions to the -06 draft, there 
will certainly be an -07 draft, and another, two week last call period. 
 This was expected. The Design Team is currently aiming for a release of 
the -07 draft next week.  I anticipate the -07 draft will not require major 
revisions, and this will indeed be the final last call.  After the last 
call on the -07 draft ends, there will most likely be an -08 draft, which 
will contain minor corrections from the last call.  I anticipate calling 
for rough consensus on this -08 draft, in April.

My sincere thanks go out to all of the reviewers of the -06 specification. 
 Your diligence and comments have greatly strengthened the language and 
understanding of the specification, and have made this last call period an 
emphatic success.
