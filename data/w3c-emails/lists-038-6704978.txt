I am concerned that Jim's proposed language may not fully describe the
sentiment we are trying to transmit.

As such I propose the following language which is meant to replace the first
sentence of the definition of a non-collection copy:

When the source resource is not a collection the result of the COPY method
is the creation of a new resource at the destination whose state and
behavior matches that of the source resource as closely as possible.
However, the exact nature of the destination resource will be the result of
what information the source resource is able to provide and what information
the destination resource is able to accept.

I am not suggesting that this is a perfect or even optimal definition but I
do believe that our goal should primarily be to make sure we do not
constrain legitimate behaviors. We are trying to define something which is
meant to be vague and, not surprisingly, this means our definition will be
vague as well.

Yaron
