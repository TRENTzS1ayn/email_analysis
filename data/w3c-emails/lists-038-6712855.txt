> lost.  Consider the following scenario:
> 
> Two clients A and B are interested in editing the file 'index.html'.
> Client A is an HTTP client rather than a WebDAV client, and so does not
> know how to do locking.
> 
> Client A doesn't lock the document, but does a GET and begins 
> editing.
> Client B does a LOCK, does a GET and begins editing.
> Client B finishes editing, does a PUT, then an UNLOCK.
> Client A does a PUT, overwriting and losing all of B's changes.
> 
> There are several reasons why the WebDAV protocol itself cannot prevent
> this situation.  First, it cannot force all clients to use locking because
> it must be compatible with HTTP clients that do not comprehend locking.
> Second, it cannot require servers to support locking because of the
> variety
> of configuration management systems, some of which rely on reservations
> and
> merging rather than on locking.  Finally, being stateless, it cannot
> enforce a sequence of operations like LOCK / GET / PUT / UNLOCK. 
> 
> WebDAV servers that support locking can reduce the likelihood that clients
> will accidentally overwrite each other's changes by requiring clients to
> lock resources before accessing them.  Such servers would effectively
> exclude HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 clients.
> 
> WebDAV clients can be good citizens by using a lock / retrieve / write /
> unlock sequence of operations (at least by default) whenever they interact
> with a WebDAV server that supports locking.
> 
> HTTP 1.1 clients can be good citizens, avoiding overwriting other clients'
> changes, by using entity tags in If-Match headers with any requests that
> would modify resources. 
> 
> Information managers may attempt to prevent overwrites by implementing
> client-side procedures requiring locking before accessing WebDAV
> resources.
