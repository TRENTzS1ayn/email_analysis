Is there any popular Web Servers implemented WebDAV yet?
Seems like Netscape Enterprise Server talks about Distributed Authoring
and Versioning and Netscape provide classes for accessing Netscape DAV
functionality. Does Netscape DAV is compatible with WebDAV. It seems
like the HTTP extension methods are different in Netscape
implementation, like GETATTRIBUTES .
Thanks
