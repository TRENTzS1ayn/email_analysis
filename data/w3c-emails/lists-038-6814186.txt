Hi Sajith,

While I understand that prototype WebDAV servers are being developed by 
several
universities, corporations and research labs, there are currently no 
publically available web servers which implement the latest WebDAV 
specification.  Perhaps I should award a prize to the first compliant, 
interoperable, client-server pair which uses WebDAV level 2.  One prize 
idea is a copy of the WebDAV spec. and a pair of scissors (it's not done 
'til there's nothing left to cut :-), although I think putting the Design 
Team in a dunking booth and then giving the developers chances to dunk us 
might prove to be more of an incentive :-)

Yes, Netscape Enterprise Server does have several features which overlap in 
functionality with WebDAV functionality, as they were developed before the 
WebDAV effort began in 1996 (there is a link to an early Netscape DA 
proposal on the WebDAV home page). However, engineers from Netscape have 
been working on the WebDAV specification since November, 1996, and, while I 
will let list members who work for Netscape speak to Netscape's future 
plans if they wish, my understanding is they are very supportive of WebDAV.
