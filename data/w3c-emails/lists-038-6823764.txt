Hi, John --

I've been assuming something like the DMA model of containment.  Here is a
quote from the DMA spec on the difference between direct membership in a
collection and membership-by-reference.  I can see that you understand
something different by direct containment.  Can you explain what it is, and
how it differs from membership-by-reference in your model?

"Direct containment. This models a 1:N, or one-to-many, relationship. A
containing object may contain multiple objects, but an object is directly
contained within at most one containing object. A containing object that
directly contains another object is the parent of that object. An object
that is directly contained within a parent object is a child of that
parent. Multiple directly contained objects are children. Direct
containment defines a strict hierarchy of objects with no cycles. Document
spaces implementing direct containment must prevent cycles. For example,
moving a parent into one of its children must be disallowed. DMA does not
limit the depth of the direct containment hierarchy, but a document space
may choose to impose a limit."
 
"Referential containment. This models an N:M, or many-to-many,
relationship. Objects that are referentially contained within a containing
object are referred to as containees. A containing object that
referentially contains another object is referred to as a container of that
object. A container may contain multiple containees. A containee may be
contained within multiple containers. Cycles in referential containment
relationships are not disallowed by DMA, because they could be expensive to
prevent. A document space may choose to disallow them, however, in which
case it is obligated to enforce this. DMA defines operations that modify
containment hierarchies in such a fashion that cyclical referential
containment can be supported."
