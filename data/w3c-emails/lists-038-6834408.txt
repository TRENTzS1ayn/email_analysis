FYI, Alex Hopmann, Microsoft, and Jim Cunningham, Netscape will be giving 
talks at the March, 13, 1998 Bay Area Roundtable on WebDAV and issues of 
Internet document publishing.  The meetings are held at the Hyatt Rickeys 
on El Camino Real in Palo Alto. Details are below.

Note that while the title of the talk session is "Internet Document 
Management," the intent of this title is to try and generate broad interest 
in this talk, and is *not* intended to indicate that WebDAV supports the 
same level of document management functionality as, for example, a 
DMA-compliant system. My apologies for the confusion.

I hope you'll all take this in the spirit it is intended, a good chance to 
come meet Alex and Jim, get an intro. to WebDAV, ask questions, and meet 
other people interested in WebDAV.

Also note that this is *not* an official meeting of either the WebDAV 
working group, or the WebDAV Design Team.

If you are planning on attending, please send Debra Brodbeck 
<brodbeck@ics.uci.edu> an email saying, "I heard about the March BART from 
Jim, and I'm going to attend."  This way there'll be enough coffee and 
munchies.  Thanks!

Web-based Document Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alex Hopmann, Lead Program Manager, Microsoft Corporation,
              alexhop@microsoft.com

In the last few years, the World Wide Web has enabled the world's
first large-scale, globally accessible corpus of information. What
makes this especially amazing is that it has done so without any
standardized system for document management and authoring.

The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) WebDAV Working group has
set out to define standards for "Distributed Authoring and Versioning"
based on HTTP, with the goal of providing a Standards-based framework
for authoring, collaborating, and managing the Web. The base WebDAV
specification is nearing completion. This talk will address the basic
architecture of both the WebDAV protocol as well as the newer Distributed
Searching and Locating protocol, including a detailed discussion of how
these standards work. The talk will then explain how this architecture
can be used to enable common document authoring scenarios, as well as
more sophisticated web-based applications using XML.

Biography: Alex Hopmann is a Lead Program Manager for the Microsoft
Corporation, where he is the liaison between product development and
standards development. Alex has been a key participant of several IETF
working groups, and is currently the chair of a follow-on group to WebDAV,
the Distributed Authoring Searching and Locating (DASL) group. He founded
ResNova Software in 1990 to develop collaborative online applications,
leading him into involvement with the IETF standards process where he has
helped design aspects of HTTP 1.1, WebDAV, and is co-author of the MHTML
(HTML Email) standard. Like many of today's computer technologists, Alex
got his start on the Apple][ and has fond memories of programming with
peeks, pokes and calls.

Scaling Document Management on the Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jim Cunningham, Engineering Manager, Netscape Communications Corporation,
                jfc@netscape.com

Scaling document management on the Internet is becoming an important
area as information of all types is quickly being moved to Web-based
access. The amount of data available and the number of users generating
this data on the web is growing rapidly, as is the number of users who
are accessing this data. In addition, some data may be dynamically
generated. Scaling document management solutions to handle this problem
is going to be necessary to ensure the data is accurate, does not become
stale, and can be managed by a large community of users who are managing
documents which may be distributed across the Internet. This talk will
define some of the issues regarding scaling on the Internet, suggest
some ideas for managing this scaling problem, and provide some real world
feedback based on Internet experience with the Netscape Enterprise Server
Web Publishing and Search systems.

Biography: Jim Cunningham is the Engineering Manager of the Web Publishing
and Text Search group at Netscape Communications Corp. where he oversees
the development of web-based document management features of the Netscape
Enterprise Server and Text Search used throughout Netscape's Suitespot
servers. Jim has been involved in the Distributed Authoring and Versioning
(WebDav) and the Distributed Authoring Searching and Locating(DASL) IETF
working groups. Jim's previous work has included research in text-based
information retrieval, including the RUBRIC research system which has
since become the basis of the Verity text search engine. Prior to Netscape, 
Jim worked in Telecommunications building ISDN Internet access products,
information retrieval as part of an interactive cable television system,
and intelligent analysis research and development.
