Thanks for your comments, Surendra.

I'm not sure from reading your comment whether there is a real issue here
or not.  The requirement was not meant to be about naming.  There is
nothing to prevent the same name (R) from being used for two different
resources that are direct members of two different collections.  /C1/R and
/C2/R in that case are two different resources.  The requirement claims
that the very same resource cannot be a direct member of more than one
collection.  So if /C1/ has a direct member named R and /C2/ has a direct
member named R, then /C1/R and /C2/R must be different resources.

Do you disagree with this?  If so, I need to ask you, as I asked John
Turner, what you understand by direct vs. by-reference membership. it will
be interesting to get all the different interpretations of these notions
that are current in the group explicitly defined.

In an ideal world, I think we would require servers to maintain referential
integrity.  Realistically, I don't think the Web environment makes this
possible.  We all experience broken links on the Web daily.  Can WebDAV fix
this problem in general?  I don't think so.  Should we try to fix it just
in the context of collections?  We could, but the WebDAV working group from
the beginning has taken the position that we are defining a client-server
protocol, and will not define any special server-server protocol elements.
I think this would be required in order to insure referential integrity,
and still wouldn't work because a member-by-reference may reside on an HTTP
server that doesn't understand the WebDAV protocol anyhow.

You could still argue that requirements should reflect the ideal world, and
we should state this requirement even though we know we can't satisfy it.
I'm open to that view.

Sorry, the requirement wasn't stated very clearly.  It's meant to convey
only that the reference can be removed from the collection, not anything
about the target of the reference.

The inheritance notion is an interesting suggestion that I haven't heard
before.  I'm not sure how feasible it is in cases where the "source" is on
a different server, possibly an HTTP server.  Jim Davis has suggested that
the member-by-reference might keep a copy of the source's properties,
though it would risk being out of date.

Can you describe in a little more detail what you have in mind?

Section 3.3 of the current WebDAV spec says "Any attempt to create a
resource (excepting the root member of a namespace) that would not be the
internal member of a collection MUST fail."  Is this a problem for the
applications you have in mind?
