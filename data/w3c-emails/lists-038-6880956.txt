I'm new to this list and to WEBDAV in general, so forgive me if this is a popular question but I didn't see a good answer on the Web site.

What is the purpose of members-by-reference for collections? In the common case (files or some other hierarchially structured set of data), collections only have internal members. Can someone give a concrete example of a situation that uses members-by-reference?
