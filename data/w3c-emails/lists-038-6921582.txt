I got you. My confusion here is on naming.

We are not trying to solve broken links problem in WEBDAV. But, still I
recommend to
consider lessons learnt or difficulties from HTTP protocol, we MUST solve
these problems
in new extensions are protocol built around HTTP. If we can leave
referential integrity as
an optional.

If other HTTP server is DAV compliant, we can query on the
properties of the reference. Hoping that there will be more DAV
implementaions,
users can see real benefit of this inheritance notion. We should not "lock
in"  DAV
with limitations. I would recommend to include "inheritance
notion" in the requirements.

There is no issue in this comment. I am in full agreement with this
requirement.
