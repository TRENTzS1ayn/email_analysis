Hi,

I've received several emails from people wanting to know when the WebDAV 
meeting will be held during the LA IETF.  While the final applications 
track schedule hasn't been finalized yet, at present, the WebDAV working 
group has tentatively been assigned a slot on Thursday, from 1-3PM 
(1300-1500).  I'll let you know if this chages.

- Jim
