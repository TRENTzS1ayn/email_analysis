The deadline for submission of Internet Drafts before the upcoming IETF 
meeting is Friday, March 13, at 5PM US Eastern time.  Since drafts 
submitted on the deadline before the Washington meeting were actually 
showing up in the I-D directory *during* the Washington IETF, I recommend 
submitting I-Ds a week in advance of the deadline.

An I-D submitted right before a meeting has no more special status than one 
submitted at any other time, but, given its proximity to the meeting, it 
has the possibility of being more relevant and in-synch with current 
concerns and discussion.

The conventional wisdom for submitting I-Ds before the meeting is so that 
people coming to the meeting will have enough time to read the relevant 
I-Ds before the meeting.

Certainly, regular submission of I-Ds indicates that activity is taking 
place on a particular topic.  However, as far as the IETF is concerned, the 
major progress indicators are documents submitted to the IESG.  There's 
very much a "move it or lose it" attitude in the IETF.

Anyone may submit an I-D.  While the Chair of a working group does have 
discretion over which I-Ds are considered official work items of a 
particular working group, it is certainly possible for someone to develop a 
draft and submit it as an Internet-Draft at any time (except for the 
blackout period before an IETF meeting).

The "sketchyness" of I-Ds varies.  A draft must be complete enough to 
convey your ideas, and must be sufficiently well-thought to avoid 
embarassment.

As for your enumeration of drafts, I will leave the discussion of 
DASL-related drafts to the Distributed Authoring Searching and Locating 
mailing list, www-webdav-dasl@w3.org.  As for the requirements for external 
members/ordered collections, I have encouraged Judith Slein to submit such 
a draft before the I-D deadline so we can discuss external members/ordered 
collections at the LA IETF.  I certainly think such a draft should be a 
work item of this working group. Since there will be relatively few open 
issues in the Distributed Authoring specification during the LA IETF, I 
anticipate the discussion at the LA IETF will mostly focus on ordered 
collections requirements issues.
