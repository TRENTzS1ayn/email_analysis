To:"'WEBDAV WG'"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

A new version of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol document, 
"Extensions for Distributed Authoring on the World Wide Web -- WEBDAV," is 
now available off the WebDAV home page:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/

This document is draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-07.txt, and is directly 
available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoc  
ol-07.txt

For those who have access to Word 97, a variant of the draft is available 
which contains the differences between the -06 and -07 versions of the 
draft:

ol-07-diff.doc

I'd like to thank Yaron Goland for his hard work on this draft. I'd also 
like to thank the members of this working group for their insightful and 
detailed comments during the last review period.  The specification is 
dramatically improved for all of your efforts.

Major changes to the draft include:

- Removing external members capability (externalmembers property, ADDREF, 
DELREF)
- Replacing If-State-Match, If-None-State-Match, and Lock-Token headers 
with the If header
- Addition of an appendix quoting (mostly verbatim) the XML namespace 
specification for use as a normative reference by WebDAV prior to issuance 
of a W3C Recommendation for XML namespaces
- Changed all XML namespace examples to be consistent with latest XML 
namespace draft
- Adding in the correct RFC number for our requirements RFC in the 
references (yeah!)
- Modified COPY language
- Addition of a section describing the downlevel PUT/LOCK scenario that 
Sanford Barr identified
- Numerous corrections identified during the working group last call.
- Removal of the changes section.
