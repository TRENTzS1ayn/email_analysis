A nicely formatted version of draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-07 is now 
available in PDF format at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/draft-ietf-webdav-protoc  
ol-07.pdf

Note that the authoritative version of draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-07 is the 
text version.  If there are differences between the text version and any 
other version, the text version is always correct.

However, to the best of my knowledge the only difference between the PDF 
version and the text version is formatting and spacing.
