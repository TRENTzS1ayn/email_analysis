It's magnificent.  Just a few small points

in 7.1.2 (p 19 in the PDF version) the discussion says "has an undefined
resource type".  But I 12.0 says that this property must be defined on all
resources.  So maybe 7.1.2 should instead say that the value is empty.

in 11.4, does the DTD for link actually allow for other tags to occur, or
only src and dst?
