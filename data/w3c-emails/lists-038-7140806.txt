The last paragraph of section 4.1 current reads ". In this case it SHOULD
return a location header in the response pointing to the URL ending with the
"/"."

The location header is used in HTTP to redirect the client to another
location or to indicate that the contents of the response is recorded at the
specified location.

The content-location header is used to indicate that the results of the
response body were generated from a resource at the specified location.

The use of the location header was a bug, it should have been
content-location.
