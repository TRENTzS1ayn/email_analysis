An Internet-Draft describing requirements for advanced collections 
capability (that it, external members and ordered collections) has been 
produced by Judith Slein, and is now available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/draft-ietf-webdav-coll  
ection-reqts-00.txt

This document will have the Internet-Draft name of 
"draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts".

Thank you Judith for developing this draft.  It is well written, and should 
form the basis for much useful discussion at the LA IETF meeting.
