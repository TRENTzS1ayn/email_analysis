Title: Requirements for Advanced Collection Functionality 
                          in WebDAV
Author(s): J. Slein
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-00.txt
Pages: 9
Date: 11-Mar-98

        The base WebDAV protocol [Goland et al., 1998] provides basic
        support for collections.  It defines a MKCOL method for creating
        collections and specifies how other HTTP and WebDAV methods
        interact with collections.  It supports only internal members of
        collections, which it defines as members whose URIs are
        immediately relative to the URI of the collection.
 
        This draft sets out requirements for more advanced, optional
        collection functionality. It extends the base functionality in two
        general directions: support for referential members, and support
        for ordered collections.  A separate WebDAV specification is
        expected to define protocol elements providing the functionality
        described here.

Send a message to:mailserv@ietf.org.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
