Here is the preliminary agenda for the LA IETF meeting.  At present, I am 
not scheduling any time at the LA IETF for discussion of the Distributed 
Authoring protocol draft, since there have been no contentious issues 
raised on the mailing list since the -07 draft was issued.  If you come up 
with any issues in draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-07, please send them to the 
mailing list.  If you feel further that the issue warrants discussion at 
the LA IETF, please also send me an email requesting a time slot.  But, at 
present, the LA IETF meeting is dedicated to a discussion of the ordered 
collections requirements.

LA IETF Preliminary Agenda:

15 min. - Status of working group work items (Jim Whitehead)
1:45 - Discussion of ordered collections and external members (Jim Davis)

If you have any items you'd like to have placed on the agenda, please send 
me an email.

- Jim
