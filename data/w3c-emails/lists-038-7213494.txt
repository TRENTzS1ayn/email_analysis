Good catch!  The 7th paragraph in the discussion in Section 7.1.2 should 
definitely say "has an empty resource type" instead of "has an undefined 
resource type."

The DTD states that only tags src and dst can occur.  However, it is 
certainly our intent to allow other tags to be present as well (this is 
shown in the example in Section 12.10.1).

As a result, (hopefully some XML/SGML people on the list will double-check 
this) the link element declaration should be:

<!ELEMENT link ((#PCDATA | src)+, (#PCDATA | dst)+)>
