LAST WEEK:

*** WORKING GROUP LAST CALL FOR COMMENTS ***

DISTRIBUTED AUTHORING PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION

We are currently at the end of the second of three weeks of the final call 
for comments from the working group on the Distributed Authoring Protocol 
Specification, draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-07.  This last call for comments 
period ends March 27, 1998, at midnight, US Pacific time.

At the end of the last call review period, a new draft will be issued
(revision -08), containing any changes based on comments during the working 
group last call period. Unless there are significant, technical problems
raised with this specification during this last call period, I intend to
submit the -08 draft to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for
their approval.  IESG review involves a (minimum) two week public last call 
for comments period.  This IESG-initiated last call period is in addition
to the working group last call period.

The draft is available in several formats at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/

Note that the ASCII variant of the draft is the authoritative variant, and 
in the event of differences between the ASCII variant and other variants, 
the ASCII variant is always correct.

The initial announcement of this working group last call can be found in 
the archives at:
