7.1.2_empty- In 7.1.2 we refer to an empty resource as undefined not
empty

I have altered the word from undefined to empty as specified below.

However, I must respectfully disagree with my learned colleague on the
matter of the DTD for LINK (I ALWAYS wanted to say that!!! =). As specified
in section 13, paragraph 1, a DAV XML parser MUST ignore any unknown XML
elements. Thus one can put any elements one wants into a link and know that
they will at worst just be ignored. Were we to change the DTD as specified
below we would be forced to put the same change into every DTD production in
our spec in order to specify what we have already specified in section 13.

Good catch!  The 7th paragraph in the discussion in Section 7.1.2 should 
definitely say "has an empty resource type" instead of "has an undefined 
resource type."

The DTD states that only tags src and dst can occur.  However, it is 
certainly our intent to allow other tags to be present as well (this is 
shown in the example in Section 12.10.1).

As a result, (hopefully some XML/SGML people on the list will double-check 
this) the link element declaration should be:

<!ELEMENT link ((#PCDATA | src)+, (#PCDATA | dst)+)>
