The working group last call for comments on the Distributed Authoring 
Protocol specification, draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-07, is now over.  A new 
draft (-08) incorporating feedback received during the last call period 
will now be produced as quickly as possible.

It is my intention to forward the -08 draft on to the IESG for approval 
once it is complete.

- Jim
