To:"'WEBDAV WG'"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

Right on schedule, the W3C XML WG produced a new revision of the XML 
Namespace draft, this time with the status of an official W3C Working Draft 
(WD).

The draft is available at:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xml-names

Although this draft is still subject to modification, Jon Bosak, the Chair 
of the XML WG, has stated:

   The provisional status of the draft notwithstanding, it should be
   noted that the urgent need for this specification on the part of
   working groups in both the W3C and the IETF makes it extremely
   unlikely that any changes to the draft beyond the repair of outright
   errors will be made for the Proposed Recommendation of Version 1.0 of
   the specification.

   It is the current intention of the XML WG to attempt the promotion
   of the Namespaces WD to Proposed Recommendation by the beginning of
   May.

The DAV protocol draft will be updated for the -08 revision to be in-synch 
with the namespace WD.

The most visible change (and the only one which, at present, will affect 
WebDAV prototype implementations) is the change in the XML namespace 
processing instructions.

So, in the DAV protocol spec., there are many instances of:

<?xml:namespace name="DAV:" as="D"?>

These will now become, as of the -08 spec.:

<?xml:namespace ns="DAV:" prefix="D"?>

For completeness, the changes are:

name -> ns
href -> src
as -> prefix
