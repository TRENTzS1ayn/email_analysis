Judy, John, Jim:

How about this:

(1) GET on a reference returns 302 as per John's proposal.
(2) PUT works on a reference, unless what is being put
is not a reference, in which case it fails.

Then, browsers would work, clients could control whether
they are dealing with the reference or the target both for
read and writing.
