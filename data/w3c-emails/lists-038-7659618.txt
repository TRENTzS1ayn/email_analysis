I guess the issue is how detailed the specification of the response entity
should be.

The HTTP 1.1 spec says "Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of
the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the
new URI(s)."

If we stay with this level of detail, we would say that for a GET or HEAD,
the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a
hyperlink to the URI of the target resource.  We could say in addition that
the Content-Type of the response should be text/html, and that it should
also be well-formed XML.

The response to a PUT is a more difficult case.  A DAV-aware client would
probably not have tried to do a PUT to a referential resource in the first
place.  For a non-DAV client, the entity of the response should present the
user with a choice between replacing the target resource and replacing the
reference.  Choosing to replace the target should cause the client to send
the PUT request to the target resource.  Choosing to replace the reference
should cause the client to send a DELETE request to the reference, followed
by a resend of the PUT request.  What does the response entity have to be
like to make this happen?
