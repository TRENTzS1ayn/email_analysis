For the PUT case we could suggest something like the following DTD
snippet:
<!ELEMENT HTML (HEAD, BODY) >
<!ELEMENT HEAD ANY >
<!ELEMENT BODY ( A, A, %TheUsualSuspects; ) >

And prose explaining that the first A is for the target and the second
is for the reference. This way JavaScript can walk into the response and
know where the reference pointed to. This type of stuff is simply hints
to the server coder as to how to code the response entity. The nice part
is that there are no new elements or new attributes on existing HTML
elements.

Ideally, the response entity will be irrelevant; the Location: header
will
suffice.

I agree. I'm just trying to help adoption on the low end by enabling
JavaScript. I'm not trying to suggest core protocol stuff be dependent
on the response entity.
