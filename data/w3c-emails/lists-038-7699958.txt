The IETF has approved the media types text/xml and application/xml.

Now the draft goes to the RFC editor, who will do some formatting tweaks,
and will assign it an RFC number before releasing it as part of the RFC
series.  But this is mostly mechanical -- the draft has been approved by the
IESG.

This is important for WebDAV, since the one public comment we received
during our last call period on the Distributed Authoring Protocol was a
concern about WebDAV using text/xml without this media type having yet been
registered by IANA (which requires IESG approval for IETF tree media types
like text/xml).  This removes one of the major roadblocks for approval of
the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol.
