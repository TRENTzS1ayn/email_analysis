During the Redmond meeting, John Turner took some pictures with his digital
camera, which I have put up on the Web at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/redmond/pictures/

I did my best to put names to faces in the pictures -- let me know if I've
made any errors, and I'll fix them right away.
