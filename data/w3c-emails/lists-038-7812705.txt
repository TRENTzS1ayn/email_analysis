One question to ask is whether we gain any significant functionality by
requiring support for direct as well as indirect references.

Another is what sorts of references are supported by the file systems and
DMSs that are likely to stand behind WebDAV servers.  How easy or difficult
will it be for these systems to map their referencing to what WebDAV
provides?  If we can count an most having support for indirect references,
there is less reason to provide direct references in WebDAV.  If
significant numbers of these systems support only direct references, then
maybe there is good reason for WebDAV to support direct references.
