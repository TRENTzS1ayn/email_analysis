Jim, you were absolutely right, we got a bug in the spec.

Insert after section 6.1:

"6.2 Write Locks and Lock Tokens

A successful request for an exclusive or shared write lock MUST result in
the generation of a unique lock token associated with the requesting
principal. Thus if five principals have a shared write lock on the same
resource then there will be five outstanding unique lock tokens."

Add to the end of the last paragraph in section 7.10.1:

"If the LOCK request was for a new lock and was successful then the
Lock-Token response header MUST be included in the response in order to
indicate the lock token associated with the newly created lock. That is, the
Lock-Token header would not be returned with a successful refresh LOCK
request because a new lock wasn't created."

Replace Section 8.5 with:

"8.5 Lock-Token Header

Lock-Token = "Lock-Token" ":" Coded-URL

The Lock-Token request header is used with the UNLOCK method to identify the
lock to be removed.  The lock token in the Lock-Token request header MUST
identify a lock that contains the resource identified by the Request-URI as
a member.

The Lock-Token response header is used with the LOCK method to indicate the
lock token created as a result of a successful LOCK request to create a new
lock."

For the record I believe this error made it into the spec because at the
last minute I proposed and the group accepted removing the lock-token
response header as it was "redundant" because we returned the lockdiscovery
information in all LOCK responses. As you discovered Jim, the header was not
redundant at all because we do not yet have a mechanism for generically
identifying principals.

What I'm now wondering is if Jim is the only one who has tried to implement
shared locks. I figure he must be or this one would have shown up earlier.

Normally finding an error of this magnitude would earn you an entry in the
Acknowledgement section, but you are already there. I don't suppose we can
just buy you off with a Microsoft DAV T-shirt? =)
