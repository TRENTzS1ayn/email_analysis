Since the spec. is silent on the issue of attributes, and certainly does not
specify any standard way to interpret attributes (e.g., to perform content
negotiation), any such use of attributes would certainly be non-standard.
However, I don't see where there is language that would make it illegal
either.

My recommendation to implementers is that they write XML parsers which can
accept attributes in any XML element they encounter in a DAV protocol
stream, but since the WebDAV specification does not give them any meaning,
they can be safely ignored in all DAV: schema elements.  For non-DAV schema
elements, especially for XML property values, any attributes encountered
should certainly be preserved, as they may affect the meaning of the XML
element.
