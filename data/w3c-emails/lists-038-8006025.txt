Certainly this is necessary in a product; but I don't think
it's necessary in the standard.  Generally, servers come
with administrative UIs or utilities; those UIs could
provide this functionality however they desire.  Come to
that, some/many DAV servers will be built around existing
document management systems; such servers could be
implemented in such a way that you could just delete the
lock in the DMS.  (It wouldn't be automatic; it would
require the DAV server to consult with the DMS to verify the
lock was still valid every time it was used.)
