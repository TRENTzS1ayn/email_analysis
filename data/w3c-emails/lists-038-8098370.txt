You're responding so fast that our e-mails are crossing
on the wire. Thank you very much.

OK, so servers can make up any rules about live properties
that they want to (or not). Good. But there is no way called out 
by the spec. to publish such rules in WebDAV that I have 
noticed. That would seem to make such rules out of band 
vis a vis the spec.

What about a property based rule that says, "Live (a) property X
must always be copied when you copy the underlying resource,
and the copy must also be live (a)." Such a rule would
seem to conflict with an "omit" tag for property X
in the protocol when copying the underlying resource. Section
11.12.2 doesn't seem to address this conflict, so how is it 
resolved -- the client proposes, the server disposes?
(The destination server would have to enforce the rule, I 
guess.) Any error codes, e.g., 412?
