The elements owner, prop, and resourcetype are declared  ANY.  The XML spec
section 3.2 says that ANY means "any declared element type", but as I
understand this, this would exclude character data from appearing in the
element.  I think at least the first two should be declared to be Mixed
instead.

Any XML experts care to comment?
