ANY allows anything, character data or any element.

Subject: Should ANY in WebDAV DTD be Mixed

The elements owner, prop, and resourcetype are declared  ANY.  The XML spec
section 3.2 says that ANY means "any declared element type", but as I
understand this, this would exclude character data from appearing in the
element.  I think at least the first two should be declared to be Mixed
instead.

Any XML experts care to comment?
