The rest of the document could, however, be valid.

This is one of those things that the (I hope) forthcoming work on 
schemas in XML will address. I certainly think it would be generally 
useful to be able to validate part of a document, and let the content 
model of the rest of the document be relatively open.

Not really, since the DTD is at least a guide for the rest of the 
document, and a sufficiently sophisticated application should be 
able to validate that part of the document that does match the DTD, 
even though it would not be able to validate the entire document.
