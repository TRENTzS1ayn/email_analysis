Why not just lock the resource and overwrite it contents?

Subject: Deletes and Constraints

Hope this hasn't been asked/answered already, but...
Let's say I want to delete an object, but I also want/need to create a new one
to replace the deleted one.  Due to some constraints in the system the delete
and the create must be done within the same transaction - is there anyway to
do this with the current level of support in WebDAV?  It would seem like the
need for a multi-part request should be fairly common.
