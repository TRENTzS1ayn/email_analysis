WebDAV replies are never intended for direct human viewing, right?  Is
there a reason then that the WebDAV spec uses text/xml and does not even
mention application/xml?  It seems to me that the latter is closer to the
intended use of WebDAV XML (as opposed to XML markup that's embedded in HTML).

If this is right, the spec should say that a WebDAV server MUST accept both
application/xml and text/xml, and MUST generate application/xml.

Would this be good, aside from the fact that it would require change to
some existing softwares?
