Does the WebDAV data model for properties say anything at all about the
significance of attributes?  In particular, if a client does a PROPPATCH
and specifies an attribute, will that attribute be returned by the PROPFIND?

The reason I am concerned is that to compare two strings that hold natural
language values (as opposed to, say, a date expressed in ISO 8601) one must
know the language in which the strings were stored.  The xml:lang attribute
(section 2.12 of the XML draft) seems ideal for this, but only if WebDAV
requires servers to preserve this attribute in property values.

If WebDAV does not requires this of *all* servers, would there be objection
to stating that WebDAV servers that also support the DASL extensions MUST
preserve this attribute?
