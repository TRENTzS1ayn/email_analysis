The IANA content type categorizations have never been particularly
usefull wrt text. According to the rules html should have been 
application/html since it is not ascii text...

I would recommend text/xml since if the DTD is declared a generic
xml text viewer could well make a decent job at presenting the
content and in general XML is aimed as a text markup language..
