There was never a requirement that text/* be ASCII. On the other hand,
'application/html' is more appropriate for HTML 4.0, because HTML
now includes script tags and other processing elements that are not
merely text and its annotations but program.
I would favor the registration of application/html, however. Let's
not compound the error by making it again.

This is not a good argument; you could configure your system to view
application/xml as well as text/xml. It's more of an issue of security
considerations.
