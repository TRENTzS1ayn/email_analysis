Hello,
We have been developing electronic forms for mainstream organizations for some time now. We have shown business how to save money and increase productivity using our forms again and again. 

During all of this time we have noticed that not all employees have been able to take advantage of our product. For the last year this has all changed. Our form solutions have allowed people with accessibility needs to take advantage of electronic forms, and have found that they can then be allowed to be every bit as productive as thier counterpart employees.

Our objective has become one of offering ALL employees the opportunity to be competitively employed. The barrier of being able to complete the paperwork used by a business, will not be an issue for any employee. In addition, the employer will recieve soft cost productivity savings and hard cost forms savings.

We want to make you aware of our products, and to be part of the solution for keeping people employed and businesses productive. Our forms have been seen at Closing the Gap, Microsoft Accessibility days, and the CSUN Conference.

For your review, we have a sample of our software product with a few forms at the following web site:  www.futureforms.com/jetweb.htm

If we can be of service to you please let us know. We can be reached toll free 1-888-786-6455, ext. 227, or by e-mail to bsahlberg@futureforms.com

Sincerely,

Bill Sahlberg,
FutureForms
