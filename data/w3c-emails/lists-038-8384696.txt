Indeed, I expect this to be the cause of endless pain and suffering down the
road. In what is essentially a repeat of the POST vs. new method debate I
expect many newbies to try to implement their function calls by setting and
getting properties rather than introducing new methods.

In the case of live properties, however, there is a fully justified reason
to provide features such as value validation. This is very similar to what
LDAP can do where one can submit the equivalent of a DTD and expect the
server to enforce that syntax for you. I suspect one day we will add this
feature to DAV.

In addition I generally think it is o.k. to use properties to retrieve
status information, just not to write it. So if you want to check if your
nuclear power plant is overloading by pulling down the "Kaboom" property,
more power to you. Just don't try to set the temperature by writing to that
property location.

It sounds to me as if live properties are analogous to CGI:
PROPPATCH/PROPFIND (POST/GET) become generalized function calls, rather than
accessors.
