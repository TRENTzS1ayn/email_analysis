In attempting to explain WebDAV to others and get support from upper management, I decided to put together a fairly simple summary of what WebDAV is, what functionality it offers, and the general architecture.  I am attaching the first draft (a Word 97 document) and would appreciate any and all feedback.

I am most interested in being corrected in any place where I am wrong.  I always find it useful to try and translate the technical language of a spec into everyday language, but in so doing I'm sure I've missed the target on some of the points.  Please point out anything that appears to be in error.  THANKS!

p.s. If any of you have need for a similar summary, you can feel free to use this one for whatever needs you have.
