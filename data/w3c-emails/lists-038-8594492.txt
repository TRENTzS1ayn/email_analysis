As a general principle, a property should never contain anything that has
identity independent of the resource to which the property is attached.
In such situations, it is always preferable to use a link to the resource
that defines the property contents, since that allows sharing and caching
of properties among many resources.

An ACL is one example of something that has identity beyond that of 
a single resource.  In fact, the common case is to associate one ACL
with an entire tree of resources.
