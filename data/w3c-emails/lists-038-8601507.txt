I wouldn't allow that.  If the server is maintaining the source file
under a different URL than the GET, then a PUT on the latter URL should
result in an error or redirection to the source URL.  The server can
determine that from the URL and content of the PUT.  Otherwise the
author is likely to be confused about what is being authored.

This is also a key issue for deployment, since older tools might be
mistakenly used to modify and PUT the generated content rather
than the source content.  It also makes access control easier.
