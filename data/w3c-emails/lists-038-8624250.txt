The issue has been raised here about whether we might be making a
mistake by encoding some of our request parameters in XML entity bodies.
The thought is that this may force proxies to read the body of the
message, something that they should not have to do.

I guess there are several questions here:

Are we currently forcing proxies to read message bodies?  Are any of the
parameters that are now in the message body ones that proxies have to
know about?  If so, should we make some changes?

Should we express some design principle for future revisions of the
spec, about not putting into the message body any parameters a proxy
might need to read?

Should we consider a more extreme position (that would require
significant changes to the current spec):  Never put request parameters
in the message body?
