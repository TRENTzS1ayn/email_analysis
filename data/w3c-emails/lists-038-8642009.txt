Roy, You say, "IF the server is maintaining the source file under a
differnt URL than GET..."  That's what I said in my proposal, but is
that what we're typically going to be seeing?  I have no idea. It's
just the first WEBDAV'ish way that I thought of for handling it.  Let
me know if your expectations are.  Anyone.

I think I understand what you're saying here.  "latter URL" here means the
one who's GET results in processing of the SSI.

I don't think I understand what you're saying here.  Determine what?
Determine if it's an old fashion PUT or a WebDAV PUT?  I'd appreciate
it if you restated this.  I don't know what "that" refers to.

Again.  I'd appreciate it if you said what "It" is... and if not
then obvious, why "[IT] makes access control easier".
