The next meeting of the WebDAV Working Group will be held at the Chicago
IETF, August 23-28, 1998.  Details and registration information for the
Chicago IETF meeting can be found at:

http://www.ietf.org/meetings/IETF-42.html

The latest agenda for the IETF meeting, available at:

http://www.ietf.org/meetings/agenda_chic.txt

has scheduled the WebDAV meeting on Thursday, August 27, from 1-3PM.

The DASL meeting is currently scheduled for Tuesday, August 25, from 1-2PM.

At present, the agenda for the WebDAV WG meeting will have discussion of
advanced collections requirements and protocol, and versioning.  I expect
that this will be the last WG meeting where the advanced collections
requirements will be discussed, as they are near completion.
