The rule was "It goes in the header unless you have a damn good reason to do
otherwise."

Put in more detail:

If     (it involves cachability it goes into the headers) exit; 
elseif (it is likely to be something a firewall would want to examine it
goes into the headers) exit;
elseif (it must be used with a method that already has a defined body then
it goes into the headers) exit;
elseif (it encodes information that is very likely to be expanded on later
then it goes in the body) exit;
elseif (it has potentially unlimited length then it goes into the body)
exit;

The second to last rule reflects the difficult of encoding the DAV message
model in a header without re-inventing XML for headers. The last rule
reflects the reality that most proxy/firewall implementations will barf if
headers get larger than around 4k. This also effects performance. Once a
proxy/firewall hits content length it can just blindly start passing bits,
which is very fast. If you have mega huge headers you slow down every single
proxy/firewall on the path for info it may not care about.

As always, it is a judgement call.
