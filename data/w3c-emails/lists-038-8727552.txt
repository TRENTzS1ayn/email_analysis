It is the way I would implement it.  Apache already does the dual URL
thing for directory indexes, content negotiation, and a variety of
other handlers for indirectly produced content.

Yep.

The server can tell the difference between a mistaken PUT on a derived
resource and a PUT intended for the source resource, usually by looking
at the content-type of the PUT request.  This isn't going to happen very
often since there are not many non-WebDAV PUT-enabled tools.

In any case, my point was that it is easier to control access to a
generated resource if the source handle and generator handle are two
different URI.  It is also much easier to explain to a user, since
the source can be moved around as a file, whereas the generator handle
is just a mapping in the server namespace.
