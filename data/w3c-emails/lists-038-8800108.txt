Judy,

I think that's an accurate characterization. If by "HTTP URL" you mean a
reference beginning with "http://", then we are using http urls. The
issue for us is that in existing products, there are (at least) two ways
of browsing hierarchical collections and the current phrasing in the
WebDAV draft appears to disallow all of them but one. Standard web
servers use the hierarchical, path-oriented URL syntax which WebDAV
appears to require. However, most document management / groupware
systems I'm familiar with reference collections and files based on a
unique ID, typically an integer, that is assigned to each resource.
Using CGI or other access vehicle, these systems manage the hierarchical
content themselves rather than basing the hierarchy on the underlying
file system.  However, the content is still hierarchical in the
traditional sense. It's simply that each node in the hierarchy is
referenced by ID rather than by path. From what I see in the draft, all
of the functionality defined by WebDAV still works with a
reference-by-ID model. PROPFIND can still return information on all of
the members of a collection resource, etc.  So why the couple sentences
requiring the hierarchical URL syntax? It doesn't seem necessary -
everything else in the draft still works as far as I can tell - and it
has the potential to cause a lot of problems for vendors that have
traditionally always used a reference-by-ID model.

Well, from the examples they provided, it looks as if they *are* using
an http URL in the sense that it starts with "http:"  But the claim is
that their namespace is significantly different from the traditional
file system directory hierarchy that we think of as being behind an HTTP
server.  So that even though they think of the objects they manage as
being hierarchically organized, it works better for them to use a flat
URL of the form "http://<dms-namespace>/<object-handle>".  Are they
still compliant if they do this?

Brian and Mitch, feel free to join the conversation if I'm not making
your case clear.
