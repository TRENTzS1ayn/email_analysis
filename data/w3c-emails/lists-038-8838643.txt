It's unclear to me to what degree Alan's later post in this thread ("Yes.")
reflects a retractment of this position, so let me add my voice to John
Stracke's in saying that in my view WebDAV has a strong requirement to
provide authoring support for both human and mechanically generated
variants.  The Web provides retrieval functionality for variants, and our
authoring support should allow most common variant cases to be remotely
authored.

But, I sense that there may have been a terminology mix-up between Web and
Document Management use of the terms variant, document, and resource, which
seems to have been resolved, so I won't beat this issue any further.
