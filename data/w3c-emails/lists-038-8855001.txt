Yeah, well, a filename is an internal identifier, too.  :-)

Actually, even with CGI, you can have URLs that look like heirarchies.  Given
the above script, if you do a DELETE on
http://demo.opentext.com/livelink/livelink/nodes/22278, then the script will be
invoked with PATH_INFO set to "/nodes/22278" and REQUEST_METHOD set to
"DELETE".  Some HTTP servers block methods they don't know about, but others
(e.g., Apache) just pass them right through.
