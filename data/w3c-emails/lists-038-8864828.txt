*** WORKING GROUP LAST CALL FOR COMMENTS ***

ADVANCED COLLECTIONS REQUIREMENTS

Requirements for advanced collections capability within WebDAV have been
discussed at length on the mailing list, and at three successive WebDAV
face-to-face meetings.  It is my opinion as Chair that this document is
ready for final review, followed by submission to the IESG for approval as
an Informational RFC.

This is the final call for comments from the working group on the document,
"Requirements for Advanced Collection Functionality in WebDAV", by Judith
Slein and Jim Davis, <draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-02>.  This last
call for comments period begins immediately, and ends Sunday, August 30, at
midnight Pacific time.  This allows over 3 weeks for comments, including the
opportunity to make comments at the Chicago IETF meeting.

At the end of the last call period, a new draft will be issued
(revision -03), containing any changes based on comments received during the
working group last call period.  Unless there are significant technical
problems raised with this document during the last call period, I intend to
submit the -03 draft to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for
approval as an Informational RFC.

Details on the procedures used to develop IETF documents can be found in RFC
2026, which can be retrieved at:

ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2026.txt

If there are any procedural questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to
contact me, or raise an issue on the list.

Chair, IETF WEBDAV Working Group
