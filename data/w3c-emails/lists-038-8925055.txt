Mmm, yeah.  Personally, though, I'd say that this approach is suboptimal in many cases--for example, if multiple users have access to that leaf node, then you run the risk of lost updates, and you can't tell who made every change.  I'd prefer to see stuff like this done via a scratch area.

EvilNastyIcky!

One major advantage of versioning is that it lets you do audits.  If you're versioning your source code, and somebody complains that it breaks only when they've got their username set to "John Smith", you can go back in the code and find out that Joe Blow put in a poison easter egg because he hated somebody named John Smith.  If you're versioning your Web site, and somebody accuses you of having put child porn on it, you can check back at every version that's ever existed and prove that you didn't.  These capabilities break down if you can edit non-leaf nodes.  I take your point about not restricting the servers too much; but this sort of functionality is so vital that I would prefer to make sure the protocol can't be asked to break it.

That's what branching is for.
