A new revision of the access control goals (formerly requirements) document,
"WebDAV Access Control Goals", <draft-ietf-webdav-acl-reqts-01.txt>, has
been submitted as an Internet-Draft, and will be available from the I-D
directory in a few days.  It is also accessible from the WebDAV home page,
at:

Thanks go out to Lisa Lippert for her hard work revising this document based
on feedback from the list, and from the Redmond meeting.

As always, your comments on this draft are very appreciated.
