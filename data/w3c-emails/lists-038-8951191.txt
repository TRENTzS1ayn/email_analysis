To:"WebDAV list"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

From a practical point of view, what is the status of the WebDAV work?
Specifically:

1. Are major vendors, either of web servers or of distributed
authoring/asset management products, participating? Is there any indication
that the proposed HTTP extensions will in fact be adopted?

2. Are the basic HTTP 1.1 methods (PUT/DELETE) any better supported than PUT
was in HTTP 1.0? There were a whole lot of FTP workarounds written due to
the fact that PUT was never reliably implemented.

3. Has anyone thought about tunneling the WebDAV protocol on top of HTTP
without extensions? This would allow real-world tools to be implemented
without waiting for basic infrastructure changes?
