Our PCDOCS products leave the choice up to the administrator.  As Bruce
says, there are customers who want to be able to change non-leaf nodes.  If
WebDAV forces this it will reduce its usefulness for our products and customers.

require this would break the model of any DMS out there that currently
leaves it to the user.

cases, administrators are very much against the automatic versioning because
of the disk space required to maintain such a system (unless you only save
diffs, which isn't the case with us).
