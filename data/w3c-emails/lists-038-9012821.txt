Would not references solve the problem? Your entire namespace is flat and
your collections contain nothing but references.

Actually, even with CGI, you can have URLs that look like heirarchies.
Given
the above script, if you do a DELETE on
http://demo.opentext.com/livelink/livelink/nodes/22278, then the script will
be
invoked with PATH_INFO set to "/nodes/22278" and REQUEST_METHOD set to
"DELETE".  Some HTTP servers block methods they don't know about, but others
(e.g., Apache) just pass them right through.
