Thanks for your comments.  I agree that we need to make clear that
references are to resources, not to locations.

The problem about what we mean by direct references is a more difficult
one.  It certainly needs to be thought through more carefully than it
has been so far.

One approach that we could take is to stay with a very strict definition
of direct reference: one for which no operations are passed through to
the target.  Then treat direct and indirect references as marking the
ends of a continuum, where in between are references for which some
operations are passed through.  We could require that the protocol be
able to represent direct references, indirect references, or anything in
between (be able to say which operations will be passed through for any
particular reference).

Or we might be able to reach consensus on one or a small set of
reference types that are really useful and must be supported by the
protocol (not necessarily by servers).  Indirect references are
certainly useful.  Maybe another useful type of reference passes through
these operations:

PROPFIND
PROPPATCH
PUT
GET
POST
HEAD
DELETE
MOVE
COPY

But does not pass through:

Any operation on the parent collection
MKREF
DELREF

A third useful type of reference might pass through:

PROPFIND
PROPPATCH
PUT
GET
POST
HEAD

But not pass through:

DELETE
MOVE
COPY
Any operation on the parent collection
MKREF
DELREF
