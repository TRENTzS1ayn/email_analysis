FYI, a birds-of-a-feather (BOF) meeting will be held at the Chicago Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting on the topic of Internet event
notifications.  This meeting will be held Tuesday, August 25, from 9AM to
10AM.

Within the IETF, a BOF meeting such as this is a typical precursor to the
formation of a working group to develop an interoperability standard.

Details on the Chicago IETF meeting, which is being held at the Sheraton
Chicago, 301 East North Water Street, including how to register, can be
found at:

A brief desription, and proposed agenda for the BOF are given below.

Event Notification Service BOF

Description:

There appears to be significant interest in Internet-scale event
notifications.  Event notifications are useful in many domains, including
web authoring, instant messaging, buddy lists, workflow, and internet
printing.  While efforts are well underway to develop a standard protocol
for instant messaging and personal presence, requirements for notification
services in other domains suggest the need for development of an
interoperable protocol for the registration, initiation, and transport of
Internet event notifications.

This BOF aims to develop a better understanding among the different
communities of interest, elicit scenarios of use for an event notification
service, refine requirements for an event notification service, and
enumerate the application domains that will benefit from an event
notification service, and discussion of how standardization will occur in
this area.  The BOF will also contain a report from the recent Workshop on
Internet Scale Event Notifications (WISEN), held in mid-July.

Chair:

Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine <ejw@ics.uci.edu>
(for this BOF meeting only; chair to be selected when chartered)

Agenda:

Report from Workshop on Internet Scale Event Notifications (WISEN) (15 min.)
