Yes, that could be done.  It would allow the documents and collections to be
presented.  Unfortunately edit operations would be something of a problem.
A generic WebDAV client would find it a difficult space to work with.  The
only place that documents can be created is in the collection representing
the flat set of documents.  The server would either have to disallow PUTing
(etc) of documents anywhere but in the proper directory, or else magic would
have to happen (accepting the PUT and then moving it and creating a
reference, or some such).
