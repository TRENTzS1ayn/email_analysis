We need to be aware of the difference between UI and protocol. 

The WebDAV protocol provides the various mechanisms you need to perform the
actions you want. Creating a flat namespace, putting resources into
collections defined in that namespace, the use of error codes to enforce the
flat namespace, etc. However WebDAV does not provide the UI that would make
such a store sensible to a user.

Thus users interacting with your store will need to use programs which
present your stores in a reasonable way. Otherwise you will have to
synthesize a mapping of your flat store into a hierarchical store. That is,
the actual store is flat but you create a phantom store that looks
hierarchical. It is not the protocol which is forcing you to do this, it is
the types of clients people are writing to use the protocol.

If the general user population decides your model is the best one then
clients will interact with DAV stores using your model.

However, to be clear, this is not a protocol issue. It is a UI issue.
