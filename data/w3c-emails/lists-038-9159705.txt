To some extent I agree, it is a UI issue.  The point of my two previous
submissions is that while it is possible to represent the document store as
a flat space, it is not very useful to users with a generic WebDAV client,
because of the restrictions made on what kind of operations they are allowed
to do.  One of the points of WebDAV is that this kind of interoperability is
important.  We specifically do NOT want to have more than one "model" of
basic user interaction although clearly a client that understands how to do
more than the basics when talking to the "right" server is fine.

On the other hand it is not correct to say that this is not a protocol
issue.  It is an issue of mapping from one model to another and the choices
made in the WebDAV protocol that make this mapping difficult are exactly the
point.

One significant problem with mapping the documents space into a hierarchy is
that, depending on the undelying system, cycles may be possible in the
document's collections, leading to a possibly infinite hierarchy.  The
protocol document does not address what to do with an infinite space when
asked to do a PROPFIND with depth="infinity".  Clearly it has to return a
finite result, but the choice of where to stop and what it should return at
the point of stopping are issues that should be agree upon.
