I don't understand what you are asking WebDAV to do. WebDAV provides a
feature, the ability to create hierarchical spaces, you choose not to allow
access to that feature, such is your right. WebDAV's requirements on the
matter are mostly written in the form of "If a URL is hierarchical then it
MUST do the following." If you don't use hierarchical URLs then there is no
issue.

As for cycles and such, I would refer you to the excellent work done by Judy
Slein and Jim Davis in their requirements draft for advanced collection
functionality, it covers references
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-02.t
xt) and specifically addresses the issue of cycles as well as depth
operations on references in collections.
