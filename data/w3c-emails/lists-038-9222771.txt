Yaron,

I don't understand what's 'quite complex' about suggesting that there
be a DAV:parents property and that interoperable clients that want to
work with the typical document management based systems as well as
file-server based systems should use PROPFIND of DAV:parents in order
to walk up the hierarchy, rather than just trying to parse the URL
tree. It's simple, backward compatible, doesn't cost much in terms of
server implementation, and much more resiliant.

Yes, there's a hierarchy, and yes, if you use it, there's a clear
way to use it, but that's very different from _requiring_ that the
hierarchy be used.

Put the burden of understanding the hierarchical forms on the servers,
not on the clients.

Larry
