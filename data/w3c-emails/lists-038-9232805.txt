Mainly it's terrific.  Good decisions about what's in and out of scope.  A
few comments:

1) In several places the ID uses the phrase "a resource or collection".  I
suggest just using the term "resource", since a collection is a kind of
resource.  The existing language implies that the two are disjoint, and
might leave some doubt as to the status of (potentially future) sub types
of resource, e.g. referential resources, versioning portals, etc.

2) Would 6.3 be clearer if it were defined in terms of the actual HTTP and
WebDAV method names (GET, PUT, DELETE) instead of generic actions ('alter
the body of a resource', 'add a child to a collection', etc)?

3) Shouldn't 6.3 also say something about 
 - retrieving the body of a resource (e.g. GET)
 - retrieving the value of a property (e.g. PROPFIND)

4) In 7.1, it is not clear whether the term 'reset' means "clear" or "set
all again".  I assume the latter is intended from the justification, but
could be wrong.

best regards

Jim
