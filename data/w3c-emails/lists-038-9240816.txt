Yaron,
   Perhaps I'm saying the same thing as Larry, but I'll say it slightly
differently.  I'd like to understand more clearly why we REQUIRE that all
resources have parent resources.  The answer is probably trivial, but I'd
like to hear it explicitly.   The only thing I've explicitly heard so far
is a comment that it "simplifies the protocol".  If that's the only reason,
I, like Larry, would like to know how.

I don't like WebDAV making that requirement on the URI namespace,  but let
me play my own devil's advocate...

Anyone,
   So if the WebDAV spec requires parentage, and if I don't want to build
my server to require explicit parentage, why couldn't I write the server to
automaticly make parent collections when a URI deep in the name space
hierachy is created.   And couldn't I set up those implicitly created
collections to behave as "invalid URL's" to ordinary user GET requests?
Similarly, couldn't implement the same thing at the WebDAV client end
without modifying the WebDAV protocol *at all* if that's what my UI
required?  BTW, I am assuming that we have strong indirect references
available to implement this.  Reasonable assumption?

Jason.
