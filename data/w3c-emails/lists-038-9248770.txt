I've received a bit of feedback indicating interest in holding a breakout
session on Advanced Collections at the Chicago IETF meeting, so that people
interested in hashing out design issues on the advanced collections protocol
will have enough time for this.

Given how busy the schedule is, undoubtedly any time I pick will be bad for
someone, but looking at the schedule Wednesday afternoon, from 3:30PM to
5:30PM looks very promising.  Right now this slot contains:

1530-1730  Afternoon Sessions II
 Michigan AB  APP  fax        Internet Fax WG
 Sheraton 1   APP  ldup       LDAP Duplication/Replication Update Protocol
BOF
 Mississippi  INT  ipvbi      IP Over VBI WG
 Arkansas     INT  ip1394     IP Over IEEE 1394 WG
 Superior AB  OPS  agentx     SNMP Agent Extensibility WG
 Sheraton 2   RTG  rtgarea    Routing Area Meeting
 Sheraton 4   TSV  avt        Audio/Video Transport WG *
 Sheraton 5   TSV  tcpsat     TCP Over Satellite WG *

This doesn't have any obvious overlaps with WebDAV or HTTP.

Unless I hear a huge groundswell of opposition, let's plan on holding the
BOF session from 3:30PM to 5:30PM on Wednesday, topic: Advanced Collections
protocol.

I'm not sure where we'll hold this meeting -- once we're on-site I'll have a
much better idea of where such a meeting could be held.  A lobby/hotel bar
of some sort is a good possibility, unless someone gets a suite and wants to
volunteer its use...
