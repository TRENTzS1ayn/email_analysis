All of the problems you identified were problems with using PROPPATCH,
not with using PROPFIND. So how does a read-only property suffer from
'the problems identified', when all of those problems are problems associated
with writing.

As for 'the more complete solution the versioning group is tasked with
providing', this is a classic 'reducing to a previously unsolved problem'.

In fact, this doesn't seem to have much to do with versioning at all,
so it's not clear how the versioning group is tasked to providing a solution
to it.
