Versioning is about maintaining a state graph. In a versioning state graph
links are of type "version" and have a set of associated behaviors, such as,
once created they can not be changed.

Handle based naming systems also maintain a state graph. In a handle based
naming system the links are of type "contains". They also have associated
behaviors, such as, they can change at will and need to be versionable.
(Which brings up the fun problem of how do you version a link when
versioning is expressed with links? I smell a compound format in our future,
make sure those link names are actually just the DAV object model and all
sorts of cool things become possible)

What I am suggesting is that the versioning group is creating a set of very
basic tools to allow for graph manipulation. Their concentration is on a
particular link type, version. However as we are working on versioning we
need to keep in mind that there are other link types and ensure we do not
prevent groups such as the handles folks from being able to leverage the
versioning work by introducing their own link types and associated
behaviors.

Think of the versioning graph manipulation work as a foundation upon which
others, such as the handles group, can build.

P.S. Larry, I hope this answers your question regarding why I think
versioning and handles are related.
