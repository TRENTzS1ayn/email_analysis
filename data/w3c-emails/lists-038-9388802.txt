Architecting WebDAV to enforce the effect of the statement "declaring that
version 1.13 descends from version 1.1 instead of 1.12, which means you lose
the audit trail that versioning provides" is going to limit its use in the
real world: people make mistakes and manipulation to correct the effect of
incorrectly submitting a version needs to be available.
