Regarding the statement

"people make mistakes and manipulation to correct the effect of
incorrectly submitting a version needs to be available."

I must point out that such a mechanism already exists in WebDAV. It
involves only resubmitting the correct version. To illustrate a very
simple case...

1.User checks in a new version (version 1.1)
2.User realizes that this was the wrong document to
check-in.
3.User checks in a new version with the right document
(version 1.2)

Not only is the audit trail preserved, but the the effect of submitting
a version incorrectly has been corrected.

Architecting WebDAV to enforce the effect of the statement "declaring
that
version 1.13 descends from version 1.1 instead of 1.12, which means you
lose
the audit trail that versioning provides" is going to limit its use in
the
real world: people make mistakes and manipulation to correct the effect
of
incorrectly submitting a version needs to be available.
