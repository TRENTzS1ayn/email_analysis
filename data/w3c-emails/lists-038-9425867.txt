Uhh, please tell me what you mean by "programmatic".  

In case I was not clear, what I propose is that when the server sucessfully
processes a MKREF where the target is T, it also changes the state of  T so
that a subsequent PROPFIND of T will show the reference R in T's
dav:references property.

I don't see how this is any different than the way LOCK changes the state
of the locked resource so that lock discovery property will return the lock.

I am certainly not proposing a property that has side-effects.

If what I am proposing is "programmatic" please explain why it is undesirable.
