The problem is that, for many/most applications, that audit trail is vital,
even legally required, so I'd really rather have a protocol that doesn't let
you mess with it.  The implementation might provide an admin interface for
doing such corrections--at a minimum, we can never stop the admin from going to
the filesystem and tweaking things by hand--but it should not be possible for
an ordinary user with a DAV client.
