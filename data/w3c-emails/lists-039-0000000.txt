   WebDAV can introduce new methods to implement its favorable PUT and DELETE.

This would make WebDAV useless to downlevel clients (e.g. browsers not
built specifically to support WebDAV).  Requiring a new header to indicate
WebDAV semantics has the same effect.

The HTTP spec makes it clear that it is up to the server to decide
which requests will succeed.  It only defines what it means for a
request to succeed.  This means that existing HTTP clients should be
prepared for requests to fail.  The fact that WebDAV makes certain
requests fail in a regular fashion for detectable reasons does not
violate either the letter or intent of the HTTP spec.

Cheers,
Geoff
