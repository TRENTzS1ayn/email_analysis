I say again: it is not clear that the meaning is totally different.

But your "if" clause evaluates to false.

But it's pretty close to theoretical, because the client-side changes to switch from "do
a PUT and know that it'll create a collection" to "do a MKCOL followed by a PUT" are
trivial.

Consistency with *itself*--it's important that a DAV client be able to know what's going
to happen when it does a PUT.  It also helps with access control: it allows an
administrator to say, "Only these people can do MKCOL" and know that nobody else will be
able to create collections.

I assert again that we are not redefining anything; that the changes you see are totally
consistent with the HTTP/1.1 spec.

No, by requiring special access rights for Depth=infinity.
