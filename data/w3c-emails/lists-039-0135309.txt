But HTTP/1.1 also does not require that servers create those intermediate
collections. Your point is bogus... you're simply relying on some
precedent rather than the specification.

As a server author myself, I have stated that my response to PUT will
return an error if you PUT to a collection that doesn't exist. Forget DAV
-- that is my statement for PUT itself. I don't believe you have a basis
to tell me that my response is incorrect.

Ergo, why is this issue w.r.t. PUT being argued? Server authors are free
to return an error in this scenario.
(DAV simply states they must.)
