But since *some* servers do not create the intermediate collections (as
you and Yoram have stated), isn't it a requirement that HTTP/1.1 clients
need to somehow deal with them?

Since they must deal with them, then why is it a problem that a certain
subset of the servers they work against will exhibit this behavior? (those
declaring Class 1 DAV conformance)
