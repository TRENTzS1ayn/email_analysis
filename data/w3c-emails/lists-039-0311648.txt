I don't follow what you are saying here.

You can do whatever you want but that doesn't mean that everybody else
thinks that this is the right thing. The purpose of a specification is to
allow people to interoperate without inflicting "sanity rules" of whatever
you feel is the right thing to do at the moment.

which is fine

>(DAV simply states they must.)

which is broken as I have pointed out. The notion of whether a resource
exists or not depends on who is looking. The example that I gave leaves the
client no means of knowing whether the server complied with the
specification or not.
