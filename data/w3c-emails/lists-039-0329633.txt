No, the server preserves the order that the client established.

In the base WebDAV spec, the state of a collection includes the set of
members, but not the order of elements in the set.  Hence a server could
return a different (random) order each time.  In an ordered collection, the
state includes not only the set but also the order.

The server does not know the meaning of the order, and does nothing to
enforce it.  It just promises not to randomize it.

Is this clear now?

If you think Judy's language was confusing please suggest better language
that would have made this clearer.

Best regards

Jim
