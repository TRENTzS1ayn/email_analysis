I definitely think besteffort vs. atomic operation is very valid
real-world scenario. What we have done is added an XML tag called sync,
whose value determines the behaviour for the PROPPATCH, PROPFIND or
SEARCH methods. So the XML element would be <D:sync>besteffort</D:sync>
or <D:sync>atomic</D:sync>. Ofcourse in order to maintain compatilibity
the default would be "atomic".

Thanks,
Imran
