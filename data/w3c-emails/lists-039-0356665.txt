Thanks for jumping in, Jim.  I did actually make changes to the spec based
on Max's comments.  I hope that version 3.2 of the collection spec is
clearer.  It's on the Web at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/collection/dt/CollSpec032.txt.

I should say that even though 3.2 include some support for server-maintained
orderings, there is no consensus even on the design team that it should stay
there.  So it may yet be removed.  Whether it stays or goes, making the
distinction between client-maintained and server-maintained is important, so
at least an explanation of the difference and a statement about what we
support will stay.
