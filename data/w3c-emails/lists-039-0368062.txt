Subject: How to succeed with the IESG



Folks,

A new Web page, Submitting Documents to the IESG, has been prepared and it
now on the web at http://www.ietf.org/ID-nits.html

I strongly suggest this page be reviewed before sending a request to your
AD requesting an IETF last call.

In fact, as this will more than likely be a living document, check the
page before EACH request is posted



Steve
