They might risk a suit if they advertise they are *compliant*, but I never saw this
word used except in the context of Y2K. To "support" doesn't mean to be
"fully compliant," and I don't believe you can convince a court differently.
Microsoft says a lot of their products support all kinds of standards, even though
their actual level of compliance is often "less than perfect". If there was a buck
to be made suing for that, I imagine people would have done so by now.
(I am not a lawyer, though).
