Not so. By your wisdom, all MAYs and SHOULDs should be taken out of all
protocols, because they are nothing but uncertainties.

RFC 2068 says:
"10.4.2 401 Unauthorized

       The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include
       a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.46) containing a challenge
       applicable to the requested resource."

So you say I should use a 401 in a way which is in brut violation of HTTP/1.1,
and that WebDAV clients will somehow magically recognize this as indicating that
the request failed due to the Depth=infinity issue and do whatever it is they
should do in such a case, and furthermore, that software authors should be able
to figure out this remarkable mechanism by reading RFC 2518.
