More likely, it would already know what the mapping resource is because
it has already retrieved the collection listing, which is certainly capable
of indicating that the name is a binding.  In any case, such a discovery
step is not an undue burden given the need for robustness rather than speed.

You would have to define a syntax for one possible media type for
exchanging this information, yes.  MOVE is not an issue, since the mapping
resource is either part of the collection or not (i.e., MOVE is rejected
by the server if just the binding is moved, with an indication to edit
the mapping resource instead).

No, the collection resource is a product of a server's configuration,
one part of which is the mapping resource.  If this wasn't bidirectional,
the collection would be unable to list its own members.  [I imagine most
implementations would allow at most one specially-named mapping resource
per collection, just as Apache only has at most one .htaccess file per
directory.]

The reason I prefer this model is because it is unavoidable in practice.
If it isn't defined this way in WebDAV, then all directory-configurable
servers will have to implement BOTH the trivial bindings of WebDAV and
their own more capable bindings via the indirect configurations.  The
question is whether the collection is able to denote those bindings
within the collection listings, and thus within your precious Save As ...
dialogs, and yet give the client a reasonable indication that it can't
use BIND/UNBIND to author them, leading therefore to an interoperability
requirement.  The existence of directory-configurable bindings far predates
WebDAV, so you should consider this to be a requirement on the manipulation
of http namespaces.  If nothing else, you need to at least have a way of
distinguishing them within the collection.
