While I think some of my words where taken out of context here, I would like
to apologize for writing things that seem to have ended up being interpreted
as offensive, and in any event, where overly bold and totally inappropriate
in a response to your posting. What I said was mostly responding to some
other postings on this matter, and in any event should not have been said.
Your own postings on this matter have been very much to the point, and
clearly aimed at finding constructive solutions to whatever problems there
are.

So again, I apologize.


Yoram
