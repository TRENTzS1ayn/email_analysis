Thanks for catching the bad cross-reference.  It's on my list of things to
fix.

I think only server-maintained orderings would be found in the list coming
back from OPTIONS.  The server has to allow any client-maintained ordering,
so the possibilities there are completely open-ended.
Including a description of the ordering for human consumption might be
useful, though.

Good.  Thanks again for your suggestions and for reviewing the latest
