Hi Dylan,

There has been some discussion of versioning levels on the versioning
discussion list, ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org (send message "subscribe" to
ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org to join this list).  The messages have
the not particularly helpful subject line "Version issues", but begin in the
archives at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-dav-versioning/1999AprJun/0000.html

Your message quotes some, but not all of the messages in this thread.

I'm going to recommend we take this discussion to the versioning discussion
list, and I'll post my reply to this there.
