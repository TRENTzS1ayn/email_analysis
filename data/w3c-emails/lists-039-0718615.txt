Depends on whether you mean "interoperability testing" as in different
applications testing against each other or whether the model in HTTP works
at all.

In the former case, I don't think we have reason to doubt the results of
the interoperability test [1] (if you do then I suspect that this should be
raised very soon).

In the later case, there is plenty examples of HTTP/1.1 working just fine,
see for example

http://www.w3.org/WinCom/NoMoreLostUpdates.html

which is fully implemented and supported in libwww, jigsaw, and amaya.
