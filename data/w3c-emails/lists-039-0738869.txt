So is the case for all other features of HTTP/1.1 listed on the form. It is
not more likely to catch a problem if you try millions of times if you
still don't happen to try the specific thing that triggers the problem. I
believe we found the serious problems for PUT and DELETE just as we did for
other HTTP methods.

Sure it is - it's plain old HTTP/1.1 - no extensions what so ever and it is
all described in the spec.
