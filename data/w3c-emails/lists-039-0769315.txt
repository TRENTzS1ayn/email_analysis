      4) There is a more natural way to do all this.   The terms are...
 BINDING - an association of a URI segment (of a collection) to a
         resource

   I'd rephrase this to say:

   "A binding is part of the state of an advanced collection, that
   associates a URI segment with a resource.  In a given advanced collection,
   a particular URI segment can be bound to at most one resource."

Ooops.  I should have said: "In a given advanced collection, a
particular URI segment can be bound to at most one resource at
a given point in time.  This binding can be modified by a MOVE
or deleted by a DELETE."

Cheers,
Geoff
