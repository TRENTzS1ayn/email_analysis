G, this paragraph leaves me scratching my head a bit.  I can't deny that
what you've just said is true, but an example in the proposal (if it can be
kept short) would be valuable.   Just something to remind us when/why this
can be said.  The item that makes me scratch my head the most is the
comment about http://host not being an advanced collection.  If I can
associate that with a concrete example, it would be better integrated in my
understanding.
