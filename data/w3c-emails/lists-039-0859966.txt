We might want to strengthen the definition of "internal member" that is in
RFC 2518.

Your definition needs to be extended to allow for internal member names to
end in a "/", and to be consistent with RFC 2518, they should start with
"./".

I agree with this.

But I don't like this, since it's essentially an atomic UNBIND/BIND pair.
My concern is whether such an operation is really needed, and whether this
means that access control for BIND can be disentangled from access control
for UNBIND.  It seems like a bad separation of concerns.

I'd add:

However, if http://host/ is an advanced collection, then it MUST have
bindings to todays-weather.html and 5-1-1999-weather.html.


That is, the existence of multiple mappings doesn't imply the collection is
advanced, but if it is advanced, every mapping must have a corresponding
binding.

Right -- we'll make this change going from Proposed to Draft.
