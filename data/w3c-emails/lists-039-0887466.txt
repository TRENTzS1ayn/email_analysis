Jason asked me to expand a bit on how you can have multiple mappings
to the same resource without multiple bindings to that resource.

... For example,
suppose a server has access to a file system with a separate file for
each day containing the weather report for that day.  In addition,
suppose http://host/weather/ is a cgi-bin script that treats its
members as queries for a weather report on the specified day.  Then
the server may map http://host/weather/today.html to the same
resource (file) as http://host/weather/5-1-1999.html, but this does
not imply that http://host/weather is an advanced collection, nor that there
are two bindings to this resource (in fact, there are no bindings
to this resource, just mappings resulting from the behavior of the
cgi-bin script).

   G, this paragraph leaves me scratching my head a bit.  I can't deny that
   what you've just said is true, but an example in the proposal (if it can be
   kept short) would be valuable.   Just something to remind us when/why this
   can be said.  The item that makes me scratch my head the most is the
   comment about http://host not being an advanced collection.  If I can
   associate that with a concrete example, it would be better integrated in my
   understanding.

Cheers,
Geoff
