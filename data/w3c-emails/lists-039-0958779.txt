Is this now considered resolved by all parties?  If someone still sees a problem
 with my proposal, please speak up.  I'd like to resolve them PDQ.

I also think the CGI/dynamic content topic is interesting and I've promised Jim
Amsden that I'd bring up some dynamic content issues, but I want to make sure
we're comfortable with the base concepts that we have been discussing before I
add more ingredients to the soup.
