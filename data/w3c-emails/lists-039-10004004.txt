Consider what happens if you need to create a resource with a particular
body and some particular properties.  If you don't have lock-nulls (or
transactions), then you do PUT, LOCK, PROPPATCH, UNLOCK (or maybe skip the
LOCK/UNLOCK, since it's only protecting one operation).  If you and
somebody else are trying to create it at the same time, then you could get
PUT1, PUT2, PROPPATCH2, PROPPATCH1, resulting in resource whose properties
don't match its body.  With lock-null, you can do LOCK, PUT, PROPPATCH,
UNLOCK.
