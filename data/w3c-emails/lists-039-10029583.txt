   Lock-null resources were introduced to allow a user to "reserve" a
   name in the namespace. That is, to sort of create the resource and
   lock it in a single method. Otherwise, there is a race condition
   between the time the resource is created and the time it is locked
   where some other user could get the lock or otherwise change the new
   resource.

Isn't this functionally equivalent to someone getting the lock on the
lock null resource between the time when you issued the lock request
and the time it was handled by the server?  The fact that they got the
lock on the empty dummy resource you created, as opposed to a lock on a
"lock null" resource doesn't seem to change the situation in any
substantive way.

We could eliminate lock-null resources, and keep the ability to reserve a name
in the namespace if LOCK on a null resource created a resource with an empty
body and locked it. Since LOCK on a null resource isn't going to respond with
404 Not Found anyway, it might as well create the resource.
