   But would this work if one intended to reserve a URL to create a collection?

Albert is of course right.
So I can no longer live with Jim's proposal (:-).

So I'm back to:

   - return a 404 if there is no resource to LOCK,
   - let the client create a "null" instance of what it wants there,
   - then the client locks that null instance and it is off and running.

Cheers,
Geoff
