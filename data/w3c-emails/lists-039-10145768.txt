That's good to hear ... that means the body-snatchers didn't
get you after all (:-).  I'm actually not as concerned about
PUT and MKRESOURCE being allowed to both create and update
resources, since they both know what kind of resource should
be there when they are done.  I think LOCK is very different
because you *can't* infer from the LOCK call what kind of resource
should be created if none is there at the moment.

Cheers,
Geoff

   Geoff,
   That's exactly how I feel about it too. With MKRESOURCE,
   perhaps even PUT shouldn't create resources as a side effect, but we
   have to be compatible with HTTP conventions.

   Having LOCK create a null resource as a side effect?
   This can't be "no control coupling" Jim Amsden talking here! (:-).
