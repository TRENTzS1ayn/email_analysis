   Given the preponderance of evidence that indicates this is a difficult
   feature to implement,

Jim, could you point me to that evidence.  Earlier today Geoff defered
that question to a note he said JimA wrote.  I did a search for it
and didn't find it.  The best I've been able to find is simply
folks saying it's hard... but not explaining why.  I'd like to
document this.
