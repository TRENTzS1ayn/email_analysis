For collections, this doesn't work properly with your/Alan's proposal for static
depth locking.  If I'm creating a collection, I do LOCK (404), MKCOL, LOCK--but
this LOCK only locks the resources that are there now (i.e., none).  So anybody
else is free to come along and add new resources, and my lock means nothing.  For
collections that are meant to model compound documents or some such, where the
entire state of the collection needs to be treated as a unit, this is a Bad Thing.
