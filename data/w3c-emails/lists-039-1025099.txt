Another good point.  We will definitely examine these other cases as well.

In practice, the language in RFC 2518 has been sufficient to allow people to
implement Multi-Status correctly.

There are response minimization rules defined in RFC 2518 (for example, see
the bottom of section 8.8.3) to address this concern.  Do these rules fall
short in some way?
