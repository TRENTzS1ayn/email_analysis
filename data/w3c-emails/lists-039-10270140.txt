My "summary" of the proposal was too terse.  When I said:

   "if you are going to do depth locking, it should be static,
   i.e. it should be a lock on the current members of the collection"

I should have said:

  "... it should be a lock on the collection and its current members"

So every successful LOCK locks at least one resource (with no
Depth header, it is exactly one resource).  A key point here
(which I managed to successfully obscure :-) is that a collection
is a distinct resource, and a lock on the collection is independent
of a lock on any of its members (separate resources, separate locks).

And to emphasize, a DELETE and a MOVE are modifications to the state
of the collection containing the resource being deleted/moved.  For a
MOVE, it is also a modification to the state of the collection
containing the Destination of the move.  In either case, it is not a
modification to the state of the resource being deleted/moved.

Cheers,
Geoff

     Huh? In your original post about static depth locking you say:

   <GMC>
   Here is (what I consider) to be an extremely sensible proposal from
   Alan Babich (from a few months ago).  He basically says that if you
   are going to do depth locking, it should be static, i.e. it should
   be a lock on the current members of the collection.  If you MOVE
   things into and out of collections (because you have the appropriate
   lock tokens for the appropriate collections), it has no effect on
   the locks on those resources.
   </GMC>


   Lock the CURRENT members of the collection.

   I believe that is what John was commenting on.

   This is giving me a headache :-)
