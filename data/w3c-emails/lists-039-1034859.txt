I'm not entirely sure I understand what "your proposal" means anymore.
There have been several proposals floating around recently...

But, if your proposal involves modifying the definition of a resource so
that a resource is always the same as the chunk of state it maps to, then I
certainly object, since this is counter to the definition of resource in RFC
2396.

I do not believe you can develop reasonable base concepts without
considering dynamic content.
