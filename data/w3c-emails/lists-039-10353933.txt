Which reminds me of yet another locks-and-simplification issue....

RFC-2518 wants LOCK tokens to be universally unique.  Isn't it
actually sufficient that they be unique relative to the LOCKed
resource, kind of along the same lines as entity tags are unique?  

In fact, as an implementation choice (and imagining the spec didn't
explicitly prohibit it), if a server only supported exclusive write
LOCKs, couldn't a server choose to trust clients to do the right
thing, and use the string "button-button-you've-got-the-button"
for every LOCK token issued?
