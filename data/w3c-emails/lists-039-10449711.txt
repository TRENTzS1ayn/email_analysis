The strongest requirement for globally unique lock tokens comes from looking
at the future where there could be multiple WebDAV servers participating in
a cooperative cluster.  In that case, having globally unique lock tokens
would prevent lock token collisions.

My original rationale for uniqueness can be found in the archives at:

(I found this URL by going to Google http://www.google.com/ and searching on
"lock token uniqueness").
