No, actually.  I'm still saying unique-within-resource.  (My only
caveat is that it's kind of vague to me what this cluster example is
all about, so I've interpreted it to support what I'm saying. :-)  If
there are multiple hands in the cookie jar for the same resource, they
just need a private agreement that will keep them from reaching for
the same cookie.
