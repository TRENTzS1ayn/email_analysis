Subject: Re: One lock per resource per person?

<ja>
A principal can only have one lock on a resource. If the lock is exclusive,
then
there can only be one. If the lock is shared, then getting another shared
lock
would not give owning principal any further capability. I don't have the
spec if
front of me, but I believe this is spelled out.
</ja>

<ck/> I think this is too restrictive.  Using SCC systems today, I can
      create multiple shared locks against the same resource.  In
      general you can do this by "checking it out" multiple times, but
      the basic notion is that I may be engaged in parallel activities
      at my client even though I am the same principal.
