Yes Chris, but this is locking, not checkout. We can cover your case in WebDAV
versioning and don't have to do it with locking. Locking is an access control
mechanism for serializing updates to a resource. It is not at all the same thing
as checkout.

<ja>
A principal can only have one lock on a resource. If the lock is exclusive,
then
there can only be one. If the lock is shared, then getting another shared
lock
would not give owning principal any further capability. I don't have the
spec if
front of me, but I believe this is spelled out.
</ja>

<ck/> I think this is too restrictive.  Using SCC systems today, I can
      create multiple shared locks against the same resource.  In
      general you can do this by "checking it out" multiple times, but
      the basic notion is that I may be engaged in parallel activities
      at my client even though I am the same principal.
