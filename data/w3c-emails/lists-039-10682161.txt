Two key questions:

- Do we want a lock on a collection to lock the "body" of the collection?

- Does any locking implementation actually do this?

If as Jim Amsden points out, the "body" of a collection is usually just
a reference to some other resource, it would probably be better to
define a lock on a collection as *not* applying to the body of that
collection.

Cheers,

   A collection can also have a body as its state. This body would be affected
   by a lock.

   <ja/> I understand a MKCOL method can include an entity request body, but the use of
   that body is not yet defined in WebDAV. I believe the spec says something about
   the body being used to create initial members of the collection. I dont remember
   anything about a collection having a body. Servers can define what GET on a
   collection means, but this (by convention) usually means returning the body of
   some distinguished member of the collection, the index page or some such thing.

   <js/> Yes, and that's the body of the collection.
