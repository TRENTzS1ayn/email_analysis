Well, I now have a good idea on when and where breakout sessions on
WebDAV-related topics will be held at the Washington, DC IETF meeting. Note
that all meetings are open to all who wish to attend them.  If you're
planning on attending any of the the Delta-V breakout meetings, please send
Jeff McAffer <Jeff_McAffer@oti.com> an email so he'll know how well to stock
the mini-bar :-) (and so he'll know if we need to get more chairs...)
