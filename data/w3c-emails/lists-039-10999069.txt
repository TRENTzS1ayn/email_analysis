Well, I actually tried to move the parent collection of a locked resource
using some existing DAV tools, and here's what happened:

User A: Opens document "/ejw/fun/survey.doc" with Word 2000. This locks the
document.

User A then goes and opens up Web folder on the desktop, displaying "/ejw/".
User A then asks to rename folder "fun" to "notfun". An error message comes
back, stating that the folder couldn't be renamed, but after manually
refreshing the Web folder, it appears that a new folder "notfun" and the old
folder "fun" are both still present. When the "fun" folder only contains
"survey.doc", after the rename both folders contain distinct copies of
"survey.doc".

When "fun" contains more resources than just "survey.doc" before the move,
the destination folder only contains these other resources, and does not
contain "survey.doc" (Xythos), or contains all resources, including
"survey.doc" (IIS 5 Beta 3). After the move, folder "fun" only contains
"survey.doc".

As I recall from RFC 2518, this is actually compliant behavior -- the move
was performed best-effort.

This suggests that part of the problem is the interplay between the new
binding semantics of move, and the desire to preclude best-effort moves.
