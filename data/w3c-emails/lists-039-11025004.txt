I think you're using semantics as an excuse here. I do not read the same
behavior from the spec (I see the same principle as being able to get
multiple, shared locks); therefore, I think you're stating it [as above] 
solely in a way to support your hypotheses.

NO. As a user, I am assigned a *single* authentication alias on the
server. In an NT environment, it is my domain\username; in a Kerberos
environment, it is my login user/ticket; etc. There is no easy way for the
user to just "well, I'll use a second alias to differentiate these." That
is out of the user's scope and reliant upon the network/security
administrator. I *really* don't think the admin is about to say "well,
let's see... they're going to use up to three apps simultaneously against
our DAV server, so I guess that I'll create three users for this person;
oh wait, but what if they want to run four apps? I guess that I tell the
person they can't do that." The admin isn't going to do this for any
number of reasons.

And the user? There is no way they're going to go through a separate
authentication processes with the server simply to use more than one app
at a time. As a user, one of the best things that I like about Windows is
that it automatically supplies my credentials to servers -- that I only
have to supply them once. In the Unix world, I'm starting to change over
to ssh to get similar functionality, but still..
