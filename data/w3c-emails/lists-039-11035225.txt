Well, uh, sheesh, I almost regret having to point this out, but the
current LOCK method already describes two flavors of locking, and it
seems to me that that overloading is what is causing the current
disagreement and discussion.

LOCKing a resource and LOCKing a namespace are different animals,
whether you use the same verb or not.  Having the method overloaded
gives the opportunity for (1) implementation errors, and (2) wishing
it weren't so.
