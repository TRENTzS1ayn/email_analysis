And if you allow a lock to move with a 302 the admin has a clean WebDAV
way to tell the locking user where his stuff has gone to instead of
the client and its user "muddling through this".
User:    Hey, my locked file is gone !
Support: Did you already look in your mailbox ? You were warned that
         your file would be moved and to which place.
But if it`s consensus that this method is user friendly, so be it.

Cheers, Edgar
