DAV4J just uses Basic Authentication for now. It didn't seem too important
to authenticate users when there isn't any support for ACLs. We plan to do
Digest though.

Subject:  Authentication in existing WebDAV servers



A question for server implementers:

Are current server implementations supporting Digest Authentication?  If
not, what are they doing for authentication?
