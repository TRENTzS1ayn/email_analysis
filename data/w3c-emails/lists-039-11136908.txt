Glyphica supports Digest authentication in our InfoPortal product,
along with Basic and cookies.  (And it took a good bit of hackery
to arrange things so a web browser could be using cookie authentication
and WebDAV could use Digest.  Anyone know where I can find a spec
for Windows NT challenge-response authentication?
