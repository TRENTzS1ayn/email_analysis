All right... true... the spec is a bit different than I implied. Section
17.1 spells it out. Yes, it must be supported (as opposed to always
required), and yes, you can use anything you want... *IF* you use a secure
channel.

Over plain old HTTP, the spec does state that Basic must not be used.

Yes, I'm being picky here, but you were first :-)

Cheers,
