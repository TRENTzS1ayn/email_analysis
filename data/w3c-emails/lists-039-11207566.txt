Its not the DAV format, but DAV could store the whole frame as a Jigsaw
property. Wouldn't work that well for DASL though.

Subject:  Jigsaw release



I've just seen the details for the new release of the W3C server -
Jigsaw and spotted the details of the XML format and the administration
protocol (http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/Doc/Programmer/JigXML.html). Is it
just me or is this not in DAV format? Does this seem a bit strange?

I'm generally just a snooper in the mailing list, but this confused me.

Dave
