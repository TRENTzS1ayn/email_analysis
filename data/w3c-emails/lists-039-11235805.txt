The question is whether what's in the spec is actually strong
enough to insure interoperability. In integrating network systems
with WebDAV,  seems that there is no guaranteed authentication
mechanism that you can be insured of supplying credentials to
that will work with most servers, even for servers that are
technically compliant with the spec. 

Right now, it says 
"WebDAV applications MUST support the Digest authentication scheme
   [RFC2069]."

But servers might "implement" digest, not allow digest authentication
for access rights to any of the server's collections.

Secondly, "Digest authentication" is itself may not be specific
enough; do you want to specify a minimum algorithm & qop value?

We've been having some difficulties finding interoperable
authentication mechanisms for non-browser-based WebDAV use.

There's no law that says "you must implement WebdAV", so people
can always implement whatever they want, and do! The question is
whether compliance guarantees interoperability. Right now,
it doesn't seem like it does, and the spec might need to change.
