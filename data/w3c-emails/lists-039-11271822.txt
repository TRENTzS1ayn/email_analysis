Jigsaw is not using DAV but a format that is more suited to a fast
serialization/deserialization scheme. The fact that the admin protocol is
using the same language is just legacy from the previous version and
actually we are thinking about using it for the admin protocols. The 2.1
track is meant to change with the possibility to do incompatible changes
like upgrading the admin protocol ;)
