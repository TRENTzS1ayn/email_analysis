Given the *current* spec :-), has anybody noticed that you can actually
have a locknull resource that does not have any *direct* locks on it? For
example:

  Establish a locknull as /a/b with a shared lock. Now, lock /a with a
  Depth: infinity lock, shared. Finally, unlock /a/b with the first
  locktoken.

Just wanted to mention this to others, as it was pretty unexpected for
me...

Cheers,
