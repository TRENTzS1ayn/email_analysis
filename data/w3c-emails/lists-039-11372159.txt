Subject: [Moderator Action] Learning WebDAV


Hi I was wondering if anyone could tell me where could I learn WebDAV from
the beggining.  I working on an important project to use a WebDAV repository
in connection with a customized interface.  But I can't see anywhere some
explanations about the examples given in all the documentation in the
internet, and also I haven't found a book that talks about this protocol.
Can anyone please help?
