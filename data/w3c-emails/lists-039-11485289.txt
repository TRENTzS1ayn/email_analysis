Header was fine, we were choking on the port (.com/ != .com:80/)

Fixed, please continue your testing,
Kevin

This was a bug in my test code.   Xythos returns two propstat elements in
this case.
The first one had an empy prop element, and a status of 200.  The second
one had
the prop I was looking for, and the appropriate status code 404.

As far as I can tell it's perfectly legal for Xythos to return that first
propstat, even though there were no props in it.  but it confused my code.
Now fixed.  Xythos is not guilty.

here is more detail.   The request is

PROPPATCH /~jrd/foo.html
If:
<http://www.sharemation.com:80/~jrd/foo.html>(<locktoken:www.sharemation.com
LockServeridu:977>)
Content-Length: 185

    </A:prop>
  </A:set>
</A:propertyupdate>

The reply is

Does the If header I am passing look wrong to you?
