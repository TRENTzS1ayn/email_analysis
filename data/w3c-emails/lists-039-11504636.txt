It is - this is a documented "feature" from a long time ago in 
Zope's evolution. Because Zope is a pretty dynamic multiprotocol
object environment rather than a simple file server, there are a 
number of similar issues that boil down to an impedence mismatch
between the expectations for dynamic vs. static resources and
(in some cases) the need to maintain b/w compatibility :(

This is especially true regarding "templatish" objects that may 
or may not be thought of as "content" depending on what you are 
doing with them. I suspect that this is also an issue with ASP, PHP,
et. al. too - it would be great to be able to manage these things 
in a standards-based way, but currently DAV is very static-file 
centric in its approach. I'm not knocking that - but it makes 
the practical use of DAV pretty limited on sites that can't get
by on just static files. I've been hoping that we can wrangle 
the time to make some contributions in this area.

I'll take a look at that. Thanks!
