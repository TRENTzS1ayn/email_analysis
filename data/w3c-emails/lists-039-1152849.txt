My apologies to the group if I have failed to notice the obvious.
Since the result of a GET on a collection may bear no correlation
to the membership of a collection, I am curious as to what is the
best way to enumerate the members of a collection.  Is it possible
to do this with a PROPFIND with a depth header of 1 and then a careful
parsing of the return for URI's of the member resources ?  Is there
a defined property for member resources ?

I am new to WebDAV and http so please be kind.

Thanks,
