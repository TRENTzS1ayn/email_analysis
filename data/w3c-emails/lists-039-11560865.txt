But still, beside this as soon as you hit dynamic content you have two
problem's hitting you; you cannot 'PUT' to the target URI so easily
anymore as it has different semantics; which is more than just the content
and something as simple as, say, renaming a top level directory reliably
can in fact trigger locking on a virtually infinitive space of URI's
deeper down.
