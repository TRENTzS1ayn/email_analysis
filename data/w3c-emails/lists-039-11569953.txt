   ... as soon as you hit dynamic content you have two
   problem's hitting you; you cannot 'PUT' to the target URI so easily
   anymore as it has different semantics;

When trying to author a dynamic resource, I believe that it makes much
more sense to first do a GET to the source definition of that dynamic
resource.  And then the PUT would logically go back to that source
definition, not to the dynamic resource.

   which is more than just the content
   and something as simple as, say, renaming a top level directory reliably
   can in fact trigger locking on a virtually infinitive space of URI's
   deeper down.

I believe it makes much more sense to LOCK the source definition of a
dynamic resource, rather than the dynamic resource itself.  So lock
checking would only be performed on the (finite) source definition space.
In addition, it is likely that the location of the dynamic resource tree
will be "frozen" at a specific URL, so you wouldn't be able to MOVE that
tree anyway, irrespective of any locking behavior.

Cheers,
Geoff
