Wow. I didn't realize that IE5 and Office 2000 were not "real-life
applications." After all, they don't check against a DTD.

<SarcasmOff/>

I've been able to implement a DAV server without the "benefit" of a DTD.
Works great. Many other people have done servers, too. There aren't so
many clients, but they all work very well. All without the benefit of a
DTD.

The rest of your email was great.... But I had to say something about your
supposition. It just isn't true that a DTD is required or even needed.
