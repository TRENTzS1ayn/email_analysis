Another email caught by the spam filter :-(  I've put in a request for this
email address to be added to the accept2 list, so future emails from David
shouldn't get bounced.

Subject: [Moderator Action] Clients using PROPPATCH?


We are working on a WebDAV server implementation, and have been testing it
using MS WebFolders and cadaver, but I haven't seen either of these use
'PROPPATCH' for anything interesting.

Does anyone know of a client that makes use of PROPPATCH?
