Ahh I think this is one for the list..

The problem is not that you sent in two different tokens in the If Header
(In fact Xythos does handle multiple ones), the problem is that you mixed
No-tag-list w/ Tagged-list, which I believe is not legal.  Any other
thoughts???

The definition for If Header is

If = "If" ":" (1*No-tag-list | 1*Tagged-list)

In my mind (and I can be wrong here) this means 1 to many No-tag-lists OR 1
to many tagged lists.  Thus what you sent is incorrect.  Maybe I should give
a better error.

You seem to have

If = "If" ":" (1*(No-tag-list | Tagged-list))

which I can do, but is not how Xythos read the spec.

Thoughts???

Wowie.  Great.  One last bug

If a resource is locked and the parent is also locked (with a different
lock) then must pass both to delete it: PASS
Can delete using both tokens: FAIL
DELETE /~jrd/foox.html
If: </~jrd/>(<locktoken:www.sharemation.comLockServeridu:1045>)
(<locktoken:www.sharemation.comLockServeridu:1044>)
None

In other words, even if I pass both tokens, I still can't delete. (looks
like in this case I am passing the token for the collection using
tagged-list production and the token for the resource itself using
no-tagged list)

ps I have not tested authentication in any way with Xythos.

pps I hope to test your DASL compliance real soon now.

ppps great work.  the xythos server is very impressive.
