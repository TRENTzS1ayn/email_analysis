Client-side, do I need to be able to parse anything other than
RFC1123-style dates? 2068 says something like servers MUST only generate
1123-style for use 'in header fields', is it the intention that this MUST
extends to getlastmodified too? If so, may be worth simply saying
'RFC1123-style dates' in the spec rather than HTTP-date, for clarity. (Or
maybe change the HTTP spec to not be specific about 'header fields'.)
