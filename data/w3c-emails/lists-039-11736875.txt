Well, congratulations, you chose the worst possible design choice.
By using a header field, you have excessively complicated the caching 
algorithm for all resources on your server.  If it isn't sending
"Vary: Translate" on every response, your server is not HTTP/1.1 compliant.

Next time, use a "source" property that contains a list of URI that
make up the sources for a particular resource.  Authoring requests are
of negligible significance for round-trip latency concerns, so spend
the round-trip where it has the least performance impact rather than
constipating the normal operation of your server.
