mod_dav supports it as a "dead" property and depends on the server admin
to set up the appropriate structures on the server.

Some future version of mod_dav (sooner or later... I dunno) will support a
directive to automatically set up DAV:source properites, aliases, and
content-type settings.

I posted a note a couple days ago about how mod_dav might handle the
property.
