There a couple of talks on structured document management at XML/MT '99
(www.gca.org/attend/1999_conferences/xml_99/default.htm), including one
which specifically mentions WebDAV (abstract below). WebDAV seems like a
natural fit for this application with its support for hierarchical
collections. My personal interest is an XML browser/editor which can edit in
place objects within a document (vs. the whole document) using WebDAV. Is
anyone working on this?

If anyone is planning to attend in Philadelphia and would like to get
together informally to discuss current WebDAV-related initiatives, please
send me e-mail and I'll help coordinate a time and place.

Approaches for structured document management
Timothy Arnold-Moore, Michael Fuller, and Ron Sacks-Davis, Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology (Australia)
Document Management Systems (DMS) are tools to manage centralized
repositories of documents, providing controlled access to documents and
tracking the changes made to the documents. This presentation compares
traditional DMS functionality with more recent DMS functional extensions and
the even greater functionality available with structured document support
through SGML or XML, and then summarizes the architectural differences among
the three approaches. It also discusses relevant standards and initiatives,
including ODMA, WEBDAV, and WAPI.
