A followup question for clarification 

Suppose I have a collection locked (at depth infinity), and I LOCK a  null
resource (7.4) within it.

Does this action constitute adding a resource  "as an internal member URI
of a locked collection " as in 7.5?

If so, then the locked-null resource now has two locks on it, right?
