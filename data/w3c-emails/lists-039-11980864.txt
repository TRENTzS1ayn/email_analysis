Yup. That's what mod_dav does.

Note that both locks must be shared.

And here is something that is really whacky: now remove the new lock --
the lock-null resource should still stick around since it had inherited
the lock from its parent collection. It will remain until that parent
collection's lock has been removed.

Fun, eh? :-)
