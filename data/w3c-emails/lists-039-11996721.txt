  I can't recall our original rationale.  We might have been thinking that,
  since the lock had to exist for the request to be honored, this
effectively
  made the locks existence a precondition, and preconditions are expressed
  using the If header.

So do we need to define server behavior if more than one lock is specified
in the If header?
