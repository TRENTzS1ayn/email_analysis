I am rather using Netscape for surfing and emacs/LaTeX for word
processing; hence I do not know much about the products that you
mentioned, and therefore I do not feel authorized to classify
them as being anything. ;-)

How do you know?  I suppose, you did not proof their correctness...
Actually, I found the invalid xml element declaration, which I
reported in my preceding mail, by using a validating parser to parse
WebDAV's DTD.  Though I notice, that validation can not guarantee
correctness, I think that a validiating parser, if sensibly applied,
can reduce the risk of introducing implementation (and possibly
specification) bugs.
