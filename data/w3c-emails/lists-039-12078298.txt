We return a DAV:lockdiscovery element (as defined) which contains multiple
DAV:activelock elements (as defined).

We refresh any locks that are extent on that resource and that we find in
the If: header. In other words, we'll refresh direct locks and those
inherited from Depth:infinity locks further up in the namespace.

On error, we return a single status code (not a multistatus). That's
because a refresh is not being applied to multiple resources -- just
multiple locks on *one* resource.
