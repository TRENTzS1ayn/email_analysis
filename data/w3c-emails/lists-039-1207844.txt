Yes, the WebDAV URL is incorrect. I used version 10, not version 08. It must
have come from documentation that didn't get updated.

Note also that the URL to alphaworks is
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/DAV4J. It's just alphaworks for me. Sorry for
the confusion.

Hi Jim,

Congratulations on the release of DAV4J!

>    WebDAV
>    is described in the IETF draft specification
>    http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-08.t
>    xt.

Yikes!  I'm hoping this doesn't mean DAV4J only implements the protocol as
of the -08 specification.  Is there any chance this could be updated to
point to the RFC:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt
