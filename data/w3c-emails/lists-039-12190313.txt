Just noticed this note from you.  You pointed out that you are talking
about the pre-AdvColl behavior  In light of this, please add the following
to my previous note...

Although this note uses the term "binding", what I'm saying is not
contingent on the Adv.Coll. spec.  BINDING is just an unambiguous term that
I am using to distinguish the child resource from the parent's connection
to it.
