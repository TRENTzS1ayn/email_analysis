Hrm; I guess it could make some sense to impute the URIs in a tagged-list
as some kind of input parameter. We do with the locktokens, after all :-)

IMO, this would have been the clearest way to do this. It's that pedantic
trap again. As JimW explained "well, we saw it as a precondition, and
preconditions are specified with the If: header, and ..."

Well, Office 2000 uses LOCKs and could be argued as one of the more
popular clients :-). If it doesn't send a Lock-Token header, then we're
out of luck. The spec would then need to specify behavior in the absence
of the Lock-Token header. Anybody know if it sends a Lock-Token header
when it refreshes its lock?

Personally: I'd be fine changing mod_dav. Simply a lot of stuff, and I
really think its the clearest mechanism for the protocol.
