I read 7.5 as saying that even a depth zero lock is inherited, because it
does not say "only depth infinity". You and others have asserted that this
is bad.  When I asked why, you said it causes problems for BIND.

I think this is assuming too much from missing information. I do not draw
this conclusion given the inheritance of depth locks on existing resources.
Locking a collection with depth:0 does not lock any of the members of the
collection. So why would adding a new member inherit the lock?
