Subject:  Lost with links ...






In our project we want to support persistency of our meta-data in a
repository,
based on WebDAV.
We'd like to avoid fine-grain repositories because there is no a product of
this
type, running
on different platforms. We'd like to use different WebDAV servers depending
on
our
requirements and to protect ourselves from their differences via WebDAV
protocol.

We found that the following services from WebDAV are crucial for us:
- naming service, properties, etc. (the whole WebDAV level-2)
- versioning (Delta-V)
- query service (DASL)
- transactions
- relationships

In WebDAV level-2 there is something called links.

In RFC2518 links are defined in paragraph 4.6 "Media Independent Links"

"A WebDAV link is a special type of property value, formally defined in
section
12.4, that allows
typed connections to be established between resources of any media type."

From 12.4 "Link XML Element"

<!ELEMENT link (src+, dst+) >
<!ELEMENT dst (#PCDATA) >
<!ELEMENT src (#PCDATA) >

We suppose that these links are the closest notion in WebDAV that may be
used to
map relationships between models,
but there are a lot of questions in respect to Delta-V and DASL.

1) Does a link include version information for "src" and "dsc" or "src" and
"dst" will be resolved in a context of a workspace?
<jra>
The link does not include version information, and generally this would not
be a good practice as it would require editing of the property and/or
containing documents to change revisions of related resources. So these,
and all other URL references would be resolved in the context of the
workspace which would be inherited from the request.
</jra>

2) Can I get part of the whole link back as result of a DASL query?
     For example, I'd like to know all destinations for particular source
for
particular kind of a link.
<jra>
I don't know DASL that well, but does it support regular expressions in
matching strings like SQL?
</jra>

3) Is there any intention to provide special operations for links?
     For example, I'd like to modify link. Is it required to download the
whole
link, change, then save or
     may I do incremental modifications (add/remove pairs (src, dst) from a
link
without downloading it)?
<jra>
Links are properties and may be modified with PROPPATCH. You'll have to use
PROPFIND first if you need to modify an existing link.
</jra>

Thanks,
Viktor
