In the current Advanced Collections specification, the 409 (Conflict) status
code is used for cases where the server cannot perform the client's request
to place a resource at a specific position in a collection because the
collection is unordered.  In my opinion, this is a good case for introducing
a new status code, say 425 (Unordered Collection).

409 is a sub-optimal choice because this status code is used by many
existing WebDAV methods, as well as new methods in the advanced collections
specification, for non-ordering related problems.  Since a client can, if it
knows the error is the result of the collection not being ordered, simply
re-submit the request without the Position header, having this case clearly
separated from other 409 cases would give the client this option.

I'm not sure whether this code should also be used for other positioning
errors (such as trying to place a resource after one that doesn't exist).
I'm tending to think it should not.
