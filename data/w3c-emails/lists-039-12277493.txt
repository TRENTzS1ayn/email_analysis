I believe that the intent was for the src and dst of a link to be a URL.
This URL could be:
- a specific revision (in which case no versioning resolution
is required)
- a specific versioned resource (in which case either a
workspace or a revision-id could be used to resolve the URL to a
particular working resource or revision of the versioned resource)
- a versioned resource that is identified by performing version
selection on the versioned collections identified by prefixes of
the URL (in which case a workspace must be used to resolve
the URL to a particular working resource or revision).

Cheers,
Geoff
