Anyone that has a locking server or locking client (or knows of one) that
would be significantly affected by this alteration or by any other
locking changes, please send me a note or post it to this list.    I'll add
you to the locking mailing list.

I just like to make sure I have a complete list of servers/clients (with
email addresses) that are resistant to changes to locking due to
2518 compatibility issues and client base.

I agree with Jason (and others) that this would be the preferable way for
a lock refresh to work.
