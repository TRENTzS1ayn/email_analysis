Viktor - for questions about DASL you should write to www-webdav-dasl@w3.org
I am cc'ing that list with my answers to your questions.


>2) Can I get part of the whole link back as result of a DASL query?

Yes. The result of a DASL query is a set of property values, it is just as
if you did a PROPFIND on the resources that the query selects.

But maybe that is not what you meant to ask.  if you meant, "Can I write a
query that selects all resources that have a link that is of certain type
and whose destination is a certain URL" the answer is no not in the current
DASL.  DASL only allows queries that compare properties to constant string
values, it does not provide a way to compare a portion of the XML value of
a property.

It does support a pattern match operator, similar to the LIKE operator of
SQL.  This is not as powerful as a regular expression though.

thanks for your interest.  for other email on dasl please use the dasl
email list

Jim
