Your scenario is exactly right, that is, it makes all the right predictions.

So the claim is that it would be confusing if WebDAV acted this way...
you'd have a tree of resources, only some of which were locked, and whose
lockedness depended on the history.

In fact I agree, it seems confusing to me too.  It's a good argument for
changing the spec.
