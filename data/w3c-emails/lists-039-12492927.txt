I suppose Office 2000 uses OLE Persistent Property Sets for storing the
properties within the document.

Such a server would be interesting for documents created using many other
Windows based applications as well. OLE defines a standard seialized data
format for property sets called "Structured Storage Serialized Property Set
Format".  A Windows NT based server could use StgOpenStorageEx and get the
IPropertySetStorage/IPropertyStorage interfaces to access the properties.
Any other server could directly access the properties using the published
format.
