     Alternately, a server implementer can disallow cyclic
     bindings from being inserted in the first place, which is
     computationally much cheaper, but which restricts the usefulness of
     BINDings.  (Like the way UNIX restricts hard links to directories).

   This is now forbidden by the spec.

Just to clarify.  By "this" Geoff was refering to the possibility of the
server not supporting cycles.  The proposed changes now require servers
to allow cycles to be created.  Geoff was not suggesting anything
regarding hard links to directories.
