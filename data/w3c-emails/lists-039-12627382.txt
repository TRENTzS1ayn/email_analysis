   Can a server implementer build both strong & weak BINDings and only allow
   cycles in weak bindings?

The current binding spec only defines strong bindings, but if your
server only allows cycles with weak bindings, you could implement BIND
by anchoring all resources with a strong binding outside of the URL
space, and then use weak bindings to implement all BIND operations.

   Well either you can use the UNIX filesystem to support advanced collections
   or you can't.  It sounds like the current answer is that you can't.

You can, using the technique described above, i.e. implementing bindings
as symbolic links into a source tree maintained outside of the URL namespace.
