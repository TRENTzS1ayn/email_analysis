I can tell you
that if most Oracle customers are offered the choice of having a bunch of
great neat content management functionality at the price of decreasing
search performance, they will stick with the search performance.  Nothing
irritates users more than waiting for search results.

On the comment I quoted above...Are we talking about text searches?
You did mention text searches above.
If performance were important,
wouldn't you build an index and just use the index to service queries?
... just like most search systems do?   If you use an index,  the amount
of time users wait for search results is not really relevant to your
point.  The performance will be the same either way.
