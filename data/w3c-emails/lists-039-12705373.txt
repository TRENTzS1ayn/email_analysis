Of course you will build an index.  That's the problem, because you are
locating the data without traversing the collection hierarchy to find the
data.  Let's say you find a hit using that index.  That item may actually
have been deleted because you have deferred garbage collection, and there is
no way to update the index to remove that item until the actual resource has
been deleted.  If you were traversing the hierarchy as well, you wouldn't
find that item if it would be garbage collected later because there wouldn't
be a path to find it.
