Already demonstrated.

mod_dav ships with the Unix filesystem for a repository. However, there
are two (private builds) of mod_dav: one that works against ClearCase (and
is experimenting with the versioning spec!), and one that delegates the
back-end services through CORBA. There have been some rumblings about
using PHP scripting to back-end mod_dav, but nothing has been completed
there, yet (that I know of).
