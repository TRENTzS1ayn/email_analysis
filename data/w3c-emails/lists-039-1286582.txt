Sorry. I ran into a problem with the XML library I'm switching to. Looks
like a linux bug it seems to work on FreeBSD running on the test server but
in the process I was chopping out bits to test where the problem occured.
Its returning something closer to correct now and I expect to have another
new version up this weekend that is correct.
