This looks pretty good, as it addresses the circular reference issue.  I'd
still like to see an optional weak binding that is guaranteed not to dangle
but that also does not affect the reference count, as I think that is needed
when the implementor chooses not to allow circular BINDings affecting
references.

A couple of other comments:

* on the security issue of revealing the set of bindings with the
dav:bindings property:  I recommend some comment to the effect that BINDings
from unreadable collections should not be readable.  So, the list of
bindings in this property would only show READABLE bindings (and thus would
be different depending on who was examining the property)
* some comment to the effect that if the URL is a versioned resource, and
the currently selected revision is changed, the resourceid will not change.
(I'm assuming that is what you want.)  So even though two people might see
different data from a GET request from the same URL (because they would get
a different revision selected), they would still have the same resourceid.
Therefore, people should NOT use resourceid to invalidate caches or any
other application that assumes a one to one correspondence between
resourceid and data.
