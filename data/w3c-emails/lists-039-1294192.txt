Hi;

After searching the archives, I have come up empty handed on the above
topic.

I am a Apache web server admin. I have many users that maintain their
own business websites. I have recently had two requests asking if we
supported Win98 Web Folders. I haven;t a clue about Win98 web folders,
but had done some preliminary reading on WebDAV and thought the two
might be related.

Any input you provide will be appreciated.

Thanks

Chris
