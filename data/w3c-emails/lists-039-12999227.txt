Well, the xml library that I wrote to support the Xerox PARC Python WebDAV

I saw Greg Stein's email saying mod_dav does not follow 23.4.2

Any one else?

So you are proposing that we drop 23.4.2 from WebDAV?

Sigh.  I suppose that, if the entire rest of the XML world does in fact
follow the convention that namespaces are distinct from element names, then
WebDAV may as well switch to follow them.  What a pain in the neck!
