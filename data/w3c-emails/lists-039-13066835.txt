You will need to include the lock token for /foo/ as you are adding a
member to this collection even though its a lock-null resource. If you do a
PROPFIND with depth:0 on /foo/, you'll see the lock-null resource even
before you do the initial PUT proving the collection's members, and
therefore it state, were modified.

Subject:  Creating a lock-null in a locked collection


I have an depth 0 write lock on /foo/. If I do LOCK /foo/bar to create a
lock-null resource, do I need to submit the locktoken for /foo/ in the
LOCK request? Or only in the PUT to /foo/bar later?

(Or is it decided that lock-null resources are going to go away?)
