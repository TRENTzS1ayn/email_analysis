Geoff,
I didn't follow. Is y a lock-null resource in your example below? It seems
according to your definition below that the URL lock scheme would have the
same behavior as 2518. If y is a lock-null resource:
  LOCK /x; Depth:0
  LOCK /x/y

  LOCK /x/y
  LOCK /x; Depth:0
In the first sequence, the LOCK /x/y request fails (assuming the lock token
is not specified or the user is not the owner of the lock) because x is
locked and y can't be created in x either as a name or resource with /x/y
bound to it.

The second sequence, both methods succeed because x isn't locked, so y can
be created, lock-null or not. Now x can be locked with depth:0 because
there are no conflicting locks. What am I missing? Or are you just saying
that LOCK doesn't require a lock token? Why the special case? What happened
to your proposal to remove lock-null resources?

Now consider the case where y isn't a lock-null resource, but an existing
resource. The first sequence could succeed without a lock-token on /x
because locking /x/y doesn't change the state of /x in any way. The second
sequence would also succeed. Is this what you meant?

If we don't have lock-null resources, how will names be reserved? Don't
worry about the issue?

Now some locking questions. If LOCK applies to the name, not the resource,
/x/y.htm is locked, and /b/c.htm is bound to the same resource as /x/y.htm,
is /b/c.htm locked too? Probably not. A user not owning the lock on
/x/y.htm could DELETE /b/c.htm since that URL isn't locked. What about LOCK
/b/c.htm? Say some other user would like this URL to remain fixed, but
doesn't want to change the contents of the resource. Would that fail due to
a conflict with the lock on /x/y.htm? Probably should. Now what if a user
not owning the lock does a PUT on /b/c.htm. According to the definition
below, this would fail even though the URL isn't locked. So the user can do
a delete, but not a put on /b/c.htm. Sounds a little confusing. Looks like
the lock is on both the name and the resource in some way.

Subject:  Re: Locking URIs rather than Resources



I agree with all aspects of Yaron's interpretation of the "URL locking"
proposal.  It illustrates the fact that in this proposal, a LOCK (and
UNLOCK)
request never fails due to the absence of a Lock-Token header.

A benefit of this approach can be seen if you invert the order in which the
locks are issued, namely, instead of:
  LOCK /x; Depth:0
  LOCK /x/y
you request:
  LOCK /x/y
  LOCK /x; Depth:0

In the current 2518 model, the first sequence would fail (for the reason
cited by Yaron) while the second would succeed (I believe ... with 2518,
you probably could make good arguments for both failure and success of the
second sequence).

In contrast, the proposed URI locking model treats these sequences
simply and identically: they both succeed, and they both end up in the
same state - with a Depth:0 lock on /x and a Depth:infinity lock on
/x/y.  In this state, if you want to do a PUT to /x/y and /x/y does
not identify a resource, you need both lock tokens (reasonably enough,
since you are modifying the state of both /x and /x/y).

Cheers,
Geoff

   Before I jump into the fray I want to make sure that I actually
understand
   the proposal. One sentence in particular gave me pause for thought.
Geoff
   stated that "...a LOCK request *never* requires a lock token". I though
hard
   about this, trying to understand exactly what it meant. Below I lay out
my
   thinking process so that if I have misunderstood the proposal my error
can
   be found and corrected.

   Imagine user U takes out a depth 0 lock on collection C. Collection C
has no
   children. The ramification is that no one but U may add a new child to
C.
   User A then shows up and wants to create a new resource with the URL
C/R.
   Before creating the resource, however, A would like to first reserve the
   name C/R. To this end A takes out a lock on C/R.

   In the old system A's request would be rejected. The reason is that in
the
   old system locks are on resources. Therefore for A to lock the name C/R
it
   has to create some resource which 'owns' C/R and then lock that
resource.
   This is where lock-null resources came from. They are the 'stand-in'
   resource who holds the name C/R until A is ready to transfer ownership
of
   the name to its final destination. However creating the lock-null
resource
   to hold C/R means that the lock-null resource would automatically become
a
   child of C. U, through its lock on C, has reserved the exclusive right
to
   create children of C. Therefore A's request to lock C/R is rejected
because
   the creation of the lock-null resource to hold the name C/R would
violate
   U's lock on C. (Is it just me or does the previous sound like an Abbott
and
   Castello routine? Castello: Who has the lock? Abbott: Who has the lock.
   Castello: No, who has the lock?!? Abott: Exactly.)

   But in the new proposal locks aren't on resources, they are on URIs.
   Therefore when A locks C/R it is not locking a resource, it is locking a
   name. Names aren't members of collections, resources are. Therefore A
can
   lock C/R without running afoul of U's lock on C because C/R, even though
it
   is locked, is still not a member of the collection. When A will run into
   trouble is when it attempts, through a COPY, MOVE, PROPPATCH, PUT,
MKCOL,
   etc. to associate the URL C/R with a resource. By associating a resource
   with C/R A will cause that resource to become a member of C. Of course U
has
   reserved the right to create new members of C, therefore A's request
will be
   rejected.

   The result is that A can lock C/R without submitting a lock token.
However
   there isn't much A can do with the lock on C/R because doing anything to
it
   would require associating it with a resource, which U's lock prevents.

   Geoff, did I get it right?
