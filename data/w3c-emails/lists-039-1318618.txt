Yep, I looked at this and have been pondering whether or not to
install it. I hadn;t planned on doing it until I actually had a user
need/request for WebDAV service.

My problem is that I have users now requesting for access via
their 'Win98 Webfolders', and am unsure as to what 'Win98 Webfolders' are.
Are they an IIS specific thing, a frontapge thing, or a WebDAV thing, or
...?

Thanks

Chris
