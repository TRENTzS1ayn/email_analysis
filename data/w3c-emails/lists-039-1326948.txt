Web Folders are an IE5 thing. It uses the WebDAV protocol to talk to the
server (or it can use the FrontPage-proprietary protocol). So... that
means you want a server to speak the WebDAV protocol. WebDAV is an
extension to HTTP, which means the easiest way to have your server speak
WebDAV is to extend your web server to speak HTTP *and* WebDAV.

My mod_dav module for Apache is just the trick. I've been using it in
conjunction with Web Folders for a couple months now and it works great.

For information about WebDAV in general, please see
http://www.webdav.org/. There is a FAQ there that may be helpful.
