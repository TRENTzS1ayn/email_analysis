COPY has to depend on what you requested to copy. If its a working
resource, you should get a new, unversioned resource. If its a revision,
you should get a new unversioned resource of that revision. If its a
versioned resource, you should probably get the whole history. But that
maybe we should dissallow copy on versioned resources?

(I've posed this question before, but it didn't get much discussion...)

What does COPY mean for a versioned resource?

Options might be:
(1) create a new versioned resource at the destination whose initial
revision is the same as the revision selected by the source,
(2) copy all the history of the source to a new versioned resource at the
destination,
(3) make a new unversioned resource that has looks like the selected source
(i.e., looses it's versioned status).

Then how does that differ if the selected resource is a working resource?
We disallow a working resource without a corresponding versioned resource
with at least an initial revision.
Option (1) seems the most likely candidate to me.
