Hi all,

In section 9.1 of RFC 2518, the spec states that 1#extend should be used
for adding tokens. Two problems:

1) the RFC doesn't have a "*" to indicate any number of extensions
2) "extend" is never specified. Specifically, what is the set of valid
   characters?

I plan to have some mod_dav-specific properties, and I'd like to note
their existence in the DAV: field. The identifier could also be used by
clients to detect the mod_dav version to work around problems or whatever.
Anyhow... I want to return something like:

DAV: 1,2,<http://apache.org/dav/1.0>

Does anybody have an issue with defining "extend" to contain at least the
characters which are valid in a Coded-URL?

thx,
-g
