The "1#element" rule in RFC 2068, section 2.1 indicates a list of at
least 1 element, separated by one or more commas and with optional
linear white space.

See issue EXTEND_UNDEFINED on the WebDAV issues list at
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/issues.html
(BTW., Greg, I could not find any hyper link on www.webdav.org that
points to this page.)

Jim Whitehead proposed to define:

(see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1999OctDec/0199.html).

Section 2.2 of RFC 2068 defines:
       token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials>

          tspecials      = "(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@"
                         | "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | <">
                         | "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "="
                         | "{" | "}" | SP | HT


Hence, the above would be illegal, as it contains "<", ">", ":" and "/".
But one could propose to define (as I already did):

extend = token | quoted-string      ; token and quoted-string are
                                      defined in [HTTP].

That would allow to put a URL into double-quotes.

Bye,
     Juergen
