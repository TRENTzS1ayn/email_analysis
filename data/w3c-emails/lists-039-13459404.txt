Oh, right.  *forehead slap*  Silly me :-)

I've added this to the specs page. Thx for the idea!

And yes. I see that you found the problem already :-)

Hrm. I don't like that idea. I'd much rather see it be a URI explicitly. A
quoted string doesn't help to prevent conflicts since you could simply
place anything in there (same with tokens). And if servers are to use that
field to express their own capabilities, then we should have a way to
prevent conflicts.

Specifically, I recommend:

   extend = absoluteURI

Further, each of the WebDAV extension specs should alter their use of the
DAV: header to use URIs for their items. For example: DAV:bindings or
DAV:redirectrefs.

Using "extend = Coded-URL" would also be fine, if people think the
brackets are needed. (although it doesn't have to be a URL...)
