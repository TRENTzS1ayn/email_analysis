Unfortunately, this would make the lexical analysis ambigous, as,
according to RFC 2068, an absoluteURI may contain a ",":

absoluteURI    = scheme ":" *( uchar | reserved )
uchar          = unreserved | escape
unreserved     = ALPHA | DIGIT | safe | extra | national
extra          = "!" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")" | ","

Hence, when encountering a ",", you do not know if this is part
of the absoluteURI, or if it is used to separate two absoluteURIs
from each other as to the 1#extend rule. :-(

Bye,
     Juergen
