P.S.:

However, the rule

   extend = Coded-URL

should be fine, because the rule

   Coded-URL = "<" absoluteURI ">"

implies that, as soon as you have encountered a "<", you can
accept as many "," as you find, belonging all to the absoluteURI,
until you finally reach a ">". (I suppose that is the reason why
people think that the brackets are needed. :-))

Bye,
     Juergen
