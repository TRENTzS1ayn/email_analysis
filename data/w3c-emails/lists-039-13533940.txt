Consider the following directory structure:

  Collection         [locked with token A, depth=0]
   \
    SubCollection    [locked with token B, depth=infinity]
     \
      File1
      File2          [these inherit token B]
      ...
      FileN


Now, how do you delete SubCollection?

Note that you must provide token A to remove SubCollection from
Collection. Also, you must provide token B for SubCollection *and*
File1..N.

What's the IF: header look like?

(presume that you cannot delineate all the (recursive) members of
 SubCollection and insert them *all* into the IF: header)

I can't see a way to do it. Normally, no-tag-lists are used for specifying
locks for a hierarchy. But you must use a tagged-list to specify token A.

Ideas?

Cheers,
