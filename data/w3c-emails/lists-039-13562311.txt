Agreed.

Go one step further, then: if you do not use IF: to specify lock tokens,
it is only good for etags. If that is the case, then we have If-Match in
HTTP/1.1. Why keep the IF: header? :-)

Based on feedback from some people on the dav-dev mailing list, I'm going
to do the following:

*) if a tagged-list state-list specifies a URL and its locktoken, then the
   state-list will be applied to the internal members (to the extend of
   the lock depth). this will effectively replicate the state list down to
   all affected members.
   (any existing tagged-list for an internal member will override this
    implied state-list)

This should solve the problem, even if it isn't "strictly" by-the-book. I
have no idea how hard this will be, but I'll dig in and try it...

Cheers,
