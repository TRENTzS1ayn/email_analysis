A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: Use of a Semantics Register with WebDAV Properties
Author(s): E. Christian
Filename: draft-christian-prop-semantics-00.txt
Pages: 5
Date: 24-Apr-00

This document specifies a mechanism to associate a WebDAV ([WEBDAV])
property with an entry in a Semantics Register. A Semantics Register
documents the meaning of properties in a formal manner and may be
implemented with schema technologies such as Extensible Markup
Language (XML) Schema ([XMLSCHEMA]) or Resource Description Framework
(RDF) Schema ([RDFS]). Schema technologies expose the derivation of
complex properties from simpler concepts, as demonstrated in the Basic
Semantics Register ([BSR]) for data elements used in Electronic Data
Interchange. Registering the meanings of properties in this manner can
enhance interoperability across systems and throughout the long-term
information life cycle.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-christian-prop-semantics-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.
