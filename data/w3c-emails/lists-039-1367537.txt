As explained in detail in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JulSep/0084.html XML
attributes are a bad idea. 

The use of attributes invariably indicates an ill considered data structure.

In this case they are used to avoid dealing with the issues of properties on
properties. Let us not avoid these hard problems but grabble them head on.
