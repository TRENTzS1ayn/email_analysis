Hi!

When trying out my DAV server I noticed that Microsofts Web Folders had
problems when I sent "HTTP/1.1 200 Ok" as status line  in a PROFIND
response, e.g.

<D:status>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok</D:status>

But when I use upper case characters everything works nicely, e.g.

<D:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</D:status>

Can anyone confirm this? This is bad behaviour by Web Folders is it not?
