Well, I can't confirm the behavior, but if this is indeed what is going on,
then it's non-compliant behavior.  The status XML element is defined as
"status-line", which is defined in HTTP/1.1, and status-line will accept any
text except for CR and LF. So lower case should have been fine. In fact,
anything there should have been fine -- the "OK" isn't meaningful to the
protocol.
