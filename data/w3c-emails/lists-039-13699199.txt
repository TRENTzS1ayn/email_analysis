I'm only here for about five more hours before leaving for the weekend
(and still getting out from a couple days of email while I was gone :-( ),
so I haven't done testing on the above problem. But I can echo what Jim
says: it shouldn't be looking at that text. In fact, mod_dav regularly
issues status line like this:

<D:status>HTTP/1.1 424 status text goes here</D:status>

(Apache doesn't provide a way to get standard text for error codes)

I haven't heard or seen any problem related to this.

Cheers,
