I believe (but haven't confirmed) this whole "text stuff" problem is
fixed if the client is Windows2000.  Might also be fixed if the client 
machine runs Office2000 with the ill-fated SR1 installed.  I don't
know if there is (yet) a fix if you aren't in one of those buckets
(if, for example, you get your Web Folders by virtue of using a recent 
MSIE).
