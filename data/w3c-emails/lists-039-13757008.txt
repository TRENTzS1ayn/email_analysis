Hopefully I'm not out of place with this question. 

Talking about URL encoding and webfolders, how should non-ASCII characters be encoded? It looks like the Microsoft webfolders encodes them based on the Windows code page. There is a setting in IE5 that says "Always send URLs as UTF-8". However WebFolders ignores this setting and never sends the URLs as UTF-8. The problem I have is that I can not reliably determine what a character is when it is encoded using code pages.

Thanks,
Dan

This is true (see also http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1738.html).

So this format is different to the MIME format called "application/
x-www-form-urlencoded", (ref.
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1) and in
particular is different to the java.net.URLEncoder behaviour.  This will
likely cause 'interesting' incompatibilities with many Java based clients.

Thanks for pointing this out.
Tim

'+' is not a valid encoding for 'space'. Some clients and servers do it
for parts of a URL (particularly within the 'query' section), but it is
not standard.

Refer to RFC 2396 (URLs) and RFC 2616 (HTTP), Section 3.2.
