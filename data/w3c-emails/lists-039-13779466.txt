The '+' encoding is not standard for URL encoding itself, but it *is*
standard for form-urlencoded data, as specified in RFC 1866:

Section 8.2.2 says:

In other words, the '+' encoding is standard not only in the message
body, but even in the request line of a GET request (at least as of
HTML/2.0).  However, when doing a POST, the form data is put into
the message body rather than the request line (section 8.2.3).
