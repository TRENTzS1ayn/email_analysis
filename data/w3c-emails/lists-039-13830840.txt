I would disagree. I think that it is quite valid to return something like
403 (Forbidden) or 401 (Authorization required) as a response. Heck, you
could also return something like 412 or 301, too.

In each of these cases, the 3xx or 4xx applies to the Request-URI. If a
status code ever applies to a URI *other* than the Request-URI (say,
caused by a Depth: header), then a 207 (Multistatus) MUST be returned.
