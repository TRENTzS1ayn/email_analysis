Howdy,

We are looking to use WebDAV as part of our server to handle the
document management ui. One thing we collect in our current HTML version
is some meta information for each file. I see the WebDAV protocol
supports setting properties for files, but what I dont see anywhere is
how the tools available out there work... If I set up our server to ask
for a description property, how can a user specifiy that property using
MS Web Folders, or any of the other ways?

Sorry if this is a common question, I looked around and didn't find
anything obvious.

Thanx,
-gabe
