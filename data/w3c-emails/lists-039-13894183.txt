At present, MS Web Folders do not allow you to set arbitrary properties on
WebDAV resources. Since Office 2000 uses Web Folders, arbitrary WebDAV
properties cannot be set in Office applications.  Since many Office
applications do allow within-object metadata to be set, it is conceivable
that an intelligent WebDAV server could extract this within-object metadata,
and expose it as a WebDAV property value.
