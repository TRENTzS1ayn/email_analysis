The eKeeper application does precisely this; we store user-defined
properties on the server. Those properties are defined within the context of
our application, to be sure, but we are using WebDAV as it was intended; to
store buckets of arbitrary properties, perhaps from different namespaces,
with a resource on the server.

-00.txt is
one example of the kind of work that needs to take place to establish
property usage conventions. John Stracke's I-D, "Use of Dublin Core Metadata
in WebDAV", draft-ietf-webdav-dublin-core-01.txt, available at:
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/dc/draft-ietf-webdav-dublin-core-01.t
xt is another.

But, maybe there are other reasons why WebDAV properties have, so far, not
been used.

Thoughts?
