Darn....

We have a document repository in our application today. We store simple meta
information, name and description....Just enough to give a user a feel for the
document before they go through all the trouble to download it. Our users have
told us they want tighter integration with the filesystem - WebDAV is perfect
for this solution. You'll notice that this use of properties does only a little
for
searching - most real search would need to look into the content of the
document.

But browsing is different. This really is a helper for folks browsing the
repository.
I know that many Office documents have meta information in them - it would be
especially cool if that meta  information was exposed using WebDAV when they
get saved using WebDAV also...

The reality is that many servers are coming, and many of them offer different
experiences
then simple web servers. It would be nice if the fancy clients out there would
enable
these servers. I cant imagine that the exchange  team over at microsoft isn't
interested in
features like this? It would also make the server generated index page pretty
cool in IIS...
I'd like to lobby the MS folks on this list hard to consider putting this stuff
in. Your leadership
could really change the way documents on the web are handled. The lack of solid
meta information about a document before it is downloaded is something that the
Web
has been missing since the very beginning!
