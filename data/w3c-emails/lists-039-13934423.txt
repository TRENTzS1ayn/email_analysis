As an aside, MS Office files have quite a bit of metadata buried in them --
right click on one and use the properties command to view.  There's a DLL to
access this information as well -- search support.microsoft.com for
"dsofile.exe" or references to "document summary".  [I used a similar DLL
from Microsoft to pull out document properties for a prototype DM system I
wrote; I believe there's also a third-party DLL with the ability to write
the properties as well.]

This isn't generally true, of course -- the metadata is stored as part of
the Windows-specific (OLE 2) file format for Office, and doesn't apply to
any cross-platform documents.

Darn....

We have a document repository in our application today. We store simple meta
information, name and description....Just enough to give a user a feel for
the
document before they go through all the trouble to download it. Our users
have
told us they want tighter integration with the filesystem - WebDAV is
perfect
for this solution. You'll notice that this use of properties does only a
little
for
searching - most real search would need to look into the content of the
document.

But browsing is different. This really is a helper for folks browsing the
repository.
I know that many Office documents have meta information in them - it would
be
especially cool if that meta  information was exposed using WebDAV when they
get saved using WebDAV also...

The reality is that many servers are coming, and many of them offer
different
experiences
then simple web servers. It would be nice if the fancy clients out there
would
enable
these servers. I cant imagine that the exchange  team over at microsoft
isn't
interested in
features like this? It would also make the server generated index page
pretty
cool in IIS...
I'd like to lobby the MS folks on this list hard to consider putting this
stuff
in. Your leadership
could really change the way documents on the web are handled. The lack of
solid
meta information about a document before it is downloaded is something that
the
Web
has been missing since the very beginning!
