Sorry if this is answered somewhere, I couldn't find it...

1) Section 8.10.4 "If the lock cannot be granted to all resources, a 409 (Conflict) status code MUST be returned with a response entity body containing a multistatus XML element describing which resource(s) prevented the lock from being granted."  

  Then in example 8.10.10, a LOCK fails but gives a 207 response code in the header.  What is the proper response code??

2)  If a more than one user has a share lock on a resource, they can all WRITE to it, but can they DELETE it???  If resouce /C/B exists, and user FOO and user BAR both have their own shared lock of /C/B, what happends if FOO issues a DELETE?  Will the DELETE succeed thus removing the share lock FOO AND BAR have on /C/B (but possibly leaving the lock on /C if /C/B was part of a depth=INFINITY lock), or will the DELETE fail??

3)  During a COPY or MOVE, if the file/directory exists, and the overwrite flag = Y.  What happends if the DELETE portion fails??  Should the MOVE/COPY fail giving the errors for the DELETE, or should the server still try to do the MOVE/COPY to the location where the DELETE failed??  And what is the proper response status (and XML) to return to the client in this case?

Thanks,
Kevin
