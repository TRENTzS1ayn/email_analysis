I'd probably vote for

  extend = Coded-URL | token

so that standard DAV defined extensions can be specified in a terse form.

Cheers,

Exactly!

All righty then... I'll resubmit my proposal:

   extend = "<" absoluteURI ">"


For semantic purposes, I expanded Coded-URL since we will certainly have
URI values in there (e.g. DAV:bindings) rather than URLs. In an If:
header, the "URL" term makes sense.

Back to my original point, then: does anybody see a problem if I updated
mod_dav to use the following DAV: header:

  DAV: 1,2,<http://apache.org/dav/0.9.16>

??
