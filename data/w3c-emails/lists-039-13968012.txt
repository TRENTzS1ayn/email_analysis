The IETF Meetings page just lists this as happening from July 30 - August 4
Rather than comment on the choice of Pittsburgh in August (:-), I will just
ask whether a hotel has been selected yet?  If so, anybody know what it is
(and why it isn't on the web page)?  If not, isn't time getting a bit short?

Cheers,
Geoff
