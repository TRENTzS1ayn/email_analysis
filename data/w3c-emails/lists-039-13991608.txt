This may be an issue that has scope beyond WebDAV, however the problems we are having are WebDAV related. Also I believe this is an issue that is more important to WebDAV then it is to the http protocol in general.

We need to have the ability to expire passwords to force users to change passwords. When a users password is expired they are given a number of grace logins. For normal http access, when a user on grace logins the web server can redirect them to a page that allows them to change their password. However, when using WebDAV clients (in particular web folders, and Office 2000) the redirect to a page to change passwords does not work. Given that a WebDAV client may not be a browser and therefore may not know how to display html there needs to be another solution for expired passwords. 

It seems to me that this could be something the WebDAV group could address. Maybe an addition to WebDAV that allows for notification that the users account needs to be updated (password changed) and a method of changing updating user account information.
