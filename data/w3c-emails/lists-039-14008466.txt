Changing passwords may be out-of-scope but providing a return code 
mechanism for revoking credentials, or to inform the user that their 
password/temporary password must be renewed is not.  About a year and a 
half ago I made a suggestion to the HTTP-WG that we add a return code
or set of return codes to do just that.  Provide a mechanism to the
underlying authentication and authorization systems that allows the
system to notify it's users in a standardized manner that something 
needs to be addressed.  The suggestion was tabled due to the timing
and where 1.1 was in the loop.

As Dan points out most of the new clients that are interfacing with
a WebDAV server are not browsers so they are incapable of displaying
HTML pages. So what do we put into the protocol to allow such 
interoperability?
