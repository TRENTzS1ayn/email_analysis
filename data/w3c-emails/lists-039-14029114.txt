I've been assuming that words such as "infinity" and "T" and "F" are
case-sensitive, using the case defined in RFC 2518. However, I just found
the following in RFC 2616:

  Section 2.1 (part of the Augmented BNF description):
    (for literals)
    ".... Unless stated otherwise, the text is case-insensitive."

In RFC 2518, Section 2, we state that WebDAV uses the same conventions as
HTTP/1.1.

Does that mean that the literals in RFC 2518 should be treated in a
case-insensitive manner by the server?

Cheers,
