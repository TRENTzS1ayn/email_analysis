Hi all...

One more question: in the current mod_dav architecture, I am unable to do
a "best effort" delete/move/copy when a lock exists somewhere in the
affected resources. As a result, the only real option available is to fail
the entire request.

However, this would effectively mean returning a 207 (Multistatus) that
contains an entry for every single resource stating (in some way) that it
was not deleted/moved/copied.

I would much rather do the following:

*) return 424 (Failed Dependency)
*) include a body in the 424 response, which contains a DAV:multistatus
   element which refers to the locked resource


Does this seem reasonable?

Thanx,
-g

p.s. and no, fixing it to do best-effort is not an option
