I am fine with the 424 as long as clients expect to see a XML body from a
Webdav server.  We NEED to have some way of informing the client why the
move/delete failed.

Again I don't care if its a new status or an existing one, I would just like
to make sure that an XML body (without internal 424's as this would be
possibly huge) can (and MUST) be returned to the client.

Um. Including 424 into a 207 is legal (since it is only a SHOULD NOT), but
it means that I would have to generate a response for all 1000 children of
the collection that I'm trying to delete. Each resource would have to say
"sorry, I wasn't deleted due to a 424 (Failed Dependency)".

I'm seeking to return a single, top-level status that indicates the whole
thing failed.

424 seemed most appropriate (4xx meaning the client can fix it, and 424
meaning that it was caused by some other reason). A 409 (Conflict) would
also be fine, but I don't think it provides as much information (409 seems
to say "problem with <this> resource" while 424 says "problem with <that>
resource").

Kevin suggests creating a new 4xx status. I'm not sure that I want to go
that far :-). If the body is a problem, then I'll probably just leave out
a body. Although... I can't see how that would be a problem... I'm with
Geoff on this one -- how does a body in a 424 cause a problem?

Okay. Fine-tuning of the response aside, I also get the feeling that
nobody is going to pester me saying "you moron, it should be best effort."
I'm going to solidify the "single failure response" in mod_dav now, and
look for responses to this thread to find the right status code and body
contents.

Cheers,
