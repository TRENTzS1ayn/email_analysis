mod_dav 1.0 is now gold! It can be found at http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/

A press release has been issued by the Apache Software Foundation and
"webdav.org", talking about the release:

    http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/press-release.html


Of particular note, is that mod_dav is going to become a standard part of
Apache 2.0, now that we have passed the 1.0 release milestone.

Cheers,
