I believe the problem that led to the use of property attributes was
the attempt to model the "history" of a versioned resource as a
property.  If instead we model it as a resource (i.e. a "history resource"
that contains a collection of revisions), then we can just use
headers (like the Depth header) to modify the PROPFIND call that
is applied to this collection.

Cheers,
Geoff

   As explained in detail in
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998JulSep/0084.html XML
   attributes are a bad idea. 

   The use of attributes invariably indicates an ill considered data structure.

   In this case they are used to avoid dealing with the issues of properties on
   properties. Let us not avoid these hard problems but grabble them head on.
