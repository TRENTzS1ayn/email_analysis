Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  I've also cc'ed the DAV developers
list dav-dev@lyra.org.

Subject: [Moderator Action] MS IE/Office/Web Folder Behaviors with
WebDAV


We're making progress with a fresh WebDAV implementation for document
management using a large-scale EDMS backend.  One of the drivers of this
project is the out-of-the-box availability of MS Office and MS Web Folder
support.  If someone could shed some light on some of the behaviors of the
MS Office products in a WebDAV environment, it would be helpful in
directing our work efforts.

1.  Using IE, when launching an MS Office product (Word/Excel) from a web
page URL pointing to a WebDAV server, the File>Save menu choice is
disabled.  One can, however, do a File>Save As...  (Word and Excel are
windowed within IE.)  Can (how does) one enable the File>Save menu
item?  (IE 5.5, Windows 2000, Office 2000).

2.  Using Windows Explorer (on W2K) , the directories do not show the
Modified Date, although the date was returned in the XML stream.  Why not?

3. Is there a way to customize Windows Explorer to add other columns of
properties and file attributes returned via the XML stream?  Is there a
toolkit or documentation to build an alternative desktop-integrated Web
Folder view similar to the Windows Explorer experience?

4.  An Adobe PDF file cannot be saved to a Web Folder using Acrobat 4.06,
although one can save to a temp directory and drag-drop the file into the
WebDAV Web Folder.  Does writing from a Windows app to a WebDAV Web Folder
require special File>Save API coding? (Or conversely, is it likely that
Adobe is using non-standard tests/coding that reject Web Folders as a
File>Save destination?)
