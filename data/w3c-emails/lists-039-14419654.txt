I'll take a shot, but I'm no expert (just a bruised user ;-)

My understanding is that you cannot enable File>Save since the clients are 
not doing LOCKing, and therefore there is no guarantee that you have 
exclusive access to the resource.  The semantics of Save are not supported 
without LOCK, so you have to choose File>Save As... and explicitly accept 
the consequences of overwriting an existing resource (i.e., are you 
sure?...)

Beats me?  It doesn't show up on NT4.0 either.

I don't know about customizing the existing window (you can't do it 
through the UI), but there is a description of the WebFolder object and 
related methods available on MS developers network 
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/officedev/off2000/fpobjWebFolder.htm), 
so presumably you can roll your own.

The web folders are not a file system mount to a dav server, so apps do 
not get webdav 'for free'.  In your suggestions, a windows app would 
require special File>Save coding.

p.s. I'm sure more people know much more about this than I do.
