Hum, if you see the proxy as a HTTP resource, The HTTP resource acting as
a proxy may issue an ftp request then return a HTTP response to the HTTP
client", so even if it end up being a ftp request, the first HTTP request
was handled by an HTTP resource.
No matter how the content is generated, it always an HTTP resource that is
handling an HTTP request.
So Precept #1 should use "HTTP resources" and not resources. Also a
resource may be at the same time an HTTP resource, and answer according to
another protocol.

Well if the resource can't handle HTTP request, the daemon that will ask
this resource to generate an HTTP reply should return to the client an
error stating that the resource doesn't support this protocol, like a Not
Found with a good explanation in the body.
