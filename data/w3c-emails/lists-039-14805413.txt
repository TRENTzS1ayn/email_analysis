Yes, I believe that is what we want, and will insert some wording of
this kind in the versioning protocol (unless anyone objects).  I agree
with Judy that this is better placed in the versioning protocol
document, since resourceid's are likely to matter and be understood by
anyone reading the versioning document (we have various id's), while
the notion of a revision and a versioned resource is much less likely
to be matter or be understood by someone reading the bindings document.

Cheers,
Geoff
