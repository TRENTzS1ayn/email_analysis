The use of a validating parser makes little sense in the context of
WebDAV properties -- because it is intended to expose a storage mechnism
for arbitrary element definitions (in the form of property values),
which themselves may or may not have a defined DTD or schema somewhere.

Is the versioning specification defining a similar mechanism whereby
arbitrarily defined elements would need to be incorporated? If not,
then indeed you should be sensitive to the requirements of validation.
But if so, the same argument stated above for property values applies.
