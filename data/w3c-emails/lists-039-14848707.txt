This is an interesting issue--how do specify some set of XML elements that
you want out of a document not available to you.  This is basically the XML
equivalent of a SELECT list in SQL.

I raised this issue in the database context with the W3C people a few months
ago, to raise the issue of a simplified form of XPath for this purpose.  I
proposed basically using a list of XPath identifiers, omitting elements in
the predicate that reference the value of any node.

I'm copying this to some relevant XML & XPath people to highlight WebDAV
PROPFIND requests as another application for this usage in addition to
database data retrieval.  It's kind of disturbing to me to see invalid XML
used for this--I'd prefer a comma separated list of XPath specifications,
omitting predicates, like:

<D:prop xmlns:R="http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/">
 R:bigbox, R:author, D:supportedlock/lockentry/lockscope
</D:prop>

I think this will avoid confusion, since a list of XML element names
shouldn't appear as empty elements.
