   The use of a validating parser makes little sense in the context of
   WebDAV properties -- because it is intended to expose a storage mechnism
   for arbitrary element definitions (in the form of property values),
   which themselves may or may not have a defined DTD or schema somewhere.

Yes, that makes sense (although you do have to at least specify the
namespace of those elements, even if you don't have the DTD's).  But
in those cases where you do have the DTD's available (such as for the
DAV:xxx properties), it does provide some cognitive dissonance to
see an element like <DAV:creationdate/> in a PROPFIND request,
when the DTD for creationdate is:
   <!ELEMENT creationdate (#PCDATA) >


Cheers,
Geoff
