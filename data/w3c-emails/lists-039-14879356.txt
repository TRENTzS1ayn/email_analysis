I agree that it is dissonant.   But there may be no better choice.

Let me make a suggestion - let he who thinks WebDAv should validate create
a DTD that will work.  The constraint is that it has to work even if there
is no DTD for some properties, and whatever mechanism you use should also
not have the bad network effect of needing to fetch the DTD with each
attempt to validate.  otherwise performance would be bad.  I am no XML
expert, so I can't tell whether this is easy or even possible.

I would certainly be willing to see changes to the DTD that would *allow*
webDAV XMl to be validating, if I didn't have to give up on expressivity
(ability to use properties without a DTD)

All things being equal, this would be better for DASL as well.  As one of
the authors I can say that I did spend some time trying to write a DTD for
DASL, mostly because I wanted to be able to check for dumb mistakes that *I
made.

Note also that RFC 2518 says that WebDAV's xml is not valid.  (but only in
passing in 17.7)  i think, given the amount of discussion that this has
brought up over history, it needs a passage in the WebDAV book of Why, if
not in the next Specification.
