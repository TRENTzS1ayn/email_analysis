This is a reminder that we are about 2/3 of the way through a working group
last call for comments period on the WebDAV Bindings Protocol specification:

<draft-ietf-webdav-binding-protocol-02>
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/draft-ietf-webdav-binding-
protocol-02

The last call period ends January 24, 2000, at midnight, Pacific time.  The
intent of the last call period is to allow working group members to perform
a final review of the specification before it is submitted to the IESG for
approval as a Proposed Standard.

For more details on the last call, please consult the original message
announcing the start of the last call period:
