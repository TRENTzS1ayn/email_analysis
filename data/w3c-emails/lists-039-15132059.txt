Actually, in this specific case the XML is valid.  The construction
<element/> is defined to be the same as <element></element> (an element with
no contents).  Since an empty element is consistent with the *DTD* for
creationdate, <creationdate/> is valid.  But, your point still holds for
properties like lockdiscovery, which have a list of subelements as part of
their DTD specification, so my objection is to your example, not to your
general point.  That said, I still think using a list of empty elements is
fine within prop.
