It is a change, but we believe a benign one.  (It shouldn't conflict with
anything implementers of rfc 2518 are already doing.)

We are using the expression "collection member" as synonymous with "internal
collection member".  We've had some inconclusive discussion about whether
this change in terminology will cause confusion.  Opinions are welcome.

RFC 2518 said that collection members are URIs.  From conversations with the
authors, we believe their intent was that the members be URI segments.  We
are changing this to say that collection members are bindings, where a
binding is an association between a URI segment and a resource.  Since a URI
segment in its collection can be associated with only one resource, it
should be ok to treat the URI segment and the binding as (for practical
purposes) equivalent.  The URI segment identifies the binding.
