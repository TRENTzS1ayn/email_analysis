I have just finished a detailed review of the bindings spec.

After having given it a lot of thought I have come to agree with the
conclusions given in the bind spec, the WebDAV collection model is broken
and needs to be fixed. I further agree that the proposed model in BIND is a
definite improvement. While I'm still not convinced of some of the mostly
philosophical details (is a bind recorded in the collection or on the
resource?, for example), none of these details are sufficiently weighty to
merit holding up the spec. If we find that some of the niggling issues
aren't correct then we will fix it later.

After reviewing the draft I find that I have 17 issues. I have identified
each issue with a name. Following WebDAV mailing list tradition each issue
is addressed in its own letter.

The complete list of issues I am raising, in no particular order, are:

Yaron.PublishBind
Yaron.WeScrewedUp
Yaron.4Huh?
Yaron.5.3Huh?
Yaron.5.4Huh?
Yaron.507
Yaron.Insulting2616
Yaron.AtomicMove

Yaron.NoSlash
Yaron.BindSyntax
Yaron.403
