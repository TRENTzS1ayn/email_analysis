The last sentence of the last paragraph of section 4 reads "Implementations
MUST ensure the integrity of bindings." Similar language is used in the
second paragraph of section 5.1. However the term "integrity" was never well
defined inside of the specification. As such it is impossible to comply with
this requirement in an interoperable way. I would strongly caution against
attempting to specify the definition for integrity, English is much too
inexact a language for such an attempt to be successful.
As such, I move that both sentences be removed and be replaced with
a series of statements that define, in exact language, the requirements that
are to be represented by the term "integrity", each sentence properly
qualified with a MUST.
