The first paragraph of section 5.3 reads "Suppose a BIND request causes a
binding from "Binding-Name" to resource R to be added to a collection, C.
Then if C-MAP is the set of URI's that were mapped to C before the BIND
request, then for each URI "C-URI" in C-MAP, the URI "C-URI/Binding-Name" is
mapped to resource R following the BIND request." 
I have a B.S. in CS & EE and got A's in my classes on set theory and
I still can't read this paragraph. I tried over and over again and I just
couldn't figure it out. If you are going to try to write set theory in
English you should at least translate it faithfully using the appropriate
terms such as "for all" and "there is an instance of". Personally I would
recommend just using an ASCII version of set code notation. Whatever you do,
the current paragraph MUST go. It is unfathomable. In fact here is the best
translation I have been able to come up with: Imagine I have a collection
http://icky/bop which contains http://icky/bop/blah. Imagine I now want to
map http://zizbang/rocky to http://icky/bop/rack. According to this language
it would seem I would have to create a bind to http://icky/bop/blah/rack. I
know this makes no sense but I swear that is what the sentence seemed to
mean when I tried to read it four or five times. As such I move that the
paragraph be rewritten.
