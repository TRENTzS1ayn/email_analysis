The language used in the first paragraph of section 6 makes certain
assertions regarding the intentions of the authors of RFC 2616 that I
believe may not necessarily be accurate. As such I move that the authors of
the BIND spec send an e-mail to all the authors of RFC 2616 and ask them to
validate the accuracy of the proposed language.
