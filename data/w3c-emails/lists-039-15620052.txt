I agree that we want to keep the sentence you identified below.

I also agree that we want to address the issue of a resource acting
differently based on the URI it is addressed from.

I suspect my problem with the language in the section derives from the
differentiation made between static and dynamic resources. In my experience
one can not really make the distinction because even if a "resource" is just
a file in a file system, there is always a server on top of it that may or
may not alter its presentation. If the language in section 9 were to be
re-written with the assumption that ALL resources are dynamic then I suspect
we would find the resulting language mutually acceptable. 

In other words, we should remove the terms dynamic/static completely and
instead talk about resources and the fact that their presentation can change
based solely on what URI they are accessed from. We shouldn't even try to
address the fact that in some cases, some resources for some period of time
may choose to look identical regardless of what URI they are accessed from.
