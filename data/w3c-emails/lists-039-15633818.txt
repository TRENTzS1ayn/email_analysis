One possiblity is to say that "all dead properties of a resource must
be available from all bindings to that resource".  This acknowledges
that the behavior of live properties can be "special", including
acting differently at different bindings to that resource.

   From: Yaron Goland <yarong@Exchange.Microsoft.com>

   Section 11 of the BIND specification defines the dav:bindings property. What
   is not clear to me from the text in this section is if it is possible to
   have the dav:bindings property accessible through one binding but not
   another? 

   One could imagine that two servers share access to the same disk drive and
   hence are able to map names to the same "resource" (as they understand the
   term). In order to keep things consistent both servers agree to record all
   the names they use to refer to the same resource. However only one of the
   servers actually supports the BIND method and the dav:bindings property and
   the other doesn't. I can still do a GET on each server and the result will
   be from the same resource but only one of the servers will be able to serve
   up the dav:bindings property. Unfortunately the language in section 11
   speaks of the dav:bindings property being on a resource so the presumption
   is that if I can get the dav:bindings property through one binding then I
   MUST be able to get it through the other. I believe this is too strict a
   requirement.

   As such I move that the language in section 11 be clarified so as to specify
   that the dav:bindings property may not necessarily be available through all
   bindings on the resource.
