  I suspect my problem with the language in the section derives from the
  differentiation made between static and dynamic resources. In my
experience
  one can not really make the distinction because even if a "resource" is
just
  a file in a file system, there is always a server on top of it that may
or
  may not alter its presentation. If the language in section 9 were to be
  re-written with the assumption that ALL resources are dynamic then I
suspect
  we would find the resulting language mutually acceptable.

I agree that there is a perspective that there are no truly static
resources in the world,
but if we get hung up on that, we're verging on a meta-physical discussion
that will
distract from the point of this section.  And if we tried to write
something that works
for all dynamic resources, there truly wouldn't be anything meaningful said
in that
section.   That section is very readable right now and does a good job of
conveying a fuzzy concept/behavior:

There are a range of resources.  From the ideal static resource to the most
dynamic resource
you could imagine.  One will probably never encounter a resource at either
extreme.  Where
a given resource lies between these two extremes is in the eyes of the
beholder... but the
platonic ideal of a static resource acts in this fashion...

That being said, feel free to write up a new version of that section, but
please don't get overly
distracted trying to convey the fact the the nominal "static resource" is
only an ideal.
I do feel if one's focus is too much on that, they will write something
less effective
than the current text.   As I said, the current text seems to do a good job
conveying
a fuzzy topic.
