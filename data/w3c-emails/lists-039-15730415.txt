In section 5.5 the 507 error code is written as "507 (Cross-Server Binding
Forbidden): The server is unable to create the requested binding because it
would bind a segment in a collection on one server to a resource on a
different server."

??????? What does a server have to do with anything? If you try to bind two
resources in different volumes on a FrontPage server the server will have
to fail the BIND even though the resources are on the same server. In
general bringing in the server is almost always a bad idea since resources
can be spread out all over the place and the reasons for various failures
may or may not have anything to do with how those resources are laid out on
the servers. As such I move that the language for the 507 error code be
altered to read that the resource was unable to create a binding to a
destination and to leave the matter at that. All mentions of the word
server should be stricken.

Hmmm.  I don't have a strong preference on whether we should create a new
status code for lack of support for remote connections.  At some point we
might find we need one.   Anyway.... the status code that you're suggesting
doesn't seem to suggest anything except that the server can't do it.
Can't we just use 500 for that?   And if so, shouldn't we mention 500 it in
the spec?  Or is 500 too obvious to mention?
