When I'm trying to perform a directory browsing, that I'm going to present
to a user. Should I then present the Displayname info or should I pars the
href to get the name of the resource, from the Propfind request?
If I should use the Displayname info, can I rely on that it only contains
the name of the resource and not the complete path? ( this seems to be the
case for IIS, Xythos, Zope. But not for CyberTeams server )
