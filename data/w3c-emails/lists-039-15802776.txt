That's the key point here.  On a direct-mapped webserver (no alias support
in the webserver) that uses a singly-linked filesystem like VMS or
Win32API-NTFS as a WebDAV backing store, it may make sense for the DELETE to
actually remove the underlying file.  If you are using a direct-mapped
webserver on a multiply-linked filesystem like Unix or POSIXsubsystem-NTFS,
then a DELETE might remove one link to the underlying file but leave any
other links lying around.  I could go on and on enumerating the various
possibilities, but to me the DELETE only removes the name from the namespace
-- it is entirely server-dependent as to what if anything happens to the
underlying data for that name.  From the client's viewpoint, that name and
its data doesn't exist anymore.
