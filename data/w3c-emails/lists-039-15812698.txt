When I'm trying to perform a directory browsing, that I'm going to present
to a user. Should I then present the Displayname info or should I pars the
href to get the name of the resource, from the Propfind request?
If I should use the Displayname info, can I rely on that it only contains
the name of the resource and not the complete path? ( this seems to be the
case for IIS, Xythos, Zope. But not for CyberTeams server )

Noone has answered, so I will take a stab.

I don't think you can count on it containing anything and even that it
exists.  If it does exist, it does seem like the thing you'd want to
display.

Note: I don't think it's even technically required to correspond to
the URI at all.

Note: in the presence of multiple bindings, if the server initializes it
to the URI and treats it as a dead property, that URI might be different
from the URI from which it was accessed.  This unexpected behavior is even
possible (but less likely) if the value is only initialized to the last
segment of the URI.

That's only the technical answer.  If you were asking for a consensus
answer, you can add DAV4J to the list.  It currently treats it as a dead
property that gets initialized to the full URI.  It also allows the client
to change the displayname to anything they wish.
