As another point of reference:

mod_dav treats it as a dead property and does *not* initialize the value
to anything. In other words, it (typically) does not exist on a resource.
If it does, then it only contains whatever somebody happened to shove into
it -- that could be a JPEG image for all mod_dav cares.
