WebDAV

State of Adoption Report

January 20, 2000

It has been a little less than a year since the WebDAV Distributed Authoring
Protocol, RFC 2518, was issued by the IETF.  I'm very pleased to report that
in that time, there has been very strong adoption of the WebDAV protocol.
Due to the hard work of the members of this working group, and the people
who have written and deployed WebDAV applications, there are now thousands
of people every day who get useful work done using the WebDAV protocol.
Over the next few years, we'll see this number increase into the millions,
as WebDAV technology diffuses broadly into the platforms, programs, and
devices we use on a daily basis, and as people better learn when and how to
use WebDAV.  Furthermore, as efforts like Advanced Collections, DASL, and
Delta-V expand the capabilities of WebDAV, they open up new applications and
audiences, leading to yet more users of the protocol.  Though WebDAV
adoption has already been strong, in many respects we are just at the
beginning of a long, 20+ year long arc for this protocol.

The purpose of this report is to highlight where WebDAV adoption stands
today by listing clients and servers that support WebDAV.  Though WebDAV
devotees will already know much of this information as individual items,
most people are surprised when they see it all put together in one place --
there is more here than people expect.  This report lists 10 client
applications, 2 publically available client API libraries, 17 WebDAV servers
(12 class-2, 5 class-1), and 2 WebDAV-enabled Web storage sites.  These
applications run on a range of platforms, with client support for Windows,
Unix, and MacOS, and server support for Windows and Unix. WebDAV benefits
from strong commercial and open source development, showing that the
protocol has a broad spectrum of support beyond any one company or
institution.  Finally, the WebDAV-enabled storage sites are gaining users
rapidly, with one site, My Docs Online, currently adding 500 new WebDAV
users a week.

WEBDAV-ENABLED STORAGE SITES

  A surprise for WebDAV was the emergence of the Web storage site as a
  strong adoptor of WebDAV technology. These sites typically offer
  20 Meg of storage for free, and the ability to share files with other
  users of the site.  Access to files is via a Web interface, or via
  WebDAV.  The ease of access to remote Web sites provided by Web Folders
  is motivating adoption of WebDAV by many storage sites.  This, in turn,
  is introducing WebDAV to a large, new audience.

  Sharemation
    http://www.sharemation.com/
    The first WebDAV-enabled storage site, offering
    20 Meg of storage, non-DAV versioning, DASL support.
    Uses the Xythos Storage Server.

  My Docs Online!
    http://www.mydocsonline.com/
    Also offering 20 Meg of storage. Currently with over
    3,000 WebDAV users after just six weeks of offering WebDAV
    capability. Apparently there would be more WebDAV users,
    except there are recurring reports of difficulty accessing
    WebDAV capability through legacy, non-HTTP/1.1 compliant
    proxies.  MyDocsOnline uses a modified version of
    Apache mod_dav.
