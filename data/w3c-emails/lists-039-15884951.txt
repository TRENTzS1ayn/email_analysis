Yep, that's what it should be.  Not only does the request-URI indicate
the point of modification, it also determines the mechanism within the
server responsible for handling that namespace -- something which absolutely
must be done *before* interpreting the method (except for TRACE).

Oh, shoot me.  For some lame reason I missed that when WebDAV went up
for review, since the semantics in HTTP have always been that the
request-URI represents the target of the modification, for the same
reason that most assembler languages use the first operand as the
destination.

I'd prefer it be done the natural way rather than being consistent with
COPY and MOVE.
