I vote for choice 2, since choice 1 is so egregiously bad.

   Hmm, since properties are part of the state of the resource, in the presence
   of bindings it is more than possible for there to be multiple URI names for
   the same "display name".  This removes the value of the displayname
   property.  Some solutions:

   1) move displayname to the collection, and have the collection maintain
   displayname/binding pairs (this solution seems icky to me)

   2) deprecate displayname, and only use URIs for display to the user, and
   concentrate on i18n support for URIs.
