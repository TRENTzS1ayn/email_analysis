It is a mapping from a concept to a representation of that concept.

That is because some concepts may be equivalent to "this exact file".
If that is the concept being mapped, then the resource will indeed be a
file, and thus the "not necessarily".  file URLs are an example of such.

The goal of the definition of resources is to make it possible for an
author to identify any possible resource via a URI, without necessitating
a change of the URI every time the representation of that resource changes.
In other words, we want the Uniform Resource Identifier to identify the
resource that corresponds to the concept desired by the author when they
created the link.  If the author wants to identify a fixed representation
(such as a revision of a file), then they will want to refer to a resource
that corresponds to that fixed representation.  It is thus natural to have
some URI that refer to more abstract concepts and others that refer to
concrete concepts.  It does make authoring rather more complicated, but
at least it is for a good cause.
