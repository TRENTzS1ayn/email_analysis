I don't understand what the problem is.  The client can use the displayname
to store some user-interpretable name for a resource that is independent of
the binding, so that the user can tell that these two URLs apply to the same
resource (they probably won't look at resourceID).  For example, the client
could parse the <title> out of an HTML document and store it there.  If you
default the display name to the last segment of the URL, then things can get
confusing as you point out.  It's up to the client to do something useful
here.
