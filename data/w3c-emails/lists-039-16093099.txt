My point is that the binding could fail not due to cross-server anything but
an intra-server something. That is why I brought up the FrontPage example.
If you try to bind between volumes it will fail. Yet given the current
definition FrontPage could not use a 507 in that case. That just seems
broken. That is why I wanted to widen the language so it could cover the
cross-volume scenario.
