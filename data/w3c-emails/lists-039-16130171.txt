Rickard,

       The CyberTeams server will soon provide the displayname property, 
which will represent whatever is recommended for displaying to the 
user.  We haven't been returning it before since most of our earlier 
testing has been against Web Folders, which calmly ignores any values in 
displayname.  I would not rely on the href containing a meaningful resource 
name, especially when you are looking at something other than a file system.

Cheers.......    Randall
