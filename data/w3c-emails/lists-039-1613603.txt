Interesting epistemological point (which, like most epistemological points, is
an irrelevancy not meant to sway the discussion one way or another): if it has
zero URL mappings, is it a resource? A resource is something that responds to
methods; if there are no URLs for it, it can't receive any methods, so you
can't tell whether it would respond to them or not.  :-)
