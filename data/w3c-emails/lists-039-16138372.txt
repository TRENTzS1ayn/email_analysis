Jim,

       It's also a big issue when you're dealing with resources from 
something other than a simple filesystem.  It's very risky to assume that 
the URL always refers to a filename that is meaningful to the user.  For 
example, our WebSite Director DAV interface supports DAV access to our 
workflow processing.  The URL for an update request in a workflow stage 
would be something like "/WSD/Editing/requestB18894", which of course would 
be virtually meaningless to users.  The displayname property however, will 
be set to something like "ADD /mydir/myfile.html" or "MOVE 
/mydir/myfile.html TO /otherdir/myfile.html", which *will* be meaningful to 
users.  Because of the fact that Web Folders ignores the displayname 
property, we're having to do some seriously ugly URL mangling to make our 
DAV interface even modestly useable.

I think it should be an option for servers to initialize the property to 
something meaningful to users, as in the example given above.  Also, 
clients should display the displayname property if set and only display the 
last part of the URL if there is no displayname property, again based on 
the example given above.

This assumes that the last path segment of the href URL has any meaning to 
the user, which is often not the case when dealing with document 
repositories and other non-filesystem servers.
