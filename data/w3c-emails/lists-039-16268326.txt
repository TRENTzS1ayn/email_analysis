Yes.

 a) You can request an "infinite" lease, but you must be prepared for the
    server to return to you instead a finite lease. You must then renew that
    lease before it expires if you want it to persist without interruption.
 b) The renewal of the lease is an explicit action on the part of the
client,
    and is required to occur within a specific time interval. There is no
    implicit anything.

This is, IMHO, significantly less complicated to implement robustly and
correctly than implicit renewal. And of course, truly infinite locks are
highly suspect in a distributed environment. It could be argued that
leases shouldn't permit them at all -- but it suffices to interpret
"infinite" to mean "the longest period a server chooses to tolerate
possibly holding a resource for a client that's never coming back."
