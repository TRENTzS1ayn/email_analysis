Hmm. But this doesn't solve my problem. Let's say that my website is called
'http://www.foo.com'. If I do a
get on this url, I'll get 'http://www.foo.com/index.htm' by default. But
'http://www.foo.com' is also a directory at the to level. So if a user types
'http://www.foo.com' I don't know if I should perform a Get or a Propfind,
both are valid. The user types the same thing for directory browsing in
'http://www.foo.com' and for getting the default page.

I agree.
This is why I posted this question. And probably why the 'web folders' have
to go through 'file/open' with a checkbox that say's it should be opened as
a folder.
