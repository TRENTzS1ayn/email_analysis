I think this mostly a UI problem. From the user's point of view, have two "views" 
on a collection resource; it's GET response, and the listing of collection members
from a PROPFIND response. These correspond to the traditional "web browser" mode of
operation, and the traditional "file browser/explorer" mode of operation.

Like you say, in Web Folders you have the "Open as Web folder" checkbox on open
dialog, which selects which of these views should be used for the given URI. 
Another way to do this (maybe Web Folders does this too, I've not been that side of
the fence for a while?), is to have some way of switching between modes from within
the browser; a toolbar button, or a drop-down box, or whatever.

So then, the user can browse about their web site, happily viewing their pages,
then maybe they want to move some files about, so they hit the "view collection
contents" button, and they can do that, then switch back again when they've
finished. That would be a nice interface, IMO.
