At Jim Whitehead's request, I have updated my Internet-Draft,
draft-ietf-webdav-dublin-core, on how to use Dublin Core metadata in
WebDAV.  This time it's much more coherent: since the Dublin Core group
has defined an RDF encoding for Dublin Core metadata, I can use that
syntax directly.  The new Draft is attached, so I can get comments
before resubmitting it.

One important note: I have not been able to find the actual
specification of the RDF encoding, only an example or two.  Could
someone from dc-general please give me a URL to refer to?

2 Abstract

   This document specifies a mapping for using the metadata vocabulary 
   of Dublin Core ([DUBLIN]) in a WebDAV ([WEBDAV]) server.

3 Introduction

   This document specifies a mapping for using the metadata vocabulary 
   of Dublin Core ([DUBLIN]) in a WebDAV ([WEBDAV]) server.

   WebDAV defines a protocol for manipulating metadata on a Web 
   resource; in WebDAV, an element of metadata is called a property. 
   Dublin Core defines several metadata elements, with standard names 
   and standard meanings. A server which stores Dublin Core metadata for
   its content may wish to make the metadata available as WebDAV 
   properties; to forestall the emergence of incompatible ways to 
   provide this functionality, this document defines a mapping from 
   Dublin Core element labels into WebDAV property names.

4 Mapping

   The approach taken in this mapping is to leverage the RDF encoding 
   ([DC-RDF]) of Dublin Core. An [RDF] document encoding Dublin Core 
   data would look something like this:

      <?xml version="1.0"?>

Stracke                                                    [Page 1]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Dublin Core in WebDAV              May 22, 1999

      <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 
      xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/" 
      xmlns:dcq="http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/">
      <rdf:Description about="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">
      <dc:creator>
      <rdf:Description>
      <rdf:value>Crocker, David</rdf:value>
      <dcq:creatorType 
      rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/schema/LastnameFirstname#"/>
      </rdf:Description>
      </dc:creator>
      </rdf:Description>
      </rdf:RDF>

   The mapping defined here works by identifying each subelement of 
   <rdf:Description> with a single WebDAV property. Since WebDAV 
   properties are expressed as XML elements ([XML]), using XML 
   namespaces ([XMLNS]) allow different groups to define sets of 
   properties without interfering with each other, the mapping is direct
   and one-to-one. In this case, the namespaces being used are 
   <URI:http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/>, 
   <URI:http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/>, and 
   <URI:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>. To obtain the 
   Dublin Core creator for the resource 
   <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt>, a WebDAV client would issue a 
   PROPFIND method to the resource, requesting the dc:creator property:

      PROPFIND /rfc/rfc822.txt HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.ietf.org
      Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
      Content-Length: xxxx

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
      <D:propfind xmlns:D="DAV:">
      <D:prop xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/">
      <dc:creator/>
      </D:prop>
      </D:propfind>

   The response to the request would provide the <dc:creator> element 
   just as in the RDF document above.

4.1 Complications

   A previous version of this document had some difficulties with 
   advanced sections of the Dublin Core model. This version addresses 
   these problems, but it may be useful to enumerate them for future 
   reference.

4.1.1 Multivalued Properties

   A WebDAV property can occur on a resource only once, while a content 
   item may bear more than one instance of a Dublin Core element. The 

Stracke                                                       [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Dublin Core in WebDAV              May 22, 1999

   previous document defined an ad hoc XML syntax for listing multiple 
   values, which drew criticism from people who wanted more general 
   multivalued property support for WebDAV. This document is able to 
   sidestep the problem because Dublin Core now has its own solution, 
   and it is not necessary to create a new one. In the above example, if
   RFC-822 had multiple authors, the <dc:creator> element would contain 
   multiple <rdf:value> elements.

4.1.2 Subelements

   When the previous document was written, some members of the Dublin 
   Core group had plans to support more structure in their metadata, but
   had not yet defined a syntax for it. At this time, the debate over 
   subelements is still not fully resolved, but the syntax in the RDF 
   encding has been established: to add extra data on a dc: element, one
   nests a dcq: element within it, as a qualifier, as in the 
   <dcq:creatorType> element in the RDF example above.

5 Internationalization Considerations

   XML is an inherently internationalizable format, able to express any 
   language or character set; as a result, all WebDAV properties, 
   including the Dublin Core properties defined here, are 
   internationalizable.

6 Security Considerations

   The security considerations of this mapping are those of [DUBLIN] 
   plus those of [WEBDAV].

7 IANA Considerations

   The namespace defined here is isomorphic to the element namespace 
   defined in [DUBLIN], so this document introduces no new IANA 
   considerations beyond those of [DUBLIN].

10 Acknowledgements

   The triviality of this specification is due to the hard work put into
   [WEBDAV], [DUBLIN], [XML], and [XMLNS] by their respective authors 
   and working groups.

   The need for this specification was pointed out (by Jim Whitehead, I 
   think) during the variants discussion held after a meeting of the 
   versioning design team of the WebDAV working group.

   Thanks to Liz Parrot for alerting me to the question of subelements.
