Section 6.3, last paragraph. It mentions that the use of the lock token
must also be enforced through the server's authentication mechanism.

That mechanism may or may not be a header, but the RFC is quite clear (in
my mind) that simply holding a token is not enough. You must have the
token and you must have the same authentication as that used when the lock
was created. Given these two pieces of state, you are allowed to operate
on the target resource.

Many clients may not set that field. I don't think that you can
necessarily depend upon it. But: I tend to agree that there is nothing
better, and that field *is* intended for human consumption (and,
therefore, for asking whether a lock should be cancelled).
