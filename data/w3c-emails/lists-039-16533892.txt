I think maybe we haven't made it clear what we are trying to accomplish by
saying that DELETE must be atomic.  And maybe expressing it that way is
confusing.  Here are the results we want (I think):

1. DELETE removes a single binding.  It does not remove all the bindings to
a resource, only the one identified by the Request-URI.  If it happens to be
the last binding, then what happens about garbage collection of either
content or properties is outside the scope of the spec.  DELETE is just
about removing the binding.

2. In the case where the binding is to a collection, DELETE still means only
remove the binding to that collection.  It is not acceptable to walk the
tree deleting bindings to descendents of that collection.  This would have
disastrous consequences in an environment with multiple bindings to
resources.  To resurrect an example of Jason's:

User UA uses URL /a/C/ to access collection coll1.  User UB uses URL /b/C/
to access the same collection.  Now suppose UA issues a DELETE on /a/C/.
What you want is for UB to be able to continue to use /b/C/ to access the
collection (and all its descendents).  So you can't go deleting the bindings
in coll1 to all its children.  All you want to do is remove the binding
a:(C->coll1) from collection /a/.

Does either of these restrictions cause problems for mod_dav?
