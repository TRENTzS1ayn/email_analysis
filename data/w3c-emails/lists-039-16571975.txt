Would this information be suitable on a page for the webdav.org site?  Might
even put some pressure on proxy developers to support RFC 2518, and to allow
their administrators to name additional methods that should be allowed over
HTTP (e.g. so that new advanced collections or DASL commands can be added).

Apache mod_proxy works fine too. IIRC Squid 2.3 will pass through the
methods defined in 2518, but will still block methods it doesn't
understand.
