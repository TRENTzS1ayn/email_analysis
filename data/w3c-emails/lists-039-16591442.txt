   No, that is a requirement on the implementation, not the protocol.
   Why don't you just use the two paragraphs that Judy listed?

I like Judy's two paragraphs, so that's fine with me.

Just for interests sake, since my rewording was intended to be just
state the key point from Judy's two paragraphs, what was wrong with
it?  Doesn't a protocol always defines requirements on the
implementation?  (I'm not disagreeing with you, I just didn't
understand your point.)

   This has nothing to do with "atomicity".

I agree.  The term "atomicity" should not be used in this context.

   It does, however, raise a
   problem in that removing the last binding to a non-empty collection might
   be unacceptable to the server.  This second case should allow the server
   to report an informative error if it requires that the collection be
   empty first (this would depend on the nature of the colection resource,
   not on some aspect of the protocol).

Good point.  An appropriate error status should be defined.

Cheers,
Geoff
