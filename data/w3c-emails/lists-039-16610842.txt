Section 5 of redirectref-02 says "MKRESOURCE can be used to create a
resource of any type other than standard data containers and collections."
(and this is repeated at the beginning of 5.1)

5.1 then goes on to say: "If the DAV:propertyupdate does not specify a
DAV:resourcetype, the resource will be a standard data container."... so,
can MKRESOURCE create "standard data containers", or can't it?

What is meant by a "standard data container" in this context? Maybe it is
the intent that MKRESOURCE without specifying the resourcetype is
equivalent to a PUT of a zero-length entity-body followed by a PROPPATCH?
