A protocol requires that the externally visible behavior of the
component match that expected by the protocol.  The way you phrased
it was specifying the state within the collection component rather
than what was visible to other components.  Consider, for example,
that a hierarchical database implementation of collections might
have dual-linked relations between sister collections, and thus
deletion of one collection would have to effect another collection.

The point being that we don't have to require anything beyond what
the protocol means -- specifying anything beyond that is just overkill
and tends to limit implementations unnecessarily.
