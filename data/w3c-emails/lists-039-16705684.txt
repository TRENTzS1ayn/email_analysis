This topic is currently being hotly debated in the thread:
"WebDAV Bindings - Issue Yaron.AtomicDelete"

Although 2518 currently implies "yes", the authors of the BIND protocol
extension have proposed that the answer be changed to "no".  Stay tuned (:-).

Minimally, we shall insist that a server be *allowed* to
leave all member collections unmodified if it cannot delete
the collection specified in the DELETE request.

Cheers,
Geoff
