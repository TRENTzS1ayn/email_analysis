   Puzzlement: why would you want to do content negotiation on version history?
   It's just data; how it gets viewed is up to the user agent.

The history property attributes were being used to decrease the amount
of history data that was being sent to the client.  So I believe by
"how you would like to view it", Yaron was referring to "how you would
like to control what subset of the data you actually get sent".
