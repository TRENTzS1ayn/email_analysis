Bill the answer for RFC 2518 is an unequivocal YES.

What is being argued is if we should change that YES to a no. This will
require issuing a new version of RFC 2518.

Until such a new version is issued the answer is YES.

BTW, Geoff, RFC 2518 already supports having the server refuse to change any
of the members if it can't delete the root.
