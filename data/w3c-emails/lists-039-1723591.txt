I agree that there are different ways to view the history.  But I believe
that a general query mechanism such as DASL would be a better
way to provide these reports, rather than a set of predefined property
types and attributes.

Until the DASL query mechanisms are defined, we get at least some
level of report customizability through standard PROPFIND mechanisms.

The results of PROPFIND is an XML report.  It has the advantage of
being understood by all browsers that implement PROPFIND, rather than
being limited to just those browsers that understand the DeltaV extensions.
