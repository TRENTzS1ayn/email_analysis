Another approach we could take would be to keep the terms "member"
and "binding" distinct, with a binding being a mapping from a segment
name to a resource, and leave the term "member" to mean a URL
(as it is in RFC-2518).  This would produce the following changes:

"An association between a single path segment and a resource.
A binding is part of the state of a collection, and identifies an
internal member of the collection.  A new binding
to a collection resource creates a new URL mapping to that
collection resource and new URL mappings to each of the members
of that collection."

"A resource whose state consists of a set of bindings which identify
the internal members of that collection."

(Do not need the term "Member Binding" since there is no other kind
of binding).

"Since DELETE of a single binding can delete many mappings, a DELETE
may fail if any of those mappings are locked."
