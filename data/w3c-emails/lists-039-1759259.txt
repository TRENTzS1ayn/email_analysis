I disagree that DASL is the right approach.  The different "types" of
history are really about semantic interpretation by the store.  I don't
believe this can be expressed in DASL short of using an attribute. 

I also don't believe that content negotiation is viable.  What if the report
was a document that it, itself, could be subject to content negotiation.

It seems, to me at least, that a property attirbute or multiple properties
is still the best way to go.  The later means an "explosion" of properties
(n * m).

I agree that there are different ways to view the history.  But I believe
that a general query mechanism such as DASL would be a better
way to provide these reports, rather than a set of predefined property
types and attributes.

Until the DASL query mechanisms are defined, we get at least some
level of report customizability through standard PROPFIND mechanisms.

The results of PROPFIND is an XML report.  It has the advantage of
being understood by all browsers that implement PROPFIND, rather than
being limited to just those browsers that understand the DeltaV extensions.
