I believe this won't buy you anything over HTTP/1.1 connection
pipelining. You'll still transfer just as much information, and you'll
still use a single TCP connection.

About the only thing that this could do would provide for the potential
for atomicity. IMO, that isn't enough of a win to compare to this
additional complexity.
