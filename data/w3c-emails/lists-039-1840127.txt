   Why is that? Because the client gets properties it doesn't understand? That's true
   for most cases, but a client which is trying to do server-to-server copying needs
   to get all the properties, whether it understands them or not.

Whenever a large or expensive "live" property is proposed, the main argument
against it (that I've heard) is that "it will make an allprop request too
expensive".  Why do you need allprop for server-to-server copying when you
have a COPY method?  The allprop approach is virtually assured of getting
an error, since there inevitably will be some live properties that cannot
be PROPPATCH'ed.

Cheers,
Geoff
