*** WORKING GROUP LAST CALL FOR COMMENTS ***

REQUIREMENTS FOR DAV SEARCHING AND LOCATING

This is the final call for comments from the working group on the document,
"Requirements for DAV Searching and Locating ", by Jim Davis,
Saveen Reddy, Judith Slein <draft-ietf-dasl-requirements-00>.
This last call for comments period begins immediately, and ends Friday,
June 16, 1999 at midnight Pacific time. This allows 2 weeks for comments,
and is intended to allow working group members to detect obvious errors in
the specification.

If necessary, at the end of the last call period, a new draft will be issued
(revision -01), containing any changes based on comments received during the
working group last call period.  Unless there are significant technical
problems raised during the last call period, this document will be
immediately forwarded to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for
approval as an Informational RFC.

If there are any procedural questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to
contact me, or raise an issue on the list.

- Alex Hopmann
Chair, IETF DASL Working Group
