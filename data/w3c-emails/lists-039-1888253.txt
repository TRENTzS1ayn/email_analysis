I agree with John.  The Collection Properites I-D
(http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hopmann-collection-props-0
0.txt)
describes a property, DAV:defaultdocument, which is used so that the DAV
user (with sufficient permissions) can control what document is
displayed when a GET is performed on a collection.  This seems to work
pretty well, and is completely consistent with down-level clients.
