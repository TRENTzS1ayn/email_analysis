I was planning to ask them to let me call it -02, to avoid confusion with the
unofficial -01.  (In retrospect, I obviously shouldn't have released the -01
without submitting it; but it's too late now.)

I'll probably mail in two files with different numbers, so they can pick
easily.

I'll take a look.  Unfortunately, doing a table may be hard, because I'm using
a hand-rolled XML-to-text converter (with custom tags designed for the kinds of
things that are needed in Drafts), and I don't have anything like <table>.  I
might cheat and create a <pre> tag, though.  :-)

OK, sounds good.

Right, OK.

Thanks.  :-)
