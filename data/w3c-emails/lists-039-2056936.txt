The sentence is correct, but confusing.  (I think I had to go back over it
the first time I read it, too.) I agree that's that what it seems to
suggest, but it doesn't actually mean that.  It's just giving one scenario
where the request must fail; it doesn't say anything about when it should
succeed.

It might be best to simplify the example, changing "and neither /a/b/ nor
/a/b/c/ exists" to "and /a/b/c/ does not exist".
