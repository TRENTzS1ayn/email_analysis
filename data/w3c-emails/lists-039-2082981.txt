New revisions of the Advanced Collections Protocol and Advanced Collections
Requirements specifications were submitted today to the Internet-Drafts
repository.

The new Advanced Collections Protocol specification,
draft-ietf-webdav-collection-protocol-04, is available via the WebDAV WG web
site, at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/draft-ietf-webdav-collecti
on-protocol-04.txt

This specification is rapidly nearing completion.  I expect there will be
one more revision to clear up minor points in this specification, and to
incorporate any feedback received during the Oslo IETF meeting, and then
this specification will go to working group last call for comments.  This
draft no longer contains direct references, and instead introduces the
concept of a binding.  In the opinion of the specification design team, it
significantly cleans up the semantics of collections in WebDAV.

If you've been waiting for a solid specification to read and review, this is
it.  Wait no longer, the train is starting to leave the station.  I expect
we will be submitting this for IESG approval in late July or early August.
Review now for your comments to have maximum impact.

There is also a new Advanced Collections Requirements specification,
draft-ietf-webdav-collection-reqts-05, which is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/draft-ietf-webdav-collecti
on-reqts-05.txt

Both of these specifications should appear in the Internet Drafts repository
within a few days.

Thanks go to Judy Slein, and to the entire Advanced Collections design team
for their hard work.
