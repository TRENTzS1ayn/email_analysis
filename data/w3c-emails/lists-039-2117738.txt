IBM is pleased to announce release 1.0.27 of DAV4J to alphaWorks. This update
release fixes a few defects and provides complete support for IE5 Web Folders.
The specific updates are:

     DAV4J now completely supports Web Folders in Microsoft IE5.
     PROPFIND for a set or properties now returns the requested properties
     instead of all properties.
     PROPFIND with no entity request body now does PROPFIND with DAV:allprop to
     return all properties by default.
     DAV4J now supports the DAV:keepalive list for COPY/MOVE.
     Properties are now copied correctly when doing MOVE/COPY.
     COPY and MOVE work across servers.
     Added support for more mime types. More can be added by administrator.
     Improved test cases and samples.
     Names of properties in the DAV4J client API are now PropertyName objects
     instead of Strings. This allows the client API to fully support XML
     namespaces for property names.
     Method Resource.setContents() now (preferably) takes an addition parameter
     for specifying MIME type.
