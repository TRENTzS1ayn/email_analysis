This one isn't easy. 

As I discussed previously
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0303.html), it
is my personal opinion that the reasons for live properties have to do with
performance issues with HTTP. 

It made us do something that I now believe has very serious ramifications on
the ability of people to innovate using HTTP and upon the future
extensibility of the protocol.

So how does one make the trade off? Until we fix HTTP I guess the answer is
fairly obvious. Who cares if you have a perfect protocol if no one can
efficiently implement it?

Maybe we will fix this next time. In the meantime, if I was designing a
WebDAV extension I would do my best to stay away from using properties. 

If you can't, you can't. 

But I bet in most cases, you can.
