I am trying to attach to your WebDAV test server using Office 2000 beta
2 and I keep getting an error saying the site is not available or busy. 
I have tried to attach using other WebDAV servers and got in okay.  So
my question is this:  Did MS just mess up in their beta 2 implementation
of WebDAV?  I don't seem to be able to connect to any server using
it....not even their NT 5 Beta 2 server.  Or, is there some setup or
syntax that perhaps I am missing when trying to make my connection?  Any
ideas?

Thanks,
