Robert,

     We haven't had any better luck with Office 2000 than you have.  We saw
the same symptoms with our WebDAV server as were reported in testing Office
2000 with the PyDAV and mod_dav servers, so I assume something is not
working right in Office 2000.

     Can someone from Microsoft shed some light on the current status of
interoperability testing between MSIE5/Office 2000 and any of the available
WebDAV servers?

Cheers......    Randall
