Finally this is available for you to peruse.  Note that this is a proposal
for a set of OPTIONAL properties that make it easier to do client-side GUIs
for DAV.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: Additional WebDAV Collection Properties
Author(s): A. Hopmann, L. Lippert
Filename: draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt
Pages: 5
Date: 06-Jan-99

   The WebDAV protocol defines a basic set of properties that should be
   understood by all DAV servers. This document defines a small set of
   additional properties that are very useful for displaying navigation
   interfaces for WebDAV enabled web sites.


A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
