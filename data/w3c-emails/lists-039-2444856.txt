Subject: RDF Model and Syntax moves to W3C Proposed Recomendation


We are pleased to announce that the W3C has granted Proposed
Recommendation Status to the RDF Model and Syntax specification [1].
RDF is the result of several metadata communities bringing together
their needs to provide a robust and flexible architecture for supporting
metadata on the web.  Additional information on RDF including software,
projects, and presentations can be found on the RDF home page [2].
Public comments and discussion on this work are welcomed [3].
