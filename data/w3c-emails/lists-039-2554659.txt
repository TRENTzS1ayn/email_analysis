greetings;

Is the nature and behaviour of structured documents specified at any other
place in webdav specs? I note the term for the first time in "1.7 The
isstructureddocument Property". Just to check, I went back through
"draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-10" and find that the word "structured" appears in
generic or colloquial senses only and that there is neither a description of
the content nor one of the behaviour of such a resource.

If this document (draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt) is the only place
where the term appears, then a more extensive definition and a distinction
between structured documents and generic collections are necessary. for
instance, is the intended hierarchy
 collection
   structured-document
     directory
or is it
 collection
   structured-document
   directory
?

Note that I very much welcome the introduction of s-d's as specialized
collections, as webdav, in its present form, is a bit fixated on "directories
/ folders" as the only collection forms. Where, for example, I would like to
consider a patient record to be a special form of collection, I'd be
stretching the present spec. on the other hand I can't express enough if I try
to model them as generic resources.

bye,
