You are correct -- structured (or compound) documents are not well defined
in any existing WebDAV specifications.

This seems quite reasonable -- otherwise, how would you know how to set the

I don't follow this, since my understanding of what is meant by structured
document in the WebDAV sense isn't covered by these two cases.  Could you
give some examples of what you mean here?

I'll let Lisa speak to her intent is when she says "structured document".
