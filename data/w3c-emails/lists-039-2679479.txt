But, for that, you can create a multipart/related whose body parts are stored
externally, using a message/external-body (or perhaps just a Content-Location:,
though that's apparently not part of MIME proper).

Advantages of doing structured documents as multipart/related instead of
collections:

   * There are obviously going to be types of structured documents;
     multipart/related already has a mechanism and namespace for specifying
     these types.
   * Given a multipart/related document with externall parts, there's an
     obvious way to serialize the document for transport.
   * Structural sharing: if two structured documents use the same image (for
     example), and the DAV server doesn't support references, then a
     collections-based approach requires that that image be copied, since
     there's no way for a client to tell the server to have it show up in both
     collections.  With a multipart/related approach, you just have both
     documents reference the same image.
   * Cross-server documents: with multipart/related, the external body parts
     can live anywhere on the Net (well, anywhere accessible to the client,
     anyway ;-).  With collections, this works only if the DAV server supports
     references.

(Mind you, I hope references will be pretty common; but, if we don't have to
depend on them, we shouldn't.)
