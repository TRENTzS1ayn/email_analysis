Give 'em a MIME type, maybe define a URL scheme to access them, and you're
done.

Multiparts can contain multiparts.

Split them out with message/external-body or Content-Location:.

multipart/alternative

Content-Type:

This should be addressed by the versioning protocol, since each version will
be a resource.

Split them out (as above).

Now, it may be a good idea for someone to form a WG on how to use MIME and
DAV for compound documents.  But they shouldn't need to create any new
mechanisms; they're all there.  I think.  :-)
