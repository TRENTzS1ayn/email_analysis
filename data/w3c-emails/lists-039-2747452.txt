[please note - beyond what one can set in a browser, my experience with mime
types ends with 'text/xml'.]

while  i won't assert, given a cursory reading of rfc 1521, that multipart is
obsolete, i wouldn't deny it either.

as does xml - dtd's - or whatever schema form follows on. xml has the
disadvantage that it does not permit inline encoding variations, but it does
permit references to arbitrary external encodings (including those covered by
mime types) and it does offer better means to discover document structure.

xml is incomplete in this regard, but only in the sense the the possible
semantics of links is not yet "ratified".

wouldn't href="..." or imgsrc="..." accomplish the same thing.

i have to look back at the webdav spec for this....
i'm not sure what the issue is in this paragraph. "reference" does not appear
to be a special term w.r.t dav collections. which i would take to mean that
uri's suffice - which i would expect any http-capable server to support... ?
