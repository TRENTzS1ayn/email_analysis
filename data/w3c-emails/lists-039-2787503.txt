The body of an HTTP request/response is payload.  If it contains anything
significant to the semantics of the operation or result, aside from a
representation of data as defined by those semantics, then it isn't HTTP.
It is something else tunneling inside HTTP, which is a waste of bytes.

In general, if you find yourself with many new methods and request
header fields, then it means there is something fundamentally wrong
with the protocol design.  Usually the fix is to do the same thing
with far fewer extensions simply by using a redirect to a different
resource rather than using new methods/fields to act indirectly.

This is from experience -- I haven't looked at the WebDAV versioning
stuff at all.
