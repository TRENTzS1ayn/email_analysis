The minutes from the January 14, 1998 conference call on Advanced
Collections have been placed on the WebDAV web site, at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/dt/Minutes990114.txt

An intermediate draft of the Advanced Collections protocol specification,
produced for discussion during the conference call, is available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/dt/CollSpec021.txt

These are both also available via the WebDAV WG home page:

Thanks are due to Judy Slein for her work in organizing the conference call,
producing the intermediate draft, and generating minutes so quickly
afterwards.
