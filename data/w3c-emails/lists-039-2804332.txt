I discussed some of these marshalling issues in a workshop paper I wrote for
the HTTP Future workshop held at WWW7 last year -- it complements Yaron's
header/body rationale post. The paper is titled, "Lessons from WebDAV for
the Next Generation Web Infrastructure", and covers the topics of parameter
marshalling, multi-resource operations, operations on resource hierarchies,
status reporting, and built-in lock support.  The paper was written to try
and separate out the "take-home" lessons from WebDAV which would be of
interest to future protocol authors, specifically for HTTP-NG.
