A new, interim version of the advanced collections protocol specification
has been updated, and placed on the WebDAV Web site at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collections/dt/CollSpec023.txt

A change report listing changes between this, and previous revisions, is
available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collections/dt/ssreport.txt

The purpose of this interim revision is to provide the basis for discussions
during the Advanced Collections conference calls, and to also keep the
working group informed of the current state of the document.  Comments on
this, or any WebDAV draft are welcomed.
