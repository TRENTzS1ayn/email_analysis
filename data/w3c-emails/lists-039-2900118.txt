Just wondering why it's necessary to use the specific 207 response code
for *all* multi-status responses - why can't a more meaningful code be
used as appropriate? For instance, when a multi-status response is needed
if MOVE or DELETE fails, use a 4xx class response. It still bugs me that a
2xx class code is used for methods which fail. 

Regards,

joe
