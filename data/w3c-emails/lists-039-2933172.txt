It seems to me it is still broken.  Consider the following

PROPFIND / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic anJkOmZvbw==
Host: www.fwi.com
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 115
 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<A:propfind xmlns:A="DAV:">
  <A:prop>
    <A:resourcetype/>
  </A:prop>
</A:propfind>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 22 Jan 1999 19:02:16 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.3 (Unix) WSD/DAV 0.5.14
Connection: close
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory
 
0
 

Three problems here:
 1) the Content-Type should be text/xml or application/xml
 2) There's not PROPFIND reply.  Note that PROPFIND seems to work if there
is no request body at all, it only fails when a non-null body is provided.
 3) httpd/unix-directory is not a standard MIME type
 
My test scripts require PROPFIND to work, so I have not tested anything
further.
