I'm occasionally getting '422 Unprocessable Entity' responses, usually
soon followed by a closed socket. Haven't been able to reproduce this
predictably.

I thought this might be sitecopy but I can't find any problems when
testing against IIS or mod_dav.

Try something like this to see it happen with sitecopy (latest code from
http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/develop.html). 

mkdir `seq 1 100`
sitecopy -d9 -u sitename

Regards,

joe
