Unfortunately, the person who initially volunteered to write an introductory
article on WebDAV for IEEE Multimedia is now unable to write the article.
So, I'm making a second call for volunteers.

I'm looking for someone to write an article for IEEE Multimedia, first draft
due the first of March, which gives an introduction to WebDAV for the IEEE
Multimedia audience, over 10,000 strong.

I see there being a lot of opportunities out there for people who like to
write, and who like WebDAV.  Articles need to be written on many topics,
like:

* Programming with WebDAV
* Getting up and running with your WebDAV server
* Introductions to WebDAV, at varying levels of detail, for varying
audiences

There are still many people who would be interested in WebDAV, but who just
haven't heard about it yet.  I need your help to spread the word.
