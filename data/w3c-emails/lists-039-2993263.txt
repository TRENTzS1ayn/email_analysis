Subject: Revised Internet-Draft boilerplate



Following up on the discussion in the plenary session at the IETF meeting in
Orlando and the discussion on the poised mailing list, the IESG on Thursday,
January 28th approved the new boilerplate text that must be included with
all Internet-Draft submissions.

Beginning Monday, February 1, all Internet-Draft submissions must include
the new boilerplate.  Any submissions that do not use the new text will
be returned to the author/submitter.

The new template can be accessed with this URL:
