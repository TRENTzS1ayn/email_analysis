In many file systems, the implementation of move is different depending on
the source and targets. Windows for example does something different if the
move is within the same device or on a different device. UNIX is similar.
So maybe we need to just state the semantics of MOVE in WebDAV and not tie
it to a particular implementation, for example, the implementation implied
by COPY followed by DELETE. Then the semantics can be expressed in a
resource-dependent way if necessary including distinguishing references
from concrete resources as necessary to produce meaningful results.
