Sounds good.

Now to check the history of the decision to say MOVE == COPY+DELETE....

I've just done that.  I've found nothing in the earlier discussions besides
the mentioning of cross-server/device copy/move that might require
COPY/DELETE approach.  I think we've already dealt with that in this
thread.

In reading the spec, rather than just the mailing list, I see the WebDAV
spec isn't that far off.  It just needs to be clearer about intent.  It's
description COPY/DELETE isn't too bad depending on how you interpret it.
We probably should leave a bit less for interpretation though.  I think
that's what JimA just suggested when he spoke of semantics vs.
implementation.
