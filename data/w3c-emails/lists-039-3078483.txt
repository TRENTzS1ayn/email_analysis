The question of what does COPYing a link mean is an interesting one.  It has
been a while since I used UNIX, so I don't recall how copy behaves.
However, on Windows, if you copy a link then you have copied the link.
Saves to the link go to the original file.  This seems really intuitive to
me because the link has a glyphette that differentiates the link from the
original.

On the other side of the coin, it is not unreasonable to expect the "share
and branch" semantics that VSS provides.  That is, you copy and when you
update you sever the link.

I guess my initial feeling is that COPYing a link does just that and if we
want to have a "copy on write" semantics, then we use a separate method or
special form of COPY.
