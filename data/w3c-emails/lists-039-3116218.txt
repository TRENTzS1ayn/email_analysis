Thank you Greg for taking the lead in producing the webdav.org site!  I
think it's a great step forward in bridging the gap between the community of
protocol developers within the IETF working group, and the rapidly emerging
development and user communities.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to call for volunteers to help Greg,
both to help out with the webdav.org site, and also to assist in the
development of mod_dav, the Apache WebDAV module.  In my view, having both
healthy open source and commercial development communities is crucial to the
adoption of WebDAV by a broad audience.

So,

* if you're a programmer, and could spare some time to work on or test
mod_dav functionality
* if you're a Web site designer, and want to work on webdav.org
* if you're a programmer in languages such as Java, C, C++, Python, Tcl and
others, and you'd like to develop an API for WebDAV for that language
* you have a great idea for a WebDAV application, and want to work with
others to make it a reality
* if there's an existing project (like Joe Orton's sitecopy, or UCI's WebDAV
Explorer) that you'd like to help work on

then...

I heartily encourage you to get in contact with Greg Stein <greg@lyra.org>,
or myself <ejw@ics.uci.edu>, so we can put you in contact with others who
are interested in the same thing, and so we can get your interest or project
up on webdav.org.

Many hands *do* make light work, and right now as interest in WebDAV is
ramping up, your individual contributions can make a big difference.

- Jim
