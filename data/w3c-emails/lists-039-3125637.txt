Great news! We are currently working on DAV support for Zope,
our open source web object publishing environment. I hope to 
have a prototype that includes at least basic class 1 support
ready soon so that we can get into interoperability testing.

Synergy with Apache is important to us as many Zope users 
run one or more Zope installations in the url namespaces of
their existing Apache servers, so we'll definitely be putting
some time into testing peaceful co-existence with mod_dav. Let
me know if there are particular things we can do to help the
mod_dav effort on this front.

Once I have the prototype ready, we'd be happy to put an 
installation on webdav.org for folks to beat on and test
against. I'll also work on getting a overview of Zope WebDAV 
support up on the www.zope.org site that can be listed in
webdav.org's projects area.
