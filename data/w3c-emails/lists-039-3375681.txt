The cut-off for Internet-Draft submissions prior to the
Minneapolis IETF meeting is Friday, February 26, 1999 
at 5pm ET. Internet-Drafts received after this time will not be 
announced nor made available in the Internet-drafts Directories.

We will begin processing Internet-Draft submissions the week
following the IETF meeting.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
