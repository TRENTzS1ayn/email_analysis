The spec (RFC 2518) is inconsistent about the expected contents of the src
and dst XML elements.  In particular are they supposed to contain an href
XML element, or a 'raw' URI.

1. The description of the link XML element (12.4) says:

   The values in the href XML elements inside
   the src and dst XML elements of the link XML element MUST NOT be
   rejected if they point to resources which do not exist."

which implies the former.

2.  The definition of dst (12.4.1) and src (12.4.2) say that the value is a
URI and the contents is PCDATA, which implies the latter.

3. The example of the source property (13.10.1) shows src without an href

    <D:src>http://foo.bar/program</D:src>

So which is it?

One reason I ask is that someone asked me how to express anchors with
smaller granularity than an entire resource, for example byte ranges or
Xpointers.

Could I write, e.g.

<src><href>http://foo.bar/program</href>
     <byte-range><start>100</start><length>255</length></byte-range></src>
