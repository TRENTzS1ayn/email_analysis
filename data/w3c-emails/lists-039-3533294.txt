I'm trying to nail down the model that we're using for references.  My
first question is,   is it possible to have references to references?

I assume the answer is yes.

Let's assume we set the ref target of resource A to be B.   And let's
assume  resouce B has a reftarget of C.   If I do a propfind on A, what
will we find it's reftarget to be equal to?

Do we require a specific behavior in this case or are we allowing this to
be unspecified for the sake of future (ref-integrity, etc) flexibility?
