1 The WebDAV Book of Why

V.Alpha 2 - 02/14/99 2:39 PM

1.1 Introduction

This is my personal collection of posts from the WebDAV mailing list. I use
this collection to save me time in answering questions about the design of
the WebDAV distributed authoring standard. In here you will find answers to
everything you ever wanted to know, but were wise enough not to ask, about
how WebDAV ended up the way it did.

Many of these papers contain histories of how various features were
developed. Almost all the histories are wrong. The reason they are wrong is
that:
a) I have a lousy memory
b) I didn't bother to actually research my answers
c) All of the above

On the other hand I have been reviewing some of the old drafts, meeting
notes and mailing lists and there is quite a story in there. Did you know
that WebDAV was originally written to use POST? That WebDAV had support for
fully distributed searching and eventing? We have all the drafts, all the
meeting notes and the entire mail archive. I'm sure there is a researcher
out there who would just love to dive in to a fully documented history of
the development of a protocol. For more information please contact Jim
Whitehead, chief librarian and head researcher of the WebDAV archives.

Disclaimer:

Nothing said here is official, binding, normative, a standard or
representative of working group consensus. The official history of the
working group is contained in the meeting minutes, the mailing list and the
untold drafts the working group produced. The final word on all standards
issues is the RFC and failing that, working group consensus.

1.2 Changes

This is the second Alpha release of this reference. Each entry is marked
with the version number, V. Alpha 1 or V. Alpha 2 to indicate when it was
