Thanks for your post Judy. It helped me realize that the section of the
WebDAV Book of Why entitled "A Short history of copy and move" should really
be titled "A short history of copy". More than that, it helped me to realize
that the post really sucked. I swear it was funny when I wrote it, but
apparently in a "you had to be there" kind of way. Anyway I broke it out
into three separate posts which I have put up on the list.

Your post also helped me find this gem of a post (if I do say so myself =)
which goes into the gory details of exactly why locks are lost on moves -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1997JulSep/0177.html. As
you will see, the definition of MOVE did not play a part in the decision
requiring that locks be lost on MOVEs.

Also, while working on my response to your question I found Larry's post on
how to structure WebDAV which sparked this post
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1999JanMar/0130.html).

In fact, your post sparked so much new material that I just released the V.
Alpha 2 version of the WebDAV Book of Why
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1999JanMar/0129.html)

As to your specific points, I hope my post on MOVE
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1999JanMar/) helped to
explain the relationship of COPY and DELETE to MOVE and why the authors
wrote the language the way they did. More importantly I hope it explains why
the definition of MOVE does not prevent the functionality you are seeking.

Thanks,
Yaron
