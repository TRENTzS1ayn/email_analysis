I wasn't familiar with that form of OPTIONS. I'll go in there and get
the right thing done.

fwiw, mod_dav only supports Class 1 right now.

There is a known bug that requires the Destination header to specify the
port number in the absolute URI. The bug has been fixed and will be in
the next release (note that msdav.lyra.org is a stable server; it does
not track development, but is updated on each release). The 0.9.7
release should happen late Thursday night or earlier.

I greatly appreciate the feedback, and look forward to future bug
reports :-)

Cheers,
