I am implementing WebDAV server but I feel I might be hitting in a
brick wall. I was wondering if PROPPATCH command enforces atomicity?
Atleast according to the WebDAV draft it says that either all the
set/remove operations pass or they all fail which means rolling back.
Can't I do "besteffort" vs. "atomic" in case of PROPPATCH? Because in
my application scenario I am trying to replace the current protocol
that allows besteffort as well as atomic flexibility.

Any response would be appreciated.

Thanks,
-Imran
