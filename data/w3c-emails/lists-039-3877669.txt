Not that I know of. You'll need two round trips (at least) for that.

It really depends on how "atomic" you need to be. You can issue a SEARCH
followed by a PROPPATCH. If you need a true atomic operation, then you
can LOCK, SEARCH, (test), PROPPATCH, UNLOCK.

There are also funny things you can do with the If: header, but I'm not
really clear on how it can be used in situations like this.
