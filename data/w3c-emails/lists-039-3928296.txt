New Internet Draft revisions of the Advanced Collections requirements and
protocol specifications are now available via the WebDAV Web site.

Requirements:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/draft-ietf-webdav-collecti
on-reqts-04.txt

Protocol:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/draft-ietf-webdav-collecti
on-protocol-03.txt


Thank you Judy for organizing the conference calls, and leading this work
forward.

The advanced collections design team believes that these specifications are
close to being complete.  If you have been waiting for a stable revision of
these specifications before performing your review of these documents, wait
no longer.  Unless there is significant feedback on the mailing list, or
during the WG meeting in Minneapolis, these documents will rapidly proceed
to a working group last call in late March/early April.
