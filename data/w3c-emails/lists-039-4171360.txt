O.k. I'm completely lost. Let's try this again.

I have a resource which is available through two names, http://foo/bar and
http://iggy/pop. Someone requests and receives an exclusive write lock
against http://foo/bar. I assert that the immediate consequence is that
http://iggy/pop is ALSO write locked by the same principal.
