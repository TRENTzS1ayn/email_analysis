I agree with everything Judy said up to here, but cut it out for brevity.

   I don't quite get Geoff's comment that "The client needs to be warned that
   there really will *not* be a copy made," since I thought the position we
   were both supporting is that there *will* really be a copy made, both for
   direct references and for redirect references.

(This was a comment on invoking a COPY on a redirect reference.)

For a redirect reference COPY, you could either return the 302 and not do
anything (letting the client decide whether to do a "no-passthrough
copy" or copy the target explicitly), or you could return the 302
*and* actually do a "no-passthrough copy.

I slightly prefer the former (since normally a "302" means that the
operation did not happen, right?), but either one is fine with me.

Cheers,
Geoff
