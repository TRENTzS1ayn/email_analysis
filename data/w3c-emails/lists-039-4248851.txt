I agree with Yaron, at least for reftype and refintegrity.

An example
<dav:resourcetype>
  <dav:reference>
   <dav:reftype><dav:direct/></dav:reftype>
   <dav:refintegrity/>
  </dav:reference>
</dav:resourcetype>

but as for the reftarget, my intuition says it does not part of the "type".
 if I have two different references, with different targets, but otherwise
the same (both are direct references with no integrity) then they should be
exactly the same "resourcetype".

Judy's rebuttal (that DASL oesn't (yet) support searches on structured
properties) is best answered by saying that that is a problem (perhaps) for
DASL.   The DASL team choose (wisely, I think) to postpone addressing this,
but this is no reason that all of WebDAV must forever be restricted in
design choices.
