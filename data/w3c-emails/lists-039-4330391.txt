What really scares me is a scenario where I have a directory filled with
references but I'm using an RFC 2518 client. If I copy the directory I will
go from a directory that took up a few kilobytes (just to record the
references) to one of any random and potentially huge size. The source
directory ate 30Kb and the destination eats up 6 Gig. I would call that
surprising.

I would also invoke precedent here. In every system I have ever heard of
that supports references (read: links) a COPY always copies the link not the
destination. I would be very hesitant to go against three decades of
accumulated experience without a good reason.

Hence I believe that the default action should be no-passthrough on COPY.
