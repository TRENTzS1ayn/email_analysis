A reference is a resource. A target is a resource. A reference and its
target are two different resources.

The example below only applies to a resource with two names. It does not
necessarily apply to a reference and its target because these are two
separate resources.

However, because a reference masquerades as the target for down level
clients it is necessary to carefully control the reference's behavior in
order to ensure that down level client expectations are met. Please refer to
the thread on LOCK and references for an excellent example of where these
expectations can clash with reality.
