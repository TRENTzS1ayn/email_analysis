A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning 
Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Goals for Web Versioning
Author(s): J. Stracke, J. Amsden
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-version-goals-00.txt
Pages: 18
Date: 01-Mar-99

Versioning and configuration management are important features for
controlling the evolution of remotely authored Web content. Parallel
development leverages versioning capability to allow multiple authors
to simultaneously author Web content. These functions form a basis for
flexible, scaleable distributed authoring. This document describes a
set of scenarios, functional, and non-functional requirements for
web versioning extensions to the WebDAV protocol. It supersedes the
versioning-related goals of [WEBDAV-GOALS].

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-version-goals-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
