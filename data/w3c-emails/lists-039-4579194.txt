   RFC 2518 requires that a LOCK lock a resource.

Fair enough.

   A reference is a resource.

I'll buy that.

   A LOCK against a reference MUST lock the reference.

No it doesn't.  The target of a reference is also a resource.
All methods other than MOVE and DELETE operate on the target
of the reference, not on the reference itself.  It is therefore
both consistent and natural for the LOCK to apply to the
*target* resource.  Do you expect a PUT to apply to the
(non-existent) body of the reference itself?

I understand your desire to have the LOCK not only lock the
body of the resource, but also lock the "binding" of the URL
to that particular resource.  But the unacceptable consequences
of doing so have been pointed out in earlier messages in
this thread.

Cheers,
Geoff
