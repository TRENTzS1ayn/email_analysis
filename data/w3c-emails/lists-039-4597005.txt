Hi everyone,

Is a resource mutable as a whole ? I mean, can I have a resource that
has mutable properties and immutable properties ? So that if I check-out
a resource, just change a mutable property and check-in this, none
revision would be created (just the mutable property updated) ? In the
other hand, a change in an immutable property of a versionable resource
would create a new revision.

Thanks in advance,

Bruno
