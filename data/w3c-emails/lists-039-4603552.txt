No, I think that doing so would be an extension of the currently
known required URL-munging methods.

The URL-munging you're suggesting has some difficulties. For example,
what is the datatype of a "revision-id". Is it a number? A string?
US-ASCII? Can a "revision-id" be a string in Japanese? What is the
encoding of the munged-URL?
