Not quite--it is *a* protocol.  A schema would be an application-specific
protocol built on top of DAV.  There are presumably going to be plenty of
people
trying to do such protocols; Jim's just trying to set up a uniform way to
describe them, and a place to publish them, so that people can share their
work,
and try to get some ad hoc interoperability, even if they don't have
IETF blessing for their protocols.
