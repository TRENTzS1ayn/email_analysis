FYI, the WebDAV working group will be meeting at the Minneapolis IETF from
3:30 - 5:30 PM, on Wednesday, March 17.

Also on the same day is the DELTA-V BOF (discussing the creation of a new
working group to work specifically on Web versioning and configuration
management), which is scheduled from 1-3PM (Wednesday, March 17).
