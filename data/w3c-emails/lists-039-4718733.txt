I am trying to build the case to Xerox of the value of releasing the source
code for the Python WebDAV server and client I have built here.  I need
your help.

I would like to claim that if Xerox release the source code to the research
community, people would use it for experiments with the protocol and
extensions to the protocol.  Python is, arguably, the best language for
rapid prototyping currently in wide use.  So, for example, if one wanted to
experiment with adding support for referential members, ordered
collections, DASL, versioning, or access control, the Python code base
might be a good one for a first prototype.  (For production code, you'd
probably want to build on mod_dav or perhaps a Java base.) 

But is this claim true?

It would be very helpful to have replies from the community one way or the
other.   If you are going to reply, please do so quickly, as I have only a
few days to make the case.

What I'd like to know is:
 1. Who are you and what institution do you represent (academic,
commercial, government)
 2. What experiments would you perhaps do (this is not a committment, only an
  expression of interest)
 3. Whether you'd be likely to contribute bug fixes and extensions back to
a suitable (open) code repository

Usually when Xerox releases software like this, it is provided free for
research purposes, but other use (eg incorporated into commercial product
or service) requires negotiation.  Would this be a problem?

Thanks

Jim Davis
