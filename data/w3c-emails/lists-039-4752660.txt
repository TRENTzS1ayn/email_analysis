One of the goals of using URIs (hence URLs) for the names of properties was
to allow WebDAV properties to be developed by multiple communities of
interest without initially requiring central registration.  But, as Jim A.
points out, sometimes you want to be able to write property definitions down
someplace where everyone can find them.  In the IETF these central
registration points are called "registries", and are currently administered
by IANA.

It strikes me that the registration of resource types currently well handled
by the MIME registry, and there is no need to duplicate this.

However, I do feel there is a need for a registry of WebDAV properties,
since none currently exists.

Jim Amsden was suggesting that we set up a Web site and have the properties
listed there, an ad-hoc registry.  My only concern with this approach is the
lifespan of the web site.  WebDAV is going to be around for a long time,
tens of years at minimum I suspect, and any registry needs to have
institutional support which can guarantee the registry will be around for a
similar length of time.  In my view, IANA provides a reasonable guarantee
that they will be around for a long time. Thus I favor having IANA be the
registration authority, rather than a Web site.  It'll take a little more
initial work, but it will be more stable (and less painful) in the long run.

One deliverable this group should produce is a document creating a registry
of WebDAV properties.  I'm not an expert at creating registries, but at
minimum this document should contain:

 - An explanation of what the registry is for (in this case, DAV properties)
 - Information that needs to be provided for each property
   - property name
   - property semantics
   - DTD fragment for contents (if applicable)
   - BNF for internal syntax of elements (if applicable)
   - security considerations
   - contact information for the property maintainer
   - live or dead property  (& behavior if live)
