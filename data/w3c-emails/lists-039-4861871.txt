Oops.  Yeah, that would be a problem.  I just left it in there because it
seemed like a nice theoretical win that fell out of the decision to use
multipart/related and cid: URIs.

Uh...I didn't think I mentioned putting binary information in the XML.
I mentioned embedding the body of the resource into the XML, *if* the resource
was itself XML.

Hmm.  That's a good alternative, yeah.
