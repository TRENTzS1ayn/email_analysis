In DAV, the members of a collection are designated with complete
URLs. If the "revision-ID" is used to construct a relative URL which
is combined with the "version collection" to create the URL of a particular
version, then you wouldn't be doing any new URL munging, since you'd
be doing relative URL calculation. However, you'd want to make sure
that the relative URLs constructed didn't contain "/" or "." or reserved
characters.
