   In DAV, the members of a collection are designated with complete
   URLs. If the "revision-ID" is used to construct a relative URL which
   is combined with the "version collection" to create the URL of a particular
   version, then you wouldn't be doing any new URL munging, since you'd
   be doing relative URL calculation.

Good (so at least I don't have to redesign that part of the proposed
protocol :-).

   However, you'd want to make sure
   that the relative URLs constructed didn't contain "/" or "." or reserved
   characters.

I assume you could achieve this by requiring that a client escape
reserved characters in revision-ID's when using them to construct the URL?

Cheers,
Geoff
