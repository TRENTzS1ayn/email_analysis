I do not believe that the specification is clear on this. Specifically,
mod_dav stores the value as "\n    <R:BoxType Box Type A </R:BoxType\n".
The name is part of the find/patch request, rather than part of the
value.

A corollary is that mod_dav does not store any attributes that are
associated with the name element.

On a separate note: I believe I have detailed this appropriately on the
mod_dav home page (http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/), but if somebody goes
to read it and finds it isn't clear enough, then please let me know.
I've been trying to capture things that could be called "implementation
defined"; the only other imp-defined item, so far, is the <href> format
in a <response> element.
