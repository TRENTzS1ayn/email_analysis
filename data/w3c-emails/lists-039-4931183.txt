Hi all. 

We are happy to announce availability of a new server for
interoperability testing, running a WebDAV-enabled version 
of Zope, Digital Creations' Open Source web application platform.

Based on RFC2518, the new WebDAV support is tightly integrated 
with the Zope object model and security system. It is server
independent, requiring no specific WebDAV support on the part 
of the web server in use. More information is available on the
test server homepage at http://webdav.zope.org/.

There are two ways to get access to the test server. A "Public"
area which supports read-only DAV operations is available from
the test server homepage at http://webdav.zope.org/. To be given
access to your own private area where you can test write operations 
(PROPPATCH, MOVE, DELETE, etc.), please send an email to
webdav@zope.org.
The recipient is a human, so the command language is pretty flexible :) 

We'll send you a confirmation and instructions for accessing your
private area of the test server. We would like to hear the results 
of any interoperability testing you do - please send any feedback 
to webdav@zope.org.

For more information on the Zope web application platform, please 
visit the Zope website at http://www.zope.org.
