I saw this, too, but knew it was going to be there before looking :-)

Put 2 and 2 together: Lisa Lippert and Alex Hopmann (both of Microsoft)
have authored an Internet Draft for "Additional WebDAV Collection
Properties". Please see the URL:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/props/draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt

The I.D. covers defaultdocument, iscollection, ishidden, and
isstructureddocument.

This does leave the status of name, parentname, isreadonly,
contentclass, lastaccessed, and isroot up in the air. I can guess at
several of them, but it would be nice if MSFT could document them.

Part work in progress. Part "aggressive use" of the DAV: namespace :-)

Hrm. Looks like I need to get the property registry set up on
webdav.org...
