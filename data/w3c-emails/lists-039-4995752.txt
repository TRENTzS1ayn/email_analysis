Interesting - IE5 does not appear to be willing to follow
a 302 (Found) redirect when it does it's initial OPTIONS
request to the server... <sigh>. It does not seem very
tolerant in its interpretation of response codes - I've
noticed that it will also fail if the server returns a 
204 (No Content) instead of a 200 OK in response to an 
OPTIONS request.

That means you'll have to include the port number in the
url to open the public area with IE:
