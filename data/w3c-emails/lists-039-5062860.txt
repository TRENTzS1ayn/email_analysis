No problem. I appreciate the extended response, before the minutes
arrived.

Okay, I can see that. I'm not sure I buy into it, but I'll take the WG's
word that a schema-based registration is best. (maybe the minutes will
elucidate the issue, so I'll wait for those)

I think in this case, the registry would simply need to indicate that
"additional material" is available for the registered schema. I think it
makes a lot of sense to allow for add'l information to be stored with
the registry (authors, web sites, RFCs, etc).

No problem. This just affects the database schema (pun intended :-) for
the registry.

When I get the registry up (by next week maybe?), I'll pre-load it with
Lisa's property draft and we'll go from there.
