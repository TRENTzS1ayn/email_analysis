I haven't seen an argument against establishing one. Instead, the issue
seems to be that people want to see it organized around schemas rather
than individual properties.

So: I'll set up a registry at www.webdav.org. People can register
schemas and properties. Of course, you will also be able to get a flat
list of properties :-)

Oh, and "registry" may be a bit strong... it kind of connotes a
requirement that people register the properties they use. Anybody have a
better name for a place where people can place their information, for
simple communication/documentation?

Cheers,
