You _can_ pluck out the "author" property from the Dublin Core and
use it without using the rest of the Dublin Core properties. However,
you can't _interpret_ the Dublin Core "author" property without
at least some of the context of Dublin Core; e.g., its framework for
establishing author, publisher, creator, editor, songwriter, performer,
contributor, quoted source, translator and the relationship of those
to the date of publication, authorship, first performance, translation,
language, etc.

Even when properties stand alone, their definitions don't.
Thus, schemas. A registry of properties alone is like a book
index without the text it indexes: enough to tell you terms
were used, but not enough to understand the meaning.
