Hi all,

I just finished updating the WebDAV interoperability experience matrix,
which lists all known client/server pairs, and their current
interoperability status.  It's available at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/interop.html

If you're working on any of the clients or servers listed, and have updated
information for any of the table entries, please send me (and the list) an
email.

Thanks!

- Jim
