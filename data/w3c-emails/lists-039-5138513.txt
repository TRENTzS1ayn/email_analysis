Hi,
I saw couple of drafts for event notification mechanisms. Is there
currently working group for event notifications or do I base it on GENA
as defined by Josh Cohen et al. I remember seeing another draft from
Surendra Reddy based on WebDAV mechanism. Any help would be really
appreciated.

Thanks,
Rajiv
