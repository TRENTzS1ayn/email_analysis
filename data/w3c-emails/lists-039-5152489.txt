Hi Folks,
Since some of you have done IE5 interoperability testing successfully I
was wondering if you could help me out. When I do try to access my
WebDAV server and open it as Web Folder, IE sends the following
request:

OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1

and my response is:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 20 Jan 1998 20:52:29 GMT
Accept-Ranges: none
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL,
PROPFIND, PROPPATCH
Public: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL,
PROPFIND, PROPPATCH
DAV: 1, 2

But right after this my guess is IE thinks I am a frontpage server
instead of WebDAV Server and sends the following request:
"GET /_vti_inf.html HTTP/1.1", and after that POST something and so on.

How do I workaround this, should I be sending redirector or something.
Any help would be deeply appreciated.

Thanks,
Imran
