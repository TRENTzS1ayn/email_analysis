Urk.  IE 5 is finicky.  I recommend getting a TCP packet snooper and 
watching the interaction between IE 5 and a server that does speak
its brand of WebDAV.

One thing I've noticed in doing this kind of sniffing is that there's
a header that you can return with OPTIONS:

MS-Author-Via: DAV

that may help.

IE 5.0 Beta didn't like default namespaces; I haven't tested to see if
IE 5 has fixed that yet.  I'm not sure, but I think it needs to have
the status tag come before the prop in a propstat.

Be prepared for its upload.  When you drop something into Web Folders,
it first does a HEAD on the prospective location, then does a PUT
with Content-Length: 0, and then another PUT with the actual file.
