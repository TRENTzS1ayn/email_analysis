I'm looking at the Feb 99   RFC 2518 and I see it includes an Appendix 4
that talks about XML namespaces.  It includes the following

   [Note to the reader: This section does not appear in [REC-XML-NAMES],
   but is necessary to avoid ambiguity for WebDAV XML processors.]

And what follows doesn't seem to be in compliance with the XML name space
recomm. as written.  Perhaps we could mention why this is the case.  (Are
some XML processors broken?)  Just a reference to another document or
source of information would be helpful.

The only reference to this I've found in the mailing list are...

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0086.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0014.html

which really doesn't explain why that section is listed as it is in
RFC2518.
