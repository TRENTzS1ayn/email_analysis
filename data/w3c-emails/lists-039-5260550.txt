are we talking about whether the following elements are
equivalent or not?

     <cars:part xmlns:cars="http://www.cars.com/xml"/>
     <cars:mlpart xmlns:cars="http://www.cars.com/x"/>
     <cars:xmlpart xmlns:cars="http://www.cars.com/"/>

if so, I've once asked James Clark about this, and his answer was
that "the XML namespaces spec doesn't make them equivalent",
but on the other hand, that an XML system using namespaces
can treat them all the same if it wants to.
