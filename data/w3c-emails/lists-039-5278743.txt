Sure; you wouldn't expect it to anyway--we're supposed to be
content-neutral.

This one does bother me.  Suppose I have a property whose content
is an XML snippet--for example, a description of the resource which
can be displayed by some client.  The XML in this snippet will
have to follow WebDAV namespace rules, which are slightly more
restrictive than the standard ordered-pair rules (you can't safely
have namespaces http://www.example.com/foo and
http://www.example.com/foob, although you can in the ordered-pair
world).  So, if your snippet is written by an editor that wants
to use tags from two such namespaces, it can't be stored into a
DAV property.

Why is it necessary for DAV to say anything about the namespaces
used in property values, anyway? Shouldn't a server be able to
accept arbitrary XML without caring?
