Yes, this is exactly the question.

WebDAV decided to define rules which state that an element name is
concatenated to the end of a namespace name to create a full element name.
All WebDAV conformant applications (this is stated in 23.4) must treat a
combination of a namespace and an element name as a full element name which
is created by concatenation.

Since the XML namespace specification was undefined in this area, the WebDAV
specification added additional requirements, for WebDAV XML namespace
applications only, to make this well defined for DAV applications.
