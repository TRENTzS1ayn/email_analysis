The WebDAV spec, section X states:

HTTP 1.1 protocol spec (I.D. rev6, an update to RFC2068), section 3.2.1
states:

"URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some
known base URI [11], depending upon the context of their use."

A response containing an <href> element definitely has a known base URI
(the resource that the PROPFIND was issued against). Therefore, a
relative URI should be acceptable.

Caveat: well, maybe it doesn't "definitely" have a known base since that
was not specified in the WebDAV spec, but it seemed obvious to me ;-)

I'm biased of course :-), but I don't see a lot of problem with using
either the two. For a server writer, it is sometimes more difficult to
use the absolute form. This is because it can be hard to know what
absolute-URI was used to access the resource. Specifically, multiple
hostnames may be used to access the same resource (e.g. a bunch of
CNAMES or partially-qualified host names)

[ caveat: actually, this could simply be an artifact of server design,
rather than a difficulty derived from the protocol itself. ]

Absolutely. The <href> must provide a URI that can be used, and that
actually contains the properties listed in the PROPFIND result.

Let's say you asked for http://myhost:8080/mypath and the result said
http://myhost/mypath. Now you attempt to issue a PROPPATCH against the
returned URI to correct a value that you found in there. Oops! Doesn't
work.

I would think that you could return any "direct reference" in the <href>
element, where that direct reference specifies the resource on which you
reported the properties.

Yup. IMO, any direct reference should be acceptable for reporting, since
they (technically) provide access to the properties reported in the
PROPFIND.
