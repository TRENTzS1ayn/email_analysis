As part of the xDev Developer Days event (hosted by DataChannel), I will be
presenting a full day tutorial on WebDAV.  This tutorial is being held in
Silicon Valley (San Jose) on Friday, July 16, at the Hyatt Sainte Claire.

This tutorial will:
- detail the WebDAV Distributed Authoring protocol and the Advanced
Collections protocol
- give a snapshot of the current status of the Delta-V Versioning and
Configuration Management protocol
- give an overview of the DASL searching protocol
- discuss implementation strategies for using WebDAV
- illustrate points with examples of using WebDAV on XML content

Additionally, there will be keynotes addresses by Norbert Mikula, Elliot
Kimber, and Paul Prescod on XML topics before and after the WebDAV tutorial
(the DAV tutorial is one of four simultaneous tracks at the event).  In my
mind, this makes the event very high value at $249.

For further information on this event, including registration details, see:

Or, you can call 1-877-XML-3396 (toll-free).
