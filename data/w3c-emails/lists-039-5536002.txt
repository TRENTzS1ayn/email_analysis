A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV
Author(s): G. Clemm, C. Kaler
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-versioning-02.txt
Pages: 31
Date: 01-Jul-99

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource-types
that define the WebDAV Versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
WebDAV Versioning will minimize the complexity of clients so as to
facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing
the WebDAV Versioning services. WebDAV Versioning includes:
- Automatic versioning support for versioning-unaware clients,
- Linear versioning , and
Support for parallel development and configuration management.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-versioning-02.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
