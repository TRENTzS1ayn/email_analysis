The WebDAV spec explicitly addresses this point.  The reason being that you
might want to lock something before creating it so you can control all the
details of it.  otherwise there is a race condition:  you create FOO,
someone else locks FOO before you can issue the lock.

Does this make sense?

See spec section 7.4 for more details
