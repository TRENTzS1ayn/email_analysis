I have now spent over four hours trying to dive through the advanced
collection's spec. I have reached page 19, have 39 comments and numerous
editorial changes.

While this spec is enormously better than its predecessor there are still
significant problems with the draft.

The main problem is that it is really three extremely complex and very
subtle drafts in one.

As a reviewer being asked to go through what amount to three separate drafts
all rolled into one is frustrating. I also believe it is inappropriate to
ask the WG to chew on the sheer volume of material and ideas presented by
the advanced collection draft at one time.

Splitting the draft into three drafts (bind, MKREF and ordering) and then
feeding the pieces linearly to the group so we can properly chew on them it
would go a long way to ensuring that proper attention is given to the issues
presented in these drafts while requiring a reasonable expenditure of effort
on the part of the WG.
