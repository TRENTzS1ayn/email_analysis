There was a birds of a feather (BOF) meeting on Web versioning and
configuration management at the Olso IETF last week. Though Jim Amsden is
currently working on getting final minutes out to the Delta-V mailing list,
I wanted to bring up one important item that was discussed at the meeting.

Since the design team wasn't present (mostly for cost reasons -- it was
appx. US $2500 per person to attend), and because it was a non-US IETF
meeting, when Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu>, one of the two Applications
Area Directors, came to the Delta-V BOF and asked "how many people here are
willing to work on this", there was a very minimal showing of hands (3-4 out
of an attendance of 30-40).  Naturally, with very few indicating they would
actually work on the project, it led to Keith having concerns over whether
this work should take place in the IETF at all.  Keith further elaborated
his position, stating that he felt the topic has value (he has no problems
with the charter) and is of interest, but he is concerned not enough people
in the IETF were willing to work on the problem.

To be convinced that there should be an IETF working group on Web versioning
and configuration management, Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu> would like to
see some emails, sent to him *directly*, from people who:
(a) believe there should be a working group on Web versioning and
configuration management (e.g., as described in the charter
<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/deltav/charter.txt>)
(b) are willing to work on this topic by actively participating on the
mailing list and reading drafts and commenting on them on the list

Here's an example of the kind of email you could send to Keith (but don't
just copy
this one, make it your own words!)

------------

To: Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu>
Subject: DeltaV: I will work on it

Keith,

It has come to my attention that you are concerned there might not be
sufficient
interest and volunteers for the proposed Web versioning and configuration
management
working group, DeltaV.  I want to let you know that I firmly believe the
IETF
should approve the DeltaV working, and intend to actively participate in
this
group.

The Web versioning and configuration management protocol being developed by
the
Delta-V group is an important infrastructure needed to make the Web capable
of
supporting remote collaboration by distributed work groups.  This
collaboration
support would benefit open source development teams, and is expected to
benefit
development of future IETF specifications as well.

So, I'm asking you to send an email to Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu>
indicating that you think there should be a working group, and that you're
willing to work in this group. If you're in the position of thinking that a
working group is good idea in this area, but that you're not sure you can
work on the topic, that would also be good to tell Keith, though not nearly
as useful as both belief and ability to work.  If you're likely to implement
the final standard, or feel that WebDAV is an important part of your product
plans, that would also be *very* useful information to convey to Keith.

Please, please, PLEASE take 5 minutes *now* and write this note.  Don't
delay, don't put it off.  Do it NOW, while it's fresh in your mind.

If you have any further questions or concerns about this, please don't
hestitate to send me email <ejw@ics.uci.edu>, or better yet, raise your
issues on the list.

Thank you in advance for your help.

- Jim
