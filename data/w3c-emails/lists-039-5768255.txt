One of the contributors to the low show of support at the BOF was the
perception that, since we had a successful BOF in Minneapolis where there
was significant support shown, it was not necessary to repeat this in Oslo.
Since repeated emails to you from Jim Amsden and myself between Minneapolis
and Olso for feedback on our charter were never answered, we assumed you
were simply busy, and it never crossed our minds that you needed additional
evidence, in the form of a cadre of eager workers, to be convinced.

I'm a bit confused by this -- I have been laboring under the impression that
starting a working group using a reaonably-thought out draft as a starting
point is a plus, rather than a minus.  We've been aware from day one that
the mailing list is the final arbiter of consensus on any specification we
produce, and hence this design is subject to change based on discussion on
the mailing list.  There has been no conscious effort to stifle discussion.
In fact, I welcome any and all discussion on our drafts, and I also welcome
any ideas you have on how to increase discussion and feedback.

I agree that the original WebDAV group didn't have sufficient versioning
expertise to do versioning well.  However, the participants on the Delta-V
mailing list are substantially different than those who worked on the
initial WebDAV specification.  I think the Delta-V group has a good mix of
fresh participants who bring a solid versioning and CM background, as well
as people who worked on the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol, so that
some design continuity is preserved.

These should probably be re-stated on the wg-chairs list, then.  I have been
laboring under the impression that full WG meetings outside the IETF needed
to go through this approval channel, but that smaller design meetings did
not.  I'll bet I'm not the only chair who is confused about this.

But, as for wanting to do work outside the IETF in face-to-face meetings,
this doesn't surprise me.  Versioning and CM are topics where it is
extremely helpful to be able to draw trees and graphs and point to things
and say "that's what I mean".  ASCII art on a mailing list is a really
painful alternative.  Furthermore, it's hard to get meaningful work done in
just a couple of hours in an IETF meeting.  Frankly, two days of intensive
meetings just on a particular subject are more useful in getting work done
than 1 or 2 sessions at an IETF meeting.

But, I agree we need to continue to work hard at making our process as
transparent as possible.

I certainly believe this broad interest exists -- as you've seen, I have
been encouraging people on the Delta-V list to contact you and let you know
they're interested, and willing to work.
