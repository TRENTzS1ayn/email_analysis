Jim, thanks again for testing the server.  I will be making all of the
changes necessary in the next few days.

that's not how I understand it.  If you're not clear, better post a
question to the webdav list asking for clarification, as others may also be
unclear.


I talked to Jim Whitehead on this.  He told me that I must keep the xml:lang
attribute, but it is not intended to stripe the property.  In other words a
propatch of

<K:foo xml:lang=us> foobar </K:foo>

then propatch

<K:foo xml:lang=f> frenchfoobar </K:foo>

Will result in only ONE value for <K:foo>.  The second value REPLACES the
first even though it is a different lang.

I think this is different than what you are telling me.

While I am at it.  Is the server required to keep ALL attributes sent to
it???

Thanks,
Kevin
