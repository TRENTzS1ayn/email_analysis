The Xythos Storage Server is a level 2 server...

You can play with it at

http://216.102.212.251/~webdav

Lock Null Resources is not implemented yet, but will be there by the end of
the week.

If you have any problems with it, please send me an email,
Kevin

Folks,

Does anyone know how many DAV level 2 servers
are running and/or planned ?  I've started using Zope and I noticed
that it is a level 1 server.  Ultimately, I'd like to do some testing
on a level 2 server.
