Jim-

Again thank you for testing the server.  Below I have consolidated your bug
lists into one.  Please tell me if you find new bugs...

Kevin



1) The reply from server (to a PROPFIND) has neither a content-length nor
does it use chunked encoding. I believe this is a violation of HTTP/1.1
rules.

-- Fixed.  Server will now keep the connection open when asked to.

2) the server does not seem to be preserving the xml:lang attribute

--Fixed.  I went half way.  The server will only preserve xml:lag on
property names, but will preserve ALL attributes in property values.  I
think that second part should be a requirement in the spec.

3) dead properties are preserved across deletion of a resource. That is, I
PROPPATCH foo, delete it, then PUT foo again, and the property I set the
first time is still there

- create foo -proppatch foo setting a dead property P -delete foo -create
foo (for second time) -propfind foo looking for P

--I can not reproduce.  I have a feeling the delete is somehow failing.  Can
you give me the HTTP requests you are sending?  I need further info.

4) PROPPATCH changes a property even if the resource is locked. I could set
and delete properties on the other hand, I could not *delete* a property
when I did pass a token

--Fixed.

5) PUT could not create resource in a locked collection even with token

--Fixed.

6) attempt to create collection /~webdav/newcoll/ when parent was locked got
code 405 (NotAllowed). shouldn't this be 409 (conflict) instead?

--See other note I sent

7) Deleted resource /~webdav/foo.html when parent was locked (without
passing token)

--Fixed.

8) attempt to lock a non-existent resource gets NotFound

--Null resources are now an option on the server

9) The tagged-list production in an If header does not allow proppatch of a
locked resource. the untagged production works fine.

--Fixed.

10) attempt to create collection /~webdav/newcoll/ when parent was locked
got code 405, but should be 412

--Duplicate see 6 above
