Dear Keith,

I believe that the creation of a DeltaV IETF working group would be 
both the optimal way to extend WebDAV with the versioning support
needed for distributed authoring, as well as provide a mechanism
for attracting key technical expertise into the IETF (e.g. software
configuration management) that I believe will be beneficial for
other ongoing IETF efforts.

I further believe that the Minneapolis and Orlando conferences
are a more accurate reflection than Oslo of the interest of IETF
participants in versioning, and of the effectiveness of doing
the versioning work in the IETF.

Cordially,
Geoff Clemm
