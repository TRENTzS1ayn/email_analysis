If the destination of a COPY/MOVE is locked, and you submit the lock token
of the destination lock in the If header, then the intent of RFC 2518 is
that the destination resource should be locked.  This is stated in the
second paragraph of section 7.7.

Note: Although I don't think we deal directly on the topic of
locks at the destination in the Adv Coll spec, 7.7 does seem to
be in disagreement
with the MOVE semantics of the Adv. Coll. proposal. If anyone
feels strongly that section 7.7 should remain
as is, I suggest that they do a read of the Adv Coll
document and then express their opposition.  I just don't
want our Adv Coll work in this area to surprise anyone.

We also should make sure that the Adv Coll document is *clear*
on what should happen in this situation.  My opinion is that
the destination lock should go away as should the locks of
any decendent nodes in the URI tree at the destination.  I
could be persuaded otherwise for a lock on the destination
URI/resource specifically though.
