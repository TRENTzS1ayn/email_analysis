I'm not sure whether you intended this to be just specific to null-lock
"collections", or to all collections.  In general, a collection may have an
entity body returned by GET, and hence, in my view, can also accept PUT
requests.  A server is also free to not accept PUT requests.  It's not
possible to say categorically they should always accept PUT, or always
reject PUT.

I don't have a strong position one way or the other.
