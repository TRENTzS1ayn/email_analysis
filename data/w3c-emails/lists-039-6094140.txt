Coincidence for IIS5.

mod_dav uses the timestamp from the underlying file. Therefore, property
changes will not update the last-modified time.

It will be difficult for some systems to respond with timestamps for
property changes because of the underlying storage system and/or the use
of live properties. In the mod_dav case, it would be "expensive" to
check for property change times because it would need to consult a
separate data store (in addition to the filesystem). Note that live
properties can change at a whim of the server; as a result, it could
render the last-modified meaningless because it could change almost
continually (tracking the live property change).

Anyhow: my recommendation would be to not rely on property changes (in
any server) to update the last-modified timestamp.
