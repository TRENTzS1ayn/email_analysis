Thanks Greg... just two remarks..

1. this list didn't have http://216.102.212.251/~webdav included which is working cool for me.

2. Why I am getting these emails twice? Earlier I though I got this twice since its replied to two email list...but this time you just replied to w3c-dist-auth@w3.org and I got it twice..is everyone  receiving twice?

thanks, som.
