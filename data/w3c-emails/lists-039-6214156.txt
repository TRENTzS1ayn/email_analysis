Ahhh... PROPFIND.  Well, it would be a pity to reject the whole
request for the sake of flagging the loop.  Perhaps if 506 were a
multistatus sub-error code.  But perhaps that's what was being proposed
in the first place.  If so, the wording should be clarified.

In fact, in general, we probably should be clear about status
codes that are intended to reside within a MULTISTATUS response and
those that are intended to be the response error code..
(Do we even have vocabulary to distinguish?)
