I would argue that the lock-null resource IS a resource...  When overwriting
any other resource, you do not need to check the parent for its locks
through IF headers (as its name consistency will not change).  Therefore I
think you don't need to check the parent as you are overwriting a known
resource.

This is at least how Xythos handles this situation...
