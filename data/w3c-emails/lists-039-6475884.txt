...*provided* you're not using any funky live properties.  Live properties are
behavior, not state, so they have safeness and idempotency, too.  So, really,
you have to assume that both PROPFIND and PROPPATCH are unsafe and
non-idempotent unless you know the safeness and idempotency of all the
properties in use.

(This is the same issue as CGIs in base HTTP/1.1; a CGI script could be built
that reacts unsafely to GET, but it wouldn't be HTTP/1.1-compliant; it's
supposed to use POST if it's unsafe.  But we don't have PROPFIND-GET and
PROPFIND-POST.)
