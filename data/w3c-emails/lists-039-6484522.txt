I agree that section 7.7 makes it clear that if you are *inheriting* a lock
from
a collection that *contains* the destination, then that inherited lock is
valid following a COPY/MOVE.  This makes sense since the locked collection
still exists following the COPY/MOVE.  But I do not see anything in 7.7 (or
in 7.5) that
either states or implies that a lock that was on the destination itself
remains
following the COPY/MOVE.  So as currently written, I believe that the spec
supports
Kevin's interpretation.

Cheers,
Geoff
