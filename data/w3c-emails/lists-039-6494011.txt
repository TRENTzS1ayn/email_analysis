I think it's more appropriate to define 'live properties' such that
they have the same relationship to safety and idempotency of PROPFIND
and PROPPATCH as 'resources' have to GET and PUT. That is:

 even though the property is live, PROPFIND of any property
SHOULD be safe and idempotent, and PROPPATCH should be idempotent.

We should make the correspondence of PROPFIND-GET and PROPPATCH-PUT
(not POST). Not having done so is an flaw in the WebDAV spec that
SHOULD be corrected, not celebrated.
