My recollection is that this issue was discussed during one of the face to
face meetings, and the resultion was that the second lock request would just
fail.

In my view, this is an extremely uncommon scenario, and it isn't worth
adding complexity to either implementations or the standard to handle it
well.  The complexity of expanding the existing lock just doesn't seem to be
worth it.
