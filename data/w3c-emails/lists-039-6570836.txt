In the subject note, please ignore the brain-damaged comment at the end:

>> Can someone please check this for me.
>>And does anyone know where the 3400AD determination came from?
>>(It's true that the timestamp can be smaller for different Variant fields.
>>But the DCE variant field only takes away 2 bits from time-hi.)

I was confusing the DCE variant field with the DCE version field.  The
version field is always 4 bits in a DCE UUID and the timestamp is always 60
bits.  It is the clock-sequence number (a different beast altogether) that
is narrowed as the variant field changes size.
