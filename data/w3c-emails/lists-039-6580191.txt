Since some systems allow GET to perform non-safe, non-idempotent operations
via URL munging (e.g., http://www.docmgmtsys.com/doc-guid;action=CHECKOUT)
it seems to me the best a spec. can do is state what the intended behavior
is wrt safety and idempotence, and assume that people won't break it without
a very good reason.
