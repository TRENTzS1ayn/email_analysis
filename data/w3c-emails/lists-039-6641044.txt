<KW> tags.... Thanks for bringing up COPY, we should be making it a priority
as well in all of this..

I am OK with 1-3.  I might argue that locks on the destination should
remain, but I could be convinced otherwise.

A resource is being MOVEd.  The locks are Depth: infinity locks on the
collections that contain either the source or the destination location.

4. The source collection is locked, but the destination collection is not
MOVE /a/b to /x/y, where /a/ is locked, but /x/ is not and /x/y is not.
<jra>
The source lock token is required in the If header. /x/y is not locked after
the
MOVE.
</jra><KW> agree</KW>

5. The source collection is not locked, but the destination collection is.
MOVE /a/b to /x/y, where /a/ is not locked and /a/b is not locked, but /x/
is locked.
<jra>
No lock token is required. /x/y will be added to /a's write lock if it is a
depth infinity lock. Otherwise, /x/y is not locked after the MOVE operation.
</jra>
<KW> Disagree with the part about No lock token required.  Since you are
changing /x's contents, you need /x's LOCK.  /a/b is moved to /x and added
to its LOCK </KW>

6. Both are locked, but with separate locks.
MOVE /a/b to /x/y, where /a/ has lock L1 and /b/ has lock L2.
<jra>
The source lock token is required in the If header. /x/y will be added to
/a's
write lock if it is a depth infinity lock. Otherwise, /x/y is not locked
after
the MOVE operation.
</jra><KW> Same arguement as above.  2 Lock token's required, /a loses /a/b
as a resource and loses it from its lock.  /x/y now exists as a new resource
(/a/b) but is still locked by L2.</KW>

One lock is at the collection level, the other at the resource level.

7. The source resource is locked, and the destination collection is locked
with a different token
MOVE /a/b to /x/y, where /a/b has lock L1, /a/ is not locked, and /x/ has
lock L2.
<jra>
L1 is required in the If header. /x/y will be locked with lock L2 if it is a
depth infinity lock.
</jra><KW> Both locks are required in IF header for reasons above.  L1 is
removed from system (nothing left to lock?) while new /x/y is in L2 due to
infinity lock</KW>


I agree that some mention must be made of the Depth header on the collection
locks.  We need to add it and COPY to the use cases that are being argued..
