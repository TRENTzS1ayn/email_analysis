Write them up in an Internet-Draft. This draft can then be used by the
document editors when RFC 2518 goes to Draft Standard.

The intent of RFC 2518 was that PROPPATCH, like every other method that does
not create a resource, would return a 404 (Not Found) error.  The spec. does
not explicitly mention this, since we intended for all standard HTTP/1.1
error cases to be applied to WebDAV.  A PROPPATCH on a null resource is a
standard 404 (Not Found) error case, and hence we didn't think it needed
special mention.
