Jason says:
Just for the sake of consistancy,  I prefer the singleton and depth locks
to be treated the same.  Just as Kevin apparently does.

I'm not sure this treating these locks the same is consistent. They are
different locks on different resources playing different roles in the methods.
As Geoff pointed out, to have a (singleton) destination lock retained on COPY or
MOVE requires a significant number of special cases.
