As Geoff pointed out, to have a (singleton) destination lock retained on COPY or
MOVE requires a significant number of special cases.

Maybe I misinterpretted what it was that he Geoff felt was inconsistant.  He
didn't mention singleton, depth or even exclusive locks.  For this reason, the
inconsistancy that I thought he depicted applies to  singleton and depth locks
equally... and exclusive and shared... and that's what I addressed in my
response to his note.
