OK not to make this any harder than it is....  But I have an issue on the
Webdav Issues list that a move/copy should not do the DELETE by itself,
ever.  This gives the client complete control and forces them to do the
delete before placing the file there.  This way my server is not making any
judgments about the existing resource for the user.

On a side note this has already been a complaint multiple times on
Sharemation, and it has only been up for 2 days.  People think that a
move/copy should be merging files, not overriding them.  Especially since IE
is telling them its doing a merge!!!  And I quote "This folder already
contains a folder named 'pictures'.  If the files in the existing folder
have the same name as files in the folder you are moving, they will be
replaced.  Do you still want to move the folder?"

Now I am not saying we should do something because Microsoft does it, but
this is the behavior I would be expecting....

If you follow this train of thought, if I replace 1 file with another, I
would expect things like creation date to be left alone.  I would expect
that only the bytes would change.  From this I would expect that any lock I
had would still be there....

Maybe I am complicating things too much, but I just felt I should mention
it...
