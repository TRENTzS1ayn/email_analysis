I am scared that the server folk are riding rough shod over the needs of the
client folk. This has been the rule, rather than the exception, in the HTTP
world. There are huge numbers of server makers but very few client makers. 

Just take a look at www.webdav.org. There are roughly 17 servers and 5
clients and most of those clients were written by server guys who only
provide APIs rather than real apps. In practice this means that the group
often thinks it has rough consensus because all the server guys have agreed
amongst themselves that they would like to make their lives easier. So
please pay special attention to the painfully few client folk who are
actually hanging around.

As for depth infinity locks, I agree that this is hard for a server to
implement. But it is also critical for a reasonable client to operate. For
example, if I am going to go change my web site I don't know which files, in
particular, I am going to change. So I want to make sure that the whole site
is locked so I don't have to worry about anything becoming inconsistent
while I wander around the site making changes.

It is unrealistic to expect clients to send, even pipelined, series of lock
requests because the chance of getting all those locks at once is low and
having to constantly retry is unrealistic, especially because of the latency
involved.

Therefore clients MUST have depth infinity locks or WebDAV can't meet their
needs.

This having been said, I fully appreciate that depth infinity locks are hard
to implement and may be inappropriate for versioning scenarios. I wouldn't
have a problem with us saying that versioned resources won't support depth
infinity. Frankly I think it would be inappropriate (and here I disagree
w/the versioning group) for a level 2 client to work directly with versioned
resources. I expect a more realistic scenario is that versioned systems will
expose a particular view in a defined namespace and level 2 clients will
then manipulate that view. It is in that view that depth infinity locking
will be implemented.
