It is my understanding that locking a collection simply locks the namespace
of the collection.

If /a is locked by L1
and /a/b is locked by L2

Then to change /a/b I only need to give L2, since /a's namespace will not
change.

Thus if /a/b is a null-resource, and you have the lock, then you can change
it at will through a PUT.

MOVE/COPY are interesting in the fact that if the whole operation is not
automic, then the Delete will fail due to the changing namespace..

I would assume that the MOVE/COPY would work without L1 if I were a client
program.

Is this not how it is supposed to work??

Whoops, I sent this to the wrong address last night....

My comments in my previous note remind me of something else.

If I have
a lock-null resource, and if someone places a lock on the
parent collection, am I blocked from doing a BIND or MOVE on my
lock-null URI?  I believe the intent of the lock-null is to insure
that we can do operations like  PUT/MKCOL there... but I'd think
that BIND and MOVE also apply... at least in intent... but that
seems to conflict with what we've been saying about BIND/MOVE
being an operation on the state of the parent collection...
and thereby blocked if someone else locks the parent.
Any thoughts?

Yaron?  :-)
