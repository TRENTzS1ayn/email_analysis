Just thought I would report to everyone what I found today on Firewalls and
Proxies.  If anyone has any data in this area, please tell me...

Web Folders.

1)  Run with no proxies set at a non-SSL port.  - Works fine
2)  Run with a proxy server at a non-SSL port - FAILS
3)  Run with no proxies set at a SSL port - Works fine
4)  Run with a proxy server at a SSL port - Works fine

It seems that the code line which does proxies without SSL is missing the
Webdav code.

IE or Office will simply send the GET and POST with the /_vti stuff.  It
never even tries to do an options.  This all occurs when the Tools ->
Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN settings -> Use a proxy server
checkbox is clicked.

Does anyone have a workaround for this without forcing the use of SSL?  Is
this consistent with what other people are finding?

Thanks,
Kevin
