This is a good point.  I was working with Raptor v5 & v6 for HTTP proxy
services, a Squid?? (that one is a friend of mine) proxy, and the
JavaWebserver Proxy.

We were looking at the Logs of the Proxies as we went.  When the checkbox
for "use proxy" is set in IE, it simply never sends the OPTIONS request....

On that same note, if your client mistakenly sends an OPTIONS with a
HTTP/1.0 Header, most Firewalls I looked at will block it.  So be careful.
(I noticed that the GET /_vti stuff still sends HTTP/1.0 headers.  I thought
this might be the problem, but by viewing the logs it was not)  In viewing
the Sharemation logs, there are some OPTIONS requests with the 1.0 Header.
The following is out of the Raptor FAQ:

<RAPTOR>
219 Can't parse URL:  (OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0 ......
The browser requested the use of the OPTIONS methods, but OPTIONS is not
part of the HTTP/1.0 standard.  It is part of HTTP/1.1.  The browser may be
allowed to ask for it, but it should specify HTTP/1.1 in the request header.
The Raptor Firewall acts correctly in refusing to support it.
