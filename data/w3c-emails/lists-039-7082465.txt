The WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol provides basic support for 
collections, offering the ability to create and list unordered 
collections.  
This specification is one of a group of three specifications that 
supplement the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol to increase the 
power of WebDAV collections. This specification defines bindings, one 
mechanism for allowing a single resource to appear in more than one 
collection.  Bindings make this possible by creating mappings of URIs to 
resources.  The BIND method defined here gives clients the ability to 
create new bindings to existing resources.  [RR] defines redirect 
references, another approach to allowing a single resource to be 
accessed from multiple collections.  [OC] provides ordered collections.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-binding-protocol-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
