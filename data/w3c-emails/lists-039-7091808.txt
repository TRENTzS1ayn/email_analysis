Title: WebDAV Ordered Collections Protocol

The WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol provides basic support for 
collections, offering the ability to create and list unordered 
collections. 
This specification is one of a group of three specifications that 
supplement the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol to increase the 
power of WebDAV collections. This specification defines a protocol 
supporting server-side ordering of collection members.  The companion 
specifications [B] and [RR] define two mechanisms for allowing a single 
resource to appear in more than one collection.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
