Title: WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources

The WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol provides basic support for 
collections, offering the ability to create and list unordered 
collections.
This specification is one of a group of three specifications that 
supplement the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol to increase the 
power of WebDAV collections. This specification defines redirect 
reference resources, one mechanism for allowing a single resource to 
appear in more than one collection.  A redirect reference resource is a 
resource in one collection that responds to most requests by redirecting 
the request (using an HTTP 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily response) to a 
different resource, possibly in a different collection.  [B] defines 
bindings, another approach to allowing a single resource to be accessed 
from multiple collections.  [OC] provides ordered collections.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
