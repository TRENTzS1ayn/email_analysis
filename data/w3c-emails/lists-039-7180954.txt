Take a look at DAV4J on http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com. It presents a client API
for accessing WebDAV resources that would make building clients much easier.

Wouldn't it make more sense if WebDAV functionality would be implemented
in the underlying OS as then every application automatically would
have access to it.
But I see that maybe more advanced features like properties etc. one would
not be able to handle that way (if it's only some sort of filesystem
structure).

I once also asked on the Linux Kernel Mailing list and it looks as if
also there nobody is working on it.. There have been some interesting
ideas floating around though like implementing filesystems in Perl
which might make the implementation of a DAV prototype quite easy.
(But as I am mostly into Python and my time is quite limited I cannot
do that. But maybe one day I will port it to Python and write the
DAV FS with this.. But we will see :)

At least it would make sense to have a look at it and tell them where
some hooks should be added to do it later, etc. Usually they're quite
open (as far as I experienced..)
