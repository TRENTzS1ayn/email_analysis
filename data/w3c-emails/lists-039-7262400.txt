Yes, but the point is that any acceptably strong authentication system is
going to involve credentials that can't be reused.  (E.g., if I'm running
through a proxy, then the proxy can steal my credentials if I use Basic
authentication, but not if I use Digest.) This is more or less OK if only
your browser has the credentials; but, if you want to do a filesystem, it's
going to need access to all the credentials of all the users who want to use
it.  (For example, with Samba, if I want a filesystem to be mounted at
startup, I have to put the password into the appropriate /etc/rc.d script.)
