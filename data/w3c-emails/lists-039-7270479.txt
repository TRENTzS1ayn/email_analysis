Yaron: HTTP was crystal clear that DELETE deletes resources.  If you want to
just remove a name and not a resource then introduce a new method with that
functionality.

There has been a lotof discussion of this issue on the mailing list in the

be removing the binding identified by the request-URI are in these messages:
