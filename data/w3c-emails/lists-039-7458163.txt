I like this idea; I just have a syntactic quibble:

It might be better if, rather than using "*", you defined an <all/> element meaning
the same thing.  For now, "*" is simple enough; but, if we add more wildcards
eventually, then it gets messier; we'd have to add more possible values, which
starts getting into defining a separate syntax, with a separate parser.  Simpler to
use XML tags and let the existing parser handle it.
