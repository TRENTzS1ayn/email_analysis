Copying a resource into a destination collection that is locked requires the
principal to own the lock, and provide its lock token in an If header. The
resouce inherites the lock of its new parent collection, the lock is not removed
from the parent. However, if the resource was locked, then the lock is not
copied. The lock state of the new destination resource is determined by its new
parent collection, not any lock the source resource might have had.

Phew!!! I couldn't believe what I was reading regarding write locks. What
use is a write lock that only sometimes is a write lock? Yikes. I'm glad
that is dead.

However there is still a point in the original post that concerns me. Let's
see if I understand the proposal:

When copying a resource into a tree that is currently locked then the lock
on that tree is lost?

Is that the proposal for how to handle locks at the destination of a copied
resource? That is my reading of the paragraph Judy provided.
