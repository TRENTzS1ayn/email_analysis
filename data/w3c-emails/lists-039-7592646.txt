The intention is that if a resource is copied or moved into a tree that is
locked, the lock on the tree remains in force.

We didn't discuss the case where you are doing a MOVE, and the resource
being moved is locked, and it is being moved into a collection that is
locked.  The lock on the collection will certainly stay in force, but we
need to decide whether the lock on the resource being MOVEd will be lost or
whether the MOVE will fail.  I guess my own opinion is that the MOVE should
fail, since that maintains a consistent position that the state of a MOVEd
resource should be unaffected by the move; if its lock state would have to
be changed, the move should fail.
