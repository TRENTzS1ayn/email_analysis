The WebDAV spec says that locks are lost on MOVE. So if the source resource is
locked, then the MOVE request must include the lock token, and the lock must be
owned by the requesting principal. Otherwise the delete portion of the move will
fail. Since MOVE is a best effort method, the copy to the destination will work,
even if the source can't be deleted. As is the case with COPY, the lock on the
destination resource is determined by its new parent collection, not by any lock
state it may have had. This could be taken to mean that the new resource is not
the same resource moved to a new location, but a different resource.

Subject:  RE: Bindings, Locks, and MOVE




The intention is that if a resource is copied or moved into a tree that is
locked, the lock on the tree remains in force.

We didn't discuss the case where you are doing a MOVE, and the resource
being moved is locked, and it is being moved into a collection that is
locked.  The lock on the collection will certainly stay in force, but we
need to decide whether the lock on the resource being MOVEd will be lost or
whether the MOVE will fail.  I guess my own opinion is that the MOVE should
fail, since that maintains a consistent position that the state of a MOVEd
resource should be unaffected by the move; if its lock state would have to
be changed, the move should fail.
