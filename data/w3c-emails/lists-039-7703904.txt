The reason that locks are lost on MOVEs is that the overwhelming majority of
existing systems can not handle moving locks on MOVEs. We could, of course,
have said locks SHOULD NOT be lost on moves. But this sort of language is
exactly the type of language the destroys interoperability. When I write a
client I am going to write it to either demand that locks move properly on
moves in the average case (with exceptions handled as force 10 failures) or
I'm going to write it to assume that locks never work on MOVE and set up my
UI and APIs appropriately.
 their UI and internal code in order to compensate. 

We will be consistent.

We will be uniform.

We will use "MUST."

If you want to change the language to say that locks MUST move then we can
discuss this, although I think preventing the majority of existing systems
in the world from supporting WebDAV is probably a bad idea. If you want to
use the Mandatory mechanism, I think that would be a great idea. But the
requirement absolutely will not be a SHOULD.

P.S. Phew... I haven't had a good rant in a while. Feels good. =)
