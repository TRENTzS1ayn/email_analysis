As the WG for WebDAV is going to be closed soon, will this list still exist to
discuss the Delta-V work and other extensions of DAV?  While I am only a
lurker right now, I do have an interest in WebDAV, Delta-V work and other
extensions of WebDAV.  I hope to soon be implementing a package based on
WebDAV and am very interested in following the protocol as it moves closer to
a standard.
If not, are there any plans to create a new mailing list for Delta-V and the
other extensions of WebDAV?
