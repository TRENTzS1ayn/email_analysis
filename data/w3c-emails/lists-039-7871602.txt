I do think the work on Advanced Collections benefits from the support of a
working group, and would like to see the WebDAV working group continue until
the 3 advanced collections specs are through IETF-wide last call.

I also think deadlines are good, that limiting the life of working groups is
a good thing, and that we should try to wrap up the advanced collections
work as soon as possible.
