RFC-2518 seems to be silent on when PROPPATCH returns 207
Multistatus.  Other methods specify (e.g., DELETE says 207 is for
when a failure occurs with a resource other than the one
identified by the Request-URI), but PROPPACH is silent.  Of
course, it has to return 207 if it's applying to multiple
resources (or multiple properties on a single resource); but what
about if it's modifying a single property on a single resource?
