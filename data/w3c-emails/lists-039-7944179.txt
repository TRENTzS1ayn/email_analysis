   That the spec needs to address the issue of cross-server anything indicates
   that the specification is fundamentally broken and needs to be re-written.

Or it means that the section that talks about the cross-server as
a special case is irrelevant and should be deleted.

   The spec should not need to address these issues at all. Rather it should
   provide a well defined start and end state. It is up to the server to figure
   out what that means in application.

Yes, I heartily agree!  That reference to cross server moves in the spec
always bothered me, but it took this note from Yaron to clarify why it
was so bothersome.

 I suspect y'all have taken a serious wrong term somewhere.

Actually "a wrong term" in this context is quite a good pun,
albeit somewhat recursive and probably unintentional (;-).

I believe that it is sufficient to just delete the sentence that talks
about cross server moves.  If a server can implement it, then fine.
If it can't, it needs nothing in the protocol to indicate that it can
fail the request -- it simply must do so.

So please ignore all my burbling about SHOULD's and MAY's in this
regard (which I've quoted below as a form of self flagellation).
Also, I fully agree with Yaron's point in a different thread that a
MOVE is not a COPY followed by a DELETE (and yes, Yaron, I admit it, I
was laughing while reading that thread :-).  My point below was
intended to be that a COPY followed by a DELETE is *not* a MOVE, it is
a COPY followed by a DELETE.

Cheers,
Geoff
