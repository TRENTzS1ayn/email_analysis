Disturbing thought from the peanut gallery: cross-host MOVE (i.e., between two
URLs with different hostnames) is not necessarily cross-server, because they
could be hosted on the same machine.  So, sometimes, something that looks like
a cross-server MOVE may work.  But usually it won't.  And, in some cases, a
user may find it works for a while and then stops, when his admin splits the
server up.  Or vice versa.  Fun, no? :-)
