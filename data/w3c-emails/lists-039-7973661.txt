Conversely, something that looks like a same-server MOVE may work (if it
works at all) in a way that is functionally indistinguishable from a
cross-server MOVE.  This can happen if the move is across internal
boundaries that require a copy, such as across file system boundaries,
or from a database to a file system.  No public protocol is needed to
support this internal move, however.
