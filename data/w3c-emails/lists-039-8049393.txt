To guarantee that a MOVE will work using a GET/PROPFIND/PUT/PROPPATCH/DELETE
or any other sequence of client commands would be to rob servers of their
ability to add value, which is clearly a step too far. This is especially
the case in circumstances where the resource in question is not a file in
disguise but a generic program.

That having been said, in many cases the previous sequence would work just
fine. Unfortunately it is also slow as all hell but in some cases there is
nothing better available.
