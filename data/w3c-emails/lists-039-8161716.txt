It can't. MKCOL is defined as creating the collection specified by the
Request-URI. If your server doesn't do that, it it isn't MKCOL :-)

Is it possible for you to create (internally) the server-specified
collection and then somehow link/alias the Request-URI to point to the
new collection?

If you have a custom client, then you can define a method such as
"STARBASE-MKCOL" which is modelled after MKCOL, but returns a Location
header with the true URI. Another alternative is to return the
"next-collection-name" as a property of the parent collection; this has
transactional problems, though (e.g. what happens if two clients request
the property and then use it in MKCOL?)

Cheers,
