I agree with you that this is a problem for all document management systems.
I believe it is the most fundamental mismatch between the WebDAV operational
model and the way document management systems work.  It affects not only
MKCOL, but all methods that result in the creation of new resources (COPY,
MKREF, PUT, MKRESOURCE).

It's also wound up with the requirement that WebDAV resource names reflect
the collection hierarchy, which the server-generated names in document
management systems generally do not do.

Document Management Systems will probably be forced to do aliasing between
client names and server names, no matter how costly and annoying that turns
out to be.
