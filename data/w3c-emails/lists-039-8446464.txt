This is incompatible with a recommendation in RFC-2616 (section 10.3.3, second
paragraph):

     Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD
     contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

Do we want to override this? It's to provide pseudo-compatibility with old or
broken browsers that don't understand 302.

(Personally, I suspect we don't need to provide the resource type information
on every request.  It's available via PROPFIND with Passthrough: T; clients
that need to know can find out.)
