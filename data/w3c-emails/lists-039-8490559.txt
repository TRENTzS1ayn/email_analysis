We've barely discussed dynamic resources in general.  They need just as much
clarification and cleanup as locks do/did, but we're not going to be able to
cover them before the end of the month and I believe that's the deadline we
face for the webdav base spec.

I think until we do get that defined, server implementers are just going to
have to experiment with their own ideas about dynamic (content) resources.

As for COPY/MOVE'ing them.  For now we'll just have to leave implementors with
the guidelines that
we have now.  If they don't  think they can support them (or anything else),
then they need to reject
requests that require they support them.    They are going to need to make some
judgement calls here.

When we come back to dynamic resources, we can be more specific about what
is expected.
