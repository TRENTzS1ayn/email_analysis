Actually, it's more than that.  You're (apparently) presuming that the servers
can come up with some way of making DELETE on the resource trigger a DELETE on
the binding.  But suppose the resource is just a file, and it gets deleted from
outside the server? I am not aware of any OS where you can get notification
when a file is deleted.  In the single-server case, this is not a problem,
because the server can check to make sure the resource still exists before
doing anything to indicate that the binding exists.  In the cross-server
case...well, you could still do it, but it'd make things like PROPFIND
expensive (if a collection contains 15 cross-server bindings, you've got to do
15 HTTP requests to make sure they're all still there).
