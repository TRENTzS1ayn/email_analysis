Why exactly is this a problem? Me, I'd consider it a feature; if I write code
that's sensitive to the Request-URI, it's probably for a good reason.  I may
want to be able to write a script once and place bindings to it in different
places that behave differently according to their location.  In fact, I *have*
written such a script.  On my personal site, I don't have access to the logs,
so I've placed index.cgi scripts in various directories that I want to monitor;
they log the hit and return a 302 to redirect to Index.html.  Since I didn't
want to maintain N copies of the script, most of them are symlinks.  Since the
302 requires an absolute URI, the script looks at the Request-URI to figure out
where to redirect to.
