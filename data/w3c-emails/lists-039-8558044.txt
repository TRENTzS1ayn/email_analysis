Jim Amsden suggested in his review comments that we define a guid property
that could be used to determine whether 2 bindings are bindings to the same
resource.

The advanced collections authors like this idea and propose to define such a
property.

We could do something similar to what RFC 2518 does for lock tokens --
require that the value of the guid be globally unique, and provide a sample
algorithm that implementers can use to generate values, but not require the
use of any particular algorithm.
