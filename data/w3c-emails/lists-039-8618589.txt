To give that dead horse one more kick (:-), I agree with John and Jason
that there is little useful we can say about the semantics of dynamic
resources.  The best we can do is give them some standard properties
like "source".

   It doesn't take much discussion to realize that copying a dynamic resource is not
   something that can ever be expressed in a standard protocol; they're far too
   implementation-dependent.
