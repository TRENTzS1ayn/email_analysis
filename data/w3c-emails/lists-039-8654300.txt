This exact same question, regarding moves and locks, came up in the past and
the group consensus was that we should not allow locks to MOVE with
resources. To revoke this decision is to pull the rug out of implementers
who took WebDAV in good faith. This is exactly the sort of behavior which
makes some many companies wary of dealing with the IETF. The rules change
too often.

There is an alternative route which I believe meets everyone's needs. We
define a new header, which can optionally be used with mandatory, that
specifies that the move is only to succeed if the lock (if any) is moved
with it. If the header is absent the server MUST NOT move the lock. The
benefit of this system is that existing clients will continue to properly
interoperate with both existing WebDAV servers and future WebDAV servers. In
addition existing WebDAV servers will be able to properly interoperate with
both existing WebDAV clients and future WebDAV clients.
