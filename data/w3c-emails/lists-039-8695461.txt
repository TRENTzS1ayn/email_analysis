I also prefer the explanatory XML body approach.

   Adding yet another error code for this is probably a waste. I think 501 is
   the right code but you should add an XML body with an element indicating
   what went wrong. You could use a header but the error status is something
   (as you are now finding) that people will want to be able to expand in the
   future. XML is expandable, headers are not.
