Geoff,

I think Yaron's point is that he believes / should be able to refer to any
resource.  Right now it's stuck with whatever it started with.  Or at least it
appears that it stuck.

I think his words were a bit harsh and that we can address his concerns.  It
just needs more thought.  Unless someone has a quick answer, I think this should
go on our issue list.

Judy... you've got the issue list, right? :-)
