   Add "DAV:merge" as a new potential value of the Overwrite header
   when used with the COPY request.

   The semantics COPY with Overwrite=DAV:merge is to "merge" the source
   resource into the destination resource.  In case of non-collection
   resources, this is just the equivalent of a PUT and a PROPPATCH into
   the Destination.  In case of collection resources, it means
   recursively PUT/PROPPATCH from the members of the source collection
   into the corresponding member of the destination collection.

NC->NC is a combined PUT/PROPPATCH.  All bindings to the destination
continue to be valid.

C->NC replaces NC with a copy of C.  Any bindings to NC are now bindings
to the copy of C.  If the server cannot do this rebinding, it must fail
the COPY request.

NC->C replaces C with a copy of NC.  Any bindings to C are now bindings
to the copy of NC.  If the server cannot do this rebinding, it must fail
the COPY request.

C->C Recursively perform the merge MOVE from every member of the source
collection to the corresponding member of the destination collection.
