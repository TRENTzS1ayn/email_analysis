  NC->NC is a combined PUT/PROPPATCH.  All bindings to the destination
  continue to be valid.

  C->NC replaces NC with a copy of C.  Any bindings to NC are now bindings
  to the copy of C.  If the server cannot do this rebinding, it must fail
  the COPY request.

  NC->C replaces C with a copy of NC.  Any bindings to C are now bindings
  to the copy of NC.  If the server cannot do this rebinding, it must fail
  the COPY request.

   C->C Recursively perform the merge MOVE from every member of the source
   collection to the corresponding member of the destination collection.

Note: there might be a client-side need for a version of this that isn't
destructive.  For example, what you recommend for NC->C can end up knocking
a lot of resources out of the URI space.  If the client is a human, she
may not have realized that she was doing that... and may in fact not realize
this until later.
