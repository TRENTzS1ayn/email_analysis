This is quite cool, and mod_dav could easily support something like
this.

Just a few comments:

* rather than specifying the uri as an XML attribute, shouldn't it be
part of the elem contents? [I think I saw an argument somehwere (by
Yaron?) that stated is was "best form" to avoid attributes that are
specifiers, rather than modifiers]

* do you want to explicitly state that <DAV:namespaces> can only appear
as a child of <DAV:allprop> and <DAV:propname> ?

* your sample request in 5.2 has the propname/propfind end-elements
swapped.

Cheers,
