Mmm...yes, OK, that makes sense.  Do you think <DAV:namespace> should contain the URI directly, or
contain <DAV:href>? The former reduces bandwidth & complexity by a tiny amount; the latter leverages the
existing definitions better.

Yes, that makes sense.  Here's my new text:

     Purpose: The namespaces XML element introduces a set of namespace elements (below).
     <namespaces> appears inside <allprop> or <propname>, and specifies that the PROPFIND request
     applies only to properties belonging to the namespaces listed in the enclosed namespace
     elements.

Whoops, so it does.  Fixed.
