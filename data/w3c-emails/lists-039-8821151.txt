One of the comments on the Adv. Collection protocol was that 
sections 5.3 and 5.4 were confusing.  I suggest we replace those
two sections with the following text:

----------------------------------------------------


5.3 URI Mappings Created by a BIND

Suppose a BIND request causes a binding from "Binding-Name" to
resource R to be added to a collection, C.  Then if C-MAP is the set
of URL's that were mapped to C before the BIND request, then for all
members, "C-URL" of C-MAP, the URL "C-URL/Binding-Name" is mapped to
resource R following the BIND request.

Note that if a binding is made to the collection itself (or to a
parent of the collection), an infinite number of mappings is
introduced.

5.4 Example: URI Mappings Created by a BIND

For example, if a binding from "index.html" to R is added to the
collection C, and if the following URL's are mapped to C:
   http://www.fuzz.com/A/1
   http://fuzz.com/A/one
then the following new mappings to R are introduced:
   http://www.fuzz.com/A/1/index.html
   http://fuzz.com/A/one/index.html

If a binding from "myself" to C is then added to C,
the following infinite number of additional mappings to C are introduced:
   http://www.fuzz.com/A/1/myself
   http://www.fuzz.com/A/1/myself/myself
   ...
and the following infinite number of additional mappings to R are introduced:
   http://www.fuzz.com/A/1/myself/index.html
   http://www.fuzz.com/A/1/myself/myself/index.html
   ...

Geoff
