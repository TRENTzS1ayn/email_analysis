<dig, dig>...the DAV spec says "URI".

This was the way I was leaning, too.  The main question that made me wonder was, suppose someone wants to
define a type of namespace that's defined by something other than a URI? (In such a case, it might be best to
be able to swap out the <href> element for something else.) However, I think the answer is that they should
just define a new URI scheme.
