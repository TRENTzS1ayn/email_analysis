This is a great improvement, I think.  More below.

If R is a collection, additional URI mappings are created to the descendents
of R.  For each new URI mapping to R, there is a new URI mapping to each of
its descendents.

I get this now that I've looked at the examples, but it might be clearer if
stated a little more formally, as you did in the first paragraph.  "If R is
identical to C or to a parent of C, an infinite number of URI mappings is
introduced."
