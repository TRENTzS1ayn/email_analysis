Yes, but we are talking about extending HTTP (in a backward compatible way).
So just because HTTP-1.1 clients do not have any way of identifying a
resource other than its URL, does not imply that the same is true
for clients and servers that understand an extension of HTTP-1.1.

In particular, the advanced collection protocol proposes a GUID property,
as does the versioning protocol.
