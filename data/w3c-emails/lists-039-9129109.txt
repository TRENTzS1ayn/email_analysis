Sounds like a great idea. Definitely needed. However, you're talking about a
significant cost in resource time and money. This is typically done by a product
marketing organization. I suspect the players building significant WebDAV client
applications and/or servers will have to step up to this task in order to sell
their products. However, this does not foster the WebDAV community as a whole,
or create interest in the standard before products are available.  Perhaps
webdav.org can minimally play this role while products are being introduced and
then individual marketing organizations can create the WebDAV drag needed to
foster a larger community. This a compromise, but its also relatively easy to
achieve.
