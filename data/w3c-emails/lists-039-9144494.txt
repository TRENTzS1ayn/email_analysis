Very nice summary Jim.  I agree with each point.  Just one comment on
point #1:

The mapping from "/" to a resource is not a binding, because there is
no collection in which the binding can live.  So the mapping from "/" to
a collection is done through some other (server defined) means.  We could
define some way of re-mapping "/" to some other currently namable resource,
but in general (and certainly to get started) you need some server defined
way of mapping "/" to a resource, so I don't think it would be worth
special casing the re-mapping of "/" to some current descendent of "/".

Also of course, this only applies to resources that support the WebDAV
protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff
