DELETE nukes the resource. If the resource gets nuked so does its bindings
since they are associated with the resource. Hence DELETE is DESTROY.

This could be interpreted as the HTTP/1.1 definition, but it is not useful in
situations where multiple bindings and versions are available. We would like
DELETE to mean subsequent requests on that URL return 404 Not Found. UNBIND has
these semantics and supports multiple bindings and multiple versions. Geoff says
that this definition is not inconsistent with the intent of HTTP/1.1 according
to Roy Fielding.
