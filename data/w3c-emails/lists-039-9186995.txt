Another important purpose of a bake-off, whether held in a single
location or done over a wide area, is to get demonstrable buy-in from
the purveyors of clients and servers.  In the context of a mailing
list, it's just too easy for someone to Keep-Their-Mouth-Shut when
problems with a particular implementation are mentioned.  If that
happens in the context of a bake-off, the silence or non-participation
can in and of itself be interpreted as a statement of intent.  It's
both a cultural and a process difference.

This is not a hypothetical problem for WebDAV.
