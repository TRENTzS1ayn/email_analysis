Another point of view is that DELETE
on a URL ensures that the next GET on that URL returns the appropriate
error status.  Furthermore, unless you want downlevel clients to trash
the history of a versioned resource, DELETE *must* have UNBIND semantics
rather than DESTROY semantics.

I don't see how this follows.
Embedded HREF's in xml documents are also associated
with the resource they reference, but they are unaffected by any
operation on the resource.

In the past, I've only heard this said for Windows95.  I have not been
able to find anything in Windows95 resembling WebDAV locking behavior.
Is this some internal implementation thing not exposed to end users?
Or is this a reference to how it was implemented in Office-2000?  In either
case, although it should influence locking semantics, I don't think we should
let it determine locking semantics, if it results in a complex or confusing
protocol.  For example, with multiple bindings to a resource (say
/a/x.html and /b/y.html), if you issue a LOCK on /a/x.html, can you move
/b/y.html?

Cheers,
