You don't even need to appeal to versioning for this one.  Suppose I use two DAV
clients, an editor with some minimal file-management features and a file manager
with full AdvCol support.  In the file manager, I do some BINDs to make one of
my documents appear in multiple places.  Then, while I'm editing, I decide I no
longer want it one of those places.  I'm in the editor, so I use its DELETE
command...and discover I've lost my document, no just the one binding I wanted
to remove.
