    4. LOCK locks the resource, not the bindings. If the namespace needs to be
    controlled, then the user should lock the applicable parent collections.

    I agree that that's what seems to be suggested.  I just want to add, "ouch!
    That's a painful way to protect a URI.".

  Then what are collections for if not to manage and control the namespace? What
  else could locking a collection mean? Note that it does not have to be a deep
  lock.
  </jra>

<jlc/> I agree that collections are to manage and control namespace.  My
editorial comment was that locking a whole collection to protect a single
binding seems like a lot of overkill.  And if you want to protect a URI
mapping... you'd have to lock the collection chain up to the root.  Even more
overkill.
