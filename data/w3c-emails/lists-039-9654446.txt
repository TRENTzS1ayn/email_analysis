Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  I've sent in a request to have
Tim's email address added to the accept2 list, so hopefully this won't
happen again.

One rule in the DTD states:
    <!ELEMENT propstat (prop, status, responsedescription?) >

I suggest that this is modified to read
    <!ELEMENT propstat (status, responsedescription?, prop) >

so that streaming clients can retrieve the status of a property before they
retireve the property itself , and thereby know whether the data is valid or
not.  In the current rule, such a client is required to read the prop data
in its entirety, possibly to discover that the data is invalid only after
the fact.

Comments?
 -------------

Trivia:
In RFC2518 Feb 1999
8.2.2 Example - PROPPATCH

(1) The property is set as <Z:authors> but the response stat is given as
<Z:Authors>.  Note the case switch.
(2) The responsedescription states 'Copyright Owner can not..' the property
was 'Copyright-Owner'.  Either the response description is a canned
response, in which case the hyphen is missing, or the server is doing
something I don't understand!
