DAV4J is still only available through alphaWorks with the typical alphaWorks
license. We are exploring the possibility of open sourcing DAV4J in order to
facilitate the construction of WebDAV client applications, and WebDAV enabling
existing repository managers. We'll keep you informed on this mailing list.

Subject:  Is it possible to license the Dav4J client?



Is IBM's DavJ4 client still available only through a 90 day license, or does
anyone know if it can or will be available for use in production systems?

Thanks for you help!
