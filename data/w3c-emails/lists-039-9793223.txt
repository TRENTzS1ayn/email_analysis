I'd suggest we just make it clear that these
optimizations are not allowed.  They save some
bandwidth over the wire, but would complicate both server and client
implementations.

   According to the WebDAV DTD, prop and status are required, and a multistatus
   must have at least one response. The optimizations you describe look good, but
   the really complicate client implementations.

   Say we invoke PROPATCH so that it sets property1 and property2 on resourceX.

   if both of these return an error, I believe we are allowed to return...

   ...
   <HREF>resourceX</HREF>
   <PROPSTAT>
      <PROP>
 <property1/><property2/>
      </PROP>
      <STATUS>HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict</STATUS>
   </PROPSTAT>
   ...

   but are we allowed to skip the PROP tag if all of the element have the same
   result?...

   ...
   <HREF>resourceX</HREF>
   <PROPSTAT>
      <STATUS>HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict</STATUS>
   </PROPSTAT>
   ...

   And are we allowed to skip the PROPSTAT altogether and just return a status for
   the URI?...

   ...
   <HREF>resourceX</HREF>
   <STATUS>HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict</STATUS>
   ...


   Or even return it in the response header?



   Does this change if the response code is "200 OK" rather than 4XX?


   If the spec doesn't already do so, it should provide a guideline here so that
   clients know all the possibilities to expect and can code for them.
