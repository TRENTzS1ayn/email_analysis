Note: This would be a client's responsibility and the client might already
require that it first determine if there are any errors before it actually
processes them individually.  In that case, the minimization code would need
to be there anyway.  DAV4J already has this in the client code... but it's
nice to define what minimizations are allowed to deal with the code that
iterates through the errors... which might be expressed in various ways...
and perhaps some that the coder hasn't thought of... unless we limit the
possibilities.

That's 2 - 0 against minimization so far.  It sounds like both votes
are against any minimizations.

Anyone else?
