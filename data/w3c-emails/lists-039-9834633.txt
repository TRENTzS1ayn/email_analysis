I thought we weren't talking about a mandatory conversion.  I can see
how doing that could be tricky for some server set-ups.  However, I
don't think this specific case would be much trouble for client
implementors.  (It doesn't really simplify anything either, since the
client has to be prepared for the non-simplified case anyhow.)
