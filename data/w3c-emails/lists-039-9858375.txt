Is there any support within the group for this change to the DTD?

Without it I fail to see how clients can receive large properties without 
inhaling the entire contents.

One rule in the DTD states:
    <!ELEMENT propstat (prop, status, responsedescription?) >

I suggest that this is modified to read
    <!ELEMENT propstat (status, responsedescription?, prop) >

so that streaming clients can retrieve the status of a property before they
retireve the property itself , and thereby know whether the data is valid or
not.  In the current rule, such a client is required to read the prop data
in its entirety, possibly to discover that the data is invalid only after
the fact.

Comments?
