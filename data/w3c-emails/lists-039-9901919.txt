Um, wait a minute, this still doesn't make sense.  If a server uses your
recommended oredering for the propstat XML element and sends the status
first, then starts streaming data out of its property store, and then
detects an error ... there's no way to put that error into the response,
since you've already sent the status, right?  Assuming the server isn't
streaming the data out doesn't work either -- if the server reads the entire
property out before marshalling the response, then it can detect ahead of
time that there was an error, and just not send any information at all for
the property, thereby avoiding the case that motivates the ordering change
in propstat.
