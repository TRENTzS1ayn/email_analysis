I've noted it in the lock issues list and I suspect Jim already has it in the
2518 issue list, but in the definition section it says that lock-null resources
are not listed as children of their parent... and (by omiision) cannot accept
UNLOCK and PROPFIND methods.  Later in the document it says the opposite.   I
believe the later information is correct.

Based on that assumption and a "problem" I encountered with LOCK support in the
Linux version of mod_dav, I'd like to propose   "lock-null" as a potential value
for the resourcetype property.  This will give clients a predictable value there
for lock-null resources.

What is the "problem" in linux mod_dav?  Well it claims that the lock-null
resource is a collection.  That's not technically incorrect.  So I'd like to
insure that we specify exactly what is returned for the sake of clients.  And it
seems like a new value would be appropriate.
