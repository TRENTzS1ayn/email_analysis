Could someone *pleeeassse* tell me what problem "lock null" resources
are supposed to solve?  I found a message from Yaron dated 3/22/98 where
they appear to be introduced by an analogy with the need for "zero"
when you are counting.  I am not convinced (:-).

If you want to "lock" a place where there is no resource, create some
dummy resource there and lock that.

Currently we're stuck with several paragraphs of verbiage telling us
how a lock null resource behaves exactly like a regular resource except
that it returns a "404" when you try to get its body.  Is that feature
so important that it warrants the incremental complexity and confusion
that it adds to the spec?

I propose that we strike all references to "lock null" resources in
2518.

Note: Unlike my previous more radical non-proposal (which by the way is
still what I wish we would do :-), this is a serious proposal.

Cheers,
Geoff
