Although I do not agree with atomic delete, I do need to point out
something here (to be fair). You have introduced an extra requirement --
simultaneous access through different protocols. From a WebDAV standpoint,
NTFS and FAT can implement an atomic delete. If you partially delete a
tree, there is nothing requiring you to move it back: from the client's
standpoint, you *have* deleted the resources.
