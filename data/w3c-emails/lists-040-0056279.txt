Thanks for the explanation.  By "state" I just meant "the set of
bindings", but I see how a non-clairvoyant reader would not know
this.  Just to confirm that I understood your point, would this
rewording be acceptable:

"A successful DELETE removes the specified binding from the specified
 collection, but (whether it succeeds or fails) MUST NOT remove any
 other other bindings from the specified collection or any other collection."

Cheers,
Geoff

   A protocol requires that the externally visible behavior of the
   component match that expected by the protocol.  The way you phrased
   it was specifying the state within the collection component rather
   than what was visible to other components.  Consider, for example,
   that a hierarchical database implementation of collections might
   have dual-linked relations between sister collections, and thus
   deletion of one collection would have to effect another collection.

   The point being that we don't have to require anything beyond what
   the protocol means -- specifying anything beyond that is just overkill
   and tends to limit implementations unnecessarily.
