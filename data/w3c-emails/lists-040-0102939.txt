The crux of the problem is that NFS, amongst others, does not necessarily
refer to files using their path location. They often refer to files using
File IDs which are completely independent of location. This means that the
attempt to move the files from one part of the namespace to another in
order to hide them won't work with NFS. NFS and similar systems will
continue to be able to operate on the files, regardless of where they are
moved to.

This means that even if the move on the sub-directory succeeds it is
possible for a NFS client to come in and open (without the filesharedelete
flag) or change the ACL on a file and hence prevent us from deleting the
file. Even if we attempt to change the ACL on a file to prevent others from
accessing the file another user with a File ID and a higher access can
always override us.

Super.  That's how NFS and a few of the file systems over which it often
gets implemented are supposed to work.    Once those files are opened, they
can be deleted from the name space and still accessed via their file
handle.   It's good to hear that that little subtlty would continue to
work.
