Does the WG still want to be seeing these reports?

Further testing against www.driveway.com: 

MKCOL fails with 500 internal server error, e.g.:

MKCOL /user.jorton/bar/ HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: cadaver/0.10.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
Host: www.driveway.com
Authorization: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

COPY returns 204, but doesn't actually copy anything: e.g.

COPY /user.jorton/foo.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: cadaver/0.10.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
Host: www.driveway.com
Destination: http://www.driveway.com/user.jorton/bar.htm
Overwrite: F
Authorization: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

A GET or PROPFIND against a collection which doesn't exist returns 422,
should be 404.

Regards,

joe
