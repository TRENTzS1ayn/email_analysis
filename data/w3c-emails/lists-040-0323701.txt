If anyone finds the inclusion of 423 and 507 helpful, I'd just as leave keep
them.  Greg has indicated that he does think it's useful to mention existing
response codes that might be expected and the circumstances that might cause
them to be returned.

I know there was no discussion of this issue among the authors of the
Redirect References spec.  The definition of MKRESOURCE also appears in the
DeltaV spec, for which it was originally drafted.  Geoff, was there any
discussion of SHOULD NOT vs. MUST NOT in the DeltaV working group?  Unless
there was some good reason for making the weaker statement, we should
probably change it to MUST NOT in both specs.
