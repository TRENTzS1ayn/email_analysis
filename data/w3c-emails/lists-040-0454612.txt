If a resource is locked with a exclusive lock, and another user tries to
lock if. The response then is 423 Locked. But, is there any way for the
client to know who owns the lock?
I would like the response to look something like this :
421 Locked
Date: ...
Server: ...
Connection: ...
LockOwner : user
LockDate  : date
LockType  : exclusive
LockedUntil : date         // if specified when locked

Comments?
