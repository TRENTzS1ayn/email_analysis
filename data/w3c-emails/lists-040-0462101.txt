If you do a Propfind against the resource looking for the lockdiscovery
property, the resource should return an Owner and Timeout to the client (if
permissions allow).

Unfortunately the Owner tag is left undefined, and I am sure each
implementation has its own sets of values.

Subject: 423 Locked


If a resource is locked with a exclusive lock, and another user tries to
lock if. The response then is 423 Locked. But, is there any way for the
client to know who owns the lock?
I would like the response to look something like this :
421 Locked
Date: ...
Server: ...
Connection: ...
LockOwner : user
LockDate  : date
LockType  : exclusive
LockedUntil : date         // if specified when locked

Comments?
