   Maybe the 423 Locked response should contain a XML body with the
   lockdiscovery property. Then the client doesn't need to do a second request
   to the server, and there will not be a time gap.

There are many would would agree that an XML body with detailed information
about the cause of the error would be a good thing (Yaron, for sure).

In this particular case, the overhead of an extra PROPFIND request
and the time gap probably don't matter much.

Cheers,
Geoff
