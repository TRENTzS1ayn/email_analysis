Like Geoff, I don't think there should be too much problem doing the
PROPFIND after the failed lock. The only thing that can happen between the
LOCK and the PROPFIND that would be of interest is UNLOCK, and then the
client would see the lock was gone and there is nothing to do (always a
possibility in a distributed, concurrent environment). We have to be
careful about overloading methods to support client use cases. This will
cause the protocol to bloat and become complex. It will also reduce
interoperability and create situations where one client's use cases
conflict with another. Some methods do return failure information that your
client can use.

Hi!

If you follow the 423 Locked thread, you see that I suggested that the
lockdiscovery should be sent in the 423 response. I would like the 423
response
to contain the locked by info, so that I don't have to do a new request to
the
server ( performance ), and not have a time gap.
Do you have any comments about sending the lockdiscovery in the 423
response, I
would appriciate getting them... ( or if you can post them on the webdav
work
group...)
