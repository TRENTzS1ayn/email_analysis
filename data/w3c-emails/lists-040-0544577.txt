I thought we were designing a protocol that is used by the client. Why
shouldn't we support it?

IMO, returning an XML body in the 423 response is a good idea. It could
have a DAV:lockdiscovery element.

The spec is how we fix interoperability issues.

While this is true, we are talking about an error case. Personally, I
don't mind taking a few more cycles in an error case. Especially if there
is a possibility that the client will be needing that information anyhow.
