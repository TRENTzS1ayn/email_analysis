That's what I decided to do for my Oberon client.

Agreed :-)

It`s a pity. I think at least for Oberon users there shouldn`t be such a
problem.
There are already names like mailto:..., ftp://..., http://..., so why
shouldn`t
there be a dav://... .
And why should this be something a MS user wouldn`t understand. He already
knows a: b:, c:, ... So you could sell dav: just as onother distributed disk
:-)
