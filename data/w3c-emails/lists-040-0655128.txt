Hi Hartmut,

I'm also copying the dav-dev@lyra.org mailing list with this. That mailing
list is specifically for mod_dav users/developers.

This is a bug in mod_dav. It doesn't check the parent resource for locks
before processing the delete.

You need to use a Tagged-list production to say that L applies to /c. If
you simply use a No-tag-list, then you are asserting the lock applies to
/c/c1 (and /c when the parent is checked).

I just tried your scenario (successfully) with the following If: header:

If: <http://host/c/>(<opaquelocktoken:0f2b6c12-1dd2-11b2-8f00-de8a8992ccf3>)

You are probably seeing the same problem as in (2) (not using a tagged
list).

Cheers,
