Ok... But the real issue is if I can make sure that the Lock command tells me, 
if I'm trying to lock something that has been updated. There is nothing in the 
webdav spec. that specifies this behaviour, right? Can I even rely on that if I 
send the E-tag, that the server is supporting this behavour on a Lock command?  
( this maybe applies to some other commands to... )
If the resource is changed, what reply can I expect from the server?
