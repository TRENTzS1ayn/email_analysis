Even though there are currently no plans for holding a WebDAV working group
meeting in Adelaide, we're still affected by the IETF-wide Internet-Draft
submission cutoff date of March 10.  No Internet Drafts will be able to be
submitted from March 10 (after 5PM US Eastern) - March 26.  Please plan
accordingly.
