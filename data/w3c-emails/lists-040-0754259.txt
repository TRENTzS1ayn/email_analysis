Neither of these notations captures content negotiation, and it isn't
OK to remove 't'. The whole *point* is to understand what are
the things that are stable over time and which things can change, and how.

If you just look 'at an instant' then there's no meaningful way
of distinguishing URLs from resources, and collapsing -UMap->. I'm guessing
you want to make UMap vary more slowly and only with explicit operations
(BIND and UNBIND) while RMap encompases all of the content negotiation &
time
varying behavior of resources without having any explicit operation modify
the mapping.
