I found section 6 to be extremely verbose, which given my record on the
matter is saying something. As such I move that the entire section be
replaced with the following two paragraphs:

A redirect resource, upon receiving a request without an
Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header, MUST respond with a 302 (Found) response. The
302 (Found) response MUST include a location header identifying the target
and a Redirect-Ref header. 

If a redirect resource receives a request with an Apply-To-Redirect-Ref
header then the redirect reference resource MUST apply the method to itself
rather than blindly returning a 302 (Found) response.
