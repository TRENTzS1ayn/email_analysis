The second sentence of the last paragraph of section 6.3 reads: "The
Redirect-Ref header informs a reference-aware client that this is not an
ordinary HTTP 1.1 redirect, but is a redirect reference resource. "

If the purpose of the Redirect-Ref header was solely to inform the client
that they were dealing with a redirect resource then the header would be
returned on all responses from a redirect resource, even those with a
Apply-To-Redirect-Ref header.

However the purpose of the Redirect-Ref header is to let redirect aware
clients determine that they are dealing with a blindly generated 302. As
such I move that the sentence be changed to state: "The Redirect-Ref header
informs a redirect aware client that they have received a blind 302 response
from a redirect resource."

Similarly the main paragraph of section 11.1 currently reads: "The
Redirect-Ref header is used in all 302 responses from redirect resources.
Its presence informs reference-aware clients that the response is not a
plain HTTP/1.1 redirect, but is a response from a redirect reference
resource."

I move that it be re-written to read: "The Redirect-Ref header is used to
mark blind 302 responses from redirect resources."
