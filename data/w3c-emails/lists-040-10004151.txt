Accidentally caught by the spam filter -- I've added Karl Best to the
accept2 list, so future emails from him will not be caught.

Subject: [Moderator Action] RE: DAV conformance tests


OASIS currently has a number of technical committees (TCs) working on
conformance testing, though none of them are working specifically on DAV.
One committee, Interoperability Conformance, is creating guidelines for the
development of conformance tests. (See
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/committees.shtml for a list of the
current OASIS TCs.)

OASIS would be happy to host a new TC to work on conformance testing for
DAV. The process for creating a new TC is quite simple, and essentially only
requires the sponsorship of three representatives of OASIS member
organizations. (See http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/process.shtml for
the OASIS TC process.) I would be happy to work with any interested parties
to get this set up.
