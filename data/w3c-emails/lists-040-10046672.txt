Hey Peter,

We are considering converting our Shared directory to a WebDAV virtual
Directory using IIS.  The hope is that this will improve download times of
files (word, excel...etc) through our Intranet.

One of our concerns is scalability, have you found WebDAV to handle many
simultaneous users well, does this slow down the server significantly?
thanks \
Mac

Hi!

> Interested in getting in touch with any companies that are using WebDAV on

We are using WebDAV in our Intranet for all files.

Most of the files are in XML and edited trought the intranet with
Documentor.

Files of outher types (powerpoint, word, excel etc) are aloso edited
over webdav either with webfolders or with
the Documentor client as ActiveX plugins.

We have our own archive; ExcoConf with webdav support. We also use a
little Exchange 2000 server.

Even the source code is edited directly in the archive wia WebDav.

We can also edit the files when working at home over webdav.

Best Regards
Peter Pierrou
