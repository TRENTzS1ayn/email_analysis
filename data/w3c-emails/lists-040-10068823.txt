Jeremy, Jim et al,

MS folks correct me if I'm way off base:

Isn't Office 2000 security integrated to a degree with the Internet Options control panel.

Perhaps the issue is not with Office 2000 functionality, but with the server's inability to set cookies on your client.

Make sure to check your Intranet Security settings and check the boxes to accept and save cookies.

Since you don't think that this is a problem, and, it probably isn't, you ought to eliminate the possibility completely by opening
up your client machine security wise.

If you are successful, and the files are writeable and can be saved back to the source directory, you can lock it down little by
little, testing each time.

So much for Stewart's grasping-straw idea.

*S*

Hi Jeremy,

Well, I took a quick look at your protocol trace, and nothing obvious
immediately jumps out at me.  Your lock timout value seems a little high,
but is less than 2^32-1, which is around 4 billion, if memory serves me
well.  It's possible Office doesn't like the timeout value to be too far off
the 120 seconds it requests (although I doubt it, since I have heard of
other people changing this timeout value without any trouble). You're also
not using a status phrase (the "OK" in "HTTP/1.1 200 OK") in the lock
response, but this also shouldn't make any difference. One grasping straw
idea is perhaps Office defaults to read-only if the <isreadonly/> property
isn't set (you're returning 404 for them).  But then why would Office try to
lock the document in the first place?

Anyone have any ideas on Jeremy's problem?

- Jim
