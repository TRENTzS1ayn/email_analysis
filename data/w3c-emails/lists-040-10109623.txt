Sorry Greg,

Thought you'd never ask...

 Wed, 9 Aug 2000 21:38:54 -0400 (EDT) 

We loaded mod_dav on the Sun's Apache Server and configured a davtest folder.

Initial comments were, "The 'cadaver' command line client has some SSL issues ".

I believe changes were made in release 0.15.2 of cadaver to fix some of these issues.

Anyone interested can see: http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/ and of course, http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/ .

:-)

G'night.

Euh... you gave the hardware, but what DAV server were you using?
