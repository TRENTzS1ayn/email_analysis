  In other words, if you just remove *everything* in the bindings spec
  that defines an implementation, including all of the attempts at defining
  bindings as being something other than resources, then what you will end
  up with is a very simple protocol for manipulating URI mappings on
  remote servers.

Roy, quick question.   What do you mean by "a binding is a resource"?
That bindings and resources are one to one?   If so, when we say that
two bindings point to the same "thing", what is the word you'd like to
use for "thing".
