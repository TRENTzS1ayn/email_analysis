If there are any changes you would like made before the WebDAV
versioning protocol is sent to the IESG for proposed standard status,
now's the time to suggest them!

<http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-12.htm>
or
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-12.txt>

Here are the current set of proposed changes to the last call version
of the WebDAV versioning protocol:

- Section 1: Delete 2 sentences about working resource and workspace
  options (Mark).

- Section 2.3: Remove the DAV:version property (Geoff).

- Section 7.5: Fix typo: is -> its (Mark).

- Section 10: Rename "baseline selector" to be "version-controlled
  configuration" (Geoff).

- Section 10.6: Rename DAV:baseline-comparison to be
  DAV:compare-baseline (Geoff).

- Section 14.2: Fix precondition name to be
  DAV:cannot-delete-default-variant (Tim).

- Section 23.1: Make DAV:comment and DAV:creator-displayname value a
  string (Eric).

- Section 23.5: Add a note that the DAV:expand-property report
  extends the property DTD's by allowing a DAV:response node wherever
  a DAV:href can appear (Greg).

- Section 23.5.1: Add missing DAV:href tags (Greg).
