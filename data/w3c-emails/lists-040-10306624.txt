On a similar note ... has anyone found a good way to display WebDAV within
Outlook?  WebFolders shows up in the file dialog box under Outlook2000, but
files from there can't be used.  Has anyone found a way to display a WebDAV
path as a folder/tab within Outlook?

No, FrontPage 2000 only supports the FrontPage server extensions.  Web
Folders support both DAV and the FrontPage server extensions -- FrontPage
supports Web Folders as a UI, but only the FPSE aspects of them on the
protocol side.
