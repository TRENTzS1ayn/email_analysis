A binding is an internal redirect from one resource to another.
The binding is a resource, and what it points to is a resource,
but they are not necessarily the same resource just because
the bindings exist.  The binding is simply a method for
establishing a temporary shared mapping mechanism for two or
more URI.  The client does not identify the mapping mechanism;
rather, it describes the relationship between the three resources
(source, destination, and source collection) such that the server
can figure out on its own how to align the mapping mechanism
in a mechanism-dependent manner.
