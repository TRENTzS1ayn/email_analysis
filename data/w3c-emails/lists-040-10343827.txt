A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV -- Advanced Status Reporting
Author(s): L. Dusseault
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-status-00.txt
Pages: 12
Date: 29-Jan-01

HTTP 1.1 [2] defines 20 status codes: 100-101, 200-206, 300-305, 
400-415, and 500-505.  The WebDAV RFC [3] adds six more: 102, 207, 
422, 423, 424 and 507.  However, WebDAV implementers have found this 
to be insufficient.  The space of status codes available is limited, 
but even if it were not, additional information would often be very 
helpful.  WebDAV clients frequently need to be able to present 
distinct options and helpful information to users, and sometimes 
cients might even be able to deal with errors automatically.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-ietf-webdav-status-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-status-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
