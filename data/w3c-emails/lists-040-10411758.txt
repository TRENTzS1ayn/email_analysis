I was about to ask "which server are you talking to?" because I knew mod_dav
returned the values appropriately. Didn't figure on a client problem :-)

The other possibility is that I'm mistaken in assuming that &amp; is the
correct substitution for an ampersand in an <href> element. I could see an
argument being made that the URL should be encoded using %26 for the
ampersand.

I'm copying the main WebDAV mailing list for feedback on this point.
