2)  /foo is a directory with no contents and is locked depth infinity
    PUT to /foo/bar, does this require a tagged list for the lock token
specifying /foo or will un untagged list work as well.

The lock token is required because /foo is locked, and PUT to /foo/bar adds
a new member. It doesn't matter if the collection is empty or not, depth
infinity or not. Depth infinity only means that /foo/bar inherits the lock.
The tag list is only needed if the request must provide different lock
tokens for more than one resource. In this case, only /foo needs a lock
token, so an untagged list will work too.
