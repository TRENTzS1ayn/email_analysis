Here are my current thoughts on the agenda for the WebDAV WG meeting at the
Minneapolis IETF:

- Open issues in the ACL specification

  I suspect most issues in this specification will
  have been resolved on the ACL mailing list before
  the IETF meeting, but if not, we'll make time for
  this.

- Property registration (Dennis Hamilton)

  Discussion of the issues inherent in registration
  of WebDAV properties.

- Open issues in RFC 2518

  We'll start marching down the RFC 2518 issues list,
  and resolve as many issues as possible.

- Reviving DASL

  When to do this, who wants to work on it, in what venue,
  etc.

I'm also hoping to have one or more breakout sessions for WebDAV dedicated
to the resolution of RFC 2518 issues.
