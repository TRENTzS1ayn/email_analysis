It might be better to wait and see whether IRIs take off
(<draft-masinter-url-i18n-07.txt>; broadly, the approach is to define that IRIs
are like URLs, but in Unicode; to use an IRI in a context that demands a URL, you
encode it in UTF-8, then apply %-encoding as normal).  No sense creating two
separate mechanisms to solve the same problem.
