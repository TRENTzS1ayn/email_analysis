I'm a big fan of IRI's (as you can tell from my earlier emails) but I 
think the issue here is the one of what to do when clients submit 
URIs with other encodings that the server returns to them in a body. 
Even when servers go to IRI discipline for URLs they generate, they 
shouldn't necessarily break clients who expect to get back what they 
asked for :^).

Here's another way of phrasing this issue that makes it not be about encoding:

The DAV spec says that it is *resources* that have properties, not 
*urls*, and that many different urls can refer to the same resource. 
When a client requests info about a resource by using a particular 
URL, but the server sends back information about a resource named by 
another URL, what guarantees does the client have about the returned 
URL:

1. Is it guaranteed to refer, in the context of this response, to the 
resource that the client asked about in the request?
2. Is it guaranteed *always* to refer to that same resource?  (In 
some sense, is there the same info in this response that one could 
glean from a permanent redirect?)

In this formulation, note that differences in %-escaping conventions 
can lead to different URLs that encode the same octet-stream.  Are 
there special conventions that apply in this case?
