This is a bug in the MacOS X client DAV library. When it does a PROPFIND, it
doesn't send a Content-Length (as you can see below). A friend of mine at
Adobe just ran into this a week or two ago during some interoperability
testing, but I thought it was just their URLAccess library (rather than a
general issue).

The rules on Content-Length are specified in section 4.4 of RFC 2616.

If a C-L isn't provided, then Apache happens to use a length==0 and assume
there is no body (i.e. if there is, then it'll monkey up the next request).
IIS returns 411. Both are valid approaches.

My Adobe friend just manually inserted a Content-Length: 0 in the request
header when operating on the MacOS platform. That is doable from code, of
course; if their webdavfs doesn't do it (I can't tell what you're using to
talk to the IIS5 box), then you're stuck.

Cheers,
