Perhaps this is an OSX-ism which will be fixed when it is released this
month..??

But in 2616/4.4 (which discusses how to determine the length of the body),
the
only way I see to infer that no body is present is to know that the message
MUST NOT have a body (e.g., if it's a GET request or a HEAD response), or
else
to see that the server closed the connection after the message (does not
work
for requests).  So I think IIS5 is probably within its rights to require
Content-Length: 0...though I personally would have written it to be more
forgiving, and assume that no Content-Length: and no Transfer-Encoding:
implies
no body.
