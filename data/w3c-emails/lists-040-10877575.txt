I agree that the current behavior is fine when the lock that would go 
in the IF header is the one that is in the LOCK-TOKEN header.

I agree.  The issue is when there is more than one lock that applies 
to the resource.  Then I believe that the write lock needs to be 
specified in the IF header when an unlock is done on one of the other 
kinds of locks.

In general I find the spec weak around the requirements on 
non-exclusive lock handling.

Thanks!  Is there a more current version of the issues document than 
the one posted at 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/issues.html ?  That 
one shows a last update of 7/2000 and there was another issue I had 
raised in September that I wasn't sure had made it on.
