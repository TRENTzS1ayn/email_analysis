I know IIS supports Unicode when URL's are encoded in UTF-8, but does any
DAV server out there understand DBCS/MBCS ?

DBCS/MBCS:  double byte or multi byte character set used for far east
languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean).  It's a mix of single byte and
multibyte characters.  The multi-byte characters are encoding as two bytes
with a lead and trail byte.  DBCS strings have to be parsed by software that
knows about DBCS because some special characters like backslash can appear
in the trail byte which could confuse some software when parsing path's for
example.
