The Mac OS X, webdavfs has been updated.  It now actually sends
a PROPFIND body a request the specific properties that
it is interested in and thus sends the  content-length as well.  I think
there is still one case with a bug, however.  Does anyone know of
a public IIS5 webdav server that I can test against ?
