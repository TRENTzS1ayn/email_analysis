<checks> OK, 2047 (updated by 2184 and 2231) is for non-ASCII content in headers,
not in the body.  2616 refers to 2047; 2616/2.2 says:

     Words
     of *TEXT MAY contain characters from character sets other than ISO-
     8859-1 [22] only when encoded according to the rules of RFC 2047
     [14].

To me, that says any HTTP/1.1 implementation needs to (SHOULD? MUST?) support
2047 (presumably, as updated by 2231, since that predates 2616).  However, TEXT
"is only used for descriptive field contents and values that are not intended to
be interpreted by the message parser" (2616/2.2, again); it apparently does not
apply to URIs.
