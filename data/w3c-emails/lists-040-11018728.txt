Hi!

I am a QA Engineer from Engenia Software, Inc.  Recently, I have performed

team can help me.  Below are my test steps, results and questions.

Thank you,
Irene


Test Steps:
1.  Setup a WebDAV server

Comment:
For the computer # 2 and 5, I can open a file, test.doc (MS Word 2000
document), in Web folder, but I can NOT open this same file thru IE browser.
Below are the messages that I got:

IE Install on Demand
To display this page correctly, you need to download or
install the following components:  Web Folder.

I have upgraded one of the computer above from IE 5.0 to IE 5.5.  After
upgrading, I no longer has this problem.

Questions:
It seems like the computer # 2 and 5 are missing Web Folder components.
1.  Do you know what components that I am missing?
