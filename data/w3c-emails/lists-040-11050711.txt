Hi,

I've been lurking too and I saw your post.

Before I got off and say that SSL can still take care of all your needs, can
you be more specific about which RSA security protocols you are interested
in?   SSL supports pretty much the same authentication and encryption
options that IPSec does without all the nasty, messy NAT issues.

If you run all your TCP connections under/over SSL, it would address your
webfolders question as well.   Furthermore, it is feasibly possible to run
SSL in both directions, therefore providing authentication of the clients.

Regards,
Jim

Hi!

I have been lurking on the list for a couple of weeks now and thought I?d
come out of the shadows to ask a question that I haven?t seen anyone else
addressing:

How about security? I understand that as DAV uses http as the underlying
protocol, I can use SSL as a way to enhance security, and realms on my
server to exclude unwanted visitors.

What I am more interested in is if there is any support in current clients
for more rigorous security, eg RSA encryption or similar approaches?

If I use a webclient such as IE or Netscape the answer is rather obvious,
but how is it with webfolders in Windows, how will it work in Mac OS X, does
Adobe support it in Photoshop and InDesign, has Microsoft done anything like
that in Office 2000, Office XP and so forth?

If this is a topic on another list, please let me know.
