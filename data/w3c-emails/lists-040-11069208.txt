Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  I've added Edwin's email address to
the accept2 list, so future email from this address will not get through.

(SAML)


Hi DAVers,
DAV is Distributed Authoring and Versioning.  So, you may be interested in
SAML -- whose goal is to provide a standard mechanism to "securely work
across an ecosystem of independent websites".

SAML Home:
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/security/


Discussions (most activity is in the UseCase list):
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/security/#mailinglists


Finally, you may be particularly interested in the Distributed Session
Management draft input:
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/security/docs/draft-orchard-itml-sessio
n-00.pdf


Regards,
Edwin.
