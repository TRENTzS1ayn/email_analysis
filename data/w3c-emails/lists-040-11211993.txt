Hi,

I have some problem building mod_dav into Apache, Looking at the instruction
page it require Expat modules,
But I only find expat-lite coming with Apache_1.3.14. (The instruction says
Expat is included in Apache_1.3.9 or newer version)

Any body know, is "Expat" the same as "expat-lite"? or I need to install
Expat in addition of expat-lite.
Since I don't want to include unnecessary packages.

Thanks


PC Wang
