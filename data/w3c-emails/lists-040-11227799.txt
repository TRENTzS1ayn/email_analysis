The mod_dav did not resolve it.
I finally resolved this by download the expat from the web, rebuild from the
source and copy .h and .so into proper directory.
(I am using Linux 7.0/Apache 1.3.14/with mod_perl-1.25 build with DSO)

My next question is how I am going to test if this is working?

Thanks

It is the same, and mod_dav will automatically detect it and use it.
