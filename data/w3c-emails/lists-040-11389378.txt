The decision to use separate methods instead of just POST (which
I think was the original question) was arrived at after a lengthy
discussion; the first record I can find is from October 1996:

Note that SOAP takes a different view; it only uses POST. I don't
think the considerations have changed substantially, except perhaps
that we're talking about using other headers and/or message body
elements rather than content-type to do method dispatching.
