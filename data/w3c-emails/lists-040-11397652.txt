Hi,

Geoff has also pointed me to

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/redirect-issues.html

which of course had this issue already listed.

However, the content of this document seems to indicate that the redirect
draft will change drastically (when the next comes out), for instance it
seems that MKRESOURCE will go away completely and will be replaced by MKREF.

Yes, I am aware of the fact that Internet Drafts are work-in-progress.
However, I am currently adding experimental redirect ref support to a WebDAV
server and would like to get some opinions about what's the best way to
proceed:

a) use draft 02, taking clarifications from the issues list where feasible,

b) implement a vendor-specific method (which then would be replaced by
whatever the next draft defines)?


Or is there a preliminary version of the next draft which could be used as a
better implementation guideline?

Julian

So, how can I create a redirect ref *with* a body?
