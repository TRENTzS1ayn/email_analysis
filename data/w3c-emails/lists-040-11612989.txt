All IMHO. Bits snipped.

You really shouldn't do this. RFC2616 Sec 8.2.3 states "a client MUST NOT
send an Expect header .... if it does not intend to send a request body".

You will have to check, but some servers might assume any data arriving on
"the socket connection" after it has sent the response for the Expect header
*is* the body. In the case of PUT, it might store the data (which could
actually be your new request) in the file as specified by the PUT request.
