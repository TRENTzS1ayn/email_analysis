Thanks for the link. From my reading of this, it seems I can get IE
to open up a folder. Can I get it to immediately launch Word on a
particular document? Or do I have to open the folder then ask the
user to double-click on the correct document in the folder?

In case others are listening, I used the following HTML

    <A STYLE="behavior:url('#default#AnchorClick')" ID="sID"
HREF="http://localhost:4444/foo/myslides.ppt"
FOLDER="http://localhost:4444/foo/"
TARGET="_top">
    My Slides
    </A>

Clinking on 'My Slides' in IE5 brought up the directory (inside IE) with
the file in it. Double clicking on the file in the web folder caused
Power Point to load the document via WebDAV, then save the changes back
when I was finished. Quite nice really, but not the user had to click
on the particular file in the folder - I cannot get it to start
power point directly on the myslides.ppt file from a web page.

Note: I tried changing the FOLDER="..." to ../foo/myslides.ppt and
IE just ignored the file name on the end (dropped it). I then tried
.../foo/myslides.ppt/ (OK, I am a hacker at heart). IE said "Not enough
memory to complete your operation."
