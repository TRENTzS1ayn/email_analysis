   I thought 8.10.7 of RFC 2518 would require them to return a 412 in
   this case (ie. "lock token not enforcable on this resource")...?

A write lock does not guarantee the lock-token-holder the ability
to write to a resource ... it just denies non-lock-token-holders
that ability.  So a server would be enforcing the lock, even if
there are reasons (such as ACLs) that prevent the lock-holder from
writing to the resource.

Cheers,
Geoff
