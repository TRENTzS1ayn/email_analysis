Section 5.2 states that it is server-defined whether or not
a collection lists non-compliant resources as internal members.

You can identify that a resource is webDAV compliant if it 
returns a "1" as a value in the DAV header returned from an OPTIONS
request.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,
     according to RFC2518, it said a webdav compliant collection may hold
not webdav compliant resource.
if so, when I use propfind with <allprop> and depth = 1 header to request
properties, webdav should make response
for all properties of its immediate members or just for all properties of
its immediate members which is webdav compliant.
how to identify a webdav compliant resource or not. Thanks
