I've used cadaver against mod_dav on my laptop (SuSE 6.4 linux), and
what it uses as the <owner><href> of a lock is username@hostname
(where "username" is the name you're authenticated as, and hostname is
the name of the host withouth the domain name).

But that's mod_dav on one particular machine.  It doesn't say anything
about what another mod_dav installation might do, or what IIS does. :-/
