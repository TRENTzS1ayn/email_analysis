Good thing you're making sure :)

Since somebody was asking if lock-null resources have been implemented:
 - Xythos WebFile Server implements lock-null resources
 - I believe the Microsoft DAV servers allow LOCK of a non-mapped URL then
PUT.  Their version of a lock null resource may not support MKCOL, and it
may not disappear when the lock expires, but it still solves the lost-update
problem for a new resource (not a problem for MKCOL).
 - Our tests of Office XP show it seems to use lock null resources.

My next concern is that the functionality was intended to solve an important
problem - the lost-update problem for a new resource is the problem that two
users can both try to create a resource with the same name using PUT.  One
overwrites the other unwittingly.  LOCK already solves the lost-update
problem for existing resources, so it seemed reasonable at the time to use
the same mechanism for new resources.

Since lock null resources solve an important problem, and since they have
been implemented, I'd object to removing them from RFC2518.  Although it may
be possible to try to simplify, I'd hesitate.  We'd want to make sure there
was a good reason to do that.  Is there any serious problem with the
existing definition?
