You cannot PROPPATCH a null resource because most repositories
need to know what kind of resource you are creating (collection,
non-collection, whatever).  So you first need to create the
resource before you can PROPPATCH it.

Hi,
      I read your paper about "Proposed Extensions to WebDAV Properties"
linked through
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/props/draft-ietf-webdav-properties-ex
tension-00.txt,
we have same problem with yours. that is proppatch on a null resource. I am
not sure whether WebDAV
spec. can support a proppatch on a null resource right now. I mean if I
perform a proppatch on a null resource
does this method create this resource with the properties defined in <set>
element inside <propertyupdate> element?
Thanks
