Thank you for your detailed review of the ACL specification -- I'm a bit
swamped right now to reply to each comment, but I'll give them detailed
consideration when creating the -07 spec.

This document is currently quiescent. It current status is that it has
passed through a working group last call for comments period, which
generated significant comments. These comments need to be integrated into
the next version of the draft, and then another WG last call needs to be
held. I am hopeful to get to this in the next few months, since I feel this
draft needs to be done before we can bring 2518 to Draft standard status,
since the bindings specification contains numerous fixes to the DAV
containment model.
