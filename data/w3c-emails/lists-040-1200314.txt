Repeated requests to have one or another method have as its default behavior
on a redirect reference to operate automatically on the target resource
rather than responding with 302.

So it seems worthwhile jumping up and down a bit about the differences
between them.

What evidence is available that would lead one to conclude that it would be
difficult to grasp redirect references without understanding direct
references, especially given that HTTP/1.1 was able to define a redirect
without having to reference its direct variant?
