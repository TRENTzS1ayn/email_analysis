Although both these are possible, I've always thought that mapping rows to
resources and tables to collections was the most useful.  The MSDAIPP
component used by MS clients (you can see its name in the User-Agent header
if you sniff) takes this approach in a way: it presents an OLEDB interface
to the client software developer which treats every file and collection as a
row.
