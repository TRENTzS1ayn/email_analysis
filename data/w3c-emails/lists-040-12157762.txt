This summarizes also my ideas. WebDAV should stick to the LOCK behaviour
of null-resources, when followed by a PUT. I think there are no interop
problems when LOCK->MKCOL is discontinued or when the resource, created
by a LOCK on a null-resource, stays after lock timeout.

In fact, changing RFC2518 in this way, will make live for server
implementors much easier and probably result in more compliant
implementations.
