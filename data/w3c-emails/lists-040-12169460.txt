One example is Microsoft IIS which does not implement lock-null resources
as specified in 2518. E.g. MKCOL will not work and lock-null resources
will not disappear after lock timeout.

mod_dav is an excellent implementation.

The point made is that the specified behaviour might not be worth
the effort. Limiting the lock-null requirements could result in
making (server) implementations easier without giving up any
functionality. The benefit for clients would be that more servers
will comply to the spec.
