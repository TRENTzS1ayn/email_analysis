I agree: my first choice would  be for abandoning the concept of a null
lock, but if people feel strongly they should be kept, the semantics
should be changed to allow the server to create an actual file to track
the lock.

Among other things, this allows other protocols to have at least a shot
at playing nice with DAV locks.  This point (interoperability with other
protocols) has been brought up a couple of times in this discussion
already, and is an important consideration for the server I'm working on
(Oracle iFS), and I suspect for others as well.  It can't just be
ignored.
