     Inspection of OPTIONS and PROPFIND responses showed:

     1) Oracle IFS only supports DAV class 1, and doesn't return an ALLOW
     header
     on OPTIONS,


That's correct, iFS DAV does not support locking in its current version.

     2) <getetag> is "getetag_blah" for all resources,


Yes, that's a known hole.  We're looking at cache interaction for our next
release, this will fall under that.

     3) It tries to return <getlastmodified> in RFC format, but uses it's
     locale
     for formatting, which obviously will not produce an RNC formatted
     date when
     your language isn't english,

Tell me more about the problem?  Where are we using the locale?

     4) It tries to return <creationdate> in RFC format (and fails in the
     same
     way), while this should be in ISO8601 format,


Does the spec say it has to be ISO8601?  I remember that Web Folders didn't
seem to like that, so we put in a hack at the last minute to make it display
dates correctly.

     5) <getcontentlanguage> (when not "unknown") is set to language
     strings like
     "ENGLISH" (which I think is incorrect according to section 14.13 of
     [RFC2068])


Yep, that's a bug.  Will fix it in our next release.

Let me know if you found any other issues.

Thanks.
