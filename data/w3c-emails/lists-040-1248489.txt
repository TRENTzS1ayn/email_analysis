I could probably make up just as compelling reasons why the ETag and
Last-Modified-Date SHOULD change during a update of a dead property etc.

But

I agree that it seems that no other server can (or is) supporting this.  I
can pull this functionality out of Xythos.

I just read Greg's email, and I don't like putting the MAY in the spec.  A
client will never know what the server is doing.  I think we just need to
pick a position and put it in 2518.

I am fine with changing properties does not modify the ETag or
Last-Modified-Date.  But I think we should be consistent.

Kevin

A good reason to not change the etag or mod-date when a property changes
is that a property is often information about the resource, as opposed to
"being" the resource.  If I mark a resource as being "tested", I don't want
it to appear that the resource has changed (thus making it look like I need
to test it again).
A less compelling reason (but still a consideration) is to achieve
consistency
between dead and live properties.  You certainly don't want a change to the
"last access time" of a resource to modify the etag or "modification time"
of
that resource.
Add to this the fact that current implementations appear to not modify the
etag or
modification time when a dead property is modified, and I think we have a
pretty
case that neither the etag value nor the modification time should
be changed when a dead property is updated.

Cheers,
Geoff
