I agree with Jason's revision, although I'd probably further revise the
wording to say:

"When a new resource is created by a LOCK request against an
unmapped URI, if an UNLOCK is applied to that resource before it
has been explicitly updated (e.g. by a PUT or a PROPPATCH), then
that resource SHOULD NOT be deleted as a side effect of the UNLOCK.
Note that this changes the behavior defined in RFC-2518, which
stated that the resource MUST be deleted in this case."

Cheers,
Geoff

> - UNLOCK on the same URI without a PUT should (can?) delete the resource

I think most people would change this to be...

- UNLOCK on the same URI without a PUT should NOT delete the resource

This will give existing implementations that try to delete it some
flexibility but push people away from that direction.  I doubt we can say
anything stronger right now.
