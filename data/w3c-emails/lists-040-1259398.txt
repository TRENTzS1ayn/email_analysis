We've got two issues here:

1) Should property updates change the mod-date?
2) Should property updates change the e-tag?

Agreed.

I disagree.  If you mark a resource as 'tested', it is a different entity
than the one not marked as 'tested'.  If we're doing any sort of
collaboration, I would not want my unmarked file (& props) to overwrite your
marked file (& props) because my application mistakenly thinks that these
entities are the same.
Furthermore, what about null resources (i.e. simple collections of
properties)?  If a property change doesn't indicate a new entity, then
there's no point in even having an e-tag -- all entities are the same.

Sounds good. Maybe we can include in the 2518 update language something
like this:

"Adding, changing, or removing a property MAY alter the
DAV:getlastmodified property."

In other words, don't rely on it happening, but also don't rely on it NOT
happening.

(note that I don't discriminate between live/dead props)
