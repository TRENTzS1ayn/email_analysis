I support Geoff's wording above over my little one liner.  :-)

This would be in conjuction with Alan Kent's proposals...

> - LOCK on unmapped URI [should] create a non-collection resource
> - MKCOL on a LOCKed unmapped URI will fail (pity, but too bad).

So is this the way we want to go?

Items of note so far (just to make sure we're comfortable with this):

- We don't speak about what happens if you violate Geoff's (SHOULD NOT).

- This doesn't speak about the nature of the non-collection resource
created.  Nor do we explicitly mention that this is a change of behavior
from 2518 except through Geoff's words about what happens upon UNLOCK.

- Presumably we'd only use the "MKCOL on a LOCKed..." wording if somewhere
in the 2518 it says otherwise since this is implicit if we are clear that
we generated an ordinary non-collection resource.

Comments?  Wordings?  Additions?
