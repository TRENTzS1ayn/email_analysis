A few people actually dislike the term 'null resource'. There is no
resource of type 'null' that is ever created.  Basically a 'null resource'
means there is no resource. So you cannot create them. Any URI not
currently bound to a resource is said to refer to a 'null resource'.
A better way of describing it is that the URI is unmapped or unbound.

I could imaging the terminology came about from the concept of having a
variable in a programming language of type 'resource' that is null
rather than pointing to a resource object.

Bottom line: there is no API to create null resources because null
resources are not resources. The phase "null resource" really means
"there is no resource".

ps: I guess you could then argue that DELETE can create null
resources! :-) :-) :-)
