| Now, you can look at it two ways:
| a) Well, nobody can move to a destination on a different server,
|    so ignoring the host part in Destination is Ok.
| b) Non-matching host parts is an error and should be reported as such.
| 
| What do you think? How is your server handling this?

Xythos does allow moves and copies to (and from) a different server;
the destination header functions independently of the host header.

My reading of 2616 says the port in the Host header is required if
non-standard.  Therefore I would say Adobe's client's Host header 
is incorrect.
