Accidentally caught by the spam filter. I have added
lawrence@pop02.odn.ne.jp to the accept2 list, so future email from this
address will go straight through to the list.

Subject: [Moderator Action] WebDAV hosting


Hello list,

I've looked all over the place trying to find a list of web hosting
companies that will allow my (remote) design partner and I to
collaboratively design sites using Adobe GoLive's WebDAV
uploading/downloading. I have asked several hosting companies and they all
say nope, they don't have WebDAV enabled; and most ask why we can't just use
FTP.

Can anyone recommend any hosting services? Or is WebDAV only for people who
own servers??

If you have any info, I would be grateful if you'll respond to:

    laferla@mac.com

Thank you very much,
Lawrence LaFerla
