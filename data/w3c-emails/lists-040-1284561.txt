I think that we have to say MAY. Consider the case where properties are
stored as part of a multi-stream file (NTFS or MacOS's HFS). I bet the
date will change when you store a property. While reasonable to state that
the server implementation is required to restore the modification date to
the original (before storing the property), I think that is getting into
dangerous territory. What if your backup solution is using the
modification time to backup that multi-stream file? Or maybe there is
another storage mechanism where a server couldn't restore the date(!).

Putting a MAY into the spec is fine. Yes, the client won't know what the
server is going to do, but that isn't that big of a deal. For most of the
live properties, the client won't always know what will happen when they
touch the resource.

Cheers,
