Hello,
We are trying to build a test harness for Webdav server's compliance testing
using Neon libraries.
Do you have any idea how to submit a lock-token while copying a resource to a
locked destination ?
I did not see any copy method in Neon's libraries which provides this facility.

Hello,
I am using Neon libraries. I did not find any method which takes a lock
token to
COPY resource to a locked resource.
How do I submit a lock-token while copying a resource to a locked
destination ?

Regards.
