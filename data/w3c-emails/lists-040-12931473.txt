I'm marking the following issue:

What status code should be returned when a lock null resource is created ?
200 OK or 201 Created? A related issue is what status code should be
returned by a PUT or MKCOL on a lock-null resource? MKCOL is defined to be
201, PUT could be 200 or 201 (201 seems like a slightly better choice).

...as resolved by our apparent consensus on the addition of the following
wording for a status code for LOCK requests...

201 (Created) - The lock request succeeded by creating a new resource
and the value of the lockdiscovery property is included in the body.
