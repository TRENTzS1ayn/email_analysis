Assuming your are referring to "ordinary" users i.e. not say when an
Administrator removes a lock because an employee has left the company sort
of thing:

I strongly disagree with this. It should not be allowed at all.

I know locks can disappear at any time, but it could cause problems for
example - the original lock creator has a document locked and has made
changes but not PUT them back. Supposing the new lock creator UNLOCKs the
document, LOCKs it and keeps the lock for days, weeks etc. The new lock
creator makes changes to the document, re-PUTs it and UNLOCKs it. The
original lock creator still has their copy of the document with their
changes, but cannot re-PUT them for all this time (weeks?). What are they
suppose to do? They could discard their changes or after the new lock
creator has UNLOCKed the document, the original lock creator may then be
able to PUT their changes in (after weeks?). But then, there could be merge
type problems or lost update type problems if they discarded their changes
because they get fed up waiting, had to switch their client machine off etc.

I know what this statement is meant to mean, but one could say this 2nd
statement contradicts the 1st because the new lock creator is not the
original lock creator. After all, look at the confusion "null resource"
caused.

Not sure what the server could provide here or how helpful it would be.
What were people thinking of e.g. IP address of the client ?
Agree with the first sentence though.

Disagree with this. There is no need to introduce a new property.

Also, this is an implementation detail and may give sensitive information
away e.g. an OS account name, which might be retrieved say with PROPFIND or
returned in a (failed) LOCK request.

The lock owner property is sufficient as it can contain contact information
e.g. tel no, email addy etc. Clients should be using this when issuing LOCK
requests. Fix the clients, don't change the RFC.
