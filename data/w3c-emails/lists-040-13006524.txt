Lisa,

thanks for the summary.

A few notes regarding the slides:

- Lock Null Resources: LOCK -> PUT is used by MS Office when doing a "save
as..."

- XML escaping: servers and clients need to process response bodies using a
conforming, namespace aware XML parser. CDATA can appear everywhere where
text content is expected (not only in properties)

- xml:lang: should stick to the definitions in Canonical XML
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#DocSubsets): attributes in
the xml namespace are inherited from parents. I'd rather not have WebDAV
invent different rules

- allprop: recommend adopting the proposal using a <include> element as
child of <propfind>.

Yes. We have implemented ordered collections and redirect references. I
think I remember of having redirect references and BINDs added to the core
protocol, is this still under consideration?

We are currently supporting the Translate header, as our back end system
doesn't have a concept of different URLs for processed/unprocessed content.
Furthermore, I think the current wording on <source> is hard to understand,
in particular

- src/dst seem be the wrong way round,
- why does <source><link>.. need a <src> element? Isn't it always identical
to the resource on which the property is defined?
- the documentation on src/dst in <link> talks about a href XML element
(http://www.greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#ELEMENT_link) which
doesn't exist

If the intention is to have <source> to be able to replace the Translate
header, this needs more work...

Strongly disagree. This contradicts both the current wording in RFC2518, the
definitions in the XML spec itself
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-lang-tag> and specs defining
XML fragment exchange (Canonical XML:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#DocSubsets>).
