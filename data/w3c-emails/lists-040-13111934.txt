   [Should] a more explicit error code should be returned when an If
   header specifies a lock which has timed-out rather than an invalid
   lock, I believe that at the moment a client cannot tell the
   difference.

I believe most servers do not store "used to be locked by" information
with a resource, so it would be very difficult for them to distinguish
between a lock which timed out and a lock with does not exist.

But in any case, why would a client really care about this distinction?

Cheers,
Geoff
