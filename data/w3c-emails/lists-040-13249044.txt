  I'm pretty neutral on this, so I'll go along with whatever
  is the consensus (assuming that there is one :-).

  OK, on those grounds, I'll switch my vote to a new header, which
  takes a comma separated list as its argument!


  I pretty much abhor all abreviations, so I'd prefer something like
  "Lock-Token-Set".

If more one person pipes up in favor of spec'ing a new header for lock
token presentation in principle, I'll write up a proposal.....

Is anyone else supportive of this?

J.
