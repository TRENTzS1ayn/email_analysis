Again.  I'd like at least one more supportive comment before I file this
one as resolved.    Please pipe up.  :-)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



I'd just delete the paragraph in 9.8 that states:

   The timeout counter SHOULD be restarted any time an owner of the lock
   sends a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported
   methods, or methods which are unsuccessful.  However the lock MUST be
   refreshed if a refresh LOCK method is successfully received.

The last sentence is redundant, since it is already specified in the
LOCK semantics.

Cheers,
Geoff
