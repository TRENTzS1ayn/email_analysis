Hi,

Ordered collections have been applied in a web server that generates an automatic menu in the
browser screen (http://www.simplecms.de:8000). The question that came up in a discussion was how to
expose that feature to webdav clients that are supposed to maintain the directory structure and
content?

Would it be appropriate to implement the draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-02? Are there known
clients that could support this?

Thanks for any advice.

Eckhard
