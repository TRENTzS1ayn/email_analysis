below?

Well, that's a really easy change, i.e. all you have to do is
absolutely nothing (:-).  Currently, section 11 in 2518 places
no constraints on who can do an UNLOCK operation (i.e. if you
can discover the lock token, you can request an UNLOCK).  The ACL spec
introduces ways to constrain who can do an operation.  So we're done (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

It sounds like we might have consensus opinion that the power to unlock
someone else's locked resource should be under ACL control.   Could someone
that feels strongly about this propose a wording and placement in 2518 that
makes this proposal concrete?

Thanks,

J.
