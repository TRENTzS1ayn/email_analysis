Hi,
I am wondering if anybody let me know, has the inheritance been
considered on properties of resources in Webdav?

Consider you have  a lots of resource with the same properties. If you
have inheritance, you can
easily store one copy of properties and it can be inherited to other
resources with the same properties.

Indeed, what is preparationed in Webdav if a resource has a property
with more than one value. I know it is considered in RDF, however I
think it may be necessary to be a part of Webdav. So that all Webdav
projects support it intrinsically.  What do you think?

Any discussion  and pointer will be appreciated,
Bita.
