I don't think we ever considered this idea.  The access control
specification has inheritance of access control lists, which are represented
as properties, but this capability is limited just to access control lists.

Some issues here:

* Is the inheritance down a collection hierarchy (from a collection to its
members), or up a hierarchy (from a member to its parents), or does there
need to be a mechanism for specifying the inheritance pattern?

* Which takes precedence, the inheritance operation, or a lock? That is, if
A inherits properties from B, and A is locked, what is the effect of a
PROPPATCH on B? Does it succeed, or does it fail, due to the lock on A?

We left this up to the definition for each individual property.  There are
many ways to represent this.

For example:

<authors>
  <author>...</author>
  <author>...</author>
  ...
</authors>

or

<author>
  <elem1>...</elem1>
  <elem2>...</elem2>
  ...
</author>

or

<author>
  <list>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
    ...
  </list>
</author>
