I'll schedule a BOF at the next IETF meeting. If there's enough interest,
we can create a proposed charter and petition the area directors for a new
working group.

I'd definitely be interested in working on notifications.  We'd like
clients
to be able to know about events like the ones you suggest, plus:
 - new resource in collection I'm subscribed to
 - Access control change in resource I'm subscribed to
 - New version in VCR (similar to your update/last-modified event, perhaps
equivalent)

How do we proceed?
