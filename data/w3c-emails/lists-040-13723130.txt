There's a minor inconsistency in 2518: the spec says that the successful
response to a LOCK request creating a new lock MUST contain the "Lock-Token"
header (Section 8.10.1).  However, the example shortly after (section
8.10.8) does not contain that header -- instead, it shows the lock token in
the body.

Most clients seem to pull the lock token out of the body; does that mean the
header isn't required?
