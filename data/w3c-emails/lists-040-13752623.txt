I am very interested in holding a BOF on Web/WebDAV event notifications as
well. I agree that the way to avoid the IMPP pit is to keep this effort
tightly focused on Web notifications. Of course, if a General purpose Event
Notification Architecture were to emerge from this effort, so much the
better. However, this should not be the stated goal.

A BOF on event notification was held at the Chicago IETF meeting in August,
1998, the result of which was complete paralysis on this topic, due to many
factors. First, the effort was framed as a general-purpose EN facility, not
limited to just Web events. Next, since it was considered general purpose,
there was a lack of agreement on even where in the protocol stack this
effort should sit. There was not universal agreement that it was an
application layer protocol. Finally, we made the mistake of having too many
presentations, and not enough time for discussion, and I think that
prevented the formation of any form of consensus on the topic.

Some slides and notes from that period can be found at:

In particular, the agenda should be viewed as an example of what not to do,
since there was not enough time for discussion (and all of the talks ran
over their time slots).

As well, the program from the WISEN workshop (also held in 1998) has many
interesting EN slides.
