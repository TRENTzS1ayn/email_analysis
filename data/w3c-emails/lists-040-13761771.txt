Actually I think it's just an erratum in the example (which was 
prepared before the lock-token: header requirement went into the 
spec).  There has been ample prior discussion of this on the list 
(and I thought there was actually an issue about it): summary is 
that, in general (including non-exclusive locks), it's impossible for 
a client to determine from the body which lock token was granted.  So 
the lock-token: header *is* required.

Isn't there also an issue on the list saying that the lock-token 
should be required with UNLOCK?  There's the same problem there with 
specifying which token to UNLOCK when a client owns multiple locks on 
a resource.

I believe most clients currently look at the body to determine the 
token only because they have to :^).  Many olders servers (such as 
IIS 5.0) didn't return lock-token: headers.
