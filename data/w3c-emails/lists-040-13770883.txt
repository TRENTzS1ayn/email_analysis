All on this thread,

Let me boil this down to what I consider the essence of this thread.
This entire discussion on publish-Subscribe to notification of events, 
or the automatic enrollment in a notification event because of the user, 
e.g. owner, is the genesis of a workflow/lifecycle module within the 
WebDAV server.

Am I off base here? When you peel enough layers off of this discussion, 
isn't workflow/lifecycle at the heart of it? Except for the simple case 
where a single item is modified, but even that needs to have exceptions.

Kevin
