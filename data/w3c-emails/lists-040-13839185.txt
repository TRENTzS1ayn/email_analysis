I've updated the issues list to reflect the fact that we need to make some
obvious editing changes to the examples.

This issue is in the issues list....

MISSING_LOCK_TOKEN

Section 8.10.1 explicitly states that the response from a successful lock
request MUST include the Lock-Token header, yet the examples in 8.10.8,
8.10.9, and 8.10.10 aren't compliant with this requirement, and should be
updated.

And my recollection is the same as yours.  I think we established, in a
discussion lead by Jim Amsden a few years ago, that the header must be
included in the header for just the reason you stated.   Unless someone
speaks up in the next few days, I'll mark that as resolved as an obvious
editing correction to the spec.

J.
