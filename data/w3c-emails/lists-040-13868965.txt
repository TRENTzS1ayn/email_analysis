Clark Warner & I discussed doing this simple little draft at the Interop
event; well, now it's published.

If there's interest from other implementors (besides Xythos and Apple), I'm
happy to pursue standardizing this in some simple form.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: Quota and Size Properties for DAV Collections
Author(s): L. Dusseault, C. Warner
Filename: draft-dusseault-dav-quota-00.txt
Pages: 4
Date: 19-Sep-01

WebDAV servers are frequently deployed with directory quota (size)
limitations.  This Internet-Draft discusses the two properties and
minor behaviors needed to interoperably deal with quotas on WebDAV
repositories.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-dusseault-dav-quota-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
