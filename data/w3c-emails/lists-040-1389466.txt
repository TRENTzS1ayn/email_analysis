Hi all,

I'd like to add an extension to mod_dav that provides a live property that
can be queried/set, which corresponds to "executable" permissions in a
Unix file system. Joe Orton has also said he'd provide the corresponding
capability on the client. We just need to settle on How To Do It Right, so
I'll come here to ask... :-)

The scenario for this is uploading a CGI script. When the script is first
placed, it won't have the executable flags turned on. The client then
follows up with a PROPPATCH to turn the flags on.

So... I've got a few questions here:

* is there a more general semantic to use? e.g. all permission types
  rather than just executable?

* this doesn't really feel like an ACL -- this is actually stating "this
  resource should be executable", rather than adjusting who can interact
  (and how) with the resource

* should I place this into the DAV: namespace, or use a private one? (I'd
  use http://www.webdav.org/props/ if DAV: wasn't appropriate)

Other comments/suggestions appreciated, as always!

Cheers,
-g
