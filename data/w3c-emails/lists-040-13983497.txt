First of all, the previous statement should appear somewhere in the RFC, and
the examples should be adjusted to be compliant to this statement: for
instance, in 8.10.8 [1] the whitespace inside the href child element is not
preserved.

I would be interested to work on this definition. I think it's essential
that a server can provide enough information to a client to discover the
actual owner of a lock, no matter whether and what *his* client has
submitted as DAV:owner. First tests show that extending DAV:activelock with
new child elements didn't have any negative impact of MS Office and Adobe
GoLive.
