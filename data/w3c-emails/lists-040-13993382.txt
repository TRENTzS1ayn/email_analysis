Hi,

if for some reason a server doesn't have one of these timestamps for a
resource, what should it report on PROPFIND for these properties?

a) Property not found (HTTP 404),

b) Empty property (this seem to be backed by the wording in section 7.4 [1],
but is reported as error by Adobe GoLive,

c) Property silently suppressed (not reported at all) -- this seems to work
with GoLive.

In addition, how should the server behaviour upon a PROPFIND/propname on
this resource?

Julian
