How do you define "the actual owner of a lock" in an interoperable way?
What would a client do with that information?

Cheers,

I would be interested to work on this definition. I think it's essential
that a server can provide enough information to a client to discover the
actual owner of a lock, no matter whether and what *his* client has
submitted as DAV:owner. First tests show that extending DAV:activelock with
new child elements didn't have any negative impact of MS Office and Adobe
GoLive.
