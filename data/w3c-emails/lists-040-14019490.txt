Having a server capture and make available principal information
of this kind is a privacy and security problem, which is why
it is defined to be client controlled.  If a server ignores what
the client has requested, and stores more information
(or even just a different format), this could violate the user's
privacy/security wishes.

Cheers,
Geoff

a) The principal that requested the LOCK (if known).
b) It might provide a user with contact information.
