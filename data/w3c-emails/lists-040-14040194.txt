In general, I think WebDAV ties locks to resources.  I think this is
embodied in a few things we take for granted:

 - DELETE a resource, and its lock goes away.
 - LOCK a URI that doesn't have a resource, and DAV requires you to create
one (a LNR).

However, there's a statement in the spec that flies in the face of that: "A
successful MOVE request on a write locked resource MUST NOT move the write
lock with the resource. "

You could justify that exception by saying yes, in general, locks are tied
to resources but do not survive moves.  But does that work??  What if you
MOVE (or rename!) a collection that has locked or lock-null resources inside
it?  If you follow the logic that locks do not survive moves, then you must:
 - remove all the locks of all the children, including LNRs
 - remove the LNRs, now that their locks are gone

Does any server follow that behaviour?  Or are locks in practice preserved
on some or all MOVE operations?
