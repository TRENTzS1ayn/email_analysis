Geoff,

maybe it's obvious for people who constantly deal with these issues, but
many people blindly copy from examples, not knowing exactly what they do...
Of course properly declaring the charset is a Good Thing (and often
necessary), but then maybe the spec should come with a warning that the
charset declarations in the examples are just that -- examples -- and must
match the *actual* encoding used for the request/response bodies.

For instance:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<town>M?nster</town>

may look completely innocent -- until it appears within something which
actually is encoded in a different (and incompatible) charset. I guess this
mail will be transferred in some ISO encoding, so the XML fragment wouldn't
parse when given byte-by-byte to an XML parser, right?.

The examples in the specs generally don't need anything outside the ASCII
range, so maybe it would be wiser to leave out the encoding declarations
(and have a separate paragraph in RFC2518++ explain the issue).

(sorry for cross-posting to "both" lists).

Julian
