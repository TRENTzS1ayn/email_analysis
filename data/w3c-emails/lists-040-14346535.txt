Before we placed the charset parameter in *every* example of the
specification, I found that implementations were not including the charset
parameter at all. Since this would make it very difficult to correctly
implement i18n features later, I added the charset parameter to all
examples.  I still don't think that all implementations use the charset
parameter, or use it correctly, but I do believe it helped.

One thing I learned from the DAV specification was the large normative
effect the examples have.  Developers sometimes code to the examples, not
the specification.

I feel very strongly that the charset values should be left in the DeltaV
specification, with their current values. This is the form the specification
was approved as, and the form in which it passed last call. I would have
raised an issue during last call if these values were not in the
specification.

Furthermore, RFC 3023 ("XML Media Types") states that use of the charset
parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, and so if we do not use the charset
parameter, the burden of explanation clearly rests on showing why it is
better to omit it, than to include it.
