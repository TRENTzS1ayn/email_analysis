Wait-a-second. Do you say that there is a *requirement* to declare the
charset if we have text/xml, and the actual encoding is UTF-8 (or a subset
of that)? That would be new to me.

Correct.

Therefore I'd say put in an "xxx" both in the header and in the XML
declaration, and add a clear description about when and how it needs to be
set (the answer doesn't seem to be obvious after all...).

A good point, but this shouldn't stop us from discussing it for future
specs.

I agree that the specs should conform to RFC3023.

It seems that RFC3023 uses the quoted charset value as well. This seems to
conflict with my experience what the servlet API expects...
