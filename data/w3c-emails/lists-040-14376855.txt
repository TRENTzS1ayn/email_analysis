So, could you please clarify some more?

1) Both unquoted and quoted parameters are valid (according to HTTP 1.1)?
2) RFC3023 uses quoted parameters in it's examples, but unquoted parameters
would be OK as well?
3) Known broken implementations regarding quoted parameters are: ...

Yes. But my point is that an encoding declaration is only meaningful for a
given octet stream -- which we don't have in an example in an RFC. If these
declarations are in, they should come with a warning that this example
assumes that the request/response body actually *is* encoded in UTF-8 (or a
subset of it), and that otherwise it must match the actual encoding.

BTW: as XML parsers may reject any encoding other than Unicode (and
subsets), I'd also propose to add wording that request/response bodies
SHOULD be encoded in one of the standard XML encodings (or refer to a
section in RFC3023 that says that).

I've seen "WebDAV" implementations that send reponse bodies in
(properly-declared) Windows encodings (it is Hotmail) :-)
