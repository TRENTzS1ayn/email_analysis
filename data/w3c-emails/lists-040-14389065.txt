Well, the use of @lyra.org is completely historical. At that magical point
in the future, when I have all the time needed, I'd be moving
dav-dev@lyra.org to mod_dav@webdav.org or something. dav-announce@lyra.org
will become announce@webdav.org.

So... I'd say the mailing list should really be: ideas@webdav.org

That said: I'm a bit unclear on its charter, purpose, etc. But then again, I
don't need to be. :-)  A *volunteer* can be that person.

Ben, Eric? Somebody else? I would create a Mailman mailing list, set you to
be the admin for it, and let you set up the description and other parameters
for the mailing list.

Further, it would be great for somebody to maintain a subsection on
webdav.org that contains this information. Maybe /papers/ideas or
/other/ideas or something. Suggestions and volunteers?

Lastly, I need to add a link/page on webdav.org to the various mailing lists
related to webdav. This would be included among those.

Cheers,
