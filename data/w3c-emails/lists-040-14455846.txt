> Hi,

> due to the recent discussion on the ACL list, I have done a comparison of
> PROPFIND, (ACL/deltaV) REPORT and (DASL) SEARCH. My conclusions are:
>
> - There are three methods with partly overlapping features: PROPFIND
> (defined in RFC2518), REPORT (defined in the soon-to-appear
> deltaV RFC) and
> SEARCH (expired draft).
> REPORT and SEARCH seem to be almost identical in features -- both just
> define frameworks into which query/report grammars can be plugged in.
> - There doesn't seem to be anything in the DASL framework that couldn't be
> done with REPORT. In fact, query grammar (REPORT) discovery seems
> to have a
> more elegant solution.
>
> Proposal: drop work on DASL. Instead define an (extensible) equivalent of
> DAV:basicseach, with the following additional features:
>
> - discovery of searchable properties
> - discovery of supported constructs in the grammar
> - better signaling of execution errors (non-searchable properties, not
> recognized grammar constructs)
> - definition of a mandatory subset of query grammar features
>
> Publish this as separate RFC, or possibly move it into RFC2518++.
