Yes, that is why I proposed to make DAV:basicsearch a REPORT.

I think you partly missed my point.

Both REPORT and SEARCH define frameworks for pluggable query grammars /
reports. I really can't see where the distinction between reports and
searches you made is reflected in the specs.

However, the framework for REPORT is already there (almost in RFC form), and
I think it's technically superior (regarding discovery of query grammars /
reports). So my proposal is to drop the DASL *framework* and re-use the one
used in REPORT, and to update / modify DAV:basicsearch to become a report.
By dropping the requirement to define a framework for SEARCH, we save a lot
of time that can be invested much better on the actual DAV:basicsearch
grammar.

If you disagree, I'd like to understand why we need the SEARCH framework
when we already have REPORT.

Regards, Julian
