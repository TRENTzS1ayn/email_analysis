Well, I wouldn't *want* to treat it differently.

:-) So instead we're doing this with SEARCH?

I understand Jim's argument about SEARCH being independant of other WebDAV
features. I just fail to see why we couldn't use REPORT's framework which
already does what we need fopr XML-based query grammars.

SEARCH currently doesn't say anything specific about non-XML based query
grammars. It would be trivial to do the same with REPORT.

However, everybody who *did* implement SEARCH and DAV:basicsearch should
keep in mind that

- drafts are work-in-progress and
- that DASL will need to be fixed in some areas, so I don't think that a
finalized draft can be completely compatible to the one that's published.

In my opinion, DASL's way to do grammar discovery is broken (it reports
grammars as URIs, while they are really Qualified (XML) names). So this
needs to be replaced with something else anyway. The framework used for
REPORT doesn't have this problem, so why not use it?
