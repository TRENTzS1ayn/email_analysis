I think we have identified something that needs to be clarified in RFC2518:

Given a collection X, where the principal does have rights to list the
collection itself, but not it's members.

Currently our server will distinguish between depth 0 and 1, that is a
PROPFIND with depth 0 will report the collection (and it's properties) OK,
while a PROPFIND with depth 1 will result in something like:

<response>
<href>X</href>
<status>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</status>
</response>

This is because once a response element for X is available, there's no other
way to distinguish between the case where the collection actually is empty,
or the collection is non-empty, but the principal doesn't have the right to
list it's members.

Feedback appreciated.

Julian
