When security is so tight that people aren't allowed to even know 
about the existence or non-existence of members, these cases (a 
collection that's empty versus one that contains members "invisible 
to you") aren't supposed to be distinguishable.  To see this, 
consider the case where a collection has some visible and some 
invisible members (from a particular user's point of view): just the 
visible members should be listed.

But I think there's an entirely different spec issue here: whether or 
not DAV collections can hide the existence of members at all. 
Section 8.1 on PROPFIND says:

    Consequently, the multistatus XML element for a collection resource
    with member URIs MUST include a response XML element for each member
    URI of the collection, to whatever depth was requested. Each response
    XML element MUST contain an href XML element that gives the URI of
    the resource on which the properties in the prop XML element are
    defined.

This seems to require you either:

a. to list the members and then say 403 for any properties, or

b. to return 403 for any PROPFIND with depth > 0 on the containing collection.

Note that neither of these options meets the security requirements of 
"a user must not be able to determine whether or not a collection has 
a given member," but I don't think that 2518 intended to make it 
illegal for servers to enforce this kind of security.  So I think 
there is a spec issue here.
