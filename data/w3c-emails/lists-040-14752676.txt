Actually though your implementation -could- store the password on disk as
plain text - most do not; and it is technically not required. Some bad
implementations do store it plain - but (for example) the apache web
server stores the password as a hash (md5 or crypt) on the server side.

See http://cvs.apache.org -> apache-1.3 -> src/support/htpasswd.c and
src/support/htdigest.c to get an idea of the code).

So it is not a requirement - just an implementation choise.

It is true that with normal basic auth the password goes over the wire in
the clear; but with digest auth this is not the case.
