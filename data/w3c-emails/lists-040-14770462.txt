Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  I have added joe@manyfish.co.uk to
the accept2 list, so future email from this address will go straight
through.

Mmm; I think you are misunderstanding something? RFC2617 section 3.3:

   Note that the HTTP server does not actually need to know the user's
   cleartext password. As long as H(A1) is available to the server, the
   validity of an Authorization header may be verified.

Where H(A1) is just the MD5 of (user + ":" + realm + ":" + password)...
