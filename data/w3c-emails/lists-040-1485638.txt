As long as we have the DAV:reftarget property, the obvious thing to do is
allow clients to update its value.  If you want to get rid of that property,
as it seems you do from NoWebDAV#3, then I suppose we would need something
like an UPDATEREFTARGET method.

Maybe I just missed it but there doesn't seem to be any way to update the
target of a redirection resource without deleting it. I move that a
mechanism be provided that enables the target of a redirection resource to
be updated without having to delete the resource.
