Sigh, this debate has been going on for eight years.

There are two potential points of vulnerability for a password, in storage
and in transit.

If you have a system that protects the password in storage and in transit
then it can be used as a public key system, therefore any system based on a
symetric key alone cannot provide protection in both cases.

The reason I first proposed Digest Authentication is that the vulnerabilty
of a password in transit is considerably greater than the vulnerability in
storage for practically any conceivable network application. The original
Moris analysis of the one way encryption scheme in UNIX considered only the
vulnerability of stored passwords because networking was not common at the
time.

The original Moris analysis is in any case hopelessly flawed, in the
original paper the proposal is made that read protecting the password file
in addition to encryption is a bad idea and should be dimissed as 'security
through obscurity'. It took several generations of password crackers before
the UNIX sysadmin world silently abandoned that particular piece of nonsense
and started using shaddow password files.

At the time the proposal was made public key encryption was encumbered by
the Diffie-Hellman and RSA patents, hence there was a need for a symetric
key scheme designed to protect the key in transit.

The second issue the digest authentication design attempts to address is
limiting the risks involved in sharing passwords between sites.

The Basic authentication scheme, even over SSL is vulnerable to practically
every scenario in which the Digest scheme is vulnerable in addition to many
in which the Digest scheme is secure. If the attacker is presumed to have
read access to a critical systen file such as the password file it is
unreasonable to assume that the attacker cannot gain write access to the web
server executable, or for that matter gain access to whatever security
sensitive resource that was meant to be protected.


Today a much better approach than Digest Authentication would be to use a
federated authentication system such as SAML being standardized in the OASIS
standards group.
