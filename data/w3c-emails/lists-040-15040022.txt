Just thought of another example. The Apache server "supports" Digest
authentication, even though the process of enabling it involves installing a
new module (mod_auth_digest). In the case of Apache, it is possible to
create a  server that does not have any Digest authentication code in the
running server executable.

Thus, Apache is an existence proof of "supporting" Digest, while not
compromising security in environments where characteristics of the Digest
implementation are unacceptable.
