Now, are we having fun here or what?

I just scanned RFC 2617 for any MUST wording on digest authentication
and could not find any. The thing I found is in Ch. 4.1, 3rd paragraph:

  "Because Basic authentication involves the cleartext transmission
   of passwords it SHOULD NOT be used (without enhancements) to protect
   sensible or valuable information."

I think this is the way it should be stated for WebDAV as well, if it
must be stated at all.
