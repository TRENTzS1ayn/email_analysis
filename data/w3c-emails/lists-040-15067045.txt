Yes, we can configure the Livelink server to support Digest Authentication.

Just seems a bit silly to have a mandatory part of a spec, that will never
get used in practice because it is too insecure, but the only reason it is
mandatory is policy aimed at making specs more secure.

I suppose that we just have to resign ourselves to these types of realities
;-)
