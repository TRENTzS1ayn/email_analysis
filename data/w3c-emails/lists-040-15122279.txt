In any specification or standard, if you have two options
A or B that don't interoperate, you don't get an "interoperable"
standard if some people support A but not B, and other people
support B but not A.  The goal of standards is that there's
general interoperability.

So a server that only supports basic with SSL may be "secure
enough", but it's not "interoperable enough".

The standards group must choose a baseline that is both
"secure enough" and "interoperable enough". So far, the group
chose "must support Digest". If you change it to "must support
Digest OR basic+SSL" on the server side, then you're mandating
"must support Digest AND basic+SSL" on the client side.

This is nice for server implementors but maybe not as nice for
client implementors.
