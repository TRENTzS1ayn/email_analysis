You wouldn't want to tell clients that they have to respond to any
particular scheme, because a client might be used in a more restrictive
environment.

It is no trouble at all, however, to require _clients_ to support (really
support!) Digest if they support Basic, because there are no _client-side_
security parameters that Basic meets, but Digest doesn't.
