For some of our sites, replace *hard* with *impossible*.
We do not control the database of user names and passwords.
We do not have access to the password, a hashed form of it,
or anything. We can only supply details and get back details
about the user. Period. For these sites it is impossible to support
digest authentication. The customers in these cases *will not*
accept having a second copy of the user database. They went
to a lot of effort to get single sign on across the organisation.

This is my problem, not WebDAV's. I just thought it was worth
pointing out again. There was lots of discussion about how
you can store hashed versions of the passwords and so its safer
etc. However, in many large organisations there is a single
group controlling authentication etc and they fight tooth
and nail to keep that control - and often rightly so. If
security is important, you have to keep your security db
secure.
