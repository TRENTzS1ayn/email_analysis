Currently it says "WebDAV applications MUST support the Digest
authentication scheme".
Yours might be a nice clarification (is an application a client, a server or
both?), but we'd have to say something about servers as well.

What patented technology are you talking about?  In practice, SSL requires
RSA, but the patent has expired.   There are also plenty of unpatented
symmetric algorithms usable with SSL.  It's true that SSL is patented itself
by Netscape but they've released it for royalty-free use  (see rfc2246
appendix G.)  Is there still an issue with that?

Aside from the patent issues, we might consider whether it's now reasonable
to require WebDAV clients to support SSL.

I agree that it's too weak to say nothing or to say "authentication must be
supported"; for the reasons Larry outlines we need to specify which
mechanisms.
