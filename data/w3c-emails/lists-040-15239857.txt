Jim,

I think both address real-world needs, and non-proprietary solutions would
be welcome.

Yes. This could replace Microsoft's "Translate" header. However, it would
also need to address which set of live properties (src or dynamic) PROPFIND
is supposed to report.

See also the discussion in [1].

> The second is to introduce the MULTIPUT method to support "PUT with

Sounds good.
