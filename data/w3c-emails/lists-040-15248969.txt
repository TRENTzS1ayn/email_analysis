Why isn't GETSRC just a GET on the DAV:dst of the DAV:source property?
(If it is just a shorthand for this, I'm against the redundant marshalling
of this request through a new method).

As for MULTIPUT, that sounds fine to me, but it should be accompanied by
a MULTIGET, which would allow reading of a resource and its metadata in
one transaction.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: Ideas: GETSRC & MULTIPUT


I'm interested in the list's thoughts on two ideas for DAV improvements:

The first is to introduce a GETSRC method to support access to the
unprocessed source of a resource. This would decouple the dynamic response
of a resource (GET) from its static source (GETSRC).

The second is to introduce the MULTIPUT method to support "PUT with
PROPPATCH" scenarios. MULTIPUT would accept some subset of multipart MIME
packages and atomically write them to the server. This would support the
update of a resource and its metadata in one transaction.
