The source link didn't work. Telling people to use the source link is not,
IMO, productive.

GETSRC could be defined as something like, "returns to the client a
representation of the resource suitable for editing in an authoring client",
so we avoid issues of getting at the "true" state of the resource. GETSRC
wouldn't have the same caching properties as GET; I don't see that as being
a big problem for authoring.

So, which specific HTTP design principle(s) does this proposal violate?

I don't want to do arbitrary transactions, since that dramatically increases
the implementation burden. But I'd be happy to call it something different.
