These are very good questions.

One possible set of answers:

The dav:readsrc privilege.

> How would you get the properties of the "source" resource?

In this model it's not a different resource, so you'd use PROPFIND. If you
want information about the src, then dav:srccontentlength, dav:srcetag,
dav:srccreationdate, dav:srclastmodified... properties would need to be
defined.
