Under what conditions did it not work?  Do you mean just never implemented?

The one that calls for different resources to be accessed using different URI.
The set of source URI for some other URI are different resources.  Since
there can be many more than one source per representation, the notion of
creating a new method to avoid one indirection is just wrong.
