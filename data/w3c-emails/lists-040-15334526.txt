If you change the protocol to add GETSRC, then there is no point in
revising RFC 2518 -- it would have to recycle at Proposed.  I think it would
make more sense to have the server and client developers explain why they
did not implement it and then come up with a solution that they will implement.

I certainly don't want to implement a GETSRC method -- that instantly doubles
the server's access control complexity and response codes.
