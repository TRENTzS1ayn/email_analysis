My assumption is that revising 2518 will take some time. If a new mechanism
for getting access to the source link is developed, and sent to proposed in
a separate RFC, I suspect we could get two interoperable implementations
before the end of the 2518 revision period, and hence include the new
mechanism, since it too woul dbe at Draft status then.

I am all in favor of developing a solution client and server implementors
will code.

Other ideas?
