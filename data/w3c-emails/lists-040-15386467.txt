The fact that you can't do anything with the source is kind of specious.
You can view the "GET" method as "execute the OPEN action on this resource"
and GETSRC as the get (that gives you the data you just PUT into the
resource).  Anything other than GET that you do to the "source" resource
will operate in the same way as on the original resource, so I think that
using another resource is a poor model.

In general, I believe having distinct URL's for different resources
is far superior to defining new methods.  How would you set access
control on the "source" resource?  How would you get the properties of
the "source" resource?  If you have a URL for the source resource,
all this is straightforward ... but if you have something like a GETSRC
method, the only thing you can do with the "source" is get its content.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

I'd like to see how the DAV:dst in WebDAV can support what Microsoft is
doing with their Translate header (namely, having the source and the dynamic
content at the same URL).
