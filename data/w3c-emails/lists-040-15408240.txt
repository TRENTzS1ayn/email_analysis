   The fact that you can't do anything with the source is kind of specious.
   You can view the "GET" method as "execute the OPEN action on this
resource"
   and GETSRC as the get (that gives you the data you just PUT into the
   resource).  Anything other than GET that you do to the "source" resource
   will operate in the same way as on the original resource, so I think that
   using another resource is a poor model.

What about the "DAV:getcontentlength" property?
And the "last accessed" date?
And the "read" ACL (i.e. everyone that
can read the result can read the source)?
And for this kind of resource, you use GETSRC to retrieve what
you just PUT, while for most other resources, you use GET to
retrieve what you just PUT?

In many cases, page caching on the server
means that there commonly are two different files being stored
on the server.  And that sometimes the source file is not even
on the same server as the derived file.

The "separate resource" model seems pretty reasonable to me.

Cheers,
Geoff
