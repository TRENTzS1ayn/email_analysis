Geoff, I'm still not buying it.

This is actually kind of a stupid property for the generated content,
since it is usually impossible to know the length of the data that will
be output before actually generating it.

Is there a DAV: property for that?

Perhaps, GET should be restricted by a dav:get privilege, or else GET
should be restricted by a dav:execute privilege if the contents is 
generated.

GETSRC will always retrieve what you PUT.  GET is the equivalent of
a doubleclick on a file in windows--it runs some type-dependent "open"
functionality.

Caching generated output may or may not make sense, depending on how
that generation is done.  I think the stretch is treating generated
content as file.  Let's say my .jsp file generates my shopping cart
page from some rows in a database.  You generally don't know the 
length, modification date, or other normal file-like properties for
generated output.  The modification date of the shopping cart is the
time the last item in the cart was modified, and most database applications
don't track this on a per-row basis.
