Well, that's a hell of a lot easier to fix than to rewrite a standard and
all of the models upon which it is based.

Huh?  Then how are they going to handle the different access control and
behavior necessary for synthetic versus static resources?  You can't PUT to
a CGI script's synthesis URI and expect to edit the source because it is the
Common Gateway Interface, which necessarily requires that the PUT be gatewayed
through to the script itself.  Trust me on this one -- the notion of GETSRC
as you described it cannot be implemented on the Web.  That only makes sense
for files, not resources, and even then only files that do not contain any
subsidiary resources as inclusions.

So the solution is to make it impossibe to edit resources that consist of
multiple sources?  That'll really piss off my customer who has spent most
of this year creating a site that is entirely controlled by a content
management system, where each resource consists of a dynamic mapping to a
database entity catalog.  Each Web page consists of dozens of source elements.
It isn't using webdav right now, but it would be a shame if webdav couldn't
support existing CMS functionality.

If it doesn't support the Web, then it doesn't qualify for the name WebDAV.
Feel free to define yet another distributed filesystem protocol within any
other working group of the IETF.  I'd rather wait until it gets implemented
correctly than reduce the standard to something that doesn't meet the need.
