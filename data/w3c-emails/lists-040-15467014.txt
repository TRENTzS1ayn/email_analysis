This gets into the realm of renditions...

I agree with Geoff, alternative renditions of a resource should be different
URLs, however we should define mechanisms for creatung these renditions from
the original resource (perhaps the concept of a "master" resource and
related "renditions") and being able to determine the master and the
renditions from the properties on each.
