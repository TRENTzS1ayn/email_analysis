Following the working group's last call for comments, below is the
third and last part of a review of the Redirect Reference Resources
Protocol.  It covers chapters 12 to 24 of the protocol.

********

..., but its value it computed directly from the value of the target
resource.  Hence, I would call it a live property (rather than a
pseudo-property).  But why should this property not be expected to be
stored on the reference resource for (just hypothetically) e.g.
caching purposes?  Anyway, I would prefer to see the location property
and the target resource property to be made a single property, even if
that means not allowing a relative URI as value of a target resource.

This protocol can not make WebDAV applications, that are not aware
of this protocol, aware of any implication of this protocol.  Hence I
suggest to replace the phrase "WebDAV applications" by "applications
that implement this protocol".

I would like to suggest the term "directory" be replaced with
"collection".
In fact, this implication is not newly introduced in this protocol; it
holds for any protocol with hierarchical access paths (and hence
should not need to be mentioned in this protocol).

That would not be consistent with the concept of redirect references
as weak links (e.g. think of moving a resource to a different
location that is already the target of some redirection reference).

This protocol is an extension for WebDAV; hence the above paragraph is
redundant.

A little typo.

Once again, this is redundant.  Why not just saying:

"This specification does not introduce any new string that is
displayed to users as part of normal, error-free operation of the
protocol.  For error reporting, rationales on internationalization
considerations and advice for application implementors, see [WebDAV]."

As this protocol is an extension to WebDAV, I think it is sufficient
to mention that this protocol does not need any new considerations to
be applied.

See the comments in part one of this review on referencing the
bindings protocol.

It may be worth noting that, in contrast to what the headline says,
this element is not an extension to the WebDAV DTD, but a replacement
for the WebDAV DTD element with the same name.
