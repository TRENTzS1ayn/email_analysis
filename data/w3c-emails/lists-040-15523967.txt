I know a little bit about the philosophical design, hope this helps.

The "Translate" header is a bit of a mis-nomer.  You could probably more
accurately call it "Author-Mode" and switch the true/false values.

When Translate is not present, or Translate: F, it means the client is a
browser, or an authoring client in browsing mode.  The HTTP/WebDAV should
therefore apply appropriate transforms, such as generating dynamic content.

When Translate: T is in the request, it means the client is in authoring
mode.  The most clearly affected method is GET because the source is
returned instead of the transformed result, but the header is actually sent
on all requests from the client at this time.  This means that a server is
potentially capable of using the Translate header to decide how to calculate
'getcontentlength' in response to a PROPFIND -- it may even be possible to
calculate the length of the source when Translate is True and the length of
the generated content when Translate is False.

I believe that for many methods (COPY, MOVE) the behaviour is the same
whether Translate is T or F.  Note however that the information about what
mode the client is in is still there, should the server ever need to make a
distinction between two behaviours on the basis of whether the client is
authoring or not.

Obviously this doesn't work directly for CGI scripts or (this is the
Microsoft solution after all) ISAPI.  I think it's possible to turn on
WebDAV access to the files that compose one of these types of Web plugins,
but since the model is more file access than Web access, these would have
different URLs and there might not be a clear way of seeing the link between
the dynamic URL and the source URLs.  Still, there hasn't been clear demand
from customers for shared authoring of these types of things right on the
Web server -- I'd suspect most serious Web programming teams would use a
real source server, perhaps a staging sever, and a production server, all
with different URLs.
