Actually this isn't the only time that Jim and others have taken pictures.
Obviously along with the mail archives, the draft archives, the paper
archives and the WebDAV book of why, we need a picture archive!

Of course you can only say Yaron of Microsoft for so long. As of Friday I
will no longer be working for Microsoft. It has been a total blast
representing Microsoft's interests in the IETF. Future questions about
Microsoft and WebDAV should go to Alex Hopmann (alexhop@microsoft.com), Josh
Cohen (joshco@microsoft.com) and Henrik Frystyk Nielsen
(henrikn@microsoft.com).
