GET already provides that -- if you can successfully invoke PUT on a
resource, then a GET on that same resource will be the stuff that you PUT
(assuming no other actions occurred in-between).

However, PUT is not allowed on many resources, specifically those resources
that only exist as a synthesis of other resources.  The source links, which
were present in the original HTTP/1.1 proposal and later transformed into
a property in 2518, tell the client how it can edit that resource given that
authoring on the same URI is not possible, period.
