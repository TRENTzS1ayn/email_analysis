It is theoretically possible for a synthetic resource to be edited by
GET and PUT of its representation, assuming that the server is smart
enough to derive the individual source changes from the modified
representation.  However, that is not an issue, since from the client's
perspective it seems to be editing a static representation.  The whole
point of the source links is to allow the server to tell the client
that "Hey, I'm not smart enough to figure out editing on this interface,
you need to go over to this list of things and edit them individually."
That is a condition of interoperability that is necessary to communicate
between the server and client due to the nature of Web resources.

There are other conditions in which the source URI would differ from the 
"normal" GET URI, such as when authoring is only allowed on a staging
server.  In those cases as well, a GETSRC method or Translate header field
simply will not work.  I cannot understand why it would even be considered.

I am sure that the RFC can be improved to spell this out in more detail,
but that is not unusual for this stage of the standardization process.

It doesn't say that, and nothing I said implies it would.  You are reversing
the implication of what I said, which isn't valid logic.
