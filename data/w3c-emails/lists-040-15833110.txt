[ moving this to the w3c-dist-auth list, where discussion belongs. a poll on
  the interop list is fine, but no more than that. ]

Before continuing further on this discussion, you should read the thread
that just occurred on the webdav working group list. See:

and the replies...

You're free to disagree with me :-)

I've used it myself, and the multiple resource model works quite fine.
Through one namespace, I get the output. Through another, it is read/write
and I can edit the source.

So I maintain that today's WebDAV *can* edit non-static pages.

Now, if the clients could simply read the DAV:source element, then it make
things even easier.

The DAV:source element referring to a separate namespace. Go read that
thread that I referred to at the top of this email.

If you "do not know what they are", then you cannot make that claim. So
don't even try, please.

Separate resources for the source and for the generated output means that
you can apply *better* security. One resource is open to everybody, and the
other resource is locked up tight.

Microsoft has nothing to do with this. WebDAV has a design for this today,
and it works. The Translate header has numerous problems. In particular, I
like Roy Fielding's and Geoff Clemm's responses in the referenced thread;
they make pretty strong/clear points about the issue.

Existing implementations of a poor solution does not make it a good
solution. We're here to make good standards, not to simply follow what
somebody has done to work around a problem.
