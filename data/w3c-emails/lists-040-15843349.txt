It seems that I just ran into a problem with Web Folders and wondered if
anybody else has seen this. Or if my assumptions are mistaken :-)

I set a property on a file like so:

    <prop3 xml:lang="de">x</prop3>

There is no default namespace defined. When I select "Properties" in a Web
Folder, it pops up an error dialog saying "Unable to display properties."

I've narrowed it down to exactly this property. Just setting this one single
property on a file will do it.

Has anybody else seen this? Or duplicate it?

The User-Agent is "Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV 1.1"

Cheers,
