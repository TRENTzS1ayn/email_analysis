I never got them working as well...
Nor visualisation of extending props, nor setting of standard props like attribs...

The Webfolder does simply not show them. So if anyone has a working sample 
for a PROPFIND with depth 0 please send it in...

But I even tried this with an IIS and the setting of props was not supported ether...
