Mathias sent this directly to me. I believe it was intended to go back to
the list. I've CC'd the main DAV list since this is turning from a quick
poll about interop into a discussion of approaches.

SimpleCMS does support it, as well as the source/link way of doing it.

No, it isn't. translate and source/link solve different problems. WebDAV
emulates a file system layer. So my clients expect _one_ source file.
Everthing else is nice-to-have, and may be very powerfull for some uses,
but is obviously wrong for a simple: give me _this_ resource,
untranslated.

As for SimpleCMS, we could well use the both approaches for different
reasons (we do not right now).

Situation: every page is transformed on-the-fly, using a menu-module,
and possible background, logo etc. resources. 

So, where should the source link(s) point to? The complete solution: 
- a raw version of the url in question
and probably
- a menu vonfig page, where the current menu style is choosen (or the
  menu program module??)
- the background gif
- the logo, if used
- any sub-dir logos, if used
- possible many more resources.
- if it's a database generated pag: possible pointers to the raw table
  data, too.

Very powerfull, potentially very usefull, but tell me: how should a
network redirector like WebIFS show this mess to the user??


Instead, the translate header would just say: give me _this_ url,
untranslated. No questions what this means. One resource. No choice (no
power, too :). Easy to realize, consistent with the file system model,
and easy to explain to the user.

So: source link are nice and powerfull and may be used for advanced
purposes, but are simply not the same as translate. 

Use both.


Just my two cents

Cheers, Mathias
