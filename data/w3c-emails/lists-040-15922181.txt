My standard response to everyone who suggests that it is
too complicated for a client to make sense of multiple source
fields is: adopt the convention that the first link is the
most important one, and just show that one.

Some of the points made in the WebDAV thread against using
headers to control what GET does:

One very common mechanism for doing Web-based access control
is to base the access control on the URL (i.e. what you can do
to a resource depends on what the URL is).  Using any header
(such as the Translate header) breaks any scheme like this.

When you do a COPY, should it go against the raw form or
the processed form of the resource?  Probably need the Translate
header for that then too.  Similarly for any other method that
could reasonably be applied to both the raw and the processed form.

So all that is needed is for the server to be able to dummy up
some URL that means "the raw form of this resource" to avoid all
these issues.  That does not seem like an unreasonable burden on
the server implementor.  Similarly, I don't think it is an unreasonable
burden on a client writer to do one extra roundtrip to retrieve a
tree of source images (i.e. one Depth:infinity PROPFIND to retrieve
all the links for a tree).

Cheers,
Geoff

Mathias sent this directly to me. I believe it was intended to go back to
the list. I've CC'd the main DAV list since this is turning from a quick
poll about interop into a discussion of approaches.

SimpleCMS does support it, as well as the source/link way of doing it.

No, it isn't. translate and source/link solve different problems. WebDAV
emulates a file system layer. So my clients expect _one_ source file.
Everthing else is nice-to-have, and may be very powerfull for some uses,
but is obviously wrong for a simple: give me _this_ resource,
untranslated.

As for SimpleCMS, we could well use the both approaches for different
reasons (we do not right now).

Situation: every page is transformed on-the-fly, using a menu-module,
and possible background, logo etc. resources. 

So, where should the source link(s) point to? The complete solution: 
- a raw version of the url in question
and probably
- a menu vonfig page, where the current menu style is choosen (or the
  menu program module??)
- the background gif
- the logo, if used
- any sub-dir logos, if used
- possible many more resources.
- if it's a database generated pag: possible pointers to the raw table
  data, too.

Very powerfull, potentially very usefull, but tell me: how should a
network redirector like WebIFS show this mess to the user??


Instead, the translate header would just say: give me _this_ url,
untranslated. No questions what this means. One resource. No choice (no
power, too :). Easy to realize, consistent with the file system model,
and easy to explain to the user.

So: source link are nice and powerfull and may be used for advanced
purposes, but are simply not the same as translate. 

Use both.


Just my two cents

Cheers, Mathias
