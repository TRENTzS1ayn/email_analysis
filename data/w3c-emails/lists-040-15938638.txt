Our server currently supports the Translate header (because it's supported
by Microsoft). However, experience shows that the way it's defined (or not
defined, lacking any official documentation) I really problematic.

For instance, PROPFIND currently will behave differently depending on the
Translate header -- in the default case, the server will (try to) report the
properties of the dynamic content (and in many case will fail to do so, for
instance for the content length). This basically means that we're forcing
clients to supply a proprietary and under-specified header to get at the
'real'  (static) information.

It seems that having different URLs for different things is the way to go,
however, the DAV:source property should

a) have better documentation,

b) be easier to act upon by a user client (see proposal in [1])
