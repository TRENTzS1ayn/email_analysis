Hi Dan,

could it be that you misunderstand the MULTIPUT as a
PUT of more than one file? The MULTIPUT was meant as
an atomic update of a resource and its related meta
data.

Regards,
Herbert

Am I the only one who gets queazy about MULTIPUT?  We have well
implemented DIR and COPY commands in DOS that accept multiple
parameters.  Why not just extend PUT and GET to accept multiple
parameters?

Perhaps I'm a bit late with my comment but I just now read
Jim's suggestions. Especially the MULTIPUT feature is
one that I missed very very much when I recently read RFC2518
and tried to map the functionality of our systems to WebDAV.
I think MULTIPUT is vital for many scenarios and it is
quite easy to implement on the server side but extremely
hard if not impossible on the client side.

Please, please add this feature to WebDAV. I'm sure its
desperately needed. And many thanks to Jim for triggering
this.

Regards,
Herbert

I'm interested in the list's thoughts on two ideas for DAV improvements:

The first is to introduce a GETSRC method to support access to the
unprocessed source of a resource. This would decouple the dynamic
response
of a resource (GET) from its static source (GETSRC).

The second is to introduce the MULTIPUT method to support "PUT with
PROPPATCH" scenarios. MULTIPUT would accept some subset of multipart
MIME
packages and atomically write them to the server. This would support the
update of a resource and its metadata in one transaction.
