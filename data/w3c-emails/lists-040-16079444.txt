OK.  Sounds like a plan.  Thanks for clarifying that.  If we have that
many names to play with, we could have a separate method for package
size. ;) Just kidding, thanks again.

My concern with re-using PUT is that existing servers typically take the
request entity body and write it byte-for-byte into a file. They do
*not*
check to see if it is a multipart package, instead they happily write
bytes,
and return a 200 or 201 (the same codes a multipart-augmented PUT would
return).

So, I think overloading PUT would result in poor interoperability.

- Jim

PS - It's OK to define new methods. Sure, the method name space is flat.
But, even if you limit method names to 10 characters, that's still 32^10
possible name combinations, of which we have used around 25.
