1)  I agree that the xmlns:D="DAV:" is kind of off-putting.  "DAV:" is a URL
with the "DAV:" protocol identifier, which is never used anywhere else, not
another namespace.  This is the way RFC2518 is defined, and I guess the goal
was to define the shortest possible namespace URL
for the "D" namespace prefix.  You get used to it.

2)  Are you complaining about the lack of mapping between the ACL privileges
and HTTP methods?  Would you be happier if it were specified that the "GET"
method for example must be restricted by "DAV:read" and the "PUT" method
must be restricted by "DAV:write"?  This issue has come up
before, and while I remember that there was some reason not to do so
(because I think some HTTP methods may be restricted by different privileges
depending on other context, e.g. POST), I'm not sure that's not a good
reason to specify things for the methods that we do map.

3)  POST is not necessarily appending to a resource.  I consider it more of
an "execute" command than anything else.

I think access control in the scenarios you describe may well be constrained
by server-defined privileges, and the general intent of the protocol is that
this is what would be done.  I can define privileges like "Sign GuestBook"
for a particular resource if I want to restrict that.
