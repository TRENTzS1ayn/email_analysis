A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV Access Control Protocol
Author(s): G. Clemm, A. Hopkins, E. Sedlar, J. Whitehead
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-acl-07.txt
Pages: 59
Date: 12-Nov-01

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and message bodies 
that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed 
Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to read and modify 
access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny 
operations upon a resource (such as HTTP method invocations) by a given 
principal.

or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-acl-07.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
