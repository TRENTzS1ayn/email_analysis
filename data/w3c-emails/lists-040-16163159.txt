Hi,

I'd suggest to extend section 10 to make a few statements about content type
and encoding of request/responses.

In particular,

- MUST support text/xml,

(because it's what all examples have been using since RFC2518)

- SHOULD accept application/xml,

(because it makes more sense than text/xml)

- when text/xml is used and the encoding is not US-ASCII, the charset MUST
be declared in the content type

(as per XML media types RFC2376),

- the bodies MUST be encoded in UTF-8 or UTF-16.

(because XML processors are not required to support anything else).


(of course this is not really an ACL issue, but ACL would be the first
WebDAV spec to clarify this).
