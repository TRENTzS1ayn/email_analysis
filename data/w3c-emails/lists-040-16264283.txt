Im having a problem with a webclient for uploading (PUT) and
downloading(GET) files and folders to an IIS server.  The problem is, the
application runs great until it has to upload an ASP file(.asp).  The status
returned is just forbidden I've been around the block on this about ten
times and cant find a way around it.  Code in vb but have tried javascript
also with same problem.  Also can write to file on server if file is
specified as a .txt URI.  Little prolems that causing big fuss.



    Dim WinHttpReq As New WinHttp.WinHttpRequest
    Dim data() As Byte, bSuccess As Boolean, lStatus As Long

    Upload = False
    If gbGUI Then formMain.Display ("Upload File: " & sFilePath & "..")

    data() = ReadBinFile(sFilePath, bSuccess)

On Error GoTo Err_H

    If Not bSuccess Then GoTo Err_H

    WinHttpReq.Open "PUT", sURL, False
    WinHttpReq.Send data()
