Hi,

I see that the WebDAV bindings protocol specification completed a last call
for
comments.  Does anyone know the timeframe/schedule for getting this draft
approved
as a "Proposed Standard"?

I am currently reading through this draft with some other folks from MERANT,
we will also look at the open issues list etc.  So we will probably have
some input/comments on this specification in the next couple of weeks.

Regards,
