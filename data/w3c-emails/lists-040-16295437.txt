Wow, that's annoying!

It seems to me that fixing RFC2396 to allow an empty opaque_part would be
best, unless someone can recall any rationale for disallowing it in the
first place.  It looks quite arbitrary.

Note that even if IETF changed the DAV namespace, you still couldn't write a
meaningful schema for WebDAV, because schema languages don't recognize the
odd naming convention that RFC2518 adopts in 23.4.2 (Meaning of Qualified
Names).

If anything is going to be done to change the basic XML structure of WebDAV,
it would be a good time to fix 23.4.2 as well.

What I really _don't_ want to see is everyone doing <dp:ropertyupdate
xmlns:dp="DAV:p"> to get conformance to all 3 specs.
