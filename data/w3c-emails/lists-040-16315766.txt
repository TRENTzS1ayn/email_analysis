OK -- how *should* this element be represented in DTD language?

Which is the offending element. This looks OK to me.

It was certainly my and Yaron's position that the ordering rules of XML
didn't apply when sending XML across the wire. That is, the ordering rules
make sense when you're doing markup of documents, but do not when you're
sending a set of protocol elements where semantically the order of arrival
is not meaningful. However, reading through RFC 2518, it appears we never
explicitly stated this. It is certainly implied in the fact that we do not
require validity, but only well formedness.  Well-formed XML does not
necessarily adhere to the ordering given in a specific DTD.
