It seems reasonable to me to add this text. I'd also go further, and
explicitly note that validating requests and responses is generally a bad
idea. IETF protocols should be strict in what they send, liberal in what
they accept. Strict checking of a DAV message for validity is more stringent
than is necessary to interpret the meaning of the message. It has been my
experience that implementations that do require strict validity tend to be
much less interoperable, since they tend to reject XML that most other
implementations accept without any problem. This is why the DAV spec. has
never required anything more than well formedness.
