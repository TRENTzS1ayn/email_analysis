Well, that's the only example I've seen in use.

Should I take that to mean only namespaces can have ":" in the tag name?
That would explain a lot.

Yes, but those will presumably be in another (well-formed) namespace.

Isn't it reasonable to have a default namespace in the property model?

I didn't say it did.  I said that treating DAV: as both a namespace and a
URI scheme is wrong (and confusing).  The reasons for doing so at the time
were because xmlns was being developed (slowly) at the same time as WebDAV.

Then it sounds to me like the xmlns attribute does not contain a URI.
It contains a URI prefix.

Yeah, it says that we never considered that someone would try to use the
grammar incorrectly within a specification.  We naturally assume that
people want the value to be a URI if they say it contans a URI.

I don't see that as being resolved, unless the WG is going to bite the
bullet and follow Tim's recommendation.
