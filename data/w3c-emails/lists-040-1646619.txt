Agreed.

Maybe I'm missing something but wouldn't the results for a PROPFIND on all
the redirect resources be a 300 and wouldn't that 300 contain the redirect
target? Isn't that the same information that would have been contained in
the DAV:reftarget element? Doesn't that therefore mean that there is no loss
of efficiency?

Actually, there is no reason why you can't define a DAV:reftarget token for
use with DASL. As I discuss in one of my points DASL can search on anything
with a name, what is being searched does NOT have to be something
retrievable through a PROPFIND.

I admit to not understanding this one. How does the use of relative or
absolute URIs in the protocol effect how information is stored at either the
client or the server? Perhaps an example would help.

Always a pleasure.
