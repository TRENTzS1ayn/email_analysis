The definition is broken. It doesn't work. See [1].

No, it doesn't.

How do you encode the local name? Given an arbitrary URI, how do you select
base URI and element name? ...and so on. It doesn't work.

I would care more if there is a single server implementation that actually
implements keepalive. Is there?

Ideally, the whole behaviour of copying live/dead properties needs to be
redefined, I think.
