Well, it's not WebDAV's business to mess around with bases for
namespaces. Namespaces don't currently use XML Base, and probably
they won't in the future. There was an extensive discussion of
whether namespace uris could be relative uris, and the conclusion
as far as I remember was that it should be discouraged.
