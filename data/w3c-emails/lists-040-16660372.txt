I think this should read: historically, in the development of WebDAV, there
was a phase where the spec assumed the existence of a mapping like this. I
don't think that RFC2518 as published does this.

I don't think that these actually *are* requirements. At least not according
to RFC2518.

Is there any (published one) that works well with arbitrary namespace names
and element names?
