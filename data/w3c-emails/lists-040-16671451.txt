I believe that when we revise 2518, that that the
new DAV:allprop behavior should be defined to be
"all live properties defined in RFC 2518 plus all
dead properties".  Since 2518 states that it is *all*
properties (both live and dead), making this direction
clear now will allow clients to rely on dead+2518
properties.

Cheers,
Geoff

How do you know you can get all the dead properties?  'allprop' as defined
in RFC2518 seems to have to change, yet we've not clearly defined a new
behaviour.  In the meantime, I don't believe clients can rely on getting
anything back in 'allprop' except the live properties defined in RFC2518.
