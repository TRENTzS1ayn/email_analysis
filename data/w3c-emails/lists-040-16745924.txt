To encode a general local name, you use UTF8 encoding and %xx escapes, as
recommended in section B.2.1 of the HTML spec.

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.1

To get the namespace URI and local name from a property URI, just scan
backwards for the last '#', '/', or ':', and split the URI.  If the left
part ends in #, then remove it.

Sort of.  Depending on the context, our server can either satisfy any
keepalive request, or it cant satisfy any keepalive request.  In the latter
situation, we fail the copy if keepalive is specified.

But a server doesn't have to implement keepalive to be broken by changing
the content model -- it only has to validate requests.
