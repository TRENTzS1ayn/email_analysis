I think it might help people to better understand the set of possible
solutions to this issue if I point out that WebDAV implementations are NOT
going to support any change that leads to a reduction in interoperability.

So, for example, any suggestion that begins, "just change WebDAV's namespace
identifier to ...." is not going to work.

Complain to me all you wish about this -- you'll just be shooting the
messenger.
