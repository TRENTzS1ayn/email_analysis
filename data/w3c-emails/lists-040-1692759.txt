The main contention in Judy's comments is that implementing the section 10
rules isn't that bad because you can always do a hash look up first on a
name and if you don't get a hit then you can begin the segment by segment
walk. I disagree with the assessment that the cost is trivial. Every single
time a URL mis-hits the server will be forced to spend time walking all of
its segments in order to figure out if the URL may point to a redirect
resource. The cost of processing a bogus URL has gone from O(1) to O(N).
That makes it very easy to use bogus URLs as a denial of service attack.

This all begs the issue, BTW, of the fact that the design means that
processing URLs correctly pointing to redirect resources will cost O(N).

All this having been said, as I indicate below, I understand why the authors
want to make redirect resources behave as they have specified and I am
sympathetic to their goals. I think the best compromise is for us to create
two types of redirect resources (created by two different methods). One type
is a simple HTTP redirect resource. No fancy namespace rules. No section 10
behavior. All it does is blindly return a 302 to a certain value, that is
it. It doesn't matter if it is in a WebDAV namespace or not. It just returns
a 302. Then we create a complex HTTP redirect resource with section 10
behavior. People who want to take on the O(N) costs associated with it are
free to do so. But let's not penalize WebDAV implementers who just want a
simple 302 by forcing a O(N) solution on them.

As for my comment regarding paragraph 3 of section 10, I agree with Judy's
comment that my analysis is flawed and so remove my comment.

and I would love to see option 2 as listed there adopted. Failing that the
authors must adopt option 1 and change the draft. Either way, I move that
the authors must address this issue based on the requirements placed in
Yaron.NoSlash. 

<js> I don't think this does raise the same issue.  All we are doing here is
making sure that you don't end up with a URL that has 2 consecutive slashes
in the middle somewhere. </js>
