Roy,

In response to your comments about the nature of resources, we plan to
remove from the binding spec all language that suggests that resources are
storage entities.  We think that otherwise, the spec is consistent with the
view that a resource is a mapping function.

We will change the definition of binding to state explicitly that it is not
a resource, but is rather part of the state of a collection resource.
Although I think this conflicts with your position, it at least makes our
position clearer.

Will these changes allay your concerns, or do we need to do further work?

--Judy
