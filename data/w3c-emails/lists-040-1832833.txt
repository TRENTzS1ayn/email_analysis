Almost.  Anything that is identifiable by a URI is a resource, which
pretty much covers everything that can be identified as a concept.
So, you are better off not explicitly saying that a binding is not
a resource.  What you want to say is simply that the target of the
bind requests is the collection resource, and the bindings are considered
to be part of the state of that collection for the purposes of those
requests.  Whether or not those bindings identify a resource, or are
resources in themselves, is not relevent during the scope of the
client/server conversation.
