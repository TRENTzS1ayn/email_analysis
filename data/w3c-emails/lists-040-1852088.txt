I disagree that an O(N) cost on error should cause us to eliminate
behavior that is both useful and expected by clients (at least, by
clients used to file-system implementations of redirect references,
such as sym-links on Unix).

First, the "N" here is very small (5, 10, not 1000).  Second, it is
likely that servers will have to do this anyway when ACL's are
introduced (you will have to check if you have a READ ACL to each
collection in the path).  And finally, the cost of doing this lookup
is likely to have been so optimized by the underlying system 
that the total cost will be minimal in any case.

Cheers,
Geoff
