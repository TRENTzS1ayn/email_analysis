I'll answer Edgar's question immediately, since it is nice and short ...
I will respond to Yaron's post later since it is nice and long (:-).
But my answer to Edgar and my response to Yaron have the same basis,
namely that when I said "a lock is on a URL", I was really saying a lock
"acts" like it is on a URL.  The fact that a lock is *really* on a
resource is detailed in the GULP (Grand Unified Locking Proposal).
In particular, it is really on the first WebDAV collection encountered
on the path.  It is then just inherited by resources below.

But before this goes too much farther, I should state that GULP was
a somewhat academic exercise to develop a complete model that would
provide consistent answers to all the depth locking, null resource
locking, and URL protection issues that have arisen on the mailing
list.

My conclusion is that we just have to simplify.  In particular, I believe
we have to keep URL protection, but that depth locking and null resources
must go in order to have a locking model that will be be implementable
and understandable in conjunction with protocol extensions such as bindings
and versioning.

And in a Simple LOcking Proposal (SLOP :-), locks will be back to being
on resources, which Yaron will like, until he hears that this means that
a lock should move with a resource when that resource is MOVE'd, which
he will vigorously protest against (if he has time to do so :-).

Cheers,
Geoff
