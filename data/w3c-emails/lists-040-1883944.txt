I don't think that the "method for each variant of each operation"
scales.  I can think of 4 or 5 groups that would like to pick SUBSCRIBE
to mean something slightly different.  One of the advantages of live
properties is that they have a built-in namespace mechanism.  I agree
that this will mean that servers will need two extra dispatch points
(i.e. in PROPFIND and PROPPATCH), but I believe that is a small price
to pay in order to avoid name collisions as more extensions to WebDAV
are developed.

Note: there currently are few enough WebDAV extensions, that I could get
the names I want for bindings, redirect references, and even versioning,
but I can already the cursing of subsequent protocol developers
as they discover that all the meaningful method names in their domain
have been used by the first wave of protocol developers. 

Cheers,
Geoff
