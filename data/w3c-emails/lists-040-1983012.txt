Every concept is referenceable, so your definition would
make the term "resource" a synonym for the term "concept".
This makes the term "resource" useless, since
the term "concept" is well defined, and adding a synonym
for it does not buy us anything.

An alternative definition is that a resource is a function
that can be associated with a URI, where the input to this
function is a method name, a request URI, a list of headers,
and a request body, and the output is a list of headers and
a response body.  (I pretty much copied this definition from
one of your earlier posts, so I make no claim of originality
here).

In this alternative definition, all sorts of concepts are not
resources ... in particular, a method name is not a resource,
a header is not a resource, a request or response body is not
a resource, and a URI is not a resource.

I believe this alternative definition is far more useful for
defining a binding protocol.  I'm willing to use some other
term for this alternative concept, if it is important to reserve
"resource" as a synonym for "concept", but my impression is
that this alternative definition is the more commonly accepted
one.

Cheers,
Geoff
