Is this really "cannot" or just "currently do not".  I understand that
the underlying file system lock has whatever semantics it has, and is
unlikely to change, but could not the HTTP MOVE method be defined to
re-establish the lock following the move?

Yes, I agree that the lock token must be included in the request
in order for the MOVE to succeed.  The question of whether only
the "lock owner" can use the lock token is a separate one that is
the topic of a different thread.

I'll take that bet ...  loser buys dinner at the next IETF
meeting (:-).
