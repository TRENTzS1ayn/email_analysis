I mean anything that can be represented.  Mostly nouns (is a color
a noun or an adjective, or both -- I can't remember, but I do know
it can be represented as a resource).

What makes you think that those can't be identified as URLs and used
by HTTP?  Keep in mind that HTTP is a gateway protocol that is
capable of infinite redirections.

If I define

   whoswho:/people/leaders/USA/federal/President/now

to mean the current President of the United States, then I can define
an HTTP service that accepts requests for that namespace and responds
with a representation of the current President.

Remember:

   1) HTTP transfers representations, not resources;

   2) The resource defines the semantic mapping between requests
      and representations;

   3) The implementation of this mapping has nothing whatsoever
      to do with the semantics of the resource UNLESS the specific
      URI in question identifies an implementation itself as a resource;

   4) Many resources can only be manipulated by a subset of HTTP methods.
