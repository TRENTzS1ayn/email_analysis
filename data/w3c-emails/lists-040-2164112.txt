HTTP URLs aren't case sensitive, but some resources are. For example, Java
source managed by a WebDAV server must retain the case in the package and
class names or the code won't compile. mod_dav foldes all resource names to
lower case, so .java files on the server won't compile.

It seems that WebDAV could, like HTTP, be case insensitive while at the
same time require that the server retain the case of resource URLs. That
is, the URL segments in the bindings would retain the case in the target
when it was entered, but access to those resources would be case
insensitive. If this is not the case, WebDAV can't be used to store Java.
That would be a real bummer!

Would the proposal above be acceptable, and in the spirit of HTTP?
