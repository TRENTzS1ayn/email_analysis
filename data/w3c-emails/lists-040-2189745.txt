Greg,
This is great. I didn't have an HTTP spec in front of me when I wrote the
note (need to get one by the bed I guess). We're probably running into the
MSFT problem. Maybe this doesn't happen on Windows2000 which seems to leave
you file names alone a little better. I'll investigate.

RFC 2616, S3.2.3 states "When comparing two URIs to decide if they match
or not, a client SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of
the entire URIs, with these exceptions: ..."

In other words: they *are* case-sensitive.

Apache certainly treats them that way. Try these two URLs:

? http://www.webdav.org/other/proxy.html
?http://www.webdav.org/other/Proxy.html

You'll find the latter fails.

Note that HTTP servers running on an MSFT platform typically treat URLs in
a case-insensitive fashion (due to the filesystem being insensitive).

WHAT?!! ?mod_dav does NOT do any case-folding. Euh... what made you think
it does?

No and no. ?(IMO)

I certainly do not want to take the performance hit to start doing
case-insensitive work in mod_dav and Apache. I am in great favor of
continuing to operate in a case-sensitive fashion, and I believe the
relevant RFCs encourage that, too.
