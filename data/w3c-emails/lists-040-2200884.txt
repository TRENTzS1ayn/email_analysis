It's certainly a possibility.

The only problem I can see with relying on MKREF is that it would not just
update the target, but would replace the resource with a new resource.
That's probably harmless if it's an HTTP resource with no properties, but if
it is a WebDAV resource it might have properties that you would like to
preserve while updating its target.

The original -00 spec allowed MKREF with Overwrite, could this be used
instead of REFSET?
