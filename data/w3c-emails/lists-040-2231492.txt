I'll backtrack from my statement just a bit... :-) Tim Ellison sent me an
off-list email saying that Apache 1.3.6 and mod_dav 0.9.15 on WinNT 4.0
SP5 *does* case-fold on a PUT.

I just tracked this down. While mod_dav doesn't do the case-folding,
Apache *does*. Thus, when mod_dav gets to the filename, it has been munged
to the lower-cased form.

[ specifically: http_request.c, line 401 in the CVS version ]

IMO, I call this a bug in Apache. The protocol and behaviors should be
case-sensitive. I'm not sure how/when Apache will be fixed, but we'll look
into it.

Cheers,
