Why would it have to delete the properties?

Overwrite is defined to "... overwrite the state of a non-null destination
resource ...". It is specified in terms of a COPY/MOVE, and we can state
that for a MKREF, it *only* overwrites the target.

There is no other language that forces us to interpret Overwrite as
"DELETE the resource first [implying the props are deleted]".

I really like Joe's idea.
