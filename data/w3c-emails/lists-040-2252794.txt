For both current uses of the Overwrite header (COPY and MOVE), the use
of Overwrite means to first delete the resource (if any) that exists at
that location.  I.e.:

   8.9.3 MOVE and the Overwrite Header

   If a resource exists at the destination and the Overwrite header is
   "T" then prior to performing the move the server MUST perform a
   DELETE with "Depth: infinity" on the destination resource.

   8.8.4 COPY and the Overwrite Header

   If a resource exists at the destination and the Overwrite header is
   "T" then prior to performing the copy the server MUST perform a
   DELETE with "Depth: infinity" on the destination resource.

To define its semantics for MKREF to differ in this regard
seems likely to result in confusion and errors on the part of implementors.

In the past, I've proposed that we extend the Overwrite header to allow
a "Merge" value (i.e. Overwrite:Merge).  If we did so, then the use of
of "Overwrite:Merge" would allow us to consistently use MKREF and an
Overwrite header to update the value of the redirect reference. 

Cheers,
Geoff

Why would it have to delete the properties?

Overwrite is defined to "... overwrite the state of a non-null destination
resource ...". It is specified in terms of a COPY/MOVE, and we can state
that for a MKREF, it *only* overwrites the target.

There is no other language that forces us to interpret Overwrite as
"DELETE the resource first [implying the props are deleted]".

I really like Joe's idea.
