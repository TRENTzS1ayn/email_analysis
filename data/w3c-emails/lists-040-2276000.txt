I read the section 9.6 in the spec about the Overwrite header itself. It
doesn't mention anything about DELETE. You guys are (IMO, incorrectly)
associating Overwrite with MOVE/COPY. I feel that the right way to look at
it is "what does MOVE/COPY do when Overwrite is present?" Another way to
say it is that you're creating too strong of a binding between the
semantics of the COPY/MOVE methods and the presence of that header.

By your logic, every method should have its own set of associated headers.
We should never share headers. We'll have Overwrite, MKREF-Overwrite, etc.

I wouldn't be upset with a "merge" definition, but I did have to respond
to the way you guys are approaching the problem :-)

Cheers,
