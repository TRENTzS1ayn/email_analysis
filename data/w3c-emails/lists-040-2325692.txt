Just a refresher, here, folks.  The actual NTFS filesystem code on WinNT is
case-sensitive, but the Win32 subsystem that is normally used to access it
is case-preserving but case-insensitive.  That is, if you have a file named
"Makefile", you can use any of "makefile", "Makefile", "makeFile",
"MakeFile", etc. to access that file with the Win32 subsystem.  I think that
the NT POSIX subsystem is case-sensitive, but I don't know of any webservers
that run under the NT POSIX subsystem.  As far as I know, Windows2000
preserves these semantics.

The upshot being that Apache on NT, as it runs under the Win32 subsystem,
will case-fold on a PUT -- it can't help itself.
