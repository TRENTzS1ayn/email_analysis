I have this question from a product team in my company.  Any opinions?  I
would say that (b) is not an option, but failing the unlock request might
be.

Section 8.11 UNLOCK Method. The first sentence states "...and all other
resources included in the lock". Does this mean that a client should only
Unlock from the point where the lock starts? For example, in a hierarchy:

Collection 1
|  |
    Collection 2Collection 3
|  |
    Resource 4Resource 5

If the lock was created with a Depth of infinity on "Collection 1", should
the user only perform the UNLOCK on "Collection 1"?

We're concerned that a client may try and unlock from a sub-point within the
hierarchy eg UNLOCK "Collection 2", which means to meet the first sentence
in the RFC, we either:

a) Have to traverse the entire hierarchy (parents and all) removing the lock
from all resources (in the above example, "Collection 1", "Collection 3" and
"File 5").

b) Only remove the lock from "Collection 2" and "File 4".
