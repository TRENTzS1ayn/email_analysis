An observation:
Although infinite loops are broken using Loop Detected rules, since all
(non-circular) paths are returned by deep operations it is trivial to
construct an n**m walks graph by having n levels with m bindings between
each.
This would be a prime candidate for denial of service type attacks against
a server.
