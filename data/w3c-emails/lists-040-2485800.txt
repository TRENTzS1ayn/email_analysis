I agree with Tim.  Furthermore, I would suggest that the example use
the DAV:urn property (aka DAV:resource-id), since that illustrates the
value of the DAV:urn property (the DAV:display-name is not a reliable way
of identifying a resource).

Cheers,
Geoff

The example given in section 12.1 of draft-ietf-webdav-binding-protocol-02
of a PROPFIND depth infinity in the presence of a loop implies that the
propstat for the loop detected resource only contains the property names
and not their values (again).
Although I can understand the point of this in the majority of cases, it
does prevent the client from reconstructing the graph of resources since
they cannot determine the destination of the binding.  If the properties
were returned the client could PROPFIND depth infinity on the resource
identifier and reconstruct the graph.
