Continuing on from last week's teleconference, a teleconference on the topic
of access control for WebDAV will be held this Friday.  All are welcome to
attend this teleconference, though if you're planning on attending, and
didn't attend last week, please send Eric Sedlar <esedlar@us.oracle.com> an
email, so he can adjust the capacity of the bridge.  Big thanks go to Eric
and Oracle for hosting the teleconference.

My proposed agenda for the teleconference is as follows (please send me an
email if you have any additional topics):

  - scoping the effort (what's core, what's an extension, what's out)
    - continuing this discussion from last week
  - evaluate existing documents as a base for continuing work
    - are the goals still the same?
    - methods vs. properties for marshalling mechanism
