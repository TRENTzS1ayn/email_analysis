Just a reminder that there will be a teleconference on the subject of access
control for WebDAV, Friday, March 31, 2000.  I did not receive any email
from people saying they would be unable to make it due to attending the
Adelaide IETF meeting.

Access Control Teleconference
Friday, March 31, 2000
11AM-12noon (Pacific)

Phone number:  888-700-6725
Meeting ID:    932328225
Password:      2518

(these are the same as last week)

Proposed Agenda:

  - scoping the effort (what's core, what's an extension, what's out)
    - continuing this discussion from last week
  - evaluate existing documents as a base for continuing work
    - are the goals still the same?
    - methods vs. properties for marshalling mechanism

- Jim
