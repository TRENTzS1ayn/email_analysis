Behaviors with WebDAV


I'm not sure I'm following the use case you describe. I'm assuming you are
using IE to get a file list? Then opening the file with IE?

Does this mean you have checked the 'Open as Web Folder' option in IE's
File>Open menu sequence? If not, you might want to check out what difference
that makes to your scenario.

This situation changes I think when you go at WebFolders from Windows
Explorer. Have you experimented with that?
