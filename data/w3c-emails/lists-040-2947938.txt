When you open the document in the IE window, is the Edit button active on
the toolbar?

What does it do if you press it -- give you a separate application or do you
start editing in IE?

My conclusion, at the moment, is that if the user desires to click on a MS
Office document URL to a WebDAV server and edit the document, then one
needs to have modified the File Type entry to un-check the 'Browse in same
window' option.

Does anyone know if there is a way to build the URL in the web page to
force the application to be launched separately, rather than within the IE
window, so that the workstation's File Type entry wouldn't need to be
changed?  Perhaps JavaScript, an Applet, or an ActiveX control could do
this?  What would be the best practice?
