Over the weekend the WebDAV working group Web site:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/

Was down.  It is now back up.

Apparently my account was automatically expired, and there has been
sufficient turnover of staff in our support group that it took them awhile
to track down the automatic expiration program, and undo its effects for
students who are still present....
