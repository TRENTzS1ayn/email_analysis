What is the general consensus on PROPFIND with Depth: infinity? I quoted a
couple messages below that tend to favor disallowing them. I got that
impression from some other comments on this list, but couldn't find specific
references.

For clarity: can prople give opinions on simply disabling PROPFIND infinity?

JimW: we should probably note (explicitly) in the spec that a server may
return a 403 (Forbidden) if a client requests a PROPFIND with a Depth of
infinity.

[ I believe everybody is probably okay with returning a 403 (Forbidden) in
  certain cases. My question is more along the lines of outright shutting it
  off before beginning to walk the repository to see what is up. ]

Cheers,

At the end of the second note I found a statement of Jim Whitehead:

"As a result, a conservative client should never perform a PROPFIND, depth
infinity unless it knows the namespace it is issuing the PROPFIND against,
and a server should be free to refuse to process a PROPFIND, depth infinity
if it would result in too large a response (since this could easily be used
to implement a denial of service attack). Both of these approaches are
allowed by the specification."

I do not understand the last sentence because I did not find anything about
that issue in RFC 2518 (Did I miss something?). I think the information that a
server
can refuse a depth infinity request is a very important information which should

be included in RFC2518?!
