I agree - Having only 0, 1 and infinity is restrictive and infinity can be a
real problem on large sites.

At the end of the second note I found a statement of Jim Whitehead:

"As a result, a conservative client should never perform a PROPFIND, depth
infinity unless it knows the namespace it is issuing the PROPFIND against,
and a server should be free to refuse to process a PROPFIND, depth infinity
if it would result in too large a response (since this could easily be used
to implement a denial of service attack). Both of these approaches are
allowed by the specification."

I do not understand the last sentence because I did not find anything about
that issue in RFC 2518 (Did I miss something?). I think the information that
a
server
can refuse a depth infinity request is a very important information which
should

be included in RFC2518?!
