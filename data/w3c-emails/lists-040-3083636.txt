That depends upon you definition of "require".  Give me depth 0 and 1, and 
I'll give you infinity behavior<g>

The problem with choosing 'n' is that it does not resolve the infinity 
issue, since a client's view of a reasonable value for n may not match the 
server's idea of reasonable -- so there still needs to be a refusal 
response.

I believe that we either need a depth "n" argument or we need to leave the
infinity.

Although there might be better solutions for Hartmut's problems that would
best be covered by an extension to WebDAV, there are conceivably other
operations that require more than simply depth 0 or depth 1.
