Hi,

Note that for realistic sized repositories, say 50K to 100K files, any
depth=infinity request near the repository root is going to be too
expensive. For instance, an allprop request in such a case will be several
to tens of megabytes, and may take minutes to produce.

While it may be convenient for clients going against small repositories, I'd
expect that most servers will fail most infinity requests most of the time.

I think a lot of the uses that people envision for depth=infinity are more
likely served by intelligent tree-walking, or by DASL. The possiblility of
failure forces you to code a tree-walk into your client anyways.

    I oppose disabling infinity.  it is useful (as other emails have shown).

    I agree to adding a principled way to refuse a request that's
    too expensive.
