What we gain from the indeterminacy is flexibility.  Otherwise, we either
set the minimum standard high (and rule out cheap implementations) or set
it low (thus requiring all clients to use inefficient methods, and making
powerful implementations either useless or non-standard.)

Yaron put it like this

"The client proposes, the server disposes".

Clients should ask for what they want, and be prepared to get less than that.
