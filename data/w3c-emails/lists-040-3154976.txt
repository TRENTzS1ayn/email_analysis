To use an analogy, I use the UNIX "find" command a lot to find
files. If it's used at the root of the file system, it includes
all the remotely mounted file systems too. Even just searching
the local files system takes quite a while. But when that's what 
I want to do, that's what I need to get done. If I decide it's 
taking too long, I simply kill it.

So, is there a way to kill a request that's taking too long?
If so, that helps quite a bit. A general mechanism for canceling 
operations addresses the problem for all long running operations.
You want a general solution, not a special solution for each
long running operation.

I oppose disabling infinity.  it is useful (as other emails have shown).

I agree to adding a principled way to refuse a request that's too expensive.
