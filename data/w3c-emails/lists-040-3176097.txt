I agree with the "client proposes, server disposes" guideline,
but currently we are (in my view, inappropriately) limiting what
the client can propose.

In particular, we are not allowing the client to propose an
upper limit such as "20" or "100", even when the client knows
that to be the appropriate upper limit for its PROPFIND request.

Cheers,
Geoff

What we gain from the indeterminacy is flexibility.  Otherwise, we either
set the minimum standard high (and rule out cheap implementations) or set
it low (thus requiring all clients to use inefficient methods, and making
powerful implementations either useless or non-standard.)

Yaron put it like this

"The client proposes, the server disposes".

Clients should ask for what they want, and be prepared to get less than
that.
