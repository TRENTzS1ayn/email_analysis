Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  Gary's email has been added to the
accept2 list for w3c-dist-auth, so no further emails should be bounced.
Well, unless he tries to send us a bit of infectous humor...

Behaviors with WebDAV


Dennis, When the document (Word/Excel...) is opened within IE, the IE menu
items are basically replaced by new menu choices that are composites of IE
and the application choices. Thus, the Help menu has both IE Help and Excel
Help choices

For the Edit menu, one gets all the standard cut/paste/clear items and one
can readily edit the document within IE.

The File menu does not have Save, but does have Save As...  When one
presses the Back button, a message box appears to ask about saving or
discarding the changes to the document, or else cancelling the operation.

This is consistent with other Office documents that are opened in read-only
mode.  One can change them, but not readily save them over the original.

Gary
