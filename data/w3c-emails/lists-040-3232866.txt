Accidentally caught by the spam filter. I have added Kevin's email to the
accept2 list for w3c-dist-auth, so his emails should not be bounced in the
future.

I'm in agreement with Jim.  We should not allow infinite depth requests at
all.  Depending at what level the request is started from and the complexity
of the PROP data, the request could place a significant resource strain on
the server.

A side benefit, of not allowing infinite depth requests, servers as a
security speedbump.  It forces an end application to make more requests to
retrieve the entire tree.  Which in turn should raise a flag with someone or
something watching the logs for unusual behavior.
