| From Tim Ellison

| The server should be free to refuse depth requests (>1<g>) that it decides
| are too expensive.  Of course, that does not preclude the spec from
| allowing the header value to be 0 .. n or infinity, but it does further
| complicate the client that has to deal with refusals and 'do the work'.

Then the server can respond to an infinite request with either a 403, if the
admin decides to be frugal with server resources, or a 507 and send up to
the
high water mark of depth.  It leaves more wiggle room but it looks like the
best solution.
