Problem:

I have converted my FTP application webdrive (www.webdrive.com) to support
DAV and I need to be able to set the "getlastmodified" property using
PROPPATCH so that utilities like powerdesk can syncrhonize files from a
Windows PC to a DAV server.

I currently retrieve the "getlastmodified" property when I generate a
PROPFIND request on a collection (directory) and this spits out all the
files in the directory along with all properties defined.  I have done
testing with several servers like (Driveway.com, Zope.org, Sharemation.com)
and notice that they all return the "getlastmodified" property but sometimes
the namespace is different from server to server.  When parsing this xml
response I always look for ":getlastmodified" to determine the time for the
file.

Questions:

Do I have to specify the namespace in xml when doing a PROPPATCH ?

Is this namespace different for each server ?

Is there a generic way to specify the getlastmodified time to set ?

Thanks,
