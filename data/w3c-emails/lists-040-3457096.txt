Would you please arrange for that address to be serviced?

I ran across it while testing some stuff, and I had
no idea what it is (I'm still not exactly sure).
So I did the obvious thing: stick
it in my Web browser and go look. No joy.

Please put a file or something there that gives folks
a clue about how that URI is intended to be used.
