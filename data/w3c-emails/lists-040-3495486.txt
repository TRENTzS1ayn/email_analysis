Subject: Last Call: XML Media Types to Proposed Standard



The IESG has received a request to consider XML Media Types
<draft-murata-xml-07.txt> as a Proposed Standard.  This has been
reviewed in the IETF but is not the product of an IETF Working Group.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by September 15, 2000.
