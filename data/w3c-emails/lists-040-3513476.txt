To: WebDAV WG<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>


FYI, the updated charter for the WebDAV working group has been approved by
Ned Freed and Patrik Faltstrom, the Application Area Directors.  The revised
charter was initially proposed to the working group July 7:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2000JulSep/0034.html

It was also discussed at the Pittsburgh IETF meeting.

Essentially, the charter now states that WebDAV WG will finish the advanced
collections work, revise 2518 for Draft Standard status, develop an access
control protocol, and develop property registration procedures.

The new charter is available at:
