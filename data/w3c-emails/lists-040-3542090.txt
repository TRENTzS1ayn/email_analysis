Is there a manner in which one can enforce a link between a document and
its Properties in a WebDAV server implementation?

If there is a  rule that every document created or edited needed to have
a user defined property how might one go about enforcing this through
the separate PUT and PROPPATCH requests?

Any Suggestions would be greatly appreciated


Thanks

Michael
