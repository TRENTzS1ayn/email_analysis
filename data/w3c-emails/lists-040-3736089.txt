My advice is to make a zero-length file and declare success.  After
all, it's completely legal.  Web Folders is trying to make sure it can
create the file before it sends the content.  You didn't say, but
usually the sequence you mentioned is quickly followed by another PUT
with the real content.

Someone locally suggested that Web Folders does it this seemingly zany
way to emulate the way MSWindows implementations deal with local file
systems.  It doesn't cost much with local file systems to do it that
way.
