Hi

You have to inform WebFolders that you support WedDav. Or else it will look
for frontpage extensions (_vtf_inf.html). So for the OPTIONS request that is
comming first you should respond by giving the headers DAV and MS-Author-Via

"DAV :1.1"
"MS-Author-Via: DAV"  


When WebFolders sees this then it will send a PROPFIND webdav request
instead of the GET request that you are getting now

Cheers
