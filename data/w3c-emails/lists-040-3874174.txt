We have developed a Java Applet that uses WebDAV to manage
resources via a browser.  It currently works well using IE and Netscape
on Windows, but may not work on some Mac clients - we'd be interested in
feedback on  what does/doesn't work.

The Applet is currently on the sharemation WebDAV supported site
www.sharemation.com.

Try it by first going to http://www.screenplan.com/eplan2.html

mydocsonline has been tested, but it does not seem to support the
LOCK command which is used by the Applet.

Thanks to the WebDAV mailing list for providing assistance on some of the
technical issues.  Any WebDAV mailing list members/developers who
want to use this Applet  (either for testing or practical use!)  please let
us
know - we'll provide a trial version.

Regards,

JC Samson

JAVA WEBDAV APPLET FOR RESOURCE PLANNING RELEASED

24 October 2000

A Java Applet has been developed that can be used to manage
shared resources using a World Wide Web browser. It uses
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to manage resource
information - and the recently released WebDAV HTTP extensions
to allow updating of resource information.

It has uses throughout most organisations, including :
*Staff allocation on projects/tasks
*Room booking
*Desk or office booking
*Equipment booking
*Car parking space booking

Many organisations still rely on hand-written charts or paper
notebooks to keep track of vital resources such as meeting rooms
or car parking spaces.  The Java Applet allows staff to view and update
resource allocation from their desk or even remotely, using a
Java-compatible device.
