To:"WebDAV WG"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>


Lisa Dusseault reminded me that there is a need to discuss issue concerning
improved HTTP error reporting, and Jim Amsden pointed out that there are
some aspects of the DeltaV protocol which could be of general use to WebDAV
applications.  As a result, I've added two new items to the agenda, to cover
these issues.

Note that Lisa Dusseault (Xythos) will be chairing the meeting in San Diego.
If all goes well, I'll have my hands full in Santa Cruz with a new baby...

If you have other items for the agenda, please let Lisa or I know.  Thank
you, Lisa, for chairing this meeting!
