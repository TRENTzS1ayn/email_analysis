Hi all,

I have major concerns regarding the change of  the response on a PROPFIND
'allprop' request in the way you described it.

Such a change would be  *v e r y  harmful*   for the GoLive 5 WebDAV client.
When we send a PROPFIND 'allprop' request we expect all properties which are
defined on the resource, especially  the Lockproperties and all custom
properties defined by GoLive 5 (which we have PROPPATCHED before).

We are probably able to replace PROPFIND 'allprop' requests by PROPFIND 'prop'
requests in future GoLive releases (which would be indeed much more efficient)
but the suggested change in the protocol would be a  *disaster*  for GoLive 5
which is already in the box.

Best, Hartmut
