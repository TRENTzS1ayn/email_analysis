...and (just to state the obvious), the namespace declaration
xmlns:Z="http://www.w3.com/standards/z39.50/">
must also be stored as part of the <Z:Authors> property.

That XML fragment is indeed the property value for Z:authors.

Probably with extreme difficulty. Probably not even possible with most XML
parsers.

If you want to interpret the value as a string... yes -- you would need to
rebuild it.


As a concrete example of this behavior: mod_dav parses the above
DAV:propertyupdate request into an XML structure. When it goes to store the
Z:authors property's value, it reconstructs the string and stores that. So,
there is precedent for reconstruction.
