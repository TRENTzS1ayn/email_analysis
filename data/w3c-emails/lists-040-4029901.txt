One more question, because maybe, as Richard Humphreys suggests, "depth
infinity" is the problem.

Hartmut, does GoLive5 use depth: infinity PROPFIND requests at all?  If yes,
does it use them for custom property discovery?

If not, then we could compromise our way through this by stating that a
WebDAV server SHOULD (MUST?) respond to a PROPFIND depth-0 'allprop' request
with all custom properties, but that it MAY respond to a PROPFIND depth>0
'allprop' request with a more limited set of properties (suggested to be the
non-locking-related properties defined in RFC2518 presently).

Would that work?
