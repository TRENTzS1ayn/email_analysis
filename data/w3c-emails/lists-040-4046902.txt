Subject: [Moderator Action] Looking for Java WebDav clients..


Hello,

My company is investigating the possiblity of creating an asset management
soln using webDav.  I was looking for any Java webDav clients with source
code that may be helpful in this endevour.  Would you know if there are any
out there.  Also, would there be any libraries within Sun's java libraries
to support this in the future.

Thanks,
Anslem.
