Of potential interest to members of this working group.

http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf-announce/Current/msg09817.html

The IESG has received a request to consider On the use of HTTP as a
Substrate for Other Protocols <draft-moore-using-http-01.txt> as a
BCP.  This has been reviewed in the IETF but is not the product of an
IETF Working Group.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by December 5, 2000.
