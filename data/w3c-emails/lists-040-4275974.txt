I'm not against paid-for-products. I simply enjoy Open Source development,
and have the lucky luxury to be able to work on it full time. Heck. I'd say
that *very* few people would be using my code if it weren't for paid-for
products.

I return a 403 (Forbidden) if a Depth:infinity PROPFIND hits mod_dav and it
has not been configured to allow them. Nothing in the RFC about "you MUST
NOT return a 403 for a PROPFIND". So I'd dispute your second statement :-)

[ and I always have the out: if an admin feels it *does* deviate from the
  spec, then they can simply enable the thing in their config. they're the
  ones to live with a DoS attack, not me :-) ]
