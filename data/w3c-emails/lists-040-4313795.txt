Yes, it is mainly the sync feature which uses this request but it's a very important and
often used feature. With synchronizing a file "a.html" I mean to perform a PROPFIND request
on "a.html" in order to figure out if it has been changed after the last time you have
downloaded that file to your local machine. Synchronizing a huge folder means to check this
out for the folder and all its content. So if the user wants to synchronize a folder with a
lot of resources in it it is very efficient to do that with one PROPFIND-infinity request.

Yes, I know and believe that!

Yes, I know and understand your point of view but, as I already pointed out,  we like those
requests because they are pretty efficient for us and we are very sensitive to changes of
the protocol or its most important implementations.

Best, Hartmut
