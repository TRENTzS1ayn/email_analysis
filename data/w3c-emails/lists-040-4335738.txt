A few months ago, I was looking for examples of simple Java client code
for accessing a WebDAV server. There are relatively few examples of any
HTTP Java client code available on the internet, let alone WebDAV !

I put the following test program together  (thanks also to the WebDAV list
for
a few pieces of advice).  Rather than the overhead of a full XML parser, I
wrote a simple routine to extract the elements I wanted from the returned
responses.

The example tests GET, PROPFIND, LOCK, PUT and UNLOCK, shows
how to implement Basic Authentication and how to handle locktokens.

As IE does not have a Java Console, I write messages out to the
screen once each example has been called.  No apologies for the code -
it's messy but it worked for testing purposes !

It works over the Internet with Sharemation, but not mydocsonline as this
does not seem to support the Lock command.

To test this out on Sharemation, which supports WebDAV
a) create a user account.
b)add a file such as  rfc2518.htm
c) run from within your Java environment (or create an applet) with the
following
parameter properties set....

<param name=user value=username>
<param name=pass value=password>
<param name=page value="http://www.sharemation.com/~username/rfc2518.htm">

where username and password are the sharemation account username and
password.

The Java source can be downloaded from www.screenplan.com/webdav.html

I'd welcome comments - please post any feedback to the working group, if
appropriate, or mail me separately.

Regards,

JC Samson
