I'd have to agree on the point that a 507 response isn't particularly
useful.  Just what is a client supposed to do with that?  How are they
supposed to recover?  What kind of feedback do they provide to the user that
they just got back a partial result set (and as Greg points out, it would be
very difficult to know how it was truncated).  Many clients would want to
just treat that as a complete failure and try a different approach, but in
the meantime they might have had to download and parse a very large (but not
large enough) response that they end up discarding.
