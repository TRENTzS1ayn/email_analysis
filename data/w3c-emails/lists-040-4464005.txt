   I don't see any way for the server to return the properties for 'subdir'
   while simultaneously indicating to the client that it did not recurse into
   'subdir'.  Thus in order to limit its answer, the server would omit the
   property set for 'subdir' as well.  Not the best of solutions; anybody have
   brighter ideas?

If the server wants to return properties for subdir, but not for its
children, it would just return a 507 for each of its children.

Cheers,
Geoff
