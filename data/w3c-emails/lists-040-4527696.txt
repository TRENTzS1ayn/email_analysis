Accidentally caught by the spam filter. I've added Angsuman to the accept2

deltav is responsible for adding full(?) versioning capabilities to webdav.

A client implementation of Source Code Management system can be easily built
to work with webdav server with deltav extensions, something not possible
with just webdav impl.

Hope that helps,
Angsuman

I'm just reading the documnentation of both groups ...

I didn't understand what is the difference of the two working groups.
Someone could tell me something ...

Can I consider deltav as the continuation of webdav ?
If so, why webdav is still working ?

Thanks
