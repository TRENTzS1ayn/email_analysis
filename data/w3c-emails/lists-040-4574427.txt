I totally agree! If you look, for example, at implementations of RFC2518 you will
come to the conclusion that a lot of problems of the "realworld" WebDAV client
server communication are caused by the fact that a lot of clients and servers do
*not*  implement the DTD of RFC 2518 exactly because they don't have to. To my mind
a protocol should define a precise language which every client and server has to
speak in order to guarantee a perfect client server communication. Moreover clients
and servers are easier to implement if they are based on  strict rules to which
they have to obey.

Best, Hartmut
