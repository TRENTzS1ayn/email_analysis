I highly recommend that WebDAV clients not depend on any ordering of
the immediate children of the top level XML element in a method
response body.  In the versioning spec, all of the request and
response body top level XML elements will be declared as ANY, to
provide for extensibility.  The only constraints will be of the form
"at most one element of type XXX must appear", so a client will not be
able to assume any particular ordering.

Cheers,
Geoff

I think mod_dav is quite clean regarding that problem. But, for
instance, IIS sends a status tag first and then a prop tag in a
propstat although the DTD states:

<!ELEMNENT propstat (prop, status, responsedescription?)>

There are a few other samples like this one but I think the main
problem is that the server and the client must be implemented in a way
that they are able to handle requests and responses which are *not*
correct regarding the DAV-DTD in RFC2518. I think the whole situation
would be much easier and cleaner if clients and servers *must* use
that DTD. Moreover it is maybe possible to get rid of some of the
"ANY"s in that DTD.

Best, Hartmut
