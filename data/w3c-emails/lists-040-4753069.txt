Interesting difference in interpretation of RFC2518 :)

Assume I have a resource /foo that is locked depth infinity by a lock token
<lt>

No resource exists at /foo/bar

A PUT is performed at /foo/bar with a No-tagged-list passing the lock token
in the IF header.   What should the correct response be.  From our limited
testing:

1)  Xythos -  201.  The resource /foo is locked and /foo/bar does not exist.
Thus the lock token is correct for every resource that exists (/foo) and
thus the creation of the file is allowed.

2)  Mod_dav - 412.  (I am assuming this is the rationale).  /foo/bar does
NOT exist.  The token should be applied to the state of resource /test/foo.
The resource does not exist, so the token cannot match.  Thus it fails with
412.

I could argue this either way.  I of course lean toward the 201, but that
just might be because it is the first way I interpreted the spec.

Thoughts?
