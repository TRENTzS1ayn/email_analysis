Stewart Hersey, man of many email addresses :-) (another one caught by the
spam filter).  I've added farmer@karuizawa.ne.jp to the accept2 list.

Thanks Jim,

Tried to figure out how to line up my comments with the attached graphic.
I believe that it will be easier for us all if I post text only to the list
and
keep screenshots available elsewhere.

On a hunch I attempted to open
http://www.sharemation.com/~jane/international
as a Web Folder on a Japanese WinMe Box.

Success...

I took a series of screenshots to benchmark the process.
They are accessible in the directory that this URL points to:

http://www.newma.org/WebDAV_WG/

Please use the table below as a process reference while viewing the
screenshots.


Graphic Title                                  Explanation
-------------                       -----------------------------

screenshot1.png:                Translation - "Enter the name or address of
the document
                                         you would like to open" (note: Web
Folder is checked).

screenshot2.png:               After opening the URL as a Web Folder I took
this shot
                                        of  the "Konnichiwa Sekai"
directory.

screenshot3.png:              Wide view of the Web Folder (notice that WinMe
couldn't
                                       grok the Korean or first character of
the Chinese directory, this time).

screenshot4.png:              Drilled down into the tree and tossed a GIF
in, to get this shot.

screenshot5.png:               I was prompted for a name and password. I'll
try this again with success,
                                        I suspect, in the future...

screenshot6.png:              A shot of My Computer's system properties, for
the record.

screenshot7.png:              Internet Explorer Version screen, from the
Help tab, for authentication
                                       purposes.

screenshot8.png:              A final shot of the "Default View" that IE5.5
will show, saying Hello World
                                       in a variety of double-byte character
lingos.

web_folder_error.bmp:   The original screenshot of the error message/prompt
that
                                      Win2K Pro (EN) popped up.


Questions and comments are welcome.

I'll be glad to continue the experiment with input and suggestions from the
WebDAV WG members.
If supplied with a username and password, I'll generate a Word file with MS
Office2000 (Japanese) and
attempt to save succeeding versions of it to this site.

Cheers,

Stewart
