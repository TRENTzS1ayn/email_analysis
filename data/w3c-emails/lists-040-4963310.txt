Now 21:00 hrs PMT 12/07/2000

Experiment underway using WinMe (JP) to place files in:
 http://www.sharemation.com/~jane/international

Image Title                                     Explanation
-----------                                 ---------------------------
screenshot9.png                         Dropped in index.html (Would you
like to overwrite?)

screenshot10.png                       Error in one or more of the folders
you tried to copy to.

screenshot11.png                       You can't save here. Try somewhere
else.

eureka.png                                 Created a new folder named
WebDAV, saved html
                                                  file inside it and tossed
it into ~jane/international !

eureka2.png                                Took a screenshot of the process
as it happened, and
                                                   chucked in the png file!

NOTE: I only succeeded in saving to sharemation when I opened the folder
from within another
application's "save as" window. I use TechSmith SnagIT to take my
screenshots, and to open ~jane.

Tried to save the Web Folder as a FrontPage 2000 Web (Web Folder becomes
.ink extension).
Tried to save a new file into ~jane/international/WebDAV with
FrontPage...FTP not supported.

changename.png                         Changed the name of eureka.png to
k.png

cantchangename.png                   Couldn't change the name of the file to
konnichiwa sekai (in Japanese).




End of Experiment 22:56 hrs PMT 12/07/2000

I will continue with the Phase II tomorrow. I will attempt to access the
folder with Word 2000 "Save As".
I will attempt to save a new version of index.html on to of the current
version.
