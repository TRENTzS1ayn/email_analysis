Hi all,

Recently I worked to add support to Xythos Storage Server for
remote COPY destinations.  To maximize flexibility, Xythos goes
a step farther and adds support for a "Source:" header.
It is hoped the group might consider adding this header to a
future revision of RFC 2518.

The Source header is formed similarly to the Destination header:

  Source = "Source" ":" absoluteURI

For Xythos, either a Source: or a Destination: header (but not both)
must be present in a COPY request.

When specified, the Source header indicates the local or remote
source of the copy, while the request URI indicates the local
target of the copy.

All other aspects of parsing and execution of the COPY are
the same as described in 2518.
