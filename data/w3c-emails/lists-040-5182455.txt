This feels a lot like Accept:...but, of course, we can't actually use Accept:,
because that would affect what kind of responses come back on success.  Do we
want an Accept-Error:, maybe?

As for the user-text option...is it really that important to be able to turn
off the user text? In probably over 90% of the cases, you're going to want to
be able to present an error message to the user (or else log something, if
you're a robot), and that user text might have extra explanatory information
that couldn't be expressed in the standard machine-readable part.
