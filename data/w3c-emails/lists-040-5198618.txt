There are instances when a user would like to get a file from a URL (mp3,
word doc, etc) that is not on a Webdav Server (or one that does not allow
for cross server Copies).  This allows Xythos to go get the file and store
it for the user.

There are a lot of proprietary extensions out there to do "cross loading"
Xythos would like to see a Webdav COPY be the standard, thus we propose
adding the "Source" tag so that clients can cause server-server copies
across Webdav Servers and/or across a Webdav Server and a HTTP server.

This gives flexibility to a Webdav server as it is able to copy resources
between machines both as a Source and a Destination.

Um...why? What does it add that you can't express with Destination:?
