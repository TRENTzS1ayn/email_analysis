I don't think so.  Every time the client advertises support for a feature
it adds to the request latency of every request and creates a new variable
against which content selection algorithms must apply.

This goes back to the discussion of content negotiation in HTTP/1.0.
Accept headers are a bad idea.  They have always been a bad idea.
A better solution is to provide the client with the primary content
choice and a means of obtaining the new content. Or, if the alternatives
are small, as in this case, just include the status in such a way that
it has no adverse impact on clients that do not understand it.
