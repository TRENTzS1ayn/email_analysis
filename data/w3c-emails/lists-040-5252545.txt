I want to respond on two topics -- the problems being encountered around
internationalization and the question I swear I saw here about registering
properties for DAV applications (but I can't find in my WebDAV/DASL folder).

The internationalization and character set problem is one of those great
demonstrators of system incoherence that leaves users helpless (the greatest
one from the recent and present past being end-to-end delivery of e-mail
with intelligible attachments).  It shows up in all efforts at
document-management interoperability.  (The ODMA middleware fails to
implement the ODMA specification concerning character set encodings, and the
specification fails to provide interoperability across code-page regimes.  I
am not picking on ODMA, it is simply one I have been struggling with most
recently.  It demonstrates how intuitively-convenient approaches can fail to
achieve the goals that are claimed for them.)

The AIIM DMware site, still under development, is intended to provide a
forum and resources for (1) exposing these difficulties; (2) identifying
experiences, practices, and tools that overcome them; and (3) providing a
place where people can perform open registration of metadata definitions and
tag sets as a way of fostering reuse and development of commonly-reusable
definitions.  This can include character sets, encodings, and also collation
rules specific to different language groups and applications.

Interoperability and interchange of metadata identifications between
different systems (e.g., the DAV and XML name-space scheme, the DMA and
other GUID-based schemes, the ODMA tag scheme, the property set scheme
shared throughout Microsoft products, and so on) is also to be supported.

This is not meant to be a grandiose all-embracing database.  The idea is to
provide a place where people can voluntarily contribute to the accumulation
of information and experience and it can be grown and extended as its
utility is established.  I don't have a particular model other than it
should be easy to use, raise the level of awareness of what there is to pay
attention to, and be conformable to more-ambitious models for
metadata-description interchange.

I am not sure where there is a good forum for continuing discussions on this
topic -- it is tangential to WebDAV, DASL, and DeltaV, although it crosses
many interests.

Because these topics have shown up here, I wanted to invite suggestions from
participants here on how we might find a mutual interest and take advantage
of AIIM DMware support in this area.

I invite further discussion and suggestions on this topic.

Please respond here or directly to me.

Thanks,

-- Dennis

http://test.webdav.org/dav/ is always available to anybody wishing to do DAV
testing (against mod_dav).
