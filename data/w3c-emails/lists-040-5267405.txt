That is why my message had more text than what you quoted above.

I currently do not believe that any error extension mechanism is
necessary, but even if it were to be necessary there are many ways
to include it that would only cost the application a couple bytes
on the response that would be ignored by anything not prepared
to handle it.  Therefore, generating a new standard for XML content
that describes an extension mechanism for status codes is not only
the equivalent of using a bazooka for domestic rodent control, it
also needlessly ties HTTP to XML responses.
