Dennis,

The DMware site is fascinating.

You wrote:

"The idea is to provide a place where
people can voluntarily contribute to 
the accumulation of information and 
experience and it can be grown and 
extended as its utility is established."

I have built my career over ten years while evangelizing this idea.

I'll be in attendance @ the AIIM E-Business Seminar:
"Understanding the Critical Issues in Enterprise Content Management"
Tue, Feb 6, 2001 
Clarion Hotel - San Francisco Airport
Millbrae,CA

Perhaps we could speak further about Internationalization in-person at that time.

Cheers,
