This is probably worth getting onto the "proposed new feature
list" for the 2518 update.  Or is it already there?

Cheers,

   FWIW, Microsoft defined a "noroot" suffix on depth headers... 

   So, "Depth: 1,noroot" would mean "my immediate children, but not myself".

   Very useful for doing directory listings because one doesn't have to first
   filter out the directory itself.
