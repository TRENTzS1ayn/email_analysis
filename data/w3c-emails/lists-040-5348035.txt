I've always viewed it this way, and consider the whole "DELETE first" thing
to be awfully pedantic.

Not at all. If I want directory DA to overwrite directory DB, then the
result should look like directory DA. That means deleting the stuff that
wasn't in DA.

And to throw back some of your semantics :-) ... DA is a set of bindings.
That set overwrites the set in DB. Bang! There goes the spurious stuff that
was in DB. Theoretically, you don't even have to copy resources... just
adjust the bindings to the resources. :-)

[ yes, I tend to avoid the whole "directories are sets of bindings" view
  because it is a rather awkward viewpoint sometimes. but it is oh-so-fun to
  throw that back at people when they suggest a semantic that is
  non-intuitive :-) ]
