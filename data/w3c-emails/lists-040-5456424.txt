Hi Peter,

It has been a little while since I last played with an IIS 5 server, but as
I recall it is possible to create a specific URL for each of "User1Root",
"User2Root", etc.  When I configured an IIS 5 server, I had each user's
DAV-enabled URL point to the "My Documents" folder in their account.
