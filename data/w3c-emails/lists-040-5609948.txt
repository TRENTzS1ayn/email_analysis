Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  I've added rmago@semandex.net to
the accept2 list, so future emails will go through to the list.

Authentication?


Can any of you guys enlighten me on how to generate the "nonce" string for
the WWW-Authenticate
header?? We are trying to use the WebDAV interface of Exchange2000 and
getting authentication
failed messages (access denied). I donot know how to correctly use the
User/Passwd/Domain
information to generate info for the WWW-Authenticate header.

Please help!

Unless I'm misreading the BNF, your WWW-Authenticate header is incorrectly
formatted. There must be a "," between the Basic and Digest challenges.
