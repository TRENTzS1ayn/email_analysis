Geoff,

Good suggestion about marshalling in the body rather than the headers.  But
the DELETE/MOVE choice won't work.

The problem is that choosing the default behaviour means working with
clients that are minimally DAV compatible, and that means that one maps the
request that those clients are going to make (DELETE) to the default
behaviour.  One puts the onus on clients that understand the difference to
make the special request (DELETE + I-mean-it-really-blow-it-away).

Ugly, but that's the kind of compromise one has to make when designing a
protocol piece by piece.  It's the price we pay for having been able to
finish DAV when we did rather than 10 yrs from now :)
