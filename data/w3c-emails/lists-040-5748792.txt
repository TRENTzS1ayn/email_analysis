It *might* be useful for a proxy to know that a resource has been moved
to a trash folder--it can update its cache.  On the other hand, looking
through the trash folder isn't going to be all that common.

Uh...ah! And the HTTP/1.1 definition of DELETE semi-forbids moving the
resource to a trash folder that can be accessed via HTTP:

     the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, at the time the
     response is given, it intends to delete the resource or move it
     to an inaccessible location.

(RFC-2616, section 9.7, first paragraph.)

It might also be useful to have a response body, to indicate what action
was actually taken.
