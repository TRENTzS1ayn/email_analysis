Jim:  Thanks for getting the issues list started.

I believe that WebDAV must permit properties to have attributes.  As you've
pointed out, RDF and PRISM do use them extensively.  A server can reformat
the attributes in a subsequent PROPFIND request.  Attrbiutes should be
persistent.

Thanks,

Mark
