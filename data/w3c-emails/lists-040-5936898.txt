Yes.

That's an interesting comment -- I'd say that everything from the opening
element <theprop... to the closing element </theprop> is the property, and
the outermost element is called its 'name'.  Everything about the property
should be stored, including 'copying down' namespace declarations where
required.

I don't think there is a boundary per se, the name is extracted from the
property.
