My vote:
- protected (i.e. properties that MUST NOT be modifiable with PROPPATCH)
 creationdate
 getcontentlength
 getetag
 getlastmodified
 lockdiscovery
 supportedlock
 resourcetype
- not protected (i.e. properties that MUST be modifiable by PROPPATCH)
 displayname
 getcontentlanguage
 getcontenttype
 source
 
My rationale for DAV:resourcetype is that the resourcetype should be used
to define the inherent nature of a resource (e.g. collection vs.
non-collection), while getcontenttype is definable by the client.

Cheers,
Geoff
