I'll add my vote: "Aye"; enforce attribute persistence on the top-level node
for dead properties.

I will point out, however, that -- according to my own quick test --
Microsoft's IIS5 DAV implementation does NOT persist attributes at that
level.  And since they don't allow markup in dead properties, they
essentially don't persist attributes at ANY level.  Now I know that the onus
is on MS to conform to the DAV spec, and not vice-versa, but I'd be curious
to know if there were server implementation issues (for MS and others) that
might change some minds on this decision.
