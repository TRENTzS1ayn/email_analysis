Since persisting the attributes is going to be tricky enough, my leaning is
to only allow namespace and xml:lang attributes in the property name tag.

However, I do agree that servers MUST persistently store XML attribute
information found in the value of the property. I don't care how they store
it -- the XML is just a marshalling format. I agree with the suggestion to
look at the XML Canonicalization Recommendation for ideas on how to specify
the round-trip behavior <http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n>.

It's important to support XLink style linking
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-xlink-20001220/>, and this is *very* dependent
on the use of attributes.  Storage of XLinks in DAV properties is a very
natural way to persistently attach link metadata to a resource -- the major
roadblock holding this up at present is the fact that, right now, a client
does not have a guarantee that attribute information will be persistently
stored.  I'm glad to see the sentiment of the working group leaning in this
direction.
