Let's try to approach it this way:

A property is a tupel of (namespacename, localname, content).

content can be (for instance) empty, a string, or mixed XML content. By
definition, it can by anything that belongs to the property element's
infoset (including anything below it).

If "content" is not a simple string, it needs to be stored in an
XML-friendly way. For instance, elements or attributes in the content might
use namespace prefixes that have been defined outside that element. For
instance:

<proppatch xmlns="DAV:" xmlns:x="foo"><set>
<prop>
<bar><x:baz/></bar>
</prop>
</set></proppatch>

If attributes of the property itself need to be recorded as well, that's
extremely easy to do: just instead of storing the "content" of the element,
you store the XML serialization of the element including it's attributes and
children.

Two other notes:

a) It needs to be specified which parts of the Infoset are preserved
(comments, processing instructions)? I'd say: all of them.

b) Microsoft's webfolders already use the old XML data namespace to put data
type information into properties, for instance <DAV:getlastmodified
dt:type="isoDate.tz" />.
