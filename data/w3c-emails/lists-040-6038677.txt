I agree with Greg et all that "attr2" needs to be stored.

I believe that allowing "attr1" could lead to some interop problems, or we
need to spec this out a little better:

<D:prop>
  <theprop attr1="foo"/>
  <theprop attr1="bar"/>
  <theprop attr2="fee"/>
</D:prop>

Is that legal?  Does the attribute make the property unique?  Does simply
the value of an attribute make it unique?  Or do we (like xmllang) simply
store one set of attributes for a property?

Also how does one use Dasl with attributes on properties?

I would like to see attributes on the property name not be supported.

The question isn't about attributes in general, it is about *which*
attributes. Consider the following:

  <D:prop>
    <theprop attr1="foo">
      thevalue
      <subelem attr2="bar"/>
    </myprop>
  </D:prop>

I believe everybody would agree that attr2 gets stored. The real question is
about attr1. I see that attribute as part of the element that *names* a
property, but it isn't part of the property *value*.

IMO, PROP_ATTR is about defining the boundary between property naming, and a
property's value.
