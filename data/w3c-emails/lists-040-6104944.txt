I think the usual XML rules should apply. That is, namespace attributes on
the DAV:prop element get applied by default to the value unless the value
provides its own. Clients have complete control of this if it the default
isn't what they want. Servers should be uninvolved in determining semantics
other than following XML rules.

I agree that this is not acceptable unless attr1 and attr2 are namespace
attributes that alter the effective tag name of the property name tags.

This does lead me to another question though.  If in the PROPPATCH call
there are xmlns attributes on the propertyupdate, set, or prop tags that
could potentially affect the tags within the property value, is the server
responsible for collecting those and representing those in PROPPATCH
responses?   Or should we require that the client put any xmlns attributes
that it cares about on the propertyname tag and within?

J.
