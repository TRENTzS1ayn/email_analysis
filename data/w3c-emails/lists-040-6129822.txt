Seems fine, but...

I could see an argument for getlastmodified (e.g. "touch" the resource). And
maybe for creationdate for somebody that is restoring documents to a server.
Then you have the "COPY is performed using PROPPATCH" where you may need to
copy all the props.

I'm also a bit leery of the getcontentlanguage and getcontenttype being a
MUST. I'd prefer those be a MAY, and displayname and source remain as MUST.
The basic problem with the language/type is needing to look them up for each
GET from the server. That can seriously impact server performance.

Cheers,
