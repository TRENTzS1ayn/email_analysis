I agree about the "getlastmodified" property.  I would love to be able to
set this so that file synchronization software will work properly.  My
product maps a network drive to a DAV server and unless I can set the
"getlastmodified" property file synch software won't work right.  I only
know of one server that allows this now, it would be nice if this could be
standardized.
