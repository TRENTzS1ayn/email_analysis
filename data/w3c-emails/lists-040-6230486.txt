Which contradicts the namespace spec and as far as I understand will be
removed from the RFC. Namespace name and local name NEVER should be
concatenated (that is, without well-defined delimiters), they are a pair,
that's it (see issue "XML_NS").

What you say is that namespaces within the contents of a property should
behave as defined in the XML namespaces recommendation, right?

That's an implementation issue, not a specification issue, correct?
