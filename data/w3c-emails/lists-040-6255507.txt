Sorry... I didn't mean to imply that. I meant that the name element has
three useful pieces of information, which must be recorded. As you suggest,
only the localpart and URI are the "key". The xml:lang is effectively part
of the value.

[ this is how it is implemented in mod_dav today ]

I maintain that it should be the serialization of the contents of the name
element, but exclude the name element itself. For example:

  <prop>
    <myprop>
      contents
      <child-elem att="foo"/>
    </myprop>
  </prop>

In the above example, I see the value as 'contents<child-elem att="foo"/>'
(mod_dav actually preserves whitespace; I just omitted it here for clarity).

Further, there may be an xml:lang that applies to the "scope" that the
property value occurs within. The name is separate, and is a tuple of
(localpart, namespace-URI).

I believe this is the appropriate interpretation; the <myprop> element (and
any attributes on it) are the name, not the value.

I completely agree.

My point is that it is more difficult for server implementors if you want to
state that the attributes on the name element are part of the property
value, and (thus) need to be stored.
