I've got a concern here... RFC2518 makes a special case for xml:lang, which
I think is a bad thing. "Canonical XML" [1][2] specifies rules for
generating canonical representations of document subsets (which seems to be
relevant to our problem), and it states that *all* attributes in the xml
namespace are inherited (as of today, this would include xml:space as well).

Also note that other working groups might be adding more attributes to the
xml namespace, such as xml:base [3]. I think it should be considered to
either drop the requirement to persist xml:lang with the property value, or
to extend the requirement so that all attributes from the xml namespace [4]
are treated equally.
