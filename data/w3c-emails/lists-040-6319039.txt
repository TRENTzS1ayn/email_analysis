DAV servers cannot preserve the namespace prefix.  What would happen if two
proppatch's told the same resource to store properties with the same
prefixes but differing namespaces?  When the server went to output info on a
propfind, it would not be consistent.

<d:prop xmlns:f="http://www.xythos.com/namespaces">
  <f:bar/>
</d:prop>

and

<d:prop xmlns:f="fdfd">
  <f:bar/>
</d:prop>

Yes, because the xml:lang value is scoped, and the property value occurs
within that scope.

And this isn't just because xml:lang occurs on the property name element; it
could be three levels higher in scope.

Nope. It could occur higher in scope, so it might not be on the property
name element at all. Thus, serializing the name isn't going to help with
preserving the xml:lang value.

I store the xml:lang and the (serialized) value as two items of data in the
property database.

As an implementor of a server, I would disagree :-)

I just want to see the language state something to the effect of: all
attributes on elements, which are children of the name element, MUST be
preserved; attributes on the name element MAY be preserved. [ plus the
language about xml:lang ]

They're SOL with (at least) mod_dav. It doesn't preserve prefixes. That is
potentially another issue for the RFC 2518 issues list (I have an opinion,
but that can occur under a separate issue thread).
