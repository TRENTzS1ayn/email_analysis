No, there's a strong indication that the *representation* is XML but the
semantics of the value are wholy outside of the scope of WebDAV.  That means
it's important not to impose artifacts of the transport encoding on the
meaning of the term property value.

Exactly, yes.  That leaves the issue of defining what will and what will not
be preserved in the case where the value is encoded as an XML fragment.  If
it's not going to be a byte-for-byte equivalence, what *is* it going to be?

I agree, w.r.t. a) and b).  What I'm after is clarification for case c),
preferably based on the Infoset definitions.

I'm suggesting that they are part of the XML encoding of the property, not
part of the property value -- an artifact of the encoding that can be
resolved by exclusion.  I also wasn't clear or explicit enough in
identifying my other issue -- defining what a property's value is when
expressed as 'in line' XML.
