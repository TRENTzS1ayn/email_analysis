My understanding is that some servers calculate the GET response
Content-Type on the fly, often by examining the filename extension. If,
instead, you need to substitute a database read to retrieve the
getcontentlength property value (which would be necessary if the
getcontentlength property was writeable), this would presumably have a
negative effect on GET performance as compared to calculating the
Content-Type on the fly.  Since GET is by far the most commonly called
method, implementors are typicaly loathe to impact GET performance.

So, Greg, what does mod_dav do with the Content-Type submitted with a PUT?
