There are two choices for building - client side and server side.  In client
side builds, the files are locally cached on client machine, and so the
existing "touch" command coul djust be used.

For server-side builds, the existence of a rich property mechanism means
that we can do much better than the "touch" hack.

This isn't a compelling scenario for me.
