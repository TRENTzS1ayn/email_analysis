Yes.

I think we should try to use a consistent vocabulary. If we use the XML
infoset (or the XPath) data model, XML namespace declarations are "namespace
nodes". They just happen to be expressed as attributes in the
serializiation...

...but it will have to use a format that allows him to recreate the XML
infoset of the property element's contents (or a to-be-defined subset of
it).

Fine with me.
