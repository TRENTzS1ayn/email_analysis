Good point.  I should have said "an operation that just sets
the getlastmodified to be the current server time is OK, but
an operation that sets getlastmodified to a client specified
value has the following problems ...".  As you say, touch(1)
does in fact let you set the dates to arbitrary client-specified
values.

Cheers,
Geoff

Note also that touch(1) is a significantly more powerful tool than the
operation "touch" as you've defined it...  

As remote-file-system type DAV clients become more widespread, I could
imagine lack of mutability of this property could become more contentious...
