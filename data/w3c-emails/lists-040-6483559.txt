And that, in itself, is another issue.  Can there be any consensus on what
operations should affect getlastmodified automatically?
 - Body updates surely...
 - Update of dead properties?
 - Conversion of resource to versioned resource or other drastic change?

Similarly, what does getlastmodified on a collection mean?
