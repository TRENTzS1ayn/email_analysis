This is where the problem lies.  If you PUT  a file to the server, the
server will update getlastmodified.  The way that existing Windows
applications synchronize files is to copy the file to the server and then
set the modified time to match the existing modified time of the file that
is say on the users hard disk.  This way when it next checks to see if the
file is in synch it will just check the last modified property.  I know that
DAV isn't specific to Windows or any file system in particular, but it would
be nice if there was a way in DAV to allow existing file synchronization
software to work.  A simple way to do this is to allow the getlastmodified
property to be set.

The algorithm mentioned above by Jim would work fine if the synchronization
software was written with DAV in mind.  My product maps a network drive
under Windows to a DAV server, so I can't really change the method that
applications use to synchronize files, nor could I expose these additional
DAV properties to them.

The DAV server for www.mydocsonline.com does this and it works very well
with my product and some other products out there that count on this for
file synchronization.
