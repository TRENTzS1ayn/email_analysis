It doesn't really matter to me if the getlastmodified time can be written to
as long as there is some mechanism in DAV for allowing

1) A time stamp property that gets updated by the server whenever the file
contents are changed.  I suppose it could be debated about what other
changes to the file/properties might cause this property to change.

2) Allow the time stamp property to be modified by a client.
