Originally raised in Mark D. Anderson's epic post to the WebDAV mailing

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0234.html

The description of this issue in this issues list is:

"Should the Depth header be usable with OPTIONS to perform a query of the
capabilities of all resources in a hierarchy?"

To me, the underlying issue is:

Do clients need to be able to query the capabilities of all resources in a
collection hierarchy in one network round trip?
