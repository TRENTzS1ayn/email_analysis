To keep things simple, I would just disallow the xml:lang attribute
on the D:prop node.  In fact, I would indicate that all attributes 
on the D:prop node are ignored unless explicitly defined by the
protocol as being allowed there.

This allows a client to ignore attributes on the D:prop node, and
just store all attributes on the property node, without having to
understand the inheritance semantics of those attributes.

Cheers,
Geoff

To be persistant, I think we all agree the xml:lang attribute can be on the
property node and doesn't have to be on a child.  Do we agree that it can
even be on the parent of the property node and still be persistant?
Should we discourage the client from doing this though?

<D:set>
 <D:prop xml:lang="NL">
   <D:displaynname>Kikkers in de koek</D:displayname>
 </D:prop>
</D:set>
