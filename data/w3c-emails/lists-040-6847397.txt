   I don't see any advantage as long as the inheritence rules are clearly
   specified, such as in

   <http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#DocSubsets>

This doesn't help a server that encounters an attribute type that it
doesn't understand (for example, a custom attribute or an attribute
introduced since that server was written).  If we only allow
attributes on the property node and below, a server can at least save
and return those attributes.  If we allow attributes on the DAV:prop
node, the server would need to know the inheritance characteristics of
that attribute in order to know how/whether to persist it.  I don't
think we want to just say "all attributes are inherited".

We could make an exception for xml:lang, but I don't see a compelling
benefit for doing so (I'm not saying there isn't one, but rather
just that I don't see it).

But whatever we do with xml:lang, I believe we should say something
in general about the handling of attributes on DAV:prop nodes
(saying there can't be any is about the simplest thing we could
say :-).

Cheers,
Geoff

   Betreff: RE: Issue: XML_LANG_CLARIFY


   To keep things simple, I would just disallow the xml:lang attribute
   on the D:prop node.  In fact, I would indicate that all attributes
   on the D:prop node are ignored unless explicitly defined by the
   protocol as being allowed there.

   This allows a client to ignore attributes on the D:prop node, and
   just store all attributes on the property node, without having to
   understand the inheritance semantics of those attributes.

   Cheers,
   Geoff

   To be persistant, I think we all agree the xml:lang attribute can be on
the
   property node and doesn't have to be on a child.  Do we agree that it can
   even be on the parent of the property node and still be persistant?
   Should we discourage the client from doing this though?

   <D:set>
    <D:prop xml:lang="NL">
      <D:displaynname>Kikkers in de koek</D:displayname>
    </D:prop>
   </D:set>
