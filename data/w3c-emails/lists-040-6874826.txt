Nah, that is a bit too extreme. There are clients that may not be able to
interpret all the properties, but still needs to retrieve them. These are
clients that deal with arbitrary properties as blobs.

allprop is needed to avoid a multiple-trip to fetch names then values. Let's
also consider what would be needed if you're trying to do an allprop on a
tree. You would need to issue a PROPFIND/propname with a Depth:1, then issue
N PROPFINDs to get each set of properties from the resources. That is just
*way* too burdensome.

The alternative is a PROPFIND/allprop with Depth:1 as a single fetch for the
properties of a collection and its members.
