I agree. I think this is what I said as well :-)

Yes. The current wording isn't very precise because if refer's to the
property's value without having defined what the property value actually is.
However, I would claim that if intent was to say that xml:lang should be
persisted only for child elements of the property element, this would have
been redundant anyway (I thought we agree that attributes of child elements
of the property element need to be persisted anyway, right?).

Seems that after all we agree :-)
