Toss the timing stuff. The revised text should simply state that clients
MUST NOT use the capability. Some existing clients will "not conform" for a
bit, but that is not our problem, and it probably won't be an issue anyways.

I agree with this one, but it could be a troublesome change. mod_dav
normally disallows Depth:infinity PROPFINDs (unless the server is confiured
to allow them), so maybe clients are used to sending a Depth:0 or 1. Hard to
say. The point is that a client that doesn't send a depth header, and
expects a depth of infinity is going to be very surprised by a Depth:0
response.
