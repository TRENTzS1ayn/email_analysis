Hey everyone.  I didn't mean to silence everyone with my note below.   I
think Jim still needs opinions to figure out the disposition of this issue.
Do we have any more comments?

I'll propose that we put this off until we know if there is an actual
problem.  Perhaps someone who felt there was a problem could speak up and
add an opinion.  Do you still think there is a problem that we need to
solve?

J.

The issue isn't tossing allprop, but providing a warning to clients about
dealing with expensive computed properties.

Removing allprop does not solve the computed problem. Since allprop *is*
useful, then there is no reason to remove it.

I agree with Greg.  We can still have this size problem with depth one and
depth zero.  And FTP's MGET can have a similar problem and we don't hear
people complaining about that.  Are we being overly concerned?  We as
authors of the spec can't know if this is a problem in advance either.
Sometimes it will be and other times it won't be.  Let's just deal with
what a client or server can do in situations where they feel it's a
problem.

So...

Is it sufficient for a client to simply disconnect/timeout?  Should we have
an error code that the server can use if it deems a request too expensive?
Or is there some other simple approach?  Or should we defer the issue until
version 2.0 if it then looks like this truly is a problem?
