There is still a problem to solve, and it's not directly the expensive
computations, though it is a result of that.  Now that specs which extend
RFC 2518 explicitly state that their properties should not be returned in an
'allprop', it no longer has the meaning it used to and clients need to be
made aware of that.  "Cat out of bag".

From the client point of view, 'allprop' could be deprecated, repurposed, or
renamed.
 - Deprecated would amount to "don't use allprop".
 - Repurposed would be "use it, but it doesn't mean what you think it means
(it doesn't return all properties)".
 - Renamed it would presumably be 'coreprop' and return the properties
defined in RFC2518 (except perhaps for lockdiscovery).
