WebDAV people:  RFC2518 leaves it carefully open whether 'getlastmodified'
changes when properties of the resource change.  It seems useful either
way -- users might want to get the last time the content was changed, or
they might want to see the last time the file was touched at all.  Is there
some precedent?  Really, one might best be served by a new timestamp
property, so the suite of timestamp-like properties would be
 - creationdate
 - time the content was last modified (etag changes, but etag doesn't
provide a timestamp)
 - time the file was last touched

Which one of the last two is most commonly handled by getlastmodified?
Implementors speak up?

DeltaV people: What does it mean to get the time file content was last
"modified", if the file is versioned?  I don't see that the behaviour of
getlastmodified is specified for a Version-Controlled Resource, can this be
a recommendation in the spec to promote consistency?  For one thing, should
'getlastmodified' on the VCR change when it is checked out, or when it is
checked in, or both?
