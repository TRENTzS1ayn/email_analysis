I don't have a problem with allowing dav:resourcetype to list all of the
abstract interfaces that a resource supports, as I mentioned in my last
mail.  However, this should only be done as part of a general RFC2518
revision, IMHO.

The original intent of the semantics property was to allow clients to
be able to evaluate an ACL, or give the user some clue as to how the
ACL will be evaluated by the server, so the client knows how to author
them.  It wasn't intended as a general capabilities discovery method.

As far as your specific suggestions, my take is:

* Recursive groups:  this is getting into the area of user/group admin,
which we are explicitly trying to stay out of.  We also
don't allow you to ask all of the groups you are a member
of.  I'm not sure there is a lot of support for going into
this area in the first rev of the spec.  However, if we
were to do so, we could add either a <dav:isRecursive>
property to principal collections or make that a defined
element tag allowed in <dav:resourcetype> (as per that
discussion).

* Inheritance policy:  the only people who cared about this were me (Oracle)
& Anne Hopkins (Microsoft), and Anne recently left Microsoft.
Our implementations were different enough that it would be
good to see what other people wanted before doing something
interoperable here so we deferred this to a later "Advanced"
spec.

* The list of writeable properties may or may not include owner, but this is
a general RFC2518 problem.  Perhaps we should have a property
that lists writeable property names rather than trying to put
the list of writeable live properties in the spec.

See above comment.

There are way too many ways to specify the default ACL to get good
interoperability.
You can specify a default ACL per user (like the Unix UMASK).  You can
specify
a default ACL per directory (Apache allows this).  You can specify a default
ACL by type (Principals have this default ACL).  Perhaps each user wants to
specify their own ACL for a particular type (when I create a particular type
of resource, it should have this ACL).  That's why I think we should defer
this
to the "Advanced" spec.

If we extend <dav:resourcetype> to list the set of supported interfaces on
the resource, we probably need a "Interface <blah> not supported" error
code.
