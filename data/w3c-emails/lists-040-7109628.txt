re: WebDAV.

My vote would be changing getlastmodified when the properties change.  As we
use properties more and more, they become a true part of the file in the
user experience.  Trying to distinguish between the two ("I know you changed
the billing number yesterday, but you didn't change the _content_ so the
date still reads last week...") can be difficult.

Unfortunately, it's a very easy shorthand for server implementations to use
the file last-modified date for getlastmodified, and for the operating
systems I know that reflects the date/time of the last content modification.

Subject: File creation date, version creation date, and getlastmodified



WebDAV people:  RFC2518 leaves it carefully open whether 'getlastmodified'
changes when properties of the resource change.  It seems useful either
way -- users might want to get the last time the content was changed, or
they might want to see the last time the file was touched at all.  Is there
some precedent?  Really, one might best be served by a new timestamp
property, so the suite of timestamp-like properties would be
 - creationdate
 - time the content was last modified (etag changes, but etag doesn't
provide a timestamp)
 - time the file was last touched

Which one of the last two is most commonly handled by getlastmodified?
Implementors speak up?

DeltaV people: What does it mean to get the time file content was last
"modified", if the file is versioned?  I don't see that the behaviour of
getlastmodified is specified for a Version-Controlled Resource, can this be
a recommendation in the spec to promote consistency?  For one thing, should
'getlastmodified' on the VCR change when it is checked out, or when it is
checked in, or both?
