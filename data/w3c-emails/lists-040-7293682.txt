Euh, how does the propname help the computed live prop case? If I fetch all
the names, then fetch the values, then I've still slammed the server with a
bunch of computed props.

Removing allprop does not help this scenario at all.

When did that go in? That seems to be a direct violation of RFC 2518.

It is *NOT* trivial. If you want to do a Depth:1, then the client is going
to have to create a union of all the resources' prop names, then do the
fetch for those props. Next, it will need to deal with the 404 that it will
get for the props that weren't available on all resources.

Trivial? Bah.
