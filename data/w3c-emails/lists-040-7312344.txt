When a version-controlled resource is checked-out it's contents and dead
properties will _already_ be the same as those of the version identified by
the DAV:checked-in property, so no update is required.

...so saying the "timestamp clearly should be updated" was totally bogus.
The act of checking-out a version-controlled resource only updates the live
properties of the resource, and 'clearly' this should *not* update the
DAV:getlastmodified timestamp<g>
Sorry for causing confusion.
