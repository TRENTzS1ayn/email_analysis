Causing the update of a live property is usually not obvious.  For example,
changing the DAV:getlastmodified value is achieved by PUT-ing new content,
changing the DAV:successor-set of a version is achieved by creating a
version whose DAV:predecessor-set identifies that version, and so on.

My point is that if, say, a versioning unaware client uses PROPFIND with
DAV:allprop and retrieves the name and value of the DAV:successor-set
property, the best the client can likely do is to render the XML value some
way that is not going to be very meaningful; and the client certainly isn't
going to know how to change that value.
