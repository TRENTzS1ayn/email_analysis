It may be common, but it isn't very interesting, especially since a client
likely cannot display the value in a meaningful way or update the value.

No dispute that people can write dumb and/or harmful clients.

I'm actually indifferent to removing allprop -- but I do think that the
default for no body and no Depth: header being allprop depth infinity is
bizzare.

Not really.  Delta-V was spec'd to not return all versioning properties in
allprop requests _because_ it was felt that the response would be too
expensive for servers to compute, and the scenarios where a client can
really make use of all the versioning values taken at a point in time are
limited if not minimal.

If the issue is tackled in RFC2518 then there would be less incentive for
Delta-V to take such a stance.
