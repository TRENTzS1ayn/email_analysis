"clearly" is not all that clear :-) ... assuming it is left in, then I
believe we'll make some guidance as to how clients should use it, and what
servers can do when they see it. But changing its semantics would be a
backwards-compat bitch.

IMO, we just note that servers are allowed to return errors on
allprop/infinity if they want to (just because, or because they see that it
will be too expensive).

Yes. It is burdensome when the existing specification meets my needs
exactly.

Nobody has yet shown that the existing spec is *broken*. The only thing
raised so far is "it bogs the server when computed props exist" and the
alternative to do a propname/propfind; but the alternative has the *same*
server performance characteristics. And I maintain worse perf from a
systemwide standpoint.

Personally, I would recommend leaving it just as it is, with a note in the
spec that the server can return <this> error in certain cases. The client
should interpret that as "whoops. we asked too much" and back off to a nicer
algorithm. (and better yet, just start with the nice one)


For my particular scenario, the "fetch by namespace" would be ideal. I could
put all of the SVN user properties into a particular namespace and just
fetch those.
