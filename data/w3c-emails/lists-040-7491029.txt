Easy, even if it were needed.  Redefine "allprop" as "all properties defined
in 2518".

But I question whether it's needed.  Since not all servers return all
RFC2518 properties in response to allprop (e.g. not returning
DAV:lockdiscovery), and since obviously clients and servers across the globe
aren't already broken, is any client relying on allprop for getting all
properties?
