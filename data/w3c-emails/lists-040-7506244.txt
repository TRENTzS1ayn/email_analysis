Greg (and Jason seems to agree):

Personally, I would recommend leaving it just as it is, with a note in the
spec that the server can return <this> error in certain cases. The client
should interpret that as "whoops. we asked too much" and back off to a
nicer
algorithm. (and better yet, just start with the nice one)

I also agree, but think the default should probably be changed to depth 0.
Althought clients are free to deal with that too. DAV4J's
Resource.getProperties() method uses a depth 0 default in its marshalling.
It doesn't really matter what the protocol specifies. Clients can use what
they want. allprop is just one option for getting properties. If servers
are slow or fail on it, client writers will discover this and adjust
accordingly. I don't think there's any need for the protocol to try to
solve it any further. Some servers can return all the properties pretty
fast. As slow as the DAV4J server is on most operations, it can return all
the properties pretty fast since they're all in a single XML document.
Depth infinity isn't that slow either, but their might be a lot of files
returned!
