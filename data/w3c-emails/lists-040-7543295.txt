GoLive 5 uses "PROPFIND ALLPROP" (with depth 0/1) for retrieving properties of
resources on the server; we are  *not*  using "ALLPROP" with "depth infinity"
(but - btw - we are using "PROPFIND PROP" with "depth infinity"). It should be
not a big deal for us to replace our "PROPFIND ALLPROP" with "PROPFIND PROP" in
future releases. Therefore - regarding future releases - it's not a big problem
for us if "ALLPROP" does not longer exist in the spec.

On the other hand:
GoLive 5 is using "ALLPROP" so - for compatiblity reasons - its  *very*
important that existing servers keep there support for "ALLPROP" for a while;
GoLive 5 relies on "ALLPROP" and  is  *not*  able to work with a server which
does not support "ALLPROP".

Best, Hartmut
