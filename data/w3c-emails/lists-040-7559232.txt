Hmm, not sure why this message was caught by the spam filter; for some
reason Lisa was bumped from the list.  I've added lisa@xythos.com to the
accept2 list -- Lisa,let me know if I should re-add you to the list as well.

This sounds so similar to the "structured documents" that were discussed on
this list ages ago.  As I recall, one of the scenarios for having a resource
that was a cross between a collection and a document was to gather a web
page together with its images in one place.  In some ways, it's treated like
a single document -- the browsing client should just see the resultant web
page when they try to view the resource.

Yaron's brief proposal:

Judith's elaboration:

Jim's issues and clarifications:

The draft "draft-hopmann-collection-props-00.txt" had a property related to
this, "isstructureddocument".  I replied to some questions about the intent
of this property:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1999JanMar/0028.html

I'm not at all sure that the model that would work for web pages (which have
multiple independent pieces) would work for your assets, but it's possible
that some of the same mechanisms could apply.  I think there is some common
ground:

 - A casually browsing client usually needs to see a "structured document"
or "asset" as a single resource, with a dominant view.  They may not need to
understand anything about the interior structure.
 - When dealing with casually browsing clients or old clients, the server
can pretend that the resource is a simple resource with a content-type of
html, ms-word, pdf or whatever the content-type of the "default" document
inside the container is.
 - An advanced client may need to break open the container to examine or
deal with the pieces, but probably not all the time.  E.g. the container
would be broken open when editing or changing structure (e.g. deleting
pieces, deleting old versions).
 - While the contents of the container may be versioned, the container
itself may not be (unclear).
