It would be better to specify which ones cannot be live (client must be
capable of writing them) and which ones cannot be dead (client is never
allowed to write them), since that is the interoperability concern.  I'm
not sure if that covers the whole set (i.e., some may depend on the way
that a resource is implemented).

Oh, and the issue should be labelled LIVE_AND_LET_DIE, because webdav
just isn't funny enough yet to reach draft standard status.
