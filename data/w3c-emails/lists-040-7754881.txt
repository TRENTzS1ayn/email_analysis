Hello,
 
1) Would it be possible with DETA-V to have different access control list
for different versions of a resource, e.g. V1 of resource /foo will allow
user A to modify and read, but V2 of resource /foo will allow user A to read
read only?
 
2) Would it be possible to have two distinct locks on two different
(working) resources?
 
 
Does that make sense at all?

 
Best regards
 
Juergen Pill
