That's why I brought it up.  I thought we could resolve this without too
much more debate.

Geoff cited a number of cases where an administrative type of person might
want to move whole directory trees while a user is editing a file.  On UNIX,
this wouldn't be a problem, since the client would have an open file
descriptor, and the data would still get saved.  In WebDAV, the client would
have to process the 302 and use the new URL.

O(log(n)) can still be expensive as n grows, and some people want a very
large n on their website.  It's not like it's horrible, though, either.
Keeping track of open locks that must be moved is much easier, however,
since my guess is that the number of open locks will be less than log(n)
on most systems.  So, allowing LOCKED files to move is still less of a
performance burden.

I don't care that much if we want to say that WebDAV locks must always
lock the part of the namespace needed by that URL, or if we provide
clients a choice (it's clear that we must provide a way to lock the
namespace, though).  I think we should just be clear in the spec as to
what locks do, though.
