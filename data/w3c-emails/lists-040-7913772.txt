*wiping egg from face*

The only purpose of my comment was a minor swipe at a well-known difference
between IETF and W3C process (openness of membership, and voting vs. rough
consensus). Given that it is well known, and that discussion of W3C vs IETF
process is off-topic for this list, I shouldn't have even said anything in
my post.

I will freely admit that there is large overlap between W3C and IETF working
groups, and that they are composed of very sharp, dedicated technical people
working on gnarly, tough problems to produce high quality technical
specifications.

I will also freely admit that there are times when the W3C process achieves
better results than the IETF process, HTML being an excellent example.

Agreed. I don't know what got into me today.
