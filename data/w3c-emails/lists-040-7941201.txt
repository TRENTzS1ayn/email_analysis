Another idea is to tweak the RDF photo metadata project code, described at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf/

To use DAV properties.  At present, it returns the RDF metadata using HTTP
content negotiation -- ask for text/rdf or text/* and you get RDF, otherwise
you get the image.  Seems like it wouldn't be that difficult to add code to
have Jigsaw to output this metadata information in a DAV property...
