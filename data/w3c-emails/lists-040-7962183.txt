Good idea! There's been a little discussion of this on the sinister and
secretive W3C www-annotation list(*), 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/2001JanJun/

Since Yves is involved in RDFPic, and Libby works with me at ILRT, this
might prove fun. I bought a digital camera recently so I'm all in
favour of better ways of interacting with such content. And I happen to
be sat on top of a wealth of interesting if unsettling image data +
metadata (http://www.brisbio.ac.uk/) so there's certainly testbed
content available, again perhaps student project material?
