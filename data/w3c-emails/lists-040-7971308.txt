That cites a case why people (an administrator) would want to move
resource,
not my point about why people would want to allow a resource that they have
locked to be moved by someone else.  I'm sure there are other cases where
people would want to move resources and they might happen to be locked by
someone else, but my point was that it doesn't seem likely
that anyone would want to allow someone else to move the resource they have
locked because it probably would prevent them from putting their change on
the
server.  For this reason, if they were given a choice, I assume they'd say
they'd
want to lock the resource, so giving them an option doesn't seem like an
effective
approach.  But it might be and I offered two situations where I think they
might be
willing to let their locked resource move, but those *seem* unlikely.

I was somewhat in error.  The "n" I cited for O(log(n)) the number of
collections
in the namespace, not the resources in the name space of that site.  That
obviously likely to be much smaller.  In fact I just did an informal survey
of 1200 websites on the web.  It looks like the average depth of a resource
is about 3 directories deep.  At the max I saw a handful of resources at
6 levels deep.  A couple sites made heavy use of resources 5 collections
deep.

It's not like it's horrible, though, either.
Keeping track of open locks that must be moved is much easier, however,
since my guess is that the number of open locks will be less than log(n)
on most systems.  So, allowing LOCKED files to move is still less of a
performance burden.

Yup.  I'd expect it to be less also.  Just not much less.

It seems like making locks also protect the namespace is the way to go.
Have I missed something?
