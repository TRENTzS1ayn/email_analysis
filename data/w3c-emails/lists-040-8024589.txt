I've run into a minor issue relating to XML syntax and WebDAV extensibility.

I'm parsing:
<D:href>http://myserver.com/</D:href>

Since an XML element can legally contain both text and elements (e.g.
<P>Hello <em>sailor!</em></P>), it's conceivable that in the future the
<href> element could be extended to have:

<D:href>http://myserver.com/
  <expires>123486</expires>
  more-stuff
</D:href>

RFC 2518 says:
   "All DAV compliant resources MUST ignore any unknown XML element and
   all its children encountered while processing a DAV method that uses
   XML as its command language."

That would indicate that I should ignore the <expires> element.  I can do
that.  But what does "ignore" mean?
 - Do I treat it as a separator so that "http://myserver.com/" is one text
child of DAV:href and "more-stuff" is another text child?  How do I know
which one to treat as the URL, particularly if they both look like urls?
 - Do I conceptually remove the ignored element?  That would leave
<DAV:href> with a single text child containing white space, approximately:
"http://myserver.com/  more-stuff".

Since all this is rather ugly, I'd most like to have a sentence added to RFC
2518 (section 14?) that states at a minimum that "text elements should NOT
have their syntax extended by adding XML elements because this is unlikely
to be backward-compatible."  I think we already instinctively follow this
guideline, but it's hard to write solid code based on guesses and
predictions that aren't written down.

Any other proposals or insights?
