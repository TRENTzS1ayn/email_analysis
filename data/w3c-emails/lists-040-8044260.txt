I see what you mean, however as we extend WebDAV we frequently update the
XML Schema/DTD.  E.g. we are considering taking propfind and adding an
<include> element to a container that coudln't previously hold that element.
What's the difference between that and updating the schema for an element
that contains strings?

Adding new elements to containers that already hold XML elements seems like
A Good Way to extend DAV.
Adding new elements to containers that previously only held text seems like
A Bad Way to extend DAV.  If there's consensus on this, perhaps we could
state as much.
