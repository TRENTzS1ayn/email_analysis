I think this makes the most sense. You could also define it as

- remove unknown child elements,
- use DOM's normalize() method (or equivalent in your API)
- use the value of the resulting text node

I agree it's ugly, but maybe it needs to be done nevertheless. How about
just describing the "correct" way to get the text value?
