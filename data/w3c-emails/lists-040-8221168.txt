The idea was to be specific here to avoid "polluting" PROPFIND replies with
unnecessary information (as seen, for instance, in IIS).

I think you misread.

PROPPATCH, when a datatype was supplied and recognized, is going to report
that by adding it to it's response body:

"The server should indicate successfull detection and parsing of the typed
value by setting the xsi:type attribute on the property element in the
response body.".

An old server will never do this upon PROPPATCH. So this remark applies to
PROPPATCH, not a subsequent PROPFIND.

Thanks.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to extend this for passing arrays (I've
got a proposal for using the SOAP encoding ready...)?
