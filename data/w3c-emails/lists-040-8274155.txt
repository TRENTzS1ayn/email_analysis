Hi

[snip...]

As an aside, you asked about the status of datatypes in XML.

The XML Schema spec, which includes a datatypes spec, is now a W3C
recommendation. See...

http://www.w3.org/XML/
-> http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema
-> http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/

BTW In the RDFCore WG, we'll be looking at ways of incorporating the XML
Schema datatypes into the RDF information
model. See WG homepage at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ to track
this work if you're interested. RDF took a similar view to the one
outlined recently here: wait for the XML groups to define some basic
datatypes, then figure out how best to use them.
