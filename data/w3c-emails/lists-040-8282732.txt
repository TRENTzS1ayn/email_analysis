I think that putting datatype information into literals makes sense, and
with XML Schema (Part 2 I think) . I recently proposed a method for
specifiying data types upon PROPPATCH [1], a similar method could be
introduced for basicsearch as well, for instance:

<literal xsi:type="xs:dateTime">2001-06-14T13:31:00Z</literal>

As for querying structured properties, I think DASL should rely on the
technologies that have been defined for this (XPath). One could even
conceive writing the full query as XSLT :-).
