Any client retrieving a property whose type is unknown to them would
benefit. For example, if a RFC2518 (but not DeltaV) aware client retrieved
a DeltaV property it seems unfair that the client was not told of its data
type simply because "the property's data type is defined in [RFC2518] or a
related specification."  It does not make clients forward compatible with
those future specifications.

Agreed, there is a default.

Yes.  For clients that are expecting a known type the information will be
redundant.

You don't have to specify the negotiation, and there are examples of this
approach in DeltaV error reporting.

It was generally agreed on this list a while back that total success may be
condensed to a simple 200 OK response.  Your suggestion would require a
further modification to these servers.
