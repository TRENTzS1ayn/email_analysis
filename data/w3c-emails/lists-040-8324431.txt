Understood. So would it possibly make sense to to change the wording to "he
property's data type is defined in [RFC2518]" (leaving other specifications
out)? I still think we don't need to return the types for RFC2518 defined
properties...

I see. Maybe this should be put onto the issues list then (for resolution in
RFC2518).

Do you think it would be a problem to require the 207 <multistatus> response
in this case?
