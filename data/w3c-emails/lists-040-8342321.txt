Tao,

A null resource is defined as ??a resource which responds with a 404 (Not
Found) to any HTTP/1.1 or DAV method except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS and
 LOCK?.  In other words, a null resource is one that does not physically
exist on the server, but whose URL does.  Locking a null resource has the
effect of reserving the URL.  In this way, a write-locked null resource (or
lock-null resource) ensures that no other user can use the specified URL
until it is unlocked.

Cheers,

Mike
