Hi, all:

 I am new to this list and I would like to ask some questions.
1. Is there any way to apply any kinds of WebDAV methods, such as 
PROPFIND, LOCK, etc., to a specific part of the content, for example, 
a specific node in an xml document?

2. If there are no such ways available, have there ever been a 
discussion about nearly related topic?

I'm very sorry for my bad English.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Thanks a lot!
Yours
