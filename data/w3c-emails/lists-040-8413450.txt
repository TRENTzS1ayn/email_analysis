The RFC2518 defined properties are:
creationdate
displayname
getcontentlanguage
getcontentlength
getcontenttype
getetag
getlastmodified
lockdiscovery
resourcetype
source
supportedlock

So the only ones that I believe would return type info (using the xs:string
- exclusion rule) are
creationdate -> dateTime
getContentLength -> nonNegativeInteger
getLastModified -> dateTime

So although I don't think it would be a great overhead for servers to
return these each time, I don't really care either way.

What is the issue? I don't think that there is any great harm to interop if
some servers respond with 200OK and others return 207MultiStatus with 200OK
for each response.

You may get pushback from some server writers.
