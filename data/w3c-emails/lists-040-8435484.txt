Tim, thanks for the summary.

Now I'm tempted to agree that these should be returned. A minor issue is
with DAV:getlastmodified, because it's format isn't xs:dateTime, meaning
that we have to define a datatype for it in the spec. That's why I'd still
prefer to leave them out.

The issue is that after reading the spec (and tracing IIS), authors of
client software might think that they'll always get a 207 which apparently
isn't the case (so I think this should be clarified).

Well, unless somebody suggests a better approach, I'll have to live with
that.
