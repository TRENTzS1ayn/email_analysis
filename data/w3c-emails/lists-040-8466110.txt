Yes, it is certainly possible for a server to perform a mapping of the
structure of a document into its namespace. Use of XPointer is one such
possibility.

When we developed the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol, one of our
design rules was to avoid requiring the server to have any knowledge about
the internal structure of a document. However, an individual server is
certainly free to do so.
