Actually, the specification is correct, though it takes a careful read to
see that.

There is a difference between a "null" resource, and a "lock null" resource.
The definition of a "null" resource, as given in Section 3, is correct. Lock
null resources are defined in Section 7.4. A null resource does not belong
to its parent collection, and does not respond to UNLOCK. Perhaps a better
way to express this concept is that what we termed a "null resource" is
really an "unmapped URL". That is, the URL is not mapped to a resource. This
avoids the philosophical question of "is a null resource a resource"? By
calling it an unmapped URL, a "null resource" is clearly not a resource.

A lock-null resource is a null resource that has been locked.  A lock null
resource has diferent properties that a null resource. Specifically, it has
at least the lock discovery properties, and it is a member of its parent's
collection.

Since a lock null resource has state, I would claim it is a resource. By the
act of a client taking out a lock, they have likely made a mapping of a URL
to a conceptual resource, and are int he process of fleshing out the
computer representation of the conceptual resource.
