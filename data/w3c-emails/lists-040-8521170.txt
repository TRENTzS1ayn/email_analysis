The more I think of this, the more confused I become.  Maybe that's not
unusual, but ...

I agree with all of this. (Despite Section 3 of RFC2518 that states clearly
that a null resource is a resource.)

I think that calling it "null resource" is very misleading since we agree
it is not a resource.  I'll use your "unmapped-URL" term for now to help
distinguish.

http://ces.ucsc.edu/bogus/bogus/bogus.html is an unmapped-URL, got it.

Or in the new phraseology, "a lock-null resource is an unmapped-URL that
has been locked".

Hmm, that doesn't sound right does it?  A resource is-a URL?

And not _all_ unmapped-URLs (in DAV compliant namespace) can be locked.
It seems that we need to augment "unmapped-URL" with "where the immediate
parent exists".

Agreed.  Moving the server state of an 'unmapped-URL where the immediate
parent exists' from no resource to a resource should, IMHO, respond with
201 Created.
