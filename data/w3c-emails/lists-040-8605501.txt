This spec is cool.  I think it should be folded into the new RFC2518.

>    This specification extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
>    to support datatyping on property values.  Protocol elements are
>    defined to let clients and servers specify the type of a property,
>    and to instruct the WebDAV method PROPFIND to return datatype
>    information.

>    able to take advantage of it when modifying a property.
> 
>    On the other hand, when setting new properties, it can be desirable
>    to pass data type information along with the value.  A server can
>    take advantage of this information to optimize storage and to perform
>    additional parsing (for instance of dates).

> 3. Overview of data types
> 
>    Although WebDAV property types can be anything that can be marshalled
>    as content of an XML element, in many cases they actually are simple
>    types like integers, booleans or dates.  "XML Schema Part 2:
>    Datatypes" [XS2] defines a set of simple types which can be used as a
>    basis for supplying type information to attributes.
> 
>    Data type information is represented using the attribute "type" from
>    the XML Schema namespace "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance".
>    In XML Schema, data types are qualified names, and the XML Schema
>    recommendation defines a set of built-in datatypes (section 3 of
>    [XS2]), defined in the namespace "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema".
> 
>    To avoid unnecessary verbosity, data type information should only be
>    supplied if it adds usable information to the protocol.  In
>    particular, type information is not required for live properties
>    defined in WebDAV [RFC2518] and related standards and properties of
>    type "xs:string".
> 
>    A server may implement any combination of datatypes, both from the
>    XML Schema recommendation and possibly from other namespaces.

> 4. Changes for PROPPATCH method
> 
>    If the property element has an XML attribute named "xsi:type", the
>    server may use this information to select an optimized representation
>    for storing the property value.  For instance, by specifying a type
>    as "xs:boolean", the client declares the property value to be of type
>    boolean (as defined in [XS2]).  The server may choose any suitable
>    internal format for persisting this property, and in particular is
>    allowed to fail the request if the format given does not fit the
>    format defined for this type.
> 
>    The server should indicate successful detection and parsing of the
>    typed value by setting the xsi:type attribute on the property element
>    in the response body (this implies that it should return a
>    MULTISTATUS status code and a <multistatus> response body).

> 6. Compatibility Considerations
> 
>    This specification does not introduce any new protocol elements, nor
>    does it change the informal WebDAV DTD.  It merely specifies
>    additional server semantics for the case where clients submit
>    additional data type information in an attribute on the property
>    element (previously undefined), and adds an additional attribute on
>    property elements upon PROPFIND.
> 
>    Clients not aware of this specification should not supply the
>    "xsi:type" attribute on property elements (after all, this attribute
>    belongs to the XML Schema-Instance namespace which has been defined
>    for exactly this purpose).  Old clients should also ignore additional
>    attributes on property elements returned by PROPFIND (and similar
>    methods), although the WebDAV specification only defines this
>    behaviour for unknown elements (and is silent about unknown
>    attributes).
> 
>    Servers not aware of this specification either drop the "xsi:type"
>    attribute, or persist it along with the property value.  However,
>    they will never indicate successful parsing of the data type by
>    returning back the type in the response to PROPPATCH.
