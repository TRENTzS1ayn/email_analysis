When you do a LOCK on a null resource then a lock-null resource is created.

I also find this confusing, and I posted a message in response to Jim
Whitehead's explanation which explains my confusion.  If I get a reply it
may answer both our questions :-)

Not _any_ URI, but any URI where the immediate parent collection already
exists.

You are as close to understanding it as I am :-)

Essentially both.  The lock applies to the resource (you cannot change its
content or dead properties) and to the internal members along the URI path
(you cannot remove or rebind those members i.e. by DELETE or MOVE or COPY)
so that the resource cannot disappear out from under you.

Caveat: I've built my own mental model of how this works because, IMHO,
RFC2518 does a poor job of describing it.  I stand to be corrected ...
better still I'd sit to have it explained clearly to me.

I agree that this text is confusing.  FWIW my rule of thumb is that if the
status code applies _only_ to the resource at the request-URI then 207
Multi Status is not used (i.e. 404 Not Found, 301 Moved Permanently, and so
on).  207 Multi Status is returned when the result applies to the resource
identified by the request-URI and other resources (i.e. depth > 0) *or* the
response applies to any number of properties.

There is no such definition around to my knowledge.  I also haven't heard
of anyone using a body for MKCOL for their own devious means -- did you
have a plan?

Do you mean in the spec. or in the world in general?
In the spec. it is those properties whose syntax and semantics are enforced
by the server, i.e. all those in Section 13.  In the world there is no such
registry.

You are expected not to use the DAV namespace (despite what you might see
in some implementations).

Strange isn't it?!  BTW this is explicitly overruled by the bindings

I believe this is the issue OVERWRITE_DELETE_ALL_TOO_STRONG on the WebDAV
issues list http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/issues.html

That is your choice as a server implementer.  These URLs to a version are
server generated and servers are not obliged to expose "/his/" as a
resource.

Agreed.

The questions were clearly written and beautifully formatted :-)
Shame about the answers.
