When that was written, I had a different model in my head.  In that model, a
null resource was in fact a resource, but all this resource ever did was
respond with "404" to everything.  Pretty dull resource.

But, I now think the "unmapped URL" is much closer to the idea I wanted to
capture by this term.

Now a lock-null resource would be a *resource* with:

* null (or undefined, take your pick) state
* properties as defined in 7.4

That is, by reserving the name, you have explicitly created a mapping
between a URL and some abstraction, whose state will be fleshed out later.

Good point.

This makes sense to me. My concern is that it would still be nice for the
first PUT after a lock-null is created to also return a 201.
