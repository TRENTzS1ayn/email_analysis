Just double checked MKCOL. It of course returns 201 upon success, never 200.
So your above suggestion would match MKCOL as well. Assuming no errors,
expected behaviour would be:

1) Client issues LOCK, "creating" an LNR, returns 201.
2) Client issues PUT or MKCOL on the LNR, either of which return 201.

Which of course is consistent, duh.
