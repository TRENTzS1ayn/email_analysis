I am a Newbie, but I am using WebDAV in my work and I have been
following the thread for a couple of weeks now.  Would it be possible to
make the error for 400: Bad Request a little more specific?  It would be
nice to have something along the lines of the following examples:
 
40x: Bad Request: Metatag '<foo>' not supported
 
40x: Bad Request: Metatag start tag '<prop>' does not match end tag
'</propertyupdate>'
 
40x: Bad Request: Request not well-formed
