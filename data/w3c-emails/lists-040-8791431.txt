I'm also interested in working on DASL some more.  Xythos has implemented
it, including the basicsearch grammar :)

Although an XPath or XMLQuery syntax would be useful, basicsearch is also
useful and should not be dropped:
 - it can easily be translated into SQL for clients or servers that already
support SQL
 - it is very simple for very simple tasks
 - it can be implemented even by servers concerned about limiting their
performance "liability", because it can do very high-level searches and
restrict what properties can be searched.  (Servers don't have to support
any features which require parsing of the body or property syntaxes.  Since
parsing can be expensive, XPath/XMLQuery impose a far greater performance
liability.)
 - it's very suited for directory contents listing, filters and sorting --
common browser tasks, easily automated.  E.g. only show items created since
<date>.  Only show items created by <principal>.
