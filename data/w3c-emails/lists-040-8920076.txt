   Interesting question. Since it is a resource, it makes sense that
   you can bind to it.

I disagree (strongly :-).  There are a large variety of things that
you cannot do to a lock null resource.  BIND should be one of them.
(In fact, just about everything should be one of them :-).  A
lock null resource is just a mechanism (hack :-) to expose a URL that
is locked but that currently is not bound to a resource.
If you want to see just how bad the lock null mechanism really is,
just compare any two implementations of lock null resources, and
notice how different/non-interoperable they are.

   So I'd say, yes. But, I'd understand if servers
   decided to fail such a request.

I'd say "no", and all servers should be required to fail such a request.

   I just gave it a quick look, and it seems like the BIND protocol
   specification does not mention lock null resources.

That is an omission (somewhat conscious, because I try to ignore
lock null resources in hopes that they will be replaced with a
more sensible form of lock discovery).  If it looks like we can't
make lock null resources go away, we need to update the BIND
protocol to explicitly disallow binding to a lock null resource.

More than acceptable, commendable (:-).

Cheers,
