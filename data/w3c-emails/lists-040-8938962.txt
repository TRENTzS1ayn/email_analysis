Author(s): G. Clemm, A. Hopkins, E. Sedlar, J. Whitehead
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-acl-06.txt

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and message 
bodies that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV 
Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to 
remotely read and modify access control lists that instruct a server 
whether to grant or deny operations upon a resource (such as HTTP 
method invocations) by a given principal

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-acl-06.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
