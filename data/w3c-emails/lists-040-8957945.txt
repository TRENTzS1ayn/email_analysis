Hi Folks,
 I'm running into something that I could use some help with. I'm
trying to rename a collection and am receiving a 502 Bad Gateway.
It appears that if I use the hostname in the Destination header, ie,
webfolders.mydocsonline.com:80, then all goes well. However, if I resolve
it to its IP address and use that instead, 38.144.45.187:80,
then the command fails. Oh, the collection is empty in case that matters.

 Should the hostname and IP address be interchangable, or am I
required to always use the hostname as part of the Destination
header.  Below are copies of the working and non-working MOVE request.

Thanks in advance!

Michael
