This is only true for servers which lack support for cross-server copies.
Xythos, for example, supports this so the host and destination header 
can be different.

| I think this is misimplement of the server.
| As you know the RFC dosen't say about the using IP address or
| hostname in Destination header.

| But you must use the same host name(ot IP address) 
| in Host and Destination header.
