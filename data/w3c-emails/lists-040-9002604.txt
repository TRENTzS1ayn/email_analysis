You should be using the hostname if you know it. If your client is given
a hostname, then resolves it to the IP address, and uses that IP address
the Host header, that defeats the whole point of having the Host header
in the first place: name-based virtual hosting. Consider that a serious
client bug. :)

If your client is only told the IP address by the user, then I think
you're stuck, unless you do a reverse DNS lookup, which might not be a
good idea anyway. Apache/mod_dav won't like an IP address in the
Destination header in the default configuration[*], and MOVE/COPY will
return 502.

[*] though it can be configured to know the IP address with the
ServerAlias directive
