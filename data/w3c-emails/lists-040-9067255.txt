Sure.  Every Adobe client uses lock discovery frequently.  Uploading 
a multi-megabyte file via PUT only to have the server then tell you 
your lock is gone generally gives rise to a very bad user experience 
:^).  So we always try to discover workflow state changes before 
doing lengthy operations that expect a certain state.

Hard to know which LNR behavior you're referring to.  If you mean 
requiring a way to discover that the "URL" you "locked" is still 
locked then yes, definitely, see above.  If you mean requiring that 
such a resource vanish if you unlock without a PUT then no.
