As I recall, the DAV Explorer client <http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/> uses
lock discovery. I believe it's smart enough to do lock discovery if a
resource is locked, and DAV Explorer doesn't have the lock token. It then
tries the lock token on the off chance the requesting principal actually
owns the lock.

Or maybe we just talked about doing this, and never implemented it. I can't
remember -- Joe?

I don't believe DAV Explorer depends on LNRs in any way.
