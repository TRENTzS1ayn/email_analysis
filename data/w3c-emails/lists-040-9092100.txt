<<
As I recall, the DAV Explorer client <http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/> uses
lock discovery. I believe it's smart enough to do lock discovery if a
resource is locked, and DAV Explorer doesn't have the lock token. It then
tries the lock token on the off chance the requesting principal actually
owns the lock.

The spec deprecates that kind of client behavior for the reason that two
programs that don't know about each other might be logged on as the same
person, right?
