Not really -- an authoring program will at least know that it had to do lock
discovery to grab the lock token, and presumably would then query the user
for whether they want to grab the lock.

In the case of DAV Explorer, we felt that a user might want to undo a lock
taken out by themselves using another program as a way of either testing the
protocol (and applications), or undoing a lock after an app. had crashed.
