There is no Overwrite with PUT. Unless you use one of the If-* headers, PUT
will overwrite the existing resource (assuming permissions etc are okay).
This is the kind of thing LOCK is suppose to deal with.

There are lots of conditions and requests that conflict with each other, so
it is important. In fact, some servers have "undefined" behaviour.

Am I the only person who actually has no real big problem with lock-null
resources (LNRs) ?
