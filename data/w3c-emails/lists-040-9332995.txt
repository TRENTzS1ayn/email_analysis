I believe this can, and should, be solved with the consistent use of
"If-None-Match: *" in the PUT request, whenever a client is trying to create
a new resource.

Can you elaborate on how this is a different thing?  It might be just as
hard for servers to handle no-content resources (if they currently only
handle 0-length resources) as it is to support a lock-null resource.  At any
rate, I wouldn't support adding a completely new concept (no-content
resources) even if we did remove the lock-null concept.
