Am I the only person who actually has no real big problem with lock-null

I have no problem with them as long as we don't pretend they are anything
other than a null resource (with a lock rooted on them).   They really
aren't that strange.  It's mostly because we've felt compelled to say that
they are a real resource or a quasi-resouce that we've had confusion and
angst over the years.
