The DMS root I was referring to was the user interface to the DMS
application. That is, it comes up with menu bars with commands like
'display worklist'. The URLs are not normal resources - its more like
a CGI-bin application with lots of arguments encoded into the URL.

So the DMS urls do not relate to resources made available from WebDAV
in my particular application. So it seemed good to separate them.
