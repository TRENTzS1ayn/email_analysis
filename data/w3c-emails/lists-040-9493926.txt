I'd point out that in many systems, DELETE privilege is separate from
create(write) privilege.  UserA, creating a resource in a folder "owned" by
UserB, may well end up creating a resource that UserA cannot delete (perhaps
UserB can).  Thus they can't necessarily do cleanup.

This is a problem with any write operation that doesn't turn out the way the
user expects so I'd be happy if that problem was not solved at all,
particularly through a special case "disappearing" resource.
