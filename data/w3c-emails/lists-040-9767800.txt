Surely folks are doing some kind of spec. conformance tests against their
DAV servers.   How did you do it?

Has anyone fleshed these tests out into something available for others to
use to test against their servers as well?

What about developing some kind of test suite using SkunkDAV code to control
it?

Thanks,
    Erik
