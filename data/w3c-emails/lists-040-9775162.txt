Has side-by-side functionality left your production server in an unstable state?

What you have described is not a "problem", Douglas.

From What's New threads:

-Help , serverXMLHTTP fail

I use serverXMLHTTP to load a remote xml file, but it always tell me "access denied", here is my asp code: set XmlDoc =
Server.CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP") XmlDoc.open "GET", "http://www.xml101.com/examples/simple.xml", false,"",null
XmlDoc.send why, anybody can help me?

Use proxycfg.exe to configure proxy, can be downloaded somewhere in microsoft.com...

What's New says (NOTE* Fix for Gerbert's XML/WebDAV on Intranet issue):

"For servers running on an intranet, it's necessary to run the proxycfg.exe utility to configure WinHTTP to access HTTP and HTTPS
servers through a proxy server. For example, you would use the proxycfg.exe utility as part of the deployment and installation
process of an application that uses the ServerXMLHTTP component to access WinHTTP."

proxycfg.exe can be downloaded here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdn-files/027/001/468/Proxycfg.exe
For more information, please refer to the readme included with the download.


Finally, the most recent MS threads regarding WinHTTP:

-Is there any more information on WinHTTP. I would like to adjust the winHTTP Registry settings programmatically but can't find any
information on the structure of the key.
- Anonymous 20 Dec 2000

-Re: WinHTTP
No, at this time, the format of the WinHTTP proxy settings stored in the registry is not documented and cannot be changed
programmatically.

Happy New Year!

Does anyone know if this is simply another symptom of the problem MS has
with its wininet.dll?  It sounds very similar: connection won't close, etc.
They've got another web access interface now, in msxml3.dll, which
specifically avoids use of wininet (see
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q237/9/06.ASP), and they've
acknowledged it to be a problem.

So, if this is the same problem, we can at least know that it has been
recognized, and they know it needs to be fixed.

I have forgotten to mention that the fatal hang of the whole desktop happens
with MS Office 2000 SR-1. However, all other versions of WebFolders (there
are quite many of them: Office, IE, OS etc.) also don't shut down the TCPIP
connection, which can lead to interesting effects with some WebDAV servers
like IIS.

I am still not sure, if we are talking about the same bug. After the user
has pressed the Cancel button there are no more flying folders. Users won't
even notice that the connection is still open until they have Office SR-1.
