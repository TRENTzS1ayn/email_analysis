Stewart,

I am not completely sure, if I have understood your mail properly. As far as
I understand the WebDAV standard, it does not specifiy if the client
connection is done via a proxy or not. For me that means that a client has
to support any type of HTTP connection (also if MS is writing the client)
and if it can not handle direct HTTP it's simply a bug. Any TCPIP client
closes a connection, if the operation should be cancelled or at least sends
something saying: "Uh, I can't go on". MS WebDAV client does simply nothing.

Using a proxy is not really an option in many cases (I am still not sure if
it would help with our problem), because NTLM authentication does not work
via proxies. Again the WebDAV standard does not mention which HTTP
authentication method has to be used (which is not a flaw at all - WebDAV
shouldn't have to bother with authentication). Earlier versions of MSs
WebDAV client had severe problems with basic authentication, thus it worked
well only in combination with NTLM (or perhaps Digest) authentication.

What are you all thinking about this? Our customers pay a whole lot to
Microsoft to use their OSes and Office packages. (We are talking about
companies like Siemens, UBS etc.) Thus MS should provide a WebDAV
implementation, which is usable (at least with their own IIS WebDAV
implementation). First answer we got from all MS support levels was: "Why
don't you use Frontpage extensions?" which renders the IETF standard
useless.
