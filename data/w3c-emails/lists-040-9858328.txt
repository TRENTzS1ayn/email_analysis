I'm interested in seeing exactly how Microsoft Support phrased that answer, in context...
Could you forward that message to the list, or cut and paste the section you've quoted.
...wondering how FPX would be used, and whether this would cause some security issue.

It is not too surprising that the current versions have intractable
problems; releasing first-version code that works but not quite in all cases
is pretty standard -- and not only for Microsoft.  Honestly, I give them a
lot of credit for implementing the standard at all; I know of no other
company their size who has put WebDAV in both their flagship server (W2K)
and flagship client (Office2K) products.

However, the response "Why don't you use FrontPage extensions?" does worry
me.  Is this just ignorance of WebDAV from the support staff (which wouldn't
surprise me), or does it show a larger disregard for the protocol from
within Microsoft?  FrontPage extensions and WebDAV are -- in many respects
-- duplicate work.  If MS is dropping WebDAV in favor of FrontPage
extensions, or some other standard even, it could spell doom for a protocol
that has been (to say the least) widely ignored by the technical community.

Does anyone -- particularly from inside Microsoft -- care to comment on
this?  I'd really like some assurances, especially if they are backed up
with facts, that Microsoft is intending to fix these problems and to
continue to support the WebDAV protocol.

Stewart,

I am not completely sure, if I have understood your mail properly. As far as
I understand the WebDAV standard, it does not specifiy if the client
connection is done via a proxy or not. For me that means that a client has
to support any type of HTTP connection (also if MS is writing the client)
and if it can not handle direct HTTP it's simply a bug. Any TCPIP client
closes a connection, if the operation should be cancelled or at least sends
something saying: "Uh, I can't go on". MS WebDAV client does simply nothing.

Using a proxy is not really an option in many cases (I am still not sure if
it would help with our problem), because NTLM authentication does not work
via proxies. Again the WebDAV standard does not mention which HTTP
authentication method has to be used (which is not a flaw at all - WebDAV
shouldn't have to bother with authentication). Earlier versions of MSs
WebDAV client had severe problems with basic authentication, thus it worked
well only in combination with NTLM (or perhaps Digest) authentication.

What are you all thinking about this? Our customers pay a whole lot to
Microsoft to use their OSes and Office packages. (We are talking about
companies like Siemens, UBS etc.) Thus MS should provide a WebDAV
implementation, which is usable (at least with their own IIS WebDAV
implementation). First answer we got from all MS support levels was: "Why
don't you use Frontpage extensions?" which renders the IETF standard
useless.
