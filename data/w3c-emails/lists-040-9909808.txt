Stewart,

Before I start, I want to make very clear that I highly appreciate
Microsoft's efforts to implement WebDAV. A very important point of
Hyperwave's philosophy is to stay as open as possible to open standards.
Because of a lack of them before WebDAV had been invented we have developed
our own proprietary protocols (as many others, e.g. Frontpage), which has
pinned users down to use proprietary clients (or APIs) to use several
functionalities (at least for things doing a bit more than NFS or SMB).

The support incidence was done in German, so I am not sure if it really
helps a lot to cite it in here. (You can use Bablefish, but prepare for
quite funny outputs due to the complexity of German sub-sentencing). I
really do hope that citing will not lead to any actions from MS, however,
there were no statements from MS support considering non-disclosure.

Wie reagieren Ihre Web Folder mit aktivierten Server Extensions auf
Ihrem IIS bzw. Apache Server? (Microsoft bietet die Server Extensions
auch fur Apache Server an).
Sollte das Problem auch bei Ihnen durch die Server Extensions gelost
sein, konnen diese bei Ihnen eingesetzt werden ?
Wenn nein, was spricht dagegen ?

These questions are about if the problem occurs with Frontpage Extensions
(FPX) too, if we can use FPX, if so why we do not want to use FPX.

After the "escalation office" has acknowledged the incidence as a client bug
(with "highest probability") we have received a request for "political
impact" for fixing the bug:

mir wurde von unserer Eskalationsstelle bestatigt, da? es sich bei Ihrem
Problem hochstwahrscheinlich um einen Client-Fehler handelt. Da die
sofortige Beseitigung Ihres Problems von Seiten unserer
Entwicklungsabteilung fur Microsoft einen gewissen Aufwand bedeutet,
benotige ich zur Rechtfertigung gegenuber der Eskalationsstelle einen
sogenannten "political impact" von Ihnen. Dieser beinhaltet folgende
Fragen:

1) Wieviele Client-Rechner sind von dem Problem betroffen ?
2) Welcher finazielle Schaden ensteht bei Ihnen, wenn das Problem nicht
gefixt wurde ?
  (Bitte Verlust in DM angeben)
3) Welcher Nachteil ensteht, wenn auf Ihren Servern die Frontpage Server
Erweiterungen doch installiert wurden ?

Question 3 is about disadvantages of installing FPX. So it was quite clear
to me that the fast and painless problem solution would have been to use
FPX. We have stated quite a number of times that this is no alternative for
us (since MS has not provided us with FPX for Hyperwave Information Server
and FPX is no open standard).
