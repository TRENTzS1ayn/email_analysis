Erik, OASIS has a long history of developing conformance tests. I copy this
e-mail to Karl Best of OASIS who can provide you with all the details. 
I would suggest we all work together on this.

Surely folks are doing some kind of spec. conformance tests against their
DAV servers.   How did you do it?

Has anyone fleshed these tests out into something available for others to
use to test against their servers as well?

What about developing some kind of test suite using SkunkDAV code to control
it?

Thanks,
    Erik
