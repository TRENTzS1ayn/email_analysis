Section 18 clearly states that "The property names and XML elements in this
specification are all derived from the base URI DAV: by adding a suffix to
this URI, for example, DAV:creationdate for the 'creationdate' property."

Now, we've had discussion on the WebDAV list to move away from this
position, and more towards the {namespace identifier} + {name} position
embedded within the XML namespace draft. This strikes me as a good thing.

URI scheme names are case insensitive (see Section 3.1 of RFC 2396). So,
"DAV:" and "dav:" are equivalent.

Yes.

Following WebDAV concatenation rules:

<cd xmlns="http://a/b/" />  => http://a/b/cd

<d xmlns="http://a/b/c" />  => http://a/b/cd

Again, let me stress that this is what RFC 2518 says, and we have discussed
on the WebDAV list that this is probably not the best path to take going
into the future.

OTOH, I haven't heard a compelling reason why the XML NS rec couldn't be
changed. Certainly this change would have far fewer interoperability
implications, especially since most namespace implementations already allow
just a URI scheme.

I have no problem with this.

Frankly, I have found this discussion to be incredibly moot, and of little
value.
