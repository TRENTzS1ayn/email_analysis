I just notice that the ACL spec says:

14IANA CONSIDERATIONS
This document uses the namespace defined by [RFC2518] for XML elements.  All
other IANA considerations mentioned in [RFC2518] also applicable to WebDAV
ACL.

So maybe this needs to be clarified. We don't want a new spec to normatively
refer to a deprecated section of RFC2518, right?
