This works fine for me if we allow for server "discretion" by saying 
"at least all live properties defined in RFC 2518 plus all dead 
properties."  Servers that *want* to show live properties should not 
be prohibited from doing so.

My motivation for this (other than common sense :^) is that I believe 
many generic clients use ALLPROP as a way of saying "show me 
everything I'm likely to care about."  Some servers will have a 
number of general-interest properties that are live and useful in 
such a list; for example, workflow servers often have live properties 
indicating status, assignee, and those kinds of things.  It would be 
awkward if 2518++ prohibited them from showing these in response to 
an ALLPROP.
