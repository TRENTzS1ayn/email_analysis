You and I seem to be going in exact opposite directions on this one, 
and I think it's because we have different ideas of what constitutes 
interoperability with respect to ALLPROP.

You seem to feel that interoperability means that all servers return 
the same properties in response to an ALLPROP.  And I would agree 
that this can only be satisfied by specifying ALLPROP as meaning a 
fixed set of properties, as you suggest.

I feel that interoperability means that existing clients will 
continue to work "as well as possible" with the new definition of 
ALLPROP.  Since ALLPROP originally meant "all properties," and the 
objection has been "that can be too expensive for servers," I think 
the compromise is to have ALLPROP mean "as many of the defined 
properties as the server feels it's reasonable to compute."

I think Geoff's suggestion (DAV live props and all dead ones) is a 
good guideline for servers, both because these properties are 
presumably cheap and because an existing client who just set a dead 
property is likely to be very surprised when ALLPROP doesn't return 
it.  I suggested adding "at least" because I think that gives servers 
the proper control over just how interoperable they want to be with 
old clients.

Probably the place you and I really agree is that we'd both rather 
see ALLPROP go away entirely :^).  But I think we also agree that 
such a move would be too backward-incompatible.
