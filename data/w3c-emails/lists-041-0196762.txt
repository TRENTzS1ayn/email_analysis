You have a very good point - existing clients will expect to see dead
properties.

However, although that proposal supports existing clients better, it isn't
clearly defined, as I explained in a previous email today.

It's clear new clients must not expect allprop to mean all properties, but
we also agree that old clients must be able to operate.  However if we can't
define a clear behaviour for allprop or some replacement, then perhaps we
should simply discourage use of allprop in revised 2518.
