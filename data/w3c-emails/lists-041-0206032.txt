I believe that your example shows well that it's completely up to 
each server which properties are live and which are dead, and that 
any given server implementation may allow for configuration that 
changes this.  But that doesn't mean that the notion of a "dead 
property" is ill-defined for a given server and time of test.  Nor 
does it mean that a requirement that servers return "at least all DAV 
live properties and all dead properties (i.e., all non-live 
properties that would give non-404 responses when queried for by 
name)" can't be tested on any given server at any given time.  It 
simply means that it's at the server's discretion what properties are 
live, and that no test can be performed unless this is properly 
documented for the server being tested.

Actually I think we should do both :^).  I think we should adopt 
Geoff's proposed semantics for ALLPROP (with my "at least" addition), 
and I think we should *also* deprecate the use of ALLPROP by generic 
clients.  That way ALLPROP clearly becomes (i) a "quick and dirty" 
way of looking at an asset that's primarily used by older generic 
clients and is supported in that usage only for backwards 
compatibility; and (ii) a shortcut used by server-specific clients 
who know exactly which properties the server chooses to return on 
ALLPROP.
