Another one:

what's the point of having a URI for a WebDAV property?

Is the underlying assumption that if the URIs of two properties are
equivalent, the properties are identical? In which case: this won't work:
the scheme name is case insensitive, the definition of equivalence for the
scheme-specific-part is up to the URI scheme, so how could a program know
them all?

Consider:

a) <foo xmlns="http://www.webdav.org/xmlns/2001" />

b) <foo xmlns="http://www.webdav.org/xmlns/2001" />

c) <foo xmlns="http://www.webdav.org/xmlns/2001/." />

According to XML NS and RFC2518, all these properties are different (because
namespace matching is done character by character).

However, the namespace URIs in a) and b) are equivalent as per RFC2396,
section 6.

c's namespace name would be equivalent, depending on whether the program
knows the equivalence rules for this particular URI scheme.
