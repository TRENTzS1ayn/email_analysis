It depends if and where and how they are defined. Just having a property
"image-height" accepted or returned by a server does not mean anything.

If you define such a property, you should also define the expected
behaviour, its liveliness and, etc. Some servers will then implement
it, while for other servers these properties are really dead.

So, the existence of such properties on a server will not tell
a client anything about their semantics. You need to introduce
some other way to announce this to a client.

The defined way to do so, is to include these properties in the
{DAV:}supported-live-property-set. Then the client knows that the
server gives special meaning to these properties.

Coming back to <allprop/>: a dead "image-height" property would
be reported, while a live property would not be reported. A client
interested in seeing "image-height" in either case, should attach
a <include>...</include> to allprop in our proposal.
