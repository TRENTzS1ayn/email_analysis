Darn, I thought I checked this.  I assume the reason for this is to
allow disambiguation between absolute and relative URI references.
But, "dav:" isn't a valid URI reference of any kind, so what if we
<holds-breath/> updated 2396 to allow ":" as the last character of
the relative path's first segment?  Would that break anything?

A change to 2396 is obviously a serious thing, but so is not
breaking WebDAV, despite its quirkiness wrt namespaces.
