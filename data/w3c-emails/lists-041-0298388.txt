A "regular" client (knowing just RFC2518) will rely on allprop returning
*all* properties. A "new" client (aware of deltaV) will know about
{DAV:}supported-live-property-set.

The existing RFC2518 syntax does suffice. However, that was modified in
deltaV and ACL. We just think that the modification isn't complete without
the inclusion facility. The compelling reason again is: performance (one
requests rather than two).
