Well, I don't know if this is compelling for you, but reasons for allprop
are:
- it's a single request. Typical use case for me is PROPFIND/allprop on
  a collection with Depth=1.
- To achieve the same with 2 propname/prop requests, I'd have to make a
  PROPFIND/propname Depth=1, calculate the closure of all propnames for
  all resources in that collection. Then perform a PROPFIND/prop with
  Depth=1 where <prop/> includes the set of all property names of all
resources.
- PROPFIND/propname is not for free. To calculate the exact set
  of live properties of a resource is often more expensive than answering
  an allprop request.
