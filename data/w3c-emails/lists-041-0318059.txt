I think Julian is right.

The specs conflict.
It  sounds like the other specs are not going to change.  At least not
2396.
It does sound like some of us feel that what 2518 specifies isn't really
what should have been specified.

I'll support the suggestion that

1) We pick a second URI for our namespace.  I'll suggest
http://webdav.org/base.
2) We update the spec to use this new URI in the examples.
3) We deprecate  DAV: as the namespace URI in the spec.
4) ASAP implementors start accepting the new URI in addition to DAV:
5) Later implementors can start transmitting the new URI.

J.
