I would suggest that this not go in the spec.  It might not even be
necessary
for server to do this.  Let's just get our code bases to accept both URI's.
When
we achieve this, and our updated code becomes prevalent in the field, this
issue
will be largely moot and implementations can begin to xmit the new URI.

Perhaps if we find there are a lot of changes as we move to draft standard,
we can suggest that the draft standard include a header to denote
draft-standard
support.  But I don't think that's necessary for this issue, so let's not
tie that
in to this issue right now.

Maybe. It seems obvious.  If I alone were to make the choice, I'd tend to
not
even mention it.
