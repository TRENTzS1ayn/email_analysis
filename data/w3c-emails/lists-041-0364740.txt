It seems like people have noted the following possibilities:

* Change the URI spec to allow "DAV:" as a URI
* Change the WebDAV spec to use something other than "DAV:" as
   the namespace name

but have left out the following possibilities:

* Change the XML namespace spec to allow "scheme-name:" as
  a namespace name, even though it isn't a legal URI
  (This isn't such a big deal, since XML namespace names allow
   IRIs with non-ASCII characters anyway, not really URIs)

* Declare that WebDAV bodies aren't really XML, because
  the WebDAV spec has this little problem with the "DAV:"
  namespace.


The latter is the closest approximation to the 'truth', requires
no incompatible changes to any specs or any other software, but
means that (as happens to be true) anyone trying to apply generic
XML software to WebDAV requests or responses has to be careful
because of the use of the "DAV:" namespace.
