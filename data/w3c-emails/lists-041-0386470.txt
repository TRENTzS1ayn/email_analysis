Clearly a situation of trying to pick the least bad alternative ...

I also agree that Julian's alternative appears to be the least bad.
There is no "error" in any of the underlying specs (URI, XML
namespace) that would support requesting a change.

Declaring WebDAV processing to be incompatible with URI or XML
namespaces would be worse.

For Julian's issues, it would be up to the server to pick a NS if the
client request does indicate that the client understands the new NS,
but the conservative thing to do would be to use the DAV: namespace.
The other issue is not really an issue, but rather a point that would
need to be made in the revised spec.

Cheers,
Geoff

Thanks, Jason.

We'd probably need to cover some more issues:

- how does a server decide which NS to use in a reply if the request didn't
contain a body (PROPFIND for instance),
- clarification, that <foo xmlns="DAV:"/> and <foo xmlns="newuri..." /> map
to *identical* properties,
- and probably some more details...
