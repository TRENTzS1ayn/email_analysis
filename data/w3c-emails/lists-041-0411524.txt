<<
Besides, even if we tried to "fix" RFC2518 on this issue, that's not the
only place where it crops up.  I know of other namespaces used in shipped
software products where the namespaces look like a string of characters
ending in ':'.   Changing the "DAV:" prefix won't fix those, whereas a
loosening of either the XML namespaces requirements or the URI requirements
would.

The 2396 folks seem intransient on this issue.  OTOH it doesn't sound like
we've discussed this with the namespace folks.  Perhaps you'd like to
take those other examples you have and make a proposal to the namespace
committee?  We could defer this issue a few weeks until we have an idea if
your proposal will be adopted.  I can be responsible for making sure we
bring up this topic again.

So Lisa, are you game?
