We can't change them now, but we can define a migration path to a format
that conforms to the underlying specs.

It isn't.

But it *is* an example of a newly written piece of code that rejects the
namespace name, and we have found out that it's correct in doing that. So we
have to consider the fact that this may apply to newly written XML
processors as well.

Because the standard as it's written today isn't well-defined? It says that
you must use an XML-NS aware processor to parse the bodies, yet the bodies
as defined by the spec do not conform to XML 1.0 (+ namespaces).

I was wondering about this as well.

Fact is the grammar doesn't allow it, and it doesn't seem that anybody is
going to touch RFC2396 "just" for WebDAV.
