In case anyone is wondering, "scheme:" is not allowed in the URI syntax
because Web browsers and client libraries do interpret it as a form of
relative URI due to a loophole in CERN's original partial URI algorithm.
People never used it, but the loophole makes it impossible for such an
identifier to be interoperable.

OTOH, I have found at least one other example -- the "about:" URL in
Netscape Navigator -- so I guess this could be changed in a future revision
of 2396.
