No, it does not!  The http scheme defines a namespace with a hierarchical
syntax for which the naming authorities are defined by DNS/IP address and
TCP port.  The protocol used to access those names will change over time,
just as it has already done so twice.  Whether or not all such protocols
are called HTTP depends on the IETF, which doesn't move anywhere near as
fast as we develop new protocols that use the http namespace.

Yes, but only if we defined it to be such a thing, which we won't do because
Web browsers still discard the scheme name if it is the same as the scheme
of the referring document.

*shrug*  It isn't a relevant distinction.

Hey, I'm a very pragmatic philosopher.  I don't care for philosophies
that don't work in practice.
