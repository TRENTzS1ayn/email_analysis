Hello,

I am a lurker on this list and I find it very interesting. We are developing
a solution for remote proofing for printers and publishers and I feel this
work has some potential in that market.

My first question is how do you think WebDav and remote proofing come
together?

Also due to my limited participation in this list I wondered how I might
switch to the digest version?

Thanks
David Lewis
