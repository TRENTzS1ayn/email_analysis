1. I agree with Julian that we should make the 2518 revise be 
namespace-compliant.

2. I agree with Julian's suggestion that we table this for a few 
weeks while Lisa and others try again to get the "DAV:" string made 
an acceptable namespace.

3. If we can't get "DAV:" accepted, I agree with using Jason's suggestion:

FWIW, I believe that making this change *will* eventually cause older 
DAV clients and servers to stop working, which I think was something 
Lisa raised in a different way.  I believe this because I think 
eventually the cost-savings of using common namespace-processing 
technology will cause the hand-written 
backwards-compatibly-accept-DAV: patches to become too expensive, at 
which point they will go away.  So

4. I agree that we will need an indicator (in OPTIONS) of 
spec-revision, and I believe that servers which *don't* accept "DAV:" 
should indicate that they are not "DAV servers" using the indicators 
that older clients look for.
