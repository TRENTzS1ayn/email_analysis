If two or more independent implementations are doing something with the
protocol that is not allowed by the RFC, and rough consensus within the
working group is that those implementations are doing no harm, then the
protocol specification should change to accommodate them.  Whatever change
is made to 2396 will have to also take into account the history of
existing implementations.

That doesn't mean it will change any time soon, but we can add it to the
list of errata, which I need to compile anyway.

I still think it is incredibly stupid for the webdav examples to be using
"D:" as an xmlns, since the only thing that accomplishes is an unnecessary
dependency on XML namespaces.
