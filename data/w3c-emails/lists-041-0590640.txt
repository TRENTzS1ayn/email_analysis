I do not understand your point here.

WebDAV uses XML namespaces to provide extensibility for
property names, not because it lets the examples
be shorter.

If you are going to use namespaces,
you have to have an xmlns declaration, and "D:" is as good
a choice for a namespace identifier as any other.

Cheers,
Geoff

I still think it is incredibly stupid for the webdav examples to be using
"D:" as an xmlns, since the only thing that accomplishes is an unnecessary
dependency on XML namespaces.
