I can add that to the issues/todo list, but I think I've heard Jim and a
few other people mention something about the prefered style of prose in the
spec, so I thought I'd check first...

Is this something we want to put in the spec... or would we put that in a
meta document?... like an annotated spec?

If latter, I'm sure I can denote that in the issues list.
