The only namespace identified I would suggest *not* using in the
examples is "DAV:".  This in the past has misled folks into believing
that if they use DAV:xxx, they can leave out the xmlns: declaration,
which they can't.  I'd vote to leave the examples as they are.  
If we use more than one namespace identifier, I guarantee we will
get a continuing stream of "why do you have to use DAV: namespace
identifier for PROPFIND and use D: namespace identifier for PROPPATCH?"
questions.

Cheers,
Geoff

I don't think that the spec should make any attempt to explain how XML
works.

What *could* be done is to vary the XML style in the examples. For instance,

<multistatus xmlns="DAV:" />

is even shorter, and as readable (at least in those examples where no mixing
with other namespaces is needed).
