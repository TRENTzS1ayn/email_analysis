It's pretty darn hard to keep folks from presuming that the
moon is made from cheese, too, despite the fact that it
wasn't when we got there. So if the official RFC says
that an undecorated "scheme:" is only valid if the scheme
definition says it is, and it only means what the scheme
definition says it means, well, we'll just have to put up
with those cheesy jokers who decide it means something else.

How does a URI scheme 'want' to do something? 

If YOU want to identify the URI scheme itself, you need
something else. I would suggest using the process in
  http://www.ietf.org/draft/draft-mealling-iana-urn-02.txt
making a "uri-scheme" space, and then using, say, 

      urn:ietf:uri-scheme:http

if you want to talk about the "http" URI scheme.
I think it must be the case that "http:" remains illegal
as a URI even though "DAV:" would be allowed.
