In a recent discussion, several people expressed dissatisfaction with
rfc2518  section 23.4 which says that the Namespace URI and the local part
are concatenated to determine the qualified tag name.  I think someone even
suggested that it was on the issues list and was going to be changed.  As I
look at the issues list, there is an item for it, but it doesn't look like
it was resolved to take any action.

What's the verdict on this issue?
