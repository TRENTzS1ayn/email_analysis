It is probably still worth making the general comment about namespaces
in section 1, because it is also useful for proprietary extensions to
the method request and response bodies.  It further looks like section 4.5
says all that needs to be said about namespaces and property names.

So I'd say all that needs to be done is to get rid of the sentence that
refers to concatenating the namespace URL with the local node name,
and we are done with this issue.

Cheers,
Geoff

Just to clarify my note a bit...

By "properties issue" what I meant is that XML namespaces are needed
largely for the sake of properties.  As per

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001OctDec/0299.html

I'd like to provide a bit more info.  (Sorry for being so fractured in the
presentation.)  I just want to point out in section 4.5 we already have...

   The XML namespace mechanism, which is based on URIs [RFC2396], is
   used to name properties because it prevents namespace collisions and
   provides for varying degrees of administrative control.

Should we leave that XML namespace comment in section 1, modify it, or
remove it.  (You can find the text of it below.)

J.
