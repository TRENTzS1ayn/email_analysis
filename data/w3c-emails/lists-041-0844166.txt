Subject: [Moderator Action] [Fresher to webdav] How to implement WebDav
http extension methods in Java

Hi All,

 I am a new comer to this subject. I am looking to implement a client in
Java
 which can communicate with WebDav enable server. However it looks like
Java's
 networking classes like URL, URLConnection and HttpURLConnection only
 support standard HTTP methods. Do I need to look at sockets to implement a
client
 or is there a better way available?

Thanks in advance.

- Rohit
