I am very pleased to announce that Lisa Dusseault, Xythos <lisa@xythos.com>
is now Co-Chair of the WebDAV Working Group.

Lisa and I will be working together to finish existing specifications
(access control, advanced collections), and to revise existing ones (RFC
2518 revision). There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I am confident that
with Lisa as Chair, we'll be able to make steady progress towards reaching
our goals.

- Jim Whitehead
Co-Chair, WebDAV Working Group
