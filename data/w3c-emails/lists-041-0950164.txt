Actually, I've been seeing a recent increase in interest for DASL -- there
was a fairly substantial off-list thread last week. I've encouraged people
to move discussion back on-list.

Unfortunately, there is currently limited client support (anyone out there
have a DASL client?). The Xythos Storage Server supports DASL on the server
side. I think this is more an indication of the lack of server support, and
this, in turn, is due to the immaturity of the specification.

I think there is a lot of interest in DASL, since it dramatically increases
the value of DAV properties.
