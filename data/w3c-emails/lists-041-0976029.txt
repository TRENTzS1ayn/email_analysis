I remember the recent question about DASL (was it this list?).
I was wondering if part of the problem with DASL is the question
of whether it addresses a need, or addresses it appropriately.

We have a text searching engine that can do lots of funky searches
etc. on the content of resources using fields (lets say dublin
core elements). But this would be quite a different thing to
querying on WebDAV properties.

Hence I was interested to understand better the goal of DASL.
Is it to be able to query WebDAV properities (and nothing else).
Or was it intended to be broader and cover the harder problem
of querying content as well?

Just curious to understand the intended scope better before
I jump in. I found a reference to a dasl requirements document
(I have not looked it up yet). But is it still valid? I ask
only because if its been a while and if no one has implemented
it, is it because they have been busy, or because DASL has
missed the mark in some way?

ps: I noticed that DASL seems to allow other queries to be
plugged in. While this is good, for the above I am not after
an answer like "you can do anything you like". I am more
interested in "what do people like/want?"

pps: I also noticed that the "basic" query langauge looked
rather long when you got down to it - orderby, contains, like,
three value logic... Convienient if you have an SQL engine around
I guess.
