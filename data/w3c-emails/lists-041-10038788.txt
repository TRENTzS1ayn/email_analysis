If this were part of the standard, I'd certainly want to support it.  
Mac OS X creates some files which are intended to be hidden (being UNIX  
based, Mac OS X hides files which begin with a "." character) and so a  
standard WebDAV property to indicate that a file is supposed to be  
hidden would be welcome.
