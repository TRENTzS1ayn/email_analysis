Subject: [Moderator Action] WebDav and Java authorization


Hello,

I am trying to create a text file on a URL in a Java class.

The directory requires username and password to access.

How/where can I set these in the code?

url = new URL("http://myserver/webdav/myFile.txt");
            connection = (HttpURLConnection)aUrl.openConnection();
            connection.setRequestMethod("PUT");
            connection.setDoOutput(true);
            out = new PrintWriter(connection.getOutputStream());
        out.println("Some Text");
            out.close();

Currently I get a 401 authorization error.

Thanks,
Rob.
