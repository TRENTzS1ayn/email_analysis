We'll get DAV:resourceid in the binding draft ... which I *have* 
been working on, but got interrupted by the stuff they pay me to do (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

One property that keeps coming up (also in the Microsoft proposal) is the
resource-ID property, to uniquely identify a resource (generally a GUID).
I'm constantly getting requests from internal groups for this, and I know a
lot of the JSR-170 people are interested in this for content management
apps.

Of course another related requirement is the ability to fetch resources by
ID.  This could be done either by fully utilizing the DAV: namespace, e.g.
DAV:<resourceID> as the URL or by waiting for DASL.
