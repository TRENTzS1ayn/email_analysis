I don't think we have to require that relativeURIs be resolved
for comparisons (since we can't expect a server to determine
when two URLs in general are bound to the same resource) but a
server should be allowed to do so.  The primary need is to be able
to say "find resources whose xxx:foo property refers to a resource
whose yyy:bar property has the value zzz" (i.e. to search through
hrefs the way DAV:expand-property lets you PROPFIND through hrefs.

Cheers,
Geoff

Correct. Keep in mind that back when DAV:basicsearch was designed, there was
no href-typed DAV: property.

The issue here is to define a meaningful operator -- for instance, at a
minimum the operator would need to be able to resolve relativeURIs for
comparisons, right?
