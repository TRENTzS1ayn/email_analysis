Just to avoid any misunderstanding, using the DeltaV protocol
will only allow such interoperation if we get clients and servers
to support the protocol.  Probably I should have said
"would theoretically allow" instead of "would effectively allow" (:-),
but that is one reason I encourage folks to use the DeltaV protocol
in their clients and servers if they want to provide shared long-term
locking functionality.

Cheers,
Geoff

My point about using the DeltaV protocol for "long-lived locking"
(or "shared locking) applications was that using this protocol
would allow a client to effectively interoperate with a wider
variety of servers (both versioning and non-versioning), with the
"version URL" effectively replacing the functionality of the
"shared lock token".
