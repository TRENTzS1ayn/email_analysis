What is needed is an interoperable way, given a resource ID, to operate on a
resource with that ID on the server.  If the mapping between resource-ID and
implementation is server-defined, we can't do that.  Requiring the DAV:
namespace to respond to these requests is probably the easiest thing to do,
since this will work with other methods, like LOCK and so forth.  REPORT
doesn't handle that case.
