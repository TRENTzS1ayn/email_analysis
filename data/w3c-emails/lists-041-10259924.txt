didn't think about that problem...

What I'd like to be able to do is to have a URL-based scheme for accessing
resources by resource ID, without having to run a REPORT or SEARCH method or
something to find a URL for it, especially since that will be yet another
spec.

OK, how about if we make resource IDs <href>s that are guaranteed to be
unique?  We had to do the same thing with principals in the ACL spec to
uniquely identify them.  So, rather than treating resource ID as an opaque
string, we can do something with it.  On a server storing GUIDs for each
resource, you could return:

http://myserver/sys/ids/<GUID>

as the string rather than just

GUID
