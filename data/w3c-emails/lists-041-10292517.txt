I like the idea of having a URI namespace for unique identifiers for
resources. Since we use the DAV: namespace exclusively for protocol
elements, I tihnk it's a bad idea to reuse the DAV: URI space for this
purpose. But, a "guid:" URI scheme could be very useful to us, and to other
working groups too, I imagine.

Now, a "guid:" URI is just an identifier, and is not explicitly defined to
be a locator, like a URL. However, we could easily say that each DAV server
understands how to resolve a subset of the overall GUID space, and if you
somehow know one of the GUIDs a server can resolve, a GET request on that
"guid:" URI will respond with the correct state, etc.

Just to make sure we're all on the same page, I'm proposing that in addition
to the current situation where there can be multiple URLs mapped to a single
resource:

URL (n)-->(1) resource

We would additionally have a 1 to 1 mapping of guid: URI to resource:

guid: (1)-->(1) resource
