Subject: [Moderator Action] Re: Using WebDav


My company just upgraded my web servers from Windows NT to Windows 2000 with
IIS 5.0. I was using the Posting Acceptor to upload documents to my intranet
site.  All the documentation that I have read so far has said not to use the
Posting Acceptor for Windows 2000 but to use this WebDAV.  My question is
really simple.  HOW???   I need to have the ability to have users go to my
site and upload documents to the site. Is this something that WebDAV can do?
I have no idea where to begin with this. Help Please.
