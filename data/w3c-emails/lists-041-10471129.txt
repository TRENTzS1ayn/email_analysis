We are attempting to eliminate an ftp server and want to use webdav.  One of
the problems I seem to be running into is that three of the sources who
provide us data via ftp are on mainframes.  They are 'graciously' providing
this data by a batch runstream that produces a file and immediately ftps it
with no human intervention.  As I see it with WebDAV, they would have to put
the file to their pc/server then use WebDav to transfer it.  Am I correct or
do you know of a way with webdav that this could be done without causing
them extra time since this data they are sending is a 'courtesy'?

Thanks for your time,
