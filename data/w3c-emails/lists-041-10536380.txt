I just wanted to make sure that it continues to not appear in
the revised document (:-).  In particular, I was concerned by
the phrase "interoperable solution", as this seemed to open the
door to including it.

So the update to the "RFC 2518 Changes" document that I'd like
to see in this regard would be adding the reasons
summarized by Julian for the rejection of the Translate header,
and changing the characterization of the Translate header from an
"interoperable solution" to an "approach".

Cheers,
Geoff

Please note that the "Translate" header does not appear in the "revised
[2518] document".  

The "RFC2518 Changes" document discusses issues that have been brought
up on the list -- including the proposal that had been made, on the
list, to standardize the Translate header.  This document is only to
help keep track of issues (together with Jason's page) and RFC bis
changes, and is not on any standards track.  Note also that this
document briefly, and I believe correctly, summarizes that the working
group rejected the solution.  

If you still have problems with this characterization and where it
appears, please explain.

Lisa
