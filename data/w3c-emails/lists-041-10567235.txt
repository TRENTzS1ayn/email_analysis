Lisa,

it probably would be safer just to say that there was a discussion and to
point to the relevant mailig list archive enties.

The problem with the "interoperable solution" is that the "solution"
*itself* is in conflict with the base spec RFC2616 (HTTP), so by definition
it can't be the protocol that an RFC based on HTTP recommends.
