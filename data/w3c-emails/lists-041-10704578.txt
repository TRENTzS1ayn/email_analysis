Hello Bita,

Although I think that Batch method can help regarding the transactions, but
it
is not enough. Because, it can only handle a transaction which made by a
sequence of WebDAV methods. However it is not the whole problem of
transactions.
Consider an application which is using WebDAV protocol as a part of it work
and
it needs to do some other functionality along with the WebDAV methods as
one
transaction. In this case my proposal of batch method doesn't help that
application. It would necessary need to TA-methods or change the server code
to
provide its own function. The latter one is an anathema.

Do I understand you right, that you think of a scenario, in which the
application wants to access/modify data from a (or multiple) WebDAV server
and from one (or many) TA aware different data sources (.e.g. an SQL
database) AND have that access/modification wrapped in a single TA.

In this case a two-phase commit protocol (and a Transaction Monitor) would
be required, assuming WebDAV supports TA (in the 2 phase commit flavor) and
all other associated DBs and datastores would support the 2PC protocol too.

We do not have this 2PC requirement, and I believe this could be an
extension to the proposed TA requirement. (at a minimum the TA_PREPARE
method needs to be supplied). Possible we could go two steps to reach this
2PC target.

Best regards,

Juergen

If you consider the proposal of batch method I have already sent to mailing
list, and if you consider that server would have the following schema of
handling a given method:

try {
     TA.begin();
     XXX Method();
    TA.commit();
} catch ( Exception e) {
    TA.rollback()
}

The whole of batch method would be considered as a one transaction without
having TA-methods like begin, abort and commit. For each request in the
Batch
method we just simply call the corresponding method which is not a separate
transaction.

I agree with this. Every body can make its choice to shoot or not.

If I am wrong please make me correct.
