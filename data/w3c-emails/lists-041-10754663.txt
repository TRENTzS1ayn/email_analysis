How does an interoperable client know that it can do this?  Are you going to
allow an optional <href> tag in DAV:resourceid so that the client can know
to do this?  This just puts the burden on the client writer.

What do you feel is unreasonable?  Finding some obscure part of the HTTP
namespace on a server to map to?  Handling requests with resource-ids?  It
seems to me that this makes resourceid simpler for simple repositories that
may not have GUIDs available, as they can just use the resource's URL if
they don't allow multiple bindings to a resource.
