It parses the URI and determines whether it's a HTTP: or HTTPS: URL.

According to the expired bindings draft, DAV:resourceid happens to have the
DAV:href format anyway ([1]).

For instance, you might want to assign resource identifiers that can travel
between servers. Using the HTTP scheme would make this impossible.

No, they can't. For instance, the resourceid would change if the resource is
moved. This is not allowed.
