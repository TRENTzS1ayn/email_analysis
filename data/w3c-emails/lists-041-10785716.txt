As stateless as possible given that we are talking about transactions.
Each request contains all of the information necessary to understand
that request, which is the only issue left given that a transaction
implies that the requests are stored for committal rather than applied
immediately.  In other words, it is just as stateless as one method
containing lots of requests.
