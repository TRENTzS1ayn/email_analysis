Lock/unlock doesn't give you rollback capability. Even though you're the
only person who can write to a resource during a lock, it still may be the
case that you're unable to complete the PROPPATCH part of a PUT/PROPPATCH
pair. The TCP connection may go down, the server may go down, you may be
exceeding your quota, etc.

Now, if the total number of use cases is relatively small, it probably makes
more sense to create new methods explicitly for these use cases, instead of
a general purpose transaction mechanism.
