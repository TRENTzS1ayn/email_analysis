The Lock/Unlock doesn't give you the "rollback" functionality 
(i.e. the client has to remember the old values, and live long
enough to restore them if the later updates fail).

But it would be interesting to investigate whether the
DeltaV CHECKOUT/CHECKIN/UNCHECKOUT protocol could give clients most
of the benefits of transactions (a non-versioning server would
only keep the most recently checked in "version" of a resource).
You would create an "activity" for a given transaction,
make your changes, and then CHECKIN the activity to commit 
all the changes, or UNCHECKOUT to roll them back.  

Cheers,
Geoff

Well I suppose, but isn't this what wrapping updates with a Lock/Unlock pair
is intended to accomplish. I have nothing against transactions, I just don't
have any need for them spanning multiple WebDAV methods. Yet:)

One common example is to be able to write a resource and its properties in a
single operation. You want this to be a transaction, so that the resource
doesn't get updates before the properties are written, and so that if the
properties cannot be written, the resource is reverted back to it's
pre-write state.
