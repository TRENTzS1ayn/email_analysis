I think we agree that a server should not depend on the client
handling cookies. WebDAV needs to function without them.

Therefore the spec should not mention them. I see the risk that
servers or client implementors might be tempted to rely on it.

It is certainly a good idea to collect implementation advice in
some FAQ or the webdav book of why.
