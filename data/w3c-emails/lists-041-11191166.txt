I agree with Stefan (i.e. that nothing about cookies should
appear in 2518bis), for the reasons he states, unless I hear a
compelling argument for why clients should be required to accept
cookies in order for WebDAV to work properly.

Cheers,
Geoff

I think we agree that a server should not depend on the client
handling cookies. WebDAV needs to function without them.

Therefore the spec should not mention them. I see the risk that
servers or client implementors might be tempted to rely on it.

It is certainly a good idea to collect implementation advice in
some FAQ or the webdav book of why.
