I generally agree with the previous posts in this thread - against 
cookies, or at least the language above being included in RFC2518 bis. 
Aside from the other reasons brought up previously, cookies break the 
REST architectural model. Rather than further entrench their use, it 
would be nice for WebDAV to help move HTTP away from the use of cookies.
