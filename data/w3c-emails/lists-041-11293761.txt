That's simply not true.  Most repositories store the type of a resource
along with the resource name in the collection (a.k.a. directory) and
thus that information is available at the time the segment is used
within a link describing the collection at no extra cost to the server.

All other repositories are fully capable of improving their internal
implementation.  OTOH, the protocol specification is responsible for
specifying that which is clearly most efficient for the protocol and
for those servers that have already anticipated its implementation.
