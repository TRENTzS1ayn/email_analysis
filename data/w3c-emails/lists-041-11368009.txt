By "repository", I did not mean "file system".  In particular, we
store our information in relational tables, and we do not imbed in
the database keys information about whether or not the key is to
a "collection" object or a "non-collection" object.  

And as to whether this would "improve the internal representation",
storing redundant information on a reference is not an "improvement",
it is a costly change that needs compelling motivation.  So perhaps
we should focus on the "compelling motivation" before spending too
much time on "how costly" it would be for a server.

Cheers,
Geoff

That's simply not true.  Most repositories store the type of a resource
along with the resource name in the collection (a.k.a. directory) and
thus that information is available at the time the segment is used
within a link describing the collection at no extra cost to the server.

All other repositories are fully capable of improving their internal
implementation.  OTOH, the protocol specification is responsible for
specifying that which is clearly most efficient for the protocol and
for those servers that have already anticipated its implementation.
