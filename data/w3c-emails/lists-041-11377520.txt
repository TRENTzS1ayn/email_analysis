I agree with both of Julian's points.

Cheers,

Questions:

1) I thought that the goal for RFC2518bis is to clarify and to simply the
protocol, not to extend it. Why do we need a new compliance class then? And
what does it mean for an existing server? For instance, if the server only
implements the "simplified" form of LOCK-NULL resources, is it allowed to
advertise compliance class "2". IMHO, it should (otherwise interoperability
with old clients may break), so why a new class then?

2) If the spec extends how compliance classes are defined, I'd like to see a
use case first. Note that advertising support for a specific live property
IMHO is not a valid use case, so servers doing this should be fixed (there's
a better way to do it, which is adding the property to the set reported in
DAV:supported-live-property-set as defined in RFC3253).
