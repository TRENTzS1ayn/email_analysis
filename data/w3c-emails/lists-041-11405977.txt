Good question, Julian.

I was going to respond "so that client side relative URL
processing is correct".  But of course, a better
way to handle that would be for the GET to just return the
slash-terminated name (or even better, the resource that it
is really redirecting the request to, such as "index.html")
in the Content-Location field, since the client is required
to use the value in the Content-Location field as the base
for relative URL processing.

So a 302 redirect is not even required for GET processing
(i.e. the server can just automatically forward the request
without an extra roundtrip for the 302 redirect).

Cheers,
Geoff

Like Geoff said,

except:

Where does this distinction come from?

I really don't want to get into a situation where 1) HEAD and 2)
PROPFIND/depth 0 say different things about the same resource.
