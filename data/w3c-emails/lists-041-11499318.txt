WG meetings are not, I repeat, *NOT*, where these kinds
of decisions are made.  These decisions are made by the working
group as a whole as represented by consensus on the mailing list.

One does not "report decisions to the list", one makes suggestions
to the list, and then determines whether or not there is consensus
on the list.

This is especially true for a working group meeting that was not
even held at an IETF meeting, and especially true in these times
of restricted travel funds, where physical presence at a meeting
can often be infeasible.

Cheers,
Geoff

...

Consensus was quite clear at the WG meeting on both these issues.  I
report this to the list to make it clear that significant dissent on the
list, along with feasible alternative solutions to the problems
encountered, would be required to overturn that.
