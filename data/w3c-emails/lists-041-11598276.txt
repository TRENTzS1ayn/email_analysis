As long as you don't mind a client saying something to the effect of:

"This server does not support the minimal level of functionality that
<product> requires of a WebDAV server (ETags).  We strongly discourage you
from using this server, as you may lose work."

when it points at your server, then go ahead and don't support ETags.
