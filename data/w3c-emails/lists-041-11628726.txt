okay.  this answer is currently not sufficient, for example in the case of a
large PUT.  whether it's an interop or a performance problem, i believe it's
something that needs to be addressed.  if there is something already in the spec
that solves the problem, i would be happy to use it.

clients need a way to authenticate themselves before performing a potentially
expensive operation.  the only such operation that has come up in
interoperability testing thus far is a large PUT, but it is conceivable that
clients will need this for other operations as well.

it was largely based on intuition.  i guess i'd have to see the exact proposal
for this new property to tell you exactly, but if it turns out to be
satisfactory, i'd be happy to use it.

i don't see your point.  these issues are orthogonal: a server may want support
authentication but not locking, so i'd like to divorce authentication from
locking if at all possible.

again, i'd like to stay away from a dependency on locking if possible, and etags
support isn't required if i recall correctly.
