I have no objection to such a warning (in fact, it sounds
like a good idea to me).  But I agree with Julian
that RFC2518bis should not invalidate a whole class of 
valid 2518 servers, even for a worthy cause such as ETag support.

Cheers,
Geoff

As long as you don't mind a client saying something to the effect of:

"This server does not support the minimal level of functionality that
<product> requires of a WebDAV server (ETags).  We strongly discourage you
from using this server, as you may lose work."

when it points at your server, then go ahead and don't support ETags.
