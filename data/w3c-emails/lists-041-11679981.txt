I'm not so sure a server will implement the If header if it doesn't
implement locking.  I'd agree it's required, but it may not be there.
And there's certainly no requirement now that servers do authentication
checks when they do If checks.  That's not required by RFC2518 -- e.g.
if the If test fails because it's logically impossible, then why bother
authenticating?

This seems like trying to fit a round peg in a square hole.
