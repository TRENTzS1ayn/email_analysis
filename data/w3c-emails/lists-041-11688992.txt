Not necessarily; if it's possible for the request to return a success
response if the user is unauthenticated, then the server must do so
right away or it may never be able to give a success response.

If a 401 error is returned the first time a client asks to do one of
these methods (like a PROPFIND to a partially-readable collection), how
does the server know the client will ever make the same request?  Maybe
the user doesn't know a username/password and so hits "cancel", and the
client doesn't retry.  And if the client software retries, again without
a username/password, by your logic the server would just respond 401
again.
