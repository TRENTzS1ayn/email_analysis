First, I bet that 100% of all non-broken, existing servers do
authentication checks before looking at the request resource and
its properities like locks. It's the sensible thing to do, as a
user might not even have read permission on the resource. So
one probably should prevent him/her from finding out about the lock
status of the resource.

Second, there is no requirement at the moment. But then, we are
talking about new requirements for servers. The orginal proposal
wants to introduce a new HTTP header, if I remember correctly.
If checking authentication first is the sensible thing to do
for security reasons, then 2518 bis should say so.

If you compare the two existing proposal, you'd find that
the invalid IF Header will work against all current servers
which:
1) check IF header (that will be all servers with locking)
2) check authentication before everything else

whereas the new Enforce Header will only work against
future servers which implement the feature.

It would therefore be interesting to hear what client implementors
think about the two proposals.

Engineering answer: that is no problem if the diameter is
equal or less than the side of the square.
