Eric,

the problem in requiring things is that you may get what you thought you
want, but then discover it was wrong to ask for it.

If you declare a server that doesn't have entity tags non-compliant, you
might get the server implementor to reconsider his/her decision. In some
cases, there may be a very good technical reason not to supply entity tags -
for instance, if your store is a file system, and you don't have any
additional place for metadata. Computing a reliable entity tag just from the
file's properties (timestamp, length...) is impossible, but the implementor
might attempt it anyway. In the end you'll get a server that *does* supply
entity tags, but they only work most of the time, so they aren't reliable.
That's worse than not having them at all.

So, there are valid reasons for RFC2616 to make these things optional (same
for server timestamps). I'm happy with language that explains that entity
tags are an important feature, but it should also make clear that if a
server can't provide reliable entity tags, it shouldn't attempt to.

Julian
