Lisa,

I think this...:

makes it clear that we need some more time to precisely describe what the
actual problem is. It's an interesting problem, and I suppose it needs to be
discussed in relation to the ACL spec. However I don't think there's any
reason to declare it an interop problem just to rush a quick workaround into
RFC2518bis.
