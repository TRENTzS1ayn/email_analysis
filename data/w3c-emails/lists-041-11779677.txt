Note that Apache 1.3 has most recently (2002-10-10) been patched to
interoperate with Apple's DAV client in MacOS 10.x

The issue was that the "Authorization" line contained a mix of quoted and
non quoted tokens; and apache used to barf on a non quoated uri value
which non alphanum chars. This is now fixed. Apache 2.0 was fine all along.

That should add a nice block of servers which interoperate.
