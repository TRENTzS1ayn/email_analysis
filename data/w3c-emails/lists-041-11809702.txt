I agree with you that RFC 2616 clearly states this purpose of
Content-Location.

However, neither IE 5.0, nor IE 6.0, nor Mozilla 1.1 gives
my beautiful Content-Location header any justice: it is
completely ignored when resolving relative uri references
inside the HTML page.

So, for all practical purposes, a 302 is required.
