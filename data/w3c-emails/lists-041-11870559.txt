To be clear, I thought that for all the issues in the draft, either:
 - they weren't controversial,
 - OR they were controversial but consensus (not unanimity) was close.

And in any case, it's the exact wording that needs to be seen to
determine real consensus.  When I-D's are published, it's correct to
publish them to the I-D repository, rather than just circulate them on
the list.  If we were only to circulate a RFC2518-bis text document on
the DAV list, then non-list-members wouldn't have the same awareness and
accessibility to the document that they have if documents are published
correctly.

Also, I thought this goes without saying, but nobody is implying that
this I-D is anywhere ready for WG last call.  There are major unresolved
issues.

We always encourage discussion and if desired straw polls on the list.
