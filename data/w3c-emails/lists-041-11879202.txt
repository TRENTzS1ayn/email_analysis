Lisa,

it's just that I think a *lot* of bad mood could be avoided if there was a
time window between edits on the I-D and the actual submission. As you have
seen, many of the changes you made *are* controversial. So maybe the
approach the WG is/was using for the ACL draft makes more sense (submit when
stable instead of submit when new)?
