Well, it really all depends on how compelling the use cases are that require
ETag support.  It's ok to make servers do things that may be hard for some
implementations if it delivers solid benefits for the client.  I heard some
pretty solid use cases at the Interop event.

In your filesystem example, as long as all of the access to the files can be
intercepted by the server software somehow, keeping around an ETag is not a
big problem as you can bump up a sequence number on each write.  A simple
filesystem based server may also have problems with supporting UUIDs as
well.
