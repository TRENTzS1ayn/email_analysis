And even if we are theoretically allowed to make such a change,
I believe we should do so only for the most compelling reasons,
since a change of this kind will make an implementor much less likely
to put a great deal of effort into supporting a given RFC if
the working group has a track record of releasing later revisions
of that RFC that put their original implementation into non-compliance.

On a related topic, working to marshall new functionality through
existing machinery rewards an implementor for going to the effort of being
fully compliant, and increases the likelihood that implementors will bother
to do so.  

Otherwise, we are sending out the message that an implementor
should just implement the subset they feel like in the way that the
feel like, counting on "interoperability concerns" to cause the protocol
to be revised to match their implementation.

Cheers,
Geoff

Eric,

if RFC2518bis requires ETag support, old, otherwise RFC2518-compliant and
non-ETag-supporting servers will not be compliant to RFC2518bis. So
something that was fully compliant before, isn't in the with the revision. I
don't think this is allowed at this publication stage.
