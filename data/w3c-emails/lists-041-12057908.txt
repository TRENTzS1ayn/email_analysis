I *completely* agree with your position, Lisa. I don't think Julian should
have taken any issue with the posting of a new I-D. Having a new I-D
provides a concrete draft for further discussion and refinement. People can
now refer to the -02 draft, rather than some nebulous concept of "lisa's
draft as of last Tuesday".

Please keep sending in new I-D's each time you have additional content.
You've got at least one supporter here :-)

Cheers,
