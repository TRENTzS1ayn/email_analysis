This seems to be a bit beyond our current scope.  But given the
solution to this is likely to be trivial, and some people seem to value
this, I can't protest much.

I like this solution since it's probably a good thing in general to
indicate the order of header checking.  This will create consistancy
that should aid clients greatly in understanding responses.

I do recall we got into a very brief discussion of order of header
evaluation
a while back.  I forget what the topic was or what order we decided.  I
suggest
we go with your proposal and see if any problems turn up.

I can't say I'm a fan of use of NOT in a If: header  though.  :-)  But the
concept
of submitting a predictably false If header seems fine with me.
