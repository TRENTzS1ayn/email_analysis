SAML is probably pretty good, but our needs appear to be minimal (or le=
ss)
and
as you can see from Geoff's posting, providing that capability in some =
form
would
probably be trivial. That doesn't mean that clients shouldn't/can't use=

SAML.  They
can if they want.  But it's not something that is generally required to=

achieve the
WebDAV functionality and interoperability, at least not for
this problem,  so it probably doesn't need to go in the base WebDAV spe=
c.
