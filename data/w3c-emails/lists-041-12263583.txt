<<
I agree with Julian.  Picking a couple of spots to emphasize this
general rule could easily lead people to (mistakenly) conclude that
the rule is only important in those places.  I believe that the
original 2518 approach is better, i.e. state the general rule clearly
in one place.
>>
Agreed.  Saying it on one place is the best approach.
