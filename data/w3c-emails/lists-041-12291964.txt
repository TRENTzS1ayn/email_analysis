This thread seemed to get overlooked, so I want to get discussion going on
it...

I basically agree with (1) and (2).  I value keeping the server driven
submission
of tokens seperate from client driven consistancy checks.  Hopefully this
will
simplify the If: header semantics.

(3) is new to me.  I'd like to hear more discussion on it.  Perhaps as a
seperate
thread.

OK

OK.  I can see how that can be implemented without breaking compatibility.

I'd like to hear more about the requirement for this.

OK with me.

OK.

So what do other people have to say?
