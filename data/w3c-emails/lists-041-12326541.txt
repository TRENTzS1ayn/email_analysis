I think part of their point here was that they want to seperate the
submission of lock tokens to satisfy the server's enforcement of
locking rules  from the clients' submission of pre-reqs for the
request   One type of submission (tokens) is pretty simple.
The other (conditional expressions) is not quite as simple.  But in
combination in the same header it makes for messy semantics.
For that reason, the If: header wasn't advocated for (2).   At least that's
what
I assume based on previous  discussions.
