We need to hear more from folks.  Things have been unusually quiet on this
subject.

Jason and Lisa have spoken up in favor of splitting the functionality.

previous postings)

Stefan has spoken against it before that time, but it is unclear if he
understood the
proposal.  Hopefully the proposal is clearer now.

Let's hear from you folks...

J.
