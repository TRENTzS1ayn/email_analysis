I agree that the scenario described in the 2nd paragraph can only occur when
it's a deep lock.

>   7.5 Write Locks and Collections
>
>    A write lock on a collection, whether created by a "Depth: 0" or
>    "Depth: infinity" lock request, prevents the addition or removal of
>    member URIs of the collection by non-lock owners.  As a consequence,
>    when a principal issues a PUT or POST request to create a new
>    resource under a URI which needs to be an internal member of a write
>    locked collection to maintain HTTP namespace consistency, or issues
>    a DELETE to remove a resource which has a URI which is an existing
>    internal member URI of a write locked collection, this request MUST
>    fail if the principal does not have a write lock on the collection.
>
>    However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection
>    containing member URIs identifying resources that are currently
>    locked in a manner which conflicts with the write lock, the request
>    MUST fail with a 423 (Locked) status code.
>
>    If a lock owner causes the URI of a resource to be added as an
>    internal member URI of a depth-infinity locked collection then the
>    new resource MUST be automatically added to the lock.  This is the
>    only mechanism that allows a resource to be added to a write lock.
>    Thus, for example, if the collection /a/b/ is write locked and the
>    resource /c is moved to /a/b/c then resource /a/b/c will be added to
>    the write lock.
