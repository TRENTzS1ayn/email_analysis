   ...
   Therefore, I believe that the use of the If header should be
   clarified in RFC2518 bis (and in particular, guidance for how to
   use it to submit lock tokens), but that the If semantics should
   remain unchanged, and a new header which allows the submission of
   invalid lock tokens should not be added.

As an example of clarifying how to use the If header to
submit lock tokens, we could say:

"When submitting multiple lock tokens, clients SHOULD use
the tagged-list production of the If header".

Cheers,
Geoff
