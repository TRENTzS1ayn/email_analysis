Perhaps you could explain this with an example?

In particular, whenever you would have a client submit:

New-If-Header: token-1 token-2

I would have that client submit:

If: <lockroot-1> (<token1>) <lockroot-2> (<token-2>)

Other than the minor syntactic swill, and the addition of the
lockroot tag, what is the difference in terms of client effort?
(Semantically of course there is a difference, in that
you cannot submit invalid lock tokens in If, but
that is a separate issue). 

Cheers,
Geoff

Yes it does, which is one of the major reasons client developers have
asked for this to be fixed: it makes it possible for clients to submit a
bunch of lock tokens for the same "area" of the namespace, even if the
client is not sure whether the server would require each lock token.

Since servers are different in how they require lock tokens for various
operations, this allows clients to submit as many lock tokens as they
believe they need, without failing on some servers.
