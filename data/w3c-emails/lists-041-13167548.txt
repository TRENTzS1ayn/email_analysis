I don't understand that answer.  It sounds like you're saying
that it's up to the server to decide what clauses should be 
checked.   Could you explain more?

OK.  Sounds right to me.

Yes, that's what I meant.

BTW... I meant the URL of the root of the *lock*.  :-)

Sounds fair enough.  We aren't using the If: header of UNLOCK now anyway
and this discussion is about the If: header.

The request URL?   I guess that's okay.  I had actually proposed
the root of the lock rather than the request  URL.  I think lower
in this note you also said it should be the root of the lock.

Sounds right.

Okay, but you should clarify what you said near the top of this note 
because it
sounded to me like you said the server might not 
evaluate the assertions for some resources specified in the
If: header.

And what do we have to say anything about  NOT in an IF: header
or does that work out?

You might want to say more about this in a newly named thread.
It will be lost in this thread. :-)  (I'd start the thread but I don't 
want to
misstate what you just tried to say. )

Okay... but I think a few paragraphs ago you suggested it
be on the request URI.  Do you want to alter that statement
when you reply?
