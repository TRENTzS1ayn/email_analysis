Hello, I was wondering if I could get some help. My office has a mac, and it has several PC's, running Mac OS X.2.1, XP Pro, Win 2K Pro, Win 98 and FreeBSD

I'd like to set up my server on XP Pro, I store highly confidential information on XP Pro, I have a firewall, and really tight security.

My needs are. I send multipage tiff files. Ranging from 20K up to 20MB, I send anywhere from 1 a day to 100's a day. I'm sick and tired of errors saying mail boxes are full and my clients calling me and screaming at me because I havent emailed it to them, even though i request a reciept when they get the email, 15 emails later they finally get it and i have 15 reciepts telling me they got it every single time.

Someone told me I should try WebDAV instead of a ftpd. Beings I need each clients information secured from the other. I cant have A even seeing who B is. I need A and B to each have there own login and passwords. That way instead of them calling me they can just login and get there files themselves. If anyone can help me. Thanks
