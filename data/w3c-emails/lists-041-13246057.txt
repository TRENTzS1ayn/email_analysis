A problem with 200/201, is that 201 means "a new resource
was created", but a BIND never creates a new resource, but
just creates a new binding to an existing resource.  We could
of course still use 200/201, but I'd be concerned that it would
be misleading.

If a client has asked that BIND overwrite any existing binding
for that segment, why would it care whether or not there was
already a binding there?

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

similarily to the PUT method, I'd like to be able to distinguish between

- a new BIND was created (201)
- an existing BIND was overwritten (200)
