   How about:

   "If a request would modify the content, dead properties, or the set
   of bindings to children of a locked resource, the request MUST fail
   unless the lock-token for that lock is specified in the request."

Or how about:

"If a request would modify the content or dead properties of a locked
resource, or would modify the bindings of a locked collection, the
request MUST fail unless the lock-token for that lock is specified in
the request."

Cheers,
Geoff
