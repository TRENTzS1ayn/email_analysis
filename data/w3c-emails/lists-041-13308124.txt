Maybe it would be more appropriate to reuse the response codes as
defined for MOVE in RFC 2518:

201: newly created
204: replaced existing resource
etc.

Ohoh. resources, uris and representations. That's www-tag ground
we're treating on here. I think one needs at least 8 years experience
in HTTP and Apache development to talk about that topic... ;)

Anyway: a BIND creates a mapping for an URI to a representation
exactly like PUT does. That the representation is not supplied by
the client, but reused from another URI, is not relevant.
