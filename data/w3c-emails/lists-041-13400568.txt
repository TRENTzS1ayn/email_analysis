Lisa,

please re-read my mail.

I was saying that we need to define what the state of a resource is.

In particular its

- content
- internal members (depth 0 lock on collections)
- dead properties
- locks
- *some* live properties (such as DAV:label) -- this is where it'll get
hairy, I guess

Julian
