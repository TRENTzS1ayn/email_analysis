This isn't much more specific than the current "is affected by"
language.  It leaves it entirely up to the server to decide what
modifying the state of a resource is.  Does modifying membership count?
(Is modifying membership blocked by a depth 0 lock?)  Does modifying
property values count?

This is exactly where clients have had problems submitting simple
requests to server implementations that each have a different idea what
resources have state modified by the request.
