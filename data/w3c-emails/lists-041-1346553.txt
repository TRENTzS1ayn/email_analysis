Eric,

the current proposal ist at:

<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-webdav-property-datatypes-la
test.html>

The format should allow "almost" generic editing (it will require that the
editor recognizes the reported data types).

The current proposal does not cover your three requirements. However I agree
that discovery of these properties makes a lot of sense -- the main question
being, how to marshall this information. Also, servers may not *have* this
information about dead properties (unless we define a protocol that
specificies how to send this information *to* the server). The least
intrusive way to provide additional information about properties the server
is aware of seems to be a special REPORT...

Julian

Julian--

  I recall that you had a proposal for getting the schema of the properties
on a particular resource via DAV.  Does this proposal also allow for a
generic property editor client?  It seems like we need a way for the server
to indicate to a client:

* what properties are editable by end-users
* what properties are displayable
* what are the localized displaynames for those properties (taking into
account the Accept-Language header as PROPFIND would for property values).

Does your proposal cover those issues?  Can you give me a pointer to your
draft?

Thanks,

  Eric
