I don't think that deciding which dead properties are editable will be done
on the client, but rather via some server-specific mechanism.  For example,
we would probably say that all dead properties not in the DAV or Oracle
namespaces are editable by default, and possibly allow some configuration in
a parameter file to list uneditable ones.
