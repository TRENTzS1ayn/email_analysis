I agree that we should make this change, to simplify and
clarify the semantics of the If header.  I also agree with
Jason that it is unlikely that any current client depends
on the server not evaluating clauses in a tagged list
(because they don't match operands of the request method),
but it would be good to verify this.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff suggested I start a new thread...

I'm going to propose that ALL of the IF: header be evaluated
by the server.
