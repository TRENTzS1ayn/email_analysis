I am somewhat concerned about the effect of this change on
the semantics of existing clients.

For example, do any clients today submit the etag of both the source
and the destination resource of a MOVE in an untagged If production?
If so, this change would remove the etag check on the Destination,
and thereby break the overwrite protection for that request. 

But if we won't be breaking existing clients, I fully support this
change, since it simplifies and clarifies the semantics of the 
If header.

Cheers,
Geoff

Also, I would clarify what the untagged if production refers to, and it
should probably refer only to the resource named in the Request-URI.
