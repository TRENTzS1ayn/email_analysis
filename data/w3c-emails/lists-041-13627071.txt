I don't have a lot of time to spend on this given how many discussion 
threads we have
alive right now, but just a quick comment...

Could we possibly implement this in a way that meshes with how we handle 
other
live resources?   Perhaps with the dav:source property?   It can just tell 
you at what
URL's to find the variants and optionally give clues about how the 
variants are
selected?   This might actually be a good defining use-case for the 
dav:source 
property.

Also, what is our target document for this?   Should I add an issue for 
this so that
it doesn't get lost?

J.
