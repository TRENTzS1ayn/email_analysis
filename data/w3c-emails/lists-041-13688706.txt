Good catch.  We are missing a DAV:bound-resource-exists
condition (I'll add one).  The 404 refers to the request-URL
not existing, so that clearly does not apply to this case.
As for case (1), 404 seems to be the most meaningful status
to return.

Cheers,
Geoff

1) What is the expected response for the case where the request URI is not
mapped?

1a) 404 NOT FOUND?
1b) 409 Conflict with DAV:error/DAV:bind-into-collection?

2) What is the expected response code for the case where the resource to be
bound does not exist (DAV:href in the request is unmapped)?

2a) 404 NOT FOUND?
1b) 409 Conflict with DAV:error/DAV:???

Obviously, I'd prefer not to have 1a) and 2a).

Julian
