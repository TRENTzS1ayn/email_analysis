I think I prefer the former -- obviously we have to choose between

- making it as simple as possible for BIND

- making it as consistent as possible for RFC2518

Moving the overwrite flag into the request body solves just one problem --
allowing the DAV:error element (or actually *specifying* it) for response
codes != 403/409 simplifies the error mapping in other cases as well.

So my vote would be to leave the BIND spec as it is, and to add an entry to
the RFC2518 issues list saying that 4xx/5xx response bodies MAY use the
DAV:error format defined in RFC3253. We could then start a separate activity
to specify precondition names for common RFC2518 error conditions (such as
parent collection must exist).
