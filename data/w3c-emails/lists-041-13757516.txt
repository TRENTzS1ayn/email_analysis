I think variants and sources are clearly different things. In HTTP,
"Variant" is a synonym for "representation" -- a resource can have many
representations, and HTTP already defines  how a server can signal depending
on which request criteria a particular variant was chosen ("variant"
header), and optionally what the more specific URI for this representation
is ("content-location" header).

Alternatively, a source of a resource is *not* a variant of the resource,
and thus should not be treated as such.

So at a minimum, a spec about variant handling in WebDAV must

- be compatible with the terminology in RFC2616
- should elevate the vary header and the content location headers to live
WebDAV properties
- should clarify the semantics variant-selection-relevant request headers
for the various WebDAV methods

On the other hand, it may also provide a framework for authoring varying
resources (and I think this is the primary target of Geoff's draft).

Last but not least: we should keep in mind that right now proper variant
handling is only possible if ugly workarounds are use if the client uses IE
as a browser (see bug report at [1] -- note that the bug is *still* present
in IE6).
