To:"WebDAV (E-mail)"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

That works for me.

Jason: Can you add this to the 2518 issues list?

Cheers,

So my vote would be to leave the BIND spec as it is, and to add an entry to
the RFC2518 issues list saying that 4xx/5xx response bodies MAY use the
DAV:error format defined in RFC3253. We could then start a separate activity
to specify precondition names for common RFC2518 error conditions (such as
parent collection must exist).
