I vote for 403 FORBIDDEN with a new DAV:error code.

I think it's clear that there *will* be implementations that do not allow
additional bindings on collections (for instance those that are
Unix-filesystem based).

We don't need a new status code, I was just trying to figure out whether to
return 405 (not allowed) or 403 (forbidden) with a well-defined
pre-condition (DAV:collection-binds-supported?).
