Dan,

a few comments:

- trying to set a dead property before going on with resource modifications
certainly is interoperable,

- I don't think that the information "which methods can I invoke with the
current credentials" belongs into a live property -- it certainly sounds
like an additional optional REPORT (for which support can be detected using
DAV:supported-report-set),

- I've got the feeling that this isn't how authentication should work in
HTTP. Either you are authenticated, or you aren't. If your current
privileges are not sufficient for a specific method, you'll get a 403. IMHO,
if a client thinks that it might succeed with different credentials, it
should be initiate the new authentication itself.
