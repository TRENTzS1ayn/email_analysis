But why? It *is* allowed to delete the resource, so there's no guarantee
that the version/VHR will be kept eternally. From a client's point of view,
it's completely irrelevant whether it's getting the 404 because the resource
was deleted or because it was moved.

Yes, but it makes the model more complicated with little benefit. Forbidding
a DELETE on a binding just because other bindings continue to exist seems to
contradict the intent of the BIND spec. Therefore I'd like to see better
reasons why we really need that. In doubt, we should *simplify* things, not
make them more complicated.
