Agreed and not controversial.

And here I still don't see the benefit. Forbidding MOVE just to achieve this
seems to be unnecessarily restrictive. The client can't rely on the resource
being available anyway -- what difference does it make *why* it's not
available anymore behind the request URI?

You just introduced the new term "the stable binding" :-)

Again: if there's a choice between simplying and complicating things, we
should try to simplify the model, unless an *essential* feature requires
this. I fail to see why the second benefit would be essential.

Why is this relevant? The ability not to re-use a previously assigned
binding is a property of the collection containing the binding. If my server
allows deletion of VHRs and/or versions, it will have to be able to take
care of this anyway -- it doesn't matter at all whether the binding
disappeared because of a DELETE or a MOVE.

So, I'm still unconvinced.

Can we concentrate on the question marked (*)?
