I think we are in violent agreement.

Some comments inline.

I'm not sure about what this means. A variant may or may not have an entity
tag. If it does, it MUST be reported.

Clarification. The DAV:getetag property MUST be *present* on a resource (for
a particular PROPFIND request), if a HEAD or GET request with the same
request headers would return an etag header. Otherwise, it MUST not be
present. We may have to discuss whether it may be reported in
DAV:supported-live-property-set, though.

Generally, all DAV:get* properties MUST be present if they would be returned
in a HEAD/GET with the same request headers, and MUST NOT be returned
otherwise. In particular, DAV:getcontentlength MUST NOT be returned as empty
if the content length is unknown (instead, it should not be present at all).
Similarily, properties such as DAV:getcontentlanguage must only be present
if the content language actually is *known*.

ETag is an entity header, so it doesn't apply to an abstract resource -- it
applies to a specific variant. We must be careful here -- there may be cases
where some of the variants of a resource have entity tags while others
don't.

Sure.

Sure. Although RFC2518-compliant locks should work as well :-)

See above. I think we need to be careful to distinguish between the resource
and its representations (the latter have entity tags, the former don't).
Note that Roy F. says that authorable (PUTtable) resources always have
exactly one variant (but this is just one opinion :-).

I think these are caused by

- fuzzy wording in RFC2518 and
- particulary broken clients that *require* the presence of all DAV:get*
properties (even when they do not exist).

That sure is a valid workaround, but it may not be always practical:

- performance for frequent updates will be bad and
- you may use a filesystem that also has alternate access paths (for
instance as a network mount) -- in this case, you can't guarantee that
nobody *else* is modifiying the content more than once per second
