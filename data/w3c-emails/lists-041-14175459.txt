So do I. The only difference is that I think that it's irrelevant whether
the resource was deleted or moved away. Could you please explain why this
would affect a client? The consequence (the prior URI not being mapped to a
resource anymore) is the same.

It still can be used the same way as described by you. The only difference
is that if the URI mapping is removed, a client can not assume that the
resource itself was removed. But why would that matter? Could you please
state a use case where this really makes a difference? And if it really does
matter, where does this leave us with the BIND spec (see below)?

Hm. I'll only state that I'm *not* proposing to make a version mutable. I
just think that making it *movable* makes the model much simpler and avoids
making special workarounds for bindings (note that this doesn'r *require* a
server to allow MOVE on it).

The intent of the BIND spec is to decouple names (bindings) from resources.
I think we should try to adhere to it. In particular, if existing protocols
need to be fixed to account for bindings, I fear that we're doing something
wrong.

Agreed (although it is "stable name" in RFC3253).
