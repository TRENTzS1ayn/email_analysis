That's an interesting issue.

To answer that, we'll have to finally decide which URIs an RFC3253 server
should report (for instance for DAV:version-history) when there are multiple
bindings. Possible answers are:

a) any
b) all
c) the stable

If the answer is a) or b), this isn't an issue. If the answer is c), then
just continue to report it. It's perfectly legal to return a URI that isn't
mapped anymore (for instance, VHRs and versions may be stored on a separate
server, and there's no way to guarantee consistency with the server the VCR
is on).

Proposal: let's try to clarify how the bindings introduced by RFC3253
actually work (DELETE semantics, reporting of URIs in live properties, ...).
Then we'll have to figure out whether this is compatible with the current
BIND draft.
