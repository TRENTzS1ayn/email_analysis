This seems to be a discussion of "bindings and versioning", not bindings.

I think the binding spec should allow servers to reject DELETE/MOVE 
requests.
The binding spec should not be concerned about all the possible reasons a 
server might reject a request, and in particular it shouldn't devote any 
time to 
versioning specific reasons a server might reject a request.

If a particular spec, like the versioning spec, has a particular semantic 
constraints
that it wants to support, it can spec that DELETE/MOVE should not be 
supported
in the situations where DELETE/MOVE would break those semantic 
constraints.

Can we agree that servers can reject DELETE/MOVE requests and move the
versioning specific discussion to the versioning mailing list?
