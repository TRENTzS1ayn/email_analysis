Gary,

I'm not sure I understand this statement...

I don't think that RFC2518 says this. The protocol certainly allows servers
to implement a rich set of server-defined properties. For instance:

- RFC3253 implements a whole set of server-defined properties that model
versioning properties,

- Microsoft Sharepoint (although breaking WebDAV in some other aspects)
nicely exposes document metadata as WebDAV properties (for instance, it
supports document classes with inheritence, their discovery and
manipulation, mandatory typed properties...)

I think this isn't true. Could you please explain this in more detail?

That sounds a bit like "existing clients do not support manipulation of our
server's properties, thus the protocol is broken". I'd say, we just need
better clients.
