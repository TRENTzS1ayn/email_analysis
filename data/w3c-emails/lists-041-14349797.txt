The new draft of quota is out, but I never responded directly to these
comments (sorry).

That's true, but even knowing that the client can't necessary assure
their request will succeed.  I suspect that if the client just PROPFINDs
the current collection and subtracts space-used-bytes from quota-bytes,
the client will get an answer that works just as well 99% of the time.
If implementation experience suggests otherwise, I'd support this live
property as well.

It didn't say that it is without regard for who created them.  The
server is free to count any resource as 0 bytes against space-used for
all kinds of reasons (e.g. the resource is a binding).  The sentence was
intended to ensure that quota was understood to be recursive by clients
and servers.  Do you have better wording?

In theory this would work already.  However I suspect servers
implementation of the Expect header is poor in reality.
