Sharemation does have a separate collection hierarchy for each user, but
many other Xythos WebFile Server installations have users share
collections with common names like "sales", "marketing", "hr".  The same
quota system applies to both models, as I hope I'll be able to explain.

Quota is applied to a collection, *not* a user, specifically because of
the model where a user doesn't just put documents in their own home
directory.  That's explicit in the draft, and it's an important feature
to allow directories to be shared by many users and still have quota
applied.  So if a quota of 1000MB is applied to the "/sales/"
collection, the server is free to report that quota, and count space
consumed by resources in the "/sales/" collection in whatever way its
policy decides.

> Where I see a real problem is a server supporting bindings.

It's specifically left up to the server to figure out how to support
bindings -- it would be impossible for the draft to enforce how to count
space used, when it's a matter of policy and the interaction of many
potential features.  The server may:
 - count the space used by a binding as 0 bytes, 
 - count the bytes used to store the binding only and not the length of
the resource it points to
 - divide the size of the target resource among all its bindings, 
 - count the full size of the target resource against every binding.
That's why the draft requires the server to show how space is used -- it
is not possible for the standard to decide these policy matters.
