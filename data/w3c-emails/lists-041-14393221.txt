The current draft states that the
quota values do not vary by user.  I believe that this
should be changed to explicitly state that they *are* per
user quota values.  A server that only maintains global
quotas would then just return the same value for every
authenticated user.

Cheers,
Geoff

It seems like this draft is fine with a user-based rather than a
collection-based
system--the server will report the same usage & quota for any collection,
but
will return different results depending on who is authenticated, no?
