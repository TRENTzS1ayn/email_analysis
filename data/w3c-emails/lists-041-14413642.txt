1.  Is there general consensus to agree with Geoff?  
2.  Is there actually an implementation need for this?

I'm a little dubious about altering the draft to say this, because it
starts to get really unclear what space-used-bytes means when it can
vary from user to user.

The current draft states that the
quota values do not vary by user.? I believe that this
should be changed to explicitly state that they *are* per
user quota values.? A server that only maintains global
quotas would then just return the same value for every
authenticated user.
Cheers,
Geoff

It seems like this draft is fine with a user-based rather than a
collection-based
system--the server will report the same usage & quota for any
collection,
but
will return different results depending on who is authenticated, no?
