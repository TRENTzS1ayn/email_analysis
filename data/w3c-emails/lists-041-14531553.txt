Since user-based quota systems are common in existing repositories,
I'm not sure what you are suggesting we wait for.

Also, I agree with the suggestion that we not use the term "bytes"
in the property names.

Cheers,
Geoff

That's a fine idea, but there's nothing necessarily tying the
current-user-quota stuff into the directory quota draft.  I generally
prefer to write drafts only once implementation is well understood --
one's assumptions tend to have been confirmed or destroyed by then.  Is
it reasonable to wait until somebody wants to implement user-quota to
standardize it?

Possibly we should have two pairs of standard properties:
DAV:quota
DAV:quota-used
DAV:current-user-quota
DAV:current-user-quota-used
(analogous to the way the ACL draft as current-user privileges)

Interesting. So if we take groups into account, we'll need a more
flexible
reporting mechanism, right?
