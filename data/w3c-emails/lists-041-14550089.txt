RE: FW: I-D ACTION:draft-dusseault-dav-quota-01.txtI don't see what's wrong with the existing properties.  Basically what they tell you is:  if I want to PUT resources into this particular collection (either directly, or indirectly in some subcollection), here's how much space the currently authenticated user can take up.  You may not be allowed (for security reasons) to see how much quota other people are using, so the only number it makes sense to report is how much space is available for me.

All we need to do is loosen up the language of the draft a bit, not change the properties or implementation.

  Possibly we should have two pairs of standard properties: 

  DAV:quota 
  DAV:quota-used 

  DAV:current-user-quota 
  DAV:current-user-quota-used 

  (analogous to the way the ACL draft as current-user privileges) 

  Cheers,

  Interesting. So if we take groups into account, we'll need a more flexible 
  reporting mechanism, right?
