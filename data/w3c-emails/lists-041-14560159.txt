All I'm suggesting we wait for is somebody who's willing to do the work
to think through user-based quotas, and has the motivation because they
want to implement it, and finally because a client/server pair need to
interoperate with user-based quota information.  (Note: when I did early
thinking about quota, we assumed we wanted user-based quota.  That
assumption was destroyed when we really thought about different usage
scenarios)

For the suggestion not to use 'bytes': I'm ok with 'octets' (is there a
difference important enough to make the change? ) but I reject the
suggestion that it should be an unmeasured unit. It's useless to know
that the quota is 33 frobnitzes and 18 frobnitzes have been used up if
you want to have some hint if you can upload a 1.5 Mb file.

Since user-based quota systems are common in existing repositories,
I'm not sure what you are suggesting we wait for.
Also, I agree with the suggestion that we not use the term "bytes"
in the property names.
Cheers,

That's a fine idea, but there's nothing necessarily tying the
current-user-quota stuff into the directory quota draft.? I generally
prefer to write drafts only once implementation is well understood --
one's assumptions tend to have been confirmed or destroyed by then.? Is
it reasonable to wait until somebody wants to implement user-quota to
standardize it?

Possibly we should have two pairs of standard properties:
DAV:quota
DAV:quota-used
DAV:current-user-quota
DAV:current-user-quota-used
(analogous to the way the ACL draft as current-user privileges)

Interesting. So if we take groups into account, we'll need a more
flexible
reporting mechanism, right?
