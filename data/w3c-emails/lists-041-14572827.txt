I don't think it makes sense to force user quotas into another draft, given
that
they accomplish the same thing.

You can't complain about not having implementations of the draft--there's
always
a chicken & egg problem here.  If you make the draft more generally
applicable,
you will get more implementations, and I don't see why an interoperable
client
needs to care about why the current user has a space limit.

Note that a given user may have different quotas in different collections.
