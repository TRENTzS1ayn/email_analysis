All I want is for interoperable clients to have two properties:

* how much junk can I store in this collection
* how much junk have I already stored in this collection (and thus could be
used if I delete stuff, potentially)

I'm happy with the properties--I just think we need to change the text to
indicate that the quota only applies to the currently authenticated HTTP
user--an interoperable client cannot assume that the quota will be the same
if authenticated as somebody else.  I don't think we need an ability to find
out how much quota other people have.
