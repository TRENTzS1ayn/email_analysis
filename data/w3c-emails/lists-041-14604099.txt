If everybody says that user quotas are required, and your proposal can't
adequately handle this, this should be resolved by

- either working on the proposal until it is flexible enough or

- acknowledging that it is *not* generic enough and to publish it as what it
is -- the description of one particular quota implementation (in which case
it shouldn't be "the" WebDAV quota protocol).

Byte size is whatever the machine/CPU/architecture happens to use. An Octet
is 8 bits. A Byte MAY be 8 bits.
