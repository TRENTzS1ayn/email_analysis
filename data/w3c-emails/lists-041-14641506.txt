That's why I used the word "potentially".  It's just a way of giving the
user some
indication of how much space could be usable in this collection in the best
case
(where any other space-occupying resources have been deleted).

Certainly, if I have one collection mapping to D: and another mapping to E:
on
a Windows machine, I would have different "used" quotas for different
collections.
I don't see why it's not a collection property.

I agree that there isn't really a need to define how nested collections
work.
If I have another partition mounted beneath a parent collection, the
collection
will have no idea how much space is available in that particular child
collection.
All we need is the two live properties, and language that indicates that the
only
thing quotas control is how much new content you can create (either in a
resource, or by creating new subcollections).
