I just did PROPFIND/propname on

http://idisk.mac.com/interop01/

(doesn't have the properties listed) and on

http://www.sharemation.com/~(someusername)

(doesn't have them, but does have
{http://www.xythos.com/namespaces/StorageServer}quota).

Which clients support it then?

But then we also sometimes fall into the trap of standardizing too early,
right?

There's nothing wrong in publicly describing a specific extension (actually,
that's very good). But it's a big step from having something that seems to
satisfy one or two server's needs, and a design that is generic enough to be
considered as the generic approach for WebDAV servers.
