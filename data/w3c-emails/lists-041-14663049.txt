To compute it, you have to access collection and *all* descendants in the
namespace. So computing it may require the same amount of effort as doing a
PROPFIND with depth infinity. That's why I'd be very hesitant to consider it
being the property of a collection (yes, even taking the current allprop
semantics into account).

The things that *are* easy to answer for any resource (no matter whether
collection or plain resource) are:

- max. storage available to the user in quota-partition of the namespace in
which the collection is allocated
- current storage allocated to the user in this partition
- storage taken by *one* specific resource
