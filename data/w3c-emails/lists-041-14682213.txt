Apple's iDisk and the Mac OS X WebDAV file system implementations were 
complete and in use before this document. They use the properties 
"quota" and "quotaused" and the values returned by those properties are 
in 512-octet units. Connect to iDisk with the Mac OS X client and the 
first PROPFIND you see will ask for and receive those properties.

When Lisa started working on the current draft and it was obvious that 
the values returned should be in the same units used by other parts of 
HTTP (such as Content-Length) instead of 512-byte units, different 
property names were used.

I have no problem with the property names quota-bytes and 
quota-used-bytes being changed to quota-octets and quota-used-octets. I 
agree that octet is the accurate term to use since it's well defined in 
RFC2616, section 2.2.

That's pretty much what the values returned mean to us and how we use 
them. Since the Mac OS X WebDAV file system mounts a collection as a 
disk volume, we use the quota values to show the user how big of an 
iDisk they have and how much of that space is still available.

Once this group has determined what the new property names are, it'll 
be simple to change the iDisk server to use the new property names (as 
well as the old property names for backwards compatibility with 
existing Mac OS X clients). Once the changes on the iDisk server are 
made, it will also be a simple client change to ask only for the new 
property names.
