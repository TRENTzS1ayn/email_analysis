Agreed. Let's give it a try:

quota space
   A quota space is a storage area on a WebDAV server where the amount
   of storage for resources is restricted. The restriction might be due 
to
   physical disk size or limited by configuration options of the server.
   The storage restriction might be enforced the same for all users, 
letting
   them share the available space, or configured and enforced differently
   for each user.
   A WebDAV collection belongs to at most one quota space. Subcollections
   might belong to the same or different quota spaces.
(Comment: I'm not sure if we need identifier for quota spaces, so that
  clients could compare if two collections are in the same quota.)

A collection belonging to a quota space has the following two live
properties:

DAV:quota-free
   The DAV:quota-free property reports the amount of storage in octets
   available to the current user in the quota space the reporting 
collection
   belongs to.

   The value of this property will usually be protected, although a user 
with
    sufficient privileges may be permitted to change the value. The
    property is useful even if it is protected. A 403 Forbidden response
    is recommended for attempts to write a protected property.

    A value of 0 indicates that storage is limited to 0.  Users will
    probably not be able to add resources to the collection.

    If a collection has no quota enforced, it should not return this
    property at all.  A client cannot entirely assume that there is no
    quota enforced on a collection that does not have this property, but
    might as well act as if there is no quota.

    This property is OPTIONAL on collections and SHOULD NOT exist on
    non-collection resources.  When a new collection is created, it is
    up to the server to initialize the value appropriately if it chooses
    to.

And

DAV:quota-used
   The DAV:quota-used property reports the amount of storage in octets
   used by the current user in the quota space the reporting collection
   belongs to.


  These values are an approximation and should be treated as such.
   It is not required that DAV:quota-free and DAV:quota-used always add 
up
   to the same value.
