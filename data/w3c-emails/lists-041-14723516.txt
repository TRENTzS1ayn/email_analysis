If a subcollection can belong to a separate quota space (aka Unix device),
can't this also be the case for internal members?

I think that the distinction between collections and non-collections is
essentially meaningless -- the properties defined here apply to the quota
space, not to a particular resource. Therefore they should be defined on all
resources that are quota-controlled.

May be useful.

Remove last two sentences.

Replace "should not return" by something like "MUST NOT be defined on the
resource".

Completely remove this paragraph.
