I'm happy to just have the two properties, and reword the
description so that they are clearly the quota for the
current user,
where a given implementation can choose to have all files
(not just the files created by that user) use up that quota.

I'd suggest most of the content of the draft just be deleted
since I believe its major problem at the moment is overspecification.
There is no need for much motivation, since the concept is
quite straightforward and familiar to most people.  In particular,
Stefan's suggested wording is fine with me.  I don't think I'd
bother with giving the quota space an identifier, but I wouldn't
object to defining a property for it.

Cheers,
Geoff

That would be "space-left-on-device" and not a quota. Certainly
every file system has it, but clients are more concerned
with the per-user quotas. Do you see a need to define these
properties?
