I like having the unit type in the name because it makes the purpose of 
the property more self-described.

However, I'm not opposed to removing the unit types from the new 
property names as long the property names are NOT quota and quotaused 
-- using quota and quotaused would break Apple's existing server and 
client implementations. Existing Mac OS X clients use quota and 
quotaused and expect the unit size to be 512-bytes and that's what the 
Apple iDisk server returns for quota and quotaused.
