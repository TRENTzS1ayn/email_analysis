Apple's existing properties should not conflict with DAV:quota or
DAV:quotaused, since they shouldn't be in the DAV: namespace (surely Apple
would not have defined non-standard properties in the DAV: namespace :-).

I like having the unit type in the name because it makes the purpose of the
property more self-described. 


However, I'm not opposed to removing the unit types from the new property
names as long the property names are NOT quota and quotaused -- using quota
and quotaused would break Apple's existing server and client
implementations. Existing Mac OS X clients use quota and quotaused and
expect the unit size to be 512-bytes and that's what the Apple iDisk server
returns for quota and quotaused.
