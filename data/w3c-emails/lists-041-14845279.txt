Jim,

I didn't want to imply that it was you who did that. But obviously somebody
else did :-)

That's a good thing.

Yes. There are many more in use (or actually not in use, but appearing in
PROPFIND requests) at Microsoft. But that shouldn't be an excuse to copy
this behaviour.

BTW: DAV:ishidden was documented in an Internet Draft that at some point
wasn't updated and therefore expired. It probably was intended to be
published as WG RFC at a later point of time. Lesson: do not use the DAV:
namespace in Internet Drafts, unless they are WebDAV working group drafts
(hint hint).
