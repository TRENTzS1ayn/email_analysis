Two thoughts:

a) MS Sharepoint works around this by enforcing schema compliance not on
creation, but upon CHECKIN. This may or may not be sufficient (checking in
pops up a dialogue where the user must fill all required fields).

b) Instead of inventing MULTIPUT, we may be able to use the HTTP Extension
Framework (RFC2774), defining mandatory headers for M-PUT (marshalling would
be a bit tricky, though).

Sure. But we won't get that unless a group of peope sits down and develops a
proposal.

In the general case, wouldn't that be just a link to a (dynamically
generated) HTML document (may be a new property or another use for
DAV:source :-).
