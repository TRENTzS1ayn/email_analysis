According to HTTP, 5xx class codes are for server errors:

"Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which
the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the
request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include
an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it
is a temporary or permanent condition. User agents SHOULD display any
included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any
request method. "

I'd say that this is ok for a condition like "disk full", but not
necessarily for something like "quota exceeded". This is not a server error,
it's just an administrative constraint that was enforced.

Proposal: define a precondition DAV:quota-not-exceeded, and let the server
return 403 or 409.
