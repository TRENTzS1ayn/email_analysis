It looks like we have finally narrowed down this thread to
one issue for 3253, which I've added as 14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2
(i.e. can you delete the stable binding to a version history
or version, if there are other bindings).  Any discussion of
14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2 should be mailed to the deltav mailing
list, not to the general webdav mailing list.

For the binding spec, Julian asks for two new preconditions
for BIND, which I will go ahead and add, unless someone objects
(they both seem reasonable to me).  Any discussion of these two
new preconditions for BIND should be mailed to the general
webdav mailing list.

Cheers,
Geoff

The issue here is that if we allow a DELETE to fail because other bindings
exist, a client may never be able to delete a binding (because due to race
conditions, there will always be additional bindings left). I'm not saying
that this can be avoided, however it *really* sounds ugly. As I said, I
haven't seen a convincing argument why we need this restriction in RFC3253
(and yes, this discussion should be moved to the other mailing list).

Yes. Still, we may have to define additional precondition values for

- resource does not support additional bindings
- new member name can't be used (in deltav: because it was already used for
a stable URI)
