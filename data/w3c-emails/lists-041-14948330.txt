RE: BIND vs. non-movable resources in RFC3253Geoff,

thanks. I think I've got at least one other precondition:

DAV:bind-loops-allowed

(explanation: we don't want the server to produce a 5xx error code for this
case)

  It looks like we have finally narrowed down this thread to
  one issue for 3253, which I've added as 14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2
  (i.e. can you delete the stable binding to a version history
  or version, if there are other bindings).  Any discussion of
  14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2 should be mailed to the deltav mailing
  list, not to the general webdav mailing list.

  For the binding spec, Julian asks for two new preconditions
  for BIND, which I will go ahead and add, unless someone objects
  (they both seem reasonable to me).  Any discussion of these two
  new preconditions for BIND should be mailed to the general
  webdav mailing list.

  Cheers,
  Geoff

  ...
  The issue here is that if we allow a DELETE to fail because other bindings
  exist, a client may never be able to delete a binding (because due to race
  conditions, there will always be additional bindings left). I'm not saying
  that this can be avoided, however it *really* sounds ugly. As I said, I
  haven't seen a convincing argument why we need this restriction in RFC3253
  (and yes, this discussion should be moved to the other mailing list).

  Yes. Still, we may have to define additional precondition values for

  - resource does not support additional bindings
  - new member name can't be used (in deltav: because it was already used
for
  a stable URI)
