   I wasn't aware off that being a requirement. I see why a server
   that *does* support cyclic bindings need to signal them upon depth
   infinity operations (-> 506), but why would you want to require
   support for their creation?

   Actually, I'm tempted to require servers to detect cyclic bindings
   upon creation and to reject those requests. What's the use case for
   cyclic bindings?

If you are using bindings to capture some relationship, and that
relationship is cyclic, then you can't capture that relationship
if you are not allowed to create cyclic bindings.

   BTW: this precondition applies to all namespace-manipulating
   operations (a MOVE of a collection may fail for the same reason).

Assuming that the server does not allow you to "move" the root
(which no server does), how do you create a cycle with a move
operation?

Cheers,
Geoff
