   I'd still feel better if you could give a simple example...

Suppose the relationship I'm capturing in a set of collections
is the "uses" relationship between software modules.  This me to
use pathnames like "moda/modb/modc" to refer to the module named
modc used by the module named modb which in turn is used by the
module named moda.  Since the "uses" relationship can be cyclic,
I could get a path like "moda/modb/modc/moda/...".

Good point.  I'll add the precondition to the MOVE method as well.

Cheers,
Geoff
