Any relationship captured by collection membership can just
as easily be captured by a property.  The "expressiveness" that
you lose is the ability to use URL paths to select a particular
path through that relationship.

Cheers,

Is there some compelling reason you would use BIND to capture this 
relationship? It seems like this could be captured just as easily and 
without losing any expressiveness via the use of a "uses" property instead.
