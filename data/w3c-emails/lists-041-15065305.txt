Good morning all,

Perhaps you're already aware of this, but... The detection of cyclic 
bindings is reducable to the problem of finding a Hamiltonian Path in a 
graph, which is NP-Complete. I strongly object to placing any 
requirements upon a server which are NP-Complete problems.

Since detection of cycles is NP-Complete, it shouldn't be a MUST level 
requirement that servers detect them. Perhaps they SHOULD detect them, 
but even that seems too strong for my tastes... It's clear that cycles 
may be caused inadvertently by other namespace operations such as MOVE, 
so disallowing them also has the effect of making a server detect them.

The problem is analogous to that of having cyclic links in the *nix 
filesystem, is it not? Is there any reason we cannot follow the same 
approach taken there? The simplest way to avoid the whole mess is to 
specify that namespace operations do not follow BINDed (bound?) 
resources since they could end up in a cycle...

I'd be interested in seeing a use case for cyclic BINDings that cannot 
be satisfied with the judicious use of properties...
