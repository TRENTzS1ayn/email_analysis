Looks like I neglected to post the most recent copy which had
this precondition added ... should now be fixed.

Cheers,

Another precondition BIND should specify:

DAV:bound-resource-is-mapped: The URL specified by the DAV:href is mapped to
a resource.

(Explanation: we don't want to return a 404, because that would indicate
that the request URL for BIND wasn't mapped).
