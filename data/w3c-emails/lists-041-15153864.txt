RE: BIND vs. non-movable resources in RFC3253On the other hand, doing that
would make the question about response codes moot.

     This COPY behaviour makes sense, but can we really require it?
     Right now it seems completely legal to just create multiple plain
     new resources with same content and dead properties...

  If the binding relationships are acyclic, creating multiple
  plain new resources with the same content and dead properties
  seems reasonable to me (i.e. I don't think the spec should
  forbid it), but this would be a somewhat expensive approach if
  there are cycles (:-).

  Cheers,
