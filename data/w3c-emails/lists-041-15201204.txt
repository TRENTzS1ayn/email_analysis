The following is from:
http://www.webdav.org/other/proxy.html

The last modofied date is Tue Mar 26 13:11:26 PST 2002.

Has something happened since then? If yes what, and how I can do it? That's
my question.

Any pointers are appreciated.

Thx. mucho.

Often there is an option that specifies which methods to support;
Squid's is "extension_methods" (IIRC).
