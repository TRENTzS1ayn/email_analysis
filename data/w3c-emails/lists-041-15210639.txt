I will put together the Agenda for the Atlanta meeting.  Here's some
issues that should be discussed.  Volunteers are *really needed* ( to
drive discussion on their selected topic) this meeting as I'm *really
swamped* myself!


RFC2518bis
 - Proposals for client forcing server auth challenge - Ilya?
 - Required support for ETags
 - If header evaluation/simplification proposals & compatibility -
Geoff?
Other drafts 
 - quota draft
 - Binding issues coming up on DL
 - allprop/include draft
Other issues
 - Impact of XML namespace changes -- Julian?
 - ACL submission status

I'm sure I've missed items so let me know.
