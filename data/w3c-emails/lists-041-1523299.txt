Fair enough

Well, there is. What you don't have is an interoperable  way to *discover*
them (and their datatypes, descriptions).

Thus one needs a generic schema-based protocol that allows discovery of
mandatory properties and their types. This is what Microsoft Sharepoint
already implements.

It certainly can be solved (without changing WebDAV), but it requires a lot
of work.
