Like Julian it seems I won't be able to make it to Atlanta :-)
Nevertheless I would like to work a night shift to follow the discussions
in the meeting from good old Europe.
So, are there any plans to implement the 'jabber' option mentioned in a posting
some days ago ?
The text conference feature is an experiment but I would be interested to try it.
Any other guys not going to Atlanta interested ?

Cheers, Edgar
