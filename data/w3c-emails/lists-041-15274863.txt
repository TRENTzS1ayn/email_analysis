I will be at the Atlanta meeting, and would be happy to drive the
discussion on any of the topics identified below.  I don't think
I would raise the XML namespace issues, though, until we have some
proposal as to how to address them (I agree they are issues, but
like Julian, I have no proposal for how to address them).

Cheers,
Geoff

Yes -- I need help not only in preparing these discussions, but also
leading them at the WG meeting.  I understand you won't be able to make
it to Atlanta, Julian.  Is somebody who will be there able to work with
Julian on understanding and explaining the XML namespace issues and the
allprop Include draft?
