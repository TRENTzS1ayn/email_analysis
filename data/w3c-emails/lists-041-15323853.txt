Driving discussion doesn?t necessarily mean having a resolution in mind.
Could you outline the possible ways to address the new XML standards
work so that the rest of us could have a framework to start thinking
about it?  Just an overview of what?s different (that might affect
WebDAV) would be helpful.

My point was that I have no particular opinion on
which way to go for the XML 1.1 and XML namespace issues
that you raised (and in your email that raised
the issues, you indicated that you didn't have a
proposed resolution either).? So although I'd be
happy to participate in a discussion on this topic,
I wouldn't be able to "drive" it in any particular
direction.
Cheers,
Geoff

I think there's some misunderstanding here.
The namespace issue as defined in Jason's list ([1]),
DAV_WITH_COLON_IS_NOT_A_URI, is closed (we don't need to change
anything).
The XML 1.1 and XML namespaces 1.1 *potential* issues should be at least
considered ([2]).
