In 8.2.1 [1],  RFC2518 states:

403 (Forbidden) - The client, for reasons the server chooses not to specify,
cannot alter one of the properties.

409 (Conflict) - The client has provided a value whose semantics are not
appropriate for the property. This includes trying to set read-only
properties.

I think the entry for 409 is just plain wrong -- if a property is read-only
("protected" in deltaV speak), than there's no point in retrying, thus 409
seems to be the wrong choice (it should be 403, possibly with DAV:error in
DAV:reponsedescription).

Is anybody relying on 409 rather than 403?
