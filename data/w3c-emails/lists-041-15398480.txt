This is the agenda I plan to submit for the Atlanta mtg. If there's no
volunteer to discuss bindings, that draft will be dropped from the
agenda.  Please let me know how long you need for your item or I will
assume each issue requires 15 minutes and each draft 20 minutes.

1. ACL status: Lisa Dusseault

2. RFC 2518 bis issues
  Client force authentication issue:  Brian Korver
  If header simplification
  Required Support for ETags: Lisa Dusseault
  New XML Namespaces: Geoff Clemm

3. Other drafts
  Allprop Include draft: Geoff Clemm
  Quota draft: Lisa Dusseault
  Bindings: * need a volunteer *

Lisa
