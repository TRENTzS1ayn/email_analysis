The IETF WG chairs mailing list has been having some interesting
discussions about IETF process.  There will likely be continued
discussions at the IESG Plenary in Atlanta next week, too.  Although
people are discussing changes, it's way too early to know what, if
anything, will change.

I got permission to forward some email from Edward Lewis in the
discussion, because I thought it describes some aspects of the existing
process really clearly.

The point of this is that the WebDAV WG naturally tries to "complete"
each of its drafts, as if they are assignments that must be handed in or
we'll get a bad grade.  That's not the case.  We can also drop work,
even work that is in our charter, and it doesn't mean we've failed as a
working group.
