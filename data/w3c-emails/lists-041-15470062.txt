I'm in violent diasgreement.

The principle you mention is one of the biggest factors leading to
interoperability. If servers do not reject non-compliant requests, clients
do not get fixed. If clients do not get fixed, other server implementors are
forced to implement "workarounds" as well. We already see the results of
this within WebDAV -- almost everybody has workarounds in the server code to
please the most-deployed but worst-supported client (Microsoft webfolders).

While doing this sometimes is unavoidable in real life, putting this into
the protocol is a completely different story.

In this particular case, allowing XML 1.1 in PROPPATCH requests will allow
creation of property names/values that can not be sent back using XML 1.0
(*). Furthermore, there's no reliable way how a server can find out whether
the client actually *understands* XML 1.1. So supporting XML 1.1 will
require new compliance levels or it *will* break communication with older
clients. That's why we really need to understand what's going on before
making changes in RFC2518bis. Right now RFC2518 normatively refers to XML
1.0, and we may want to clarify that this means that requests marshalled in
any other XML version *must* be rejected.

(*) Unless we allow XML 1.1 but explicitly forbid property names/values that
cannot be marshalled using XML 1.0 (in which case using XML 1.1 in the first
place is questionable).
