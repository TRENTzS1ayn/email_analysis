Julian,

The principal you object to (Postel's robustness principal, spelled out
in RFC-793, the TCP/IP draft), informs the design of many IETF
protocols, especially when dealing with issues of backward
compatibility.  Within the IETF, this principal is believed to
increase interoperability, in contrast to what you state.

As for forcing servers to reject non-compliant requests, I think
we'll all agree that non-compliant implementations are a problem,
but how can the protocol document force these implementations
into compliance?  And if vendor Y decides to interoperate with
non-compliant vendor X, there is little that this working group
can do to prohibit vendor Y from doing so.

On the subject of certain non-compliant clients, if we were to
prohibit the accepting of XML1.1, what effect would you expect
that prohibition to have on the decisions made by the vendors of
such clients?

Eric, I don't recall if you stated the client requirements.  Did you
expect that clients would be permitted to generate XML1.1?

Note, the above should not be construed as an argument either for or
against WebDAV support for XML1.1.
