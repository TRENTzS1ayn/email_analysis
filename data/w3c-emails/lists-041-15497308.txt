However, XML is conservative in both directions (malformed requests are
never accepted), and has reached very high interoperability. Are you
suggesting that an XML parser should accept documents with minor
wellformedness errors if it thinks it can fix them?

For example: Microsoft's XML parsers used to accept control characters that
aren't allowed in XML. People solely on the Microsoft platform started using
this as a feature -- they never tested against other implementations. Guess
what they said when Microsoft finally fixed their parser?

So yes, I think that this well known principle is *causing* interoperability
problems. It's much better to have a as-precise-as-possible protocol
definition and to mandate that both clients and servers stick to it.

It can't.

However, Eric was suggesting that the protocol explicitly *allows* accepting
XML 1.1 requests. That's very different from not saying anything about it.

Accepting XML 1.1 requests as they are defined right now would mean that
property values and names (and labels, privileges...) can occur that can't
be marshalled to a client using XML 1.0. That's what I call a major interop
problem.

Hopefully they'd send XML 1.0.

Understood.

Actually, it's a good thing that finally we've got a discussion thread about
this topic :-)
