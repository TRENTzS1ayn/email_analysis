I'd like to thank Jim Luther, and the Mac OS X Core OS group for hosting the
following Interim WebDAV WG meeting. The meeting is free of charge, and open
to all working group members. An agenda will be sent out the mailing list
soon, but will focus on finishing RFC 2518bis, as well as making significant
progress on DASL, bindings, and property-related specifications and
registration.

If you are planning on attending, please RSVP to Jim Luther at
<luther.j@apple.com>.
