Actually, DO NOT RSVP me.

To RSVP, send email to Nora Mosqueda <mosqueda@apple.com> and let Nora 
know that you plan to attend the IETF WebDAV Working Group Interim 
Meeting (include "WebDAV WG Interim Meeting" in the title of your 
email), what day(s) you will be attending, and if you have any dietary 
requirements we should be aware of.

I've included more extensive information below (including an attached 
map).

How to get to Apple's R&D campus
The Apple Computer R&D campus is located in Cupertino, California 
immediately south of Interstate 280 on the east side of De Anza 
Boulevard. Cupertino is 5 minutes west of San Jose and 45 minutes 
southeast of San Francisco in the heart of Silicon Valley.

 From Interstate 280, take De Anza Blvd south to Mariani Avenue (the 
first stoplight). Turn left onto Mariani Ave and then turn left again 
onto Infinite Loop. Free parking will be on your left (park in either 
of the large lots). R&D Building 1 is the building directly across from 
the parking lot.
