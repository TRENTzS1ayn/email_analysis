Julian said: "Checking: the desired semantics are that the request
succeeds
?? independently of the lock still being present or not?"

Geoff said: "Yes."

My response: I don't agree with that narrow definition of what's
desired.  I think the problem statement is that the if header is
constantly causing interoperability problems. The desired semantics are
"some semantics that make locks easier to use".
