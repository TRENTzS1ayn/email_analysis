This makes sort of sense. However, I still don't see why this should be a
requirement. A client that requires entity tags can trivially find out
whether a resource supports them. If the resource doesn't support entity
tags, but the client needs them, don't attempt the operation.

I do agree with the earlier consensus that servers must be consistent in
what they say about etag support (per ressource), notably that DAV:getetag
must be present as property if and only iff HEAD/GET return the etag as well
(but this is just a clarification, not a new requirement).

Actually, that requires *strong* entitity tags as opposed to weak entitity
tags, right? If you make strong etags a requirement, Apache moddav (when
talking to a fs backend) becomes non-compliant. Have you considered that?
