I don't understand that part of the question. The namespace of an attribute
is defined by the "Namespaces in XML" recommendation. There's no ambiguity
here.

Back last year, I wrote down a precise definition of what I think needs to
be persisted. This is not part of it.

This is a no-brainer. Attributes can be put into namespaces to disambiguate
them. The specific case of putting type information into attributes is
discussed in [1], which is compatible with the requirement to persist
attributes.

The spec is silent about what the value of a property actually is. So this
needs to be resolved (issues list [2], issue "PROP_ROUNDTRIP").

I feel strongly for keeping it this way, although I'd prefer wording that
uses the more precise terminology from the XML Infoset
recommendation.PROP_ROUNDTRIP. In particular I'd prefer to delay any change
until the issues above have been dicussed.
