My preference is to keep things the way it is in 2518bis.  I don't feel so 
strongly about keeping all the attributes on the propertyname tag, but I 
definitely don't wan't to agonize over it if there is no strong case to be 
made either way.

I do want to hear more about what Joel Soderberg encountered that would make it lean away from persisting random 
attributes.

I do agree with Julian that the namespace persistance issue is pretty 
clear, but I'll resurrect the discussion on property value roundtripping 
and see if we can nail that issue and all sub issues shut.
