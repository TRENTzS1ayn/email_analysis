Preserving namespaces is almost a given (I would be surprised if that was not already being done by most implementations).  However, I don't believe that the namespace aliasing must be preserved.  When returning the value, different aliases may be used.  

This has no bearing, though, on random attributes (metadata) on the property name.  If you force persistance of these items, that means that you dictate a storage format that is XML.  WebDAV should not be in the business of dictating formats.  

If the only reason for asking for persistance is for namespacing, there are other ways that information can be retained that does not tie the hands of the non-XML based property storage.

My preference is to keep things the way it is in 2518bis.  I don't feel so 
strongly about keeping all the attributes on the propertyname tag, but I 
definitely don't wan't to agonize over it if there is no strong case to be 
made either way.

I do want to hear more about what Joel Soderberg encountered that would make it lean away from persisting random 
attributes.

I do agree with Julian that the namespace persistance issue is pretty 
clear, but I'll resurrect the discussion on property value roundtripping 
and see if we can nail that issue and all sub issues shut.
