Well, I would have agreed with this a few years ago. Since then, W3C
recommendations have been published in which the alias itself has become
significant as well (for instance, when using QNames in attribute values).
So yes, to round-trip XML contents you need the aliases as well.

True.

I didn't intend to do that. Actually, our server does honor the XML Schema
xsi:type attribute to do the same thing (see [1]).

Does it? The server needs to decide on a case-by-case basis anyway. If the
property value contains for instance nested elements, in general you can't
persist it non-XML. Having an "unexpected" attribute is just another case.

Again, nobody said that. If a server thinks that it can round-trip a
property value internally using a non-XML format, it's free to do so.

It's *allowed* to choose an optimized internal representation. It's however
*required* to be able to persist arbitrary XML.

I'll check, but anyway...: if they're able to do the one thing (nested
element content), where's the problem doing the other thing as well?
