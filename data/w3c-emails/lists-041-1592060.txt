I don't feel strongly about it. If, then I would list 207 as
possible status code of COPY/MOVE (where there are completely
absent now) and explain that 423 LOCKED will only map to locked
request-uri. If any other uri (destination included) makes trouble,
clients should be able to deal with a 207.

I don't understand that question. Can you elaborate?
