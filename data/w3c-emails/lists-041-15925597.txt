Hi, I am working on Tomcat 4.1.x for a project. My project has a requirement 
to have web folders for uploading images that can be viewed in the site, that 
we are developing. The number of image files will be very large and that will 
be a daily operation. I wana know more about how I can use webdav that is 
implemented in tomcat 4.1.x for this. Since I was not able to get more 
documentation on the 4.1.x. I say the slide project but i dont need that much 
for my project.  I just need to give authentication for the webfolders 
folders dynamically.

Thanks in advance,
Prabahar
