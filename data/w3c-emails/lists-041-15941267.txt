Hi,

I have created a server with Dav enabled that supports the options and
propfind methods. I have tested it with a Dav client it is working fine.

but when I have tried it with the microsoft windows XP 'my network places',
windows client send to my server a propfind request with an empty body and I
respond by giving all the prop properties but on the client side, windows
gives an error

"[my server] is not accessible."

eventhough I have no security restriction on my server.

what could be the problem with communicating with a microsoft window client?

Thanks,

Burhan
