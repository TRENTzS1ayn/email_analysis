Subject: [Moderator Action] Problem with Single Sign-On and DAV


Hello - I am using a document management product and have enabled its
authentication through an SSO product.  In addition, the Document management
product has WEBDAV.  However, when I try and access the system through DAV,
it challenges me with USERID and PWD again.  The problem is that the
USERID/PWD no longer are in the Document Management product.  They are in
the SSO database.  How do I resolve this issue?



I appreciate your help!
