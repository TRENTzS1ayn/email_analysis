Hello,

This is a reminder to people planning to attend Interim WEBDAV WG 
meeting in January to RSVP at least 1 week before the meeting so 
visitor badges can be printed, and refreshments and meals can be 
planned. Apple Computer will be closed for the holidays from December 
24, 2002 through January 1, 2003 so any RSVPs made during that time 
will not be acknowledged until after the first of the year.

I've copied the details concerning the meeting and how to RSVP below.

- Jim
