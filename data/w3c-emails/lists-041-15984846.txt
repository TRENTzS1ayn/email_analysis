I think Jim Luther neglected to give the precise RSVP contact info for the
Interim WG meeting:

Please RSVP to Nora Mosqueda <mosqueda@apple.com> and let Nora
know that you plan to attend the IETF WebDAV Working Group Interim
Meeting (include "WebDAV WG Interim Meeting" in the title of your
email), what day(s) you will be attending, and if you have any dietary
requirements we should be aware of.

Thanks!

- Jim
