They are missing from the status tables, but they are mentioned in
descriptions and examples.

I think the issue is that

- 423 is used both for LOCK problems on source and destination URIs,

- there doesn't seem to be any prior usage of multistatus to describe
information about destination URIs.

The cleanest "solution" (although not backward-compatible) would be to have
a separate status code for the condition "destination locked". However, we
are currently talking about RFC2518, so we're probably stuck with the
ambiguity.

In a future WebDAV protocol that supports enhanced error reporting a la
RFC3253, I'd probably suggest:

409 CONFLICT
...

<error xmlns='DAV:'><destination-URI-is-locked/></error>

I understand that as: is it actually allowed (in copy/move/delete) to use
multistatus to report problems on destination resources?
