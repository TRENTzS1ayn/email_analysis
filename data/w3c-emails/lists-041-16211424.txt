It seems from draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-07 that only
version-controlled resources are part of the ordering of
version-controlled collections (Section 9: "for compatibility with
RFC3253, only the ordering of version-controlled members needs to be
maintained")

Does that mean there's no way to order versioned and unversioned
resources together within a version-controlled collection?
