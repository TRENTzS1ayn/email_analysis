   From: Lisa Dusseault [mailto:lisa@xythos.com]

   It seems from draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-07 that only
   version-controlled resources are part of the ordering of
   version-controlled collections (Section 9: "for compatibility with
   RFC3253, only the ordering of version-controlled members needs to
   be maintained")

   Does that mean there's no way to order versioned and unversioned
   resources together within a version-controlled collection?

That is correct.  The issue is that when you UPDATE a
version-controlled collection with a new version, it can change the
set of version-controlled members, and there would not be a way to
define what the ordering of the existing non-version-controlled
members should be wrt the new version-controlled members.

Cheers,
Geoff
