The full context being:

"This specification considers both the ordering type (DAV:ordering-type
property) and the ordering of collection members to be part of the state of
a collection. Therefore both MUST be recorded upon CHECKIN or
VERSION-CONTROL, and both MUST be restored upon CHECKOUT, UNCHECKOUT or
UPDATE (where for compatibility with RFC3253, only the ordering of
version-controlled members needs to be maintained)."

Nope. It's supposed to mean that you *can* order both types of resources
within a versioned-controlled collection, but collection *versions* will
only keep ordering information for those members that were
version-controlled.

Do I need to rephrase the text to make this clearer?
