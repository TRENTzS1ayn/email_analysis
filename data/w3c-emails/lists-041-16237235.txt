Wait-a-minute :-)

For instance, we can define that the UPDATE operation does not define the
ordering of those members (that is, the server (a) may insert them in
arbitrary places or (b) must insert them at the end). Currently the
postcondition is:

"(DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members-ordered): If the request
modified the DAV:checked-in version of a version-controlled collection and
the DAV:ordering-type for the checked-in version is not unordered
("DAV:unordered"), the version-controlled members MUST be ordered according
to the checked-in version's DAV:version-controlled-binding-set property."

How about adding:

"Members that are not version-controlled MUST be moved to the end of the
ordering (in no particular order)."

This behaviour would be consistent with section 6.1 (setting the position
when no ordering information was specified).
