   For instance, we can define that the UPDATE operation does not
   define the ordering of those members (that is, the server (a) may
   insert them in arbitrary places or (b) must insert them at the
   end). Currently the postcondition is:

   "(DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members-ordered): If the
   request modified the DAV:checked-in version of a version-controlled
   collection and the DAV:ordering-type for the checked-in version is
   not unordered ("DAV:unordered"), the version-controlled members
   MUST be ordered according to the checked-in version's
   DAV:version-controlled-binding-set property."

   How about adding:

   "Members that are not version-controlled MUST be moved to the end of the
   ordering (in no particular order)."

   This behaviour would be consistent with section 6.1 (setting the position
   when no ordering information was specified).

That would be fine with me, or just saying that the order of the
non-version-controlled members is server-defined following the UPDATE.

Cheers,
Geoff
