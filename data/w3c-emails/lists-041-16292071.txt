Sorry, I must not have been sufficiently clear in my questions.  I'm
mostly discussing operations without the Position header -- operations
with clients that aren't aware of ordering.

So this meant, how are resources added to a client-ordered collection
when the Position header is missing? Must servers add them to the end of
the ordering or can they be put at the beginning or anywhere?

Again I was unclear.  I meant direct sub-collections, or collections
which are direct children of the ordered collection. These are ordered
together with regular child resources, correct?  There are no examples
of this but I believe this is what the spec says.

What happens if the Position header is not present?  Must servers
preserve the ordering or lose it?

And here, what happens if the COPY method has no Position header?

No, I disagree with this.  Overwriting a regular resource does not reset
all the live properties.  For example, it would be pretty disastrous for
the ACL property to be reset every time a resource is overwritten.
Besides, the ordering is a property of the parent, not the resource
being overwritten.  I would expect that ordering would be preserved, but
the spec ought to say one way or another.

Then why not make it explicit in the specification?

It is not the servers doing "safe save" operation, it's the clients, and
these may be clients that are unaware of ordering or choose not to set
the Position header.

It's important to consider how a server with an ordered collection
interacts with ordinary clients (ones that do not use the Position
header). Otherwise, an author that tries to keep their collection
ordered may frequently find the ordering  unecessarily "messed up" after
resources are added, deleted, renamed, or overwritten by non-ordering
client software (e.g. Office).
