Process question:  what is the ACL list, and why is conversation
on a decision to be made by the working group moving to it?
If this is a design team, pleae note the IESG's statement
on the work of design teams at:

http://www.ietf.org/IESG/STATEMENTS/Design-Teams.txt

Thanks for filling me in,
regards,
Ted Hardie
