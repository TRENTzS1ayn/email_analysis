I was suggesting to take the question to the ACL mailing list, because it
affects mainly the WebDAV ACL spec, not the ordering spec (which is
discussed here on the "generic" WebDAV mailing list) -- the WebDAV ACL
mailing list simply is a better place to resolve open issues regarding the
behaviour of ACLs upon COPY/MOVE.
