That's why I wrote *usually* here.

That would be good. Do we? Anyway, this should be clarified in RFC2518bis.

That *may* be the source for the confusion.

However I've got the impression that Lisa would like servers to better
support the following request chain ("safe delete"):

GET A
PUT A.bak
MOVE A.bak -> A

or similarily

GET A
MOVE A -> A.bak
PUT A
DELETE A.bak

Under this scenario, a resource would usually lose it's ordering position.
However, it would also lose it's version history and it's ACL, so I fail to
see why this would be a specific problem with the ordering spec.

However, if the client would issue these requests:

GET A
PUT A.bak
COPY A.bak A
DELETE A.bak

and the server conforms to the RFC3253 COPY semantics, there wouldn't be any
problem with ordering, ACLs or version history (the ordering spec just
"inherits" from the server's view of what COPY/Overwrite means).

So if at the end of the day we agree that COPY should always have RFC3253
sematics, I'm all for it :-) I just didn't want the ordering spec to require
a specific model.


Julian


P.S.: these "safe delete" scenarios obviously can become problematic if the
client doesn't properly handle dead properties.
