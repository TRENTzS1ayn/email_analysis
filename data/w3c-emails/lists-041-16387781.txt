I agree there's little we can do about the safe-save algorithms that use
MOVE, sadly.  In fact, the correctest behavior for MOVE is probably, as
with version histories, to retain the source resource's ordering
position if a destination is overwritten.

However, if a destination is not being overwritten, then shouldn't the
MOVE (the rename) preserve ordering?
