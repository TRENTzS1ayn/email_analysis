The ACL list can be loosely viewed as a design team. I say loosely, since
design teams are normally small and closed, and this list is open and free
for all to subscribe. It emerged as a way to prevent the main DAV list from
being occasionally swamped by ACL discussion.

Operationally, actively working members of the DAV WG are subscribed to both
the main DAV list and the ACL list, and so the ACL list serves as a
convenient partitioning and filtering mechanism for ACL discussions.

Of course, all drafts discussed on the ACL list are brought to the main DAV
list for WG last call, and for official decisions on consensus. See for
example:
