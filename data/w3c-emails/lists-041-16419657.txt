Stumbled across this recent press release:

"To meet the needs of enterprise developers, XMLSPY 5 builds on the
success of previous award winning versions through the addition of
several key new features: 

Enhanced WebDAV Support -- Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning (WebDAV) is a standardized set of extensions to the HTTP
(web) protocol, which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage
XML files located on remote web-servers. XMLSPY 5 and AUTHENTIC 5 now
support Delta-V (http://www.webdav.org/deltav/), an extension to the
WebDAV protocol which enables check-in/check-out functionality when used
in conjunction with a WebDAV server, thus supporting XML content editing
in a truly collaborative, distributed environment, such as the Web."
