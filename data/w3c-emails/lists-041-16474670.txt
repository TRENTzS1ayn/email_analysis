OK...:

1) noted and closed.

2) noted and added a sentence clarifying that DELETE MUST NOT affect the
ordering of the remaining members.

3) noted as open issue [1]  -- suggest not to do anything about it unless
more people speak up in favor of requiring a specific server behaviour.


Regards,

Julian
