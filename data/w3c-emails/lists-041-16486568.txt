OK,

I finally got feedback from Altova. The Home Edition doesn't seem to do
DeltaV, but the Enterprise Edition does. Once an external web folder is
added to a project, version-controlled resources can be checked-in and
checked-out. Checkin even prompts for DAV:comment (I think this is the first
client doing this :-). I haven't managed to enable version-control using
XML-Spy, though.

Some more info is at:
