Just a brief reminder that we're in the final days of a working group last
call for comments period on the WebDAV Ordered Collections protocol,
draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-07.

From the abstract of the -07 specification

  This specification extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
  to support server-side ordering of collection members. Of particular
  interest are orderings that are not based on property values, and so
  cannot be achieved using a search protocol's ordering option and
  cannot be maintained automatically by the server. Protocol elements
  are defined to let clients specify the position in the ordering of
  each collection member, as well as the semantics governing the
  ordering.

This last call for comments period ends Sunday, April 27, 2003, at midnight,
US Pacific time.

The specification can be accessed at:

Based on comments received so far, there will likely be another draft
produced, but there will not be another WG last call period. I am currently
anticipating that the -08 specification will be sent immediately to the IESG
for approval. As a result, if you are planning on reviewing this
specification, please do so immediately.
