Thanks Julian. But can't we use the properties instead. For example in case of
having a book, just define a property called page, or if there is no proper
property, just create a proper one for them. I read the documentation, it is
saying  "The ordering protocol defined here focuses on support for such
human-maintained orderings."  What does it mean by human-maintained ordering?

Sorry if it is very basic question.
Bita.
