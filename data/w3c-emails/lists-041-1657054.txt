Hi,

I recently tested this ([1]). After changing the explorer options, Word
indeed launches when selecting a link to a .doc file, however a trace shows
that Word

a) GETs the resource (ok) and displays it as "read only" (wrong), then

b) does an OPTION on the root collection (wrong, it may not be DAV enabled),
then

c) does an OPTION on the resource itself, which responds with a 401 (Auth
required). However, the authentication dialog does not pop up until Word's
document window is closed.

Has anybody used this setup successfully?

And yes,

d) the file can be successfully opened and edited when opened from
Microsoft's webfolder client.

Julian
