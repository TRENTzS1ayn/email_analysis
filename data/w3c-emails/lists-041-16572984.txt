Well, I was thinking that maybe the best use case of the Ordering protocol was
regarded to the versioning of resources. In this case, I though if every time
that a revision is created, a live property containing the name of resource was

attached to the resource, maybe we didn't need to the new Ordered protocol.

Does it make sense?
