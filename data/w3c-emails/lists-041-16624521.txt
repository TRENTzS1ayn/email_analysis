That seems odd to me.  I've not tried mod_dav in about 3 years, but what I 
know of Apache suggests that you can use it for whatever accounts you 
define.  Perhaps I just misunderstand your statement though.   So what 
specifically have you heard prevents one from using it in support of the 
accounts that you mention?
