if the spec is silent on the issue simply means that it's undefined. So an
implementor that assumes this mean "MUST" simply is wrong. The point being,
we (Geoff and myself) feel that the spec shouldn't require any specific
server behaviour, and thus not defining it at all seems to be absolutely
reasonable.
