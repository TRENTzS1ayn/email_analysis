(See "Issues List" immediately after the Table of Contents).

There is currently one open issue which is in the process of resolution on
the WG mailing list (issue 6.1, when-are-members-added).

Once the open issues have been resolved, the document editor, Julian
Reschke, will issue a new Internet-Draft. Once this has been done,
draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-08 will be sent to the IESG for approval
as a Proposed Standard.
