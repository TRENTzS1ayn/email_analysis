Yes.

To summarize the possible variations:

1) specify that a MOVE inside a collection does not add a new member -> in
this case a "rename" operation won't change ordering, but will be completely
inconsistent with the cross-collection MOVE (where a new member *is* added
and thus the Position header semantics apply)

2) specify that a MOVE inside a collection removes the old and adds a new
member -> consistency with cross-collection MOVE operation, but ordering
will be lost when done by a client that isn't aware of ordering semantics

3) do not mandate a specific behaviour (the current wording) -- in which
case we'd still need to decide whether spec needs to be more specific about
this being server-defined behaviour.

I think in doubt we should consider simplicity of the spec as well,
therefore leave things as they are and possibly make that more explicit.
