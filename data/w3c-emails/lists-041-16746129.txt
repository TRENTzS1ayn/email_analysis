We actually have two logical operations hiding under the name "MOVE".
(a) One is a rename within a collection. (b) The other is a move (possibly
also with a rename at the same time) to another collection.

I don't think people would expect the same ordering behavior for (a) and
(b), since they view them as different logical operations.
