Well,

actually I *do* assume that MOVE behaves the same regardless the source
collection (and I assume so is Geoff).

To summarize: principles of "least surprise" or "regularity" do not seem to
help us here -- they can be used to argue for both positions. As this is
supposed to become a "proposed" standard only, we may want to delay this
decision in order to gather more implementation experience (as far as I know
currently there's only one single implementation). Therefore, my proposal is
to leave this specific point undefined. We'd then still need to decide
whether the spec should explicitly point out that the behaviour is
server-dependant.

Feedback appreciated.

Julian
