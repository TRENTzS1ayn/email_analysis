Hi,

Sorry to bother you about this but I've tried Googling for an answer and
can't seem to find any mentions.  I have WebDAV running successfully on
Redhat 8 and can access enabled directories with no problems from Windows
using Network Places.  However, when I try to use OS X "connect to server",
I can connect to the enabled directory but all subdirectories are named but
not accessible (there is no folder icon and when the name of the subdir is
clicked the listing disappears from the directory contents).  I don't see
any error report in httpd's logs to indicate what is going on.  Windows has
no problem accessing the subdirs.  Have you heard of this?

Thanks

Jerry
