Nope :-) Status codes *other* than 403 *or* 409 are replaces.

That would be 423 LOCKED or 403 FORBIDDEN.

Actually, I'd prefer to change/clarify multistatus error reporting to:

- MUST contain response elements for each source resource that wasn't
moved/copied/deleted as specified (however keeping the current optimization
for 424 on ancestors)

- MAY contain response elements for targets that caused the failure.

So we would get something like:

<multistatus xmlns="DAV:">
   <response>
      <href>source</href>
      <status>HTTP/1.1 403 Conflict</status>

<responsedescription><error><destination-locked/></error></responsedescripti
on>
   </response>
   <response>
      <href>http://host/destination/parent</href>
      <status>HTTP/1.1 423 LOCKED</status>
   </response>
   ...
</multistatus>

The benefit being that a client that "blindly" searches for source URIs will
find something. However, a smarter client can extract the additional piece
of information that's available after all.


It might be woth thinking to also add some kind of linkage between the two
response elements.
