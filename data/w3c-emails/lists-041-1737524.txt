Actually, I tend to be of the other camp.  I feel the spec should avoid UI
imperatives if possible, the spec is clear enough about what the possible
negative repercusions of this UI approach are, and if a client wants to
experiment at the UI level, let them... as long as they comply at the
protocol level.  (I assume Msft complies at the protocol level, but I
haven't verified that.)

I don't feel strongly though and will go with the flow.

I agree.

we just noticed the following bug in Microsoft's web folder implementation:
when displaying the contents of a collection, it will use (when present)
the
DAV:displayname property as internal member name. Furthermore, the URI
displayed in the "tabular view" will use the collection's URI + the
displayname to build the member's URI.

This is obviously wrong, because there's no guarantee that the individual
DAV.displayname values in a property are distinct.

IMHO, the RFC2518 revision should say:

"User agents MUST not use the DAV:displayname to identify the individual
collection members (because the value may not be unique across the members
of a collection). However, they MAY use it to display additional
information
about a collection member".
