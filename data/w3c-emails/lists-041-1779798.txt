MS Webfolder does that. The result being that if you rename an internal
member and then do a refresh of the window, you see the old name again
(because DAV:displayname does not change as well). I'd call this a client
problem that could have been avoided with a better description of
DAV:displayname.

MS Webfolder seems to *internally* keep the right URL, yet it displays the
wrong one (both as member name and in the "href" column).
