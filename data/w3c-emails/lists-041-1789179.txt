So, as usual I propose a format which will make everyone scream and
come up with a much better one.

...
<D:response>
   <D:href>/bla/...</D:href>
   <D:status>HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT</D:status>
   <D:cause>
     <D:href>/other/...</D:href>
     <D:status>HTTP/1.1 423 LOCKED</D:status>
   </D:cause>
</D:response>
