Yes, that was what I meant ... even though I know
that COPY is applied to the object that is not being changed, and
has a header identifying the object that is being changed,
my subconscious keeps wanting it to be the other way (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

I think it sould be the other way around:

- when the source was locked, just report 423 on the source,

- when the source wasn't copied because it's destination was locked, report
409 for the source and throw in a pointer to the locked destination.
