If headers with ETags do not add any value to the protocol. For
GET rfc2616 already defines If-Match and friends. Since the ETag
only captures content changes (property changes have undefined
effect on ETags), IF headers for ETag lack a use case.

Having never encountered a client using them, I propose to
drop ETags in IF headers.

The remaining "more advanced" features of IF I can think of are:
- not
- use of URIs with locktokens

URIs with locktokens are in use by us (both server and client).

Does anyone have a use case for "Not"?
