We can handle this similar to the "keepalive" body for COPY requests.

Do we know a client using IF headers with ETags? If it is a feature
not used by anyone, it has not proven interoperability and we should
change/discard it.

If we discover that it is used, or if someone can explain the use
case and benefits, that is a completely different matter.

Our server is able to handle the current IF header syntax, so I
have no problem with the current specification. I just think that
cutting away unused features will increase interoperable
implementations.
