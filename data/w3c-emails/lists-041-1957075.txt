Stefan,
   Greg's posting didn't point out anything that can't be done without the
ETag support in the IF: header.   That's why he ended his posting with:

> Arguably, the semantic could be manufactured with other combinations, but
> I'd suggest that is your use case.

If you know of another case that he told you about off line, please share
it.

If anyone actually knows of a client that actually uses the IF: etag
feature, then please point it out.

J.

As I wrote earlier today, Greg changed my mind on this matter.
There is a use case which cannot be covered by existing HTTP features.

So I'd vote for keeping the If: header as it is.
