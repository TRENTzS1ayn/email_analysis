<<
I think a key point is the one Greg made at the end of this message,
namely that this use case can be achieved without allowing etags in
the If header.  In particular, you just try the PUT with the LOCK
request, and if that fails because you no longer have the lock, you
retry the PUT with the appropriate etag in an If-Match header.  I
think it is very reasonable to require an extra round trip in an
exceptional case like this (i.e. losing your lock).
>>
Or depending on your purpose, just skip directly to the second step
of using the If-Match header.  It depends on what you're trying to
achieve.
