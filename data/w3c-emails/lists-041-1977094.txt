Well, using also ETag verification allows consistency check. If you still
have your lock and the ETag has changed, then it's because something nasty
happened on the server side (as the ETag represents more or less a version
tag of the resource).
As it won't cost anything, I don't understand why you want to remove a
consistency check.
