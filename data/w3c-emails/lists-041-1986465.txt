<<
Well, using also ETag verification allows consistency check. If you still
have your lock and the ETag has changed, then it's because something nasty
happened on the server side (as the ETag represents more or less a version
tag of the resource).
As it won't cost anything, I don't understand why you want to remove a
consistency check.

He wasn't suggesting giving up the consistancy check.  He was suggesting
you
can already do that consistancy check without IF:/etag.  You can use
HTTP's IF-MATCH:/etag instead in most cases.
