That is the current state of affairs, yes.

Hmm. I think it would be useful to say that ETags should only
change on content modifications. In my understanding HTTP
caches are encouraged by HTTP/1.1 to validate on ETags.
WebDAV enabled servers could improve caching if PROPPATCH
and friends would not change ETags.

So, a recommendation in a future version of 2518 makes sense,
don't you think?
