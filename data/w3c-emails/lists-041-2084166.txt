Are servers commonly expected to keep GET on a source resource bitwise
identical with the last PUT?  It seemed transcoding, canonicalizing,
or other postprocessing at PUT time would be expected to routinely
change strong ETags (in fact we do that sort of thing to deter abuse
of a free hosting service).  Are common clients unable to accomodate
this?
