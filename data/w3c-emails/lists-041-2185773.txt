How about a more generic version:

<D:response>
    <D:href>/bla/source</D:href>
    <D:status>HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT</D:status>
    <D:responsedescription>
      <D:dependant-status>
        ... complete DAV:response element for resource causing the conflict
      </D:dependant-status>
   </D:responsedescription>
</D:response>

This would avoid having to define a whole new set of error conditions...
