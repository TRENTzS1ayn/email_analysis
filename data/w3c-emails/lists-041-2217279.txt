The reason not to reuse it is that this is not a "response"
element, but rather an "explanation" element (i.e. the same
reason you would not re-use a "point" element to represent
a "vector" element, even though they both contained 2 integers).
In particular, it is likely that you will want to extent a
"response" in ways that are inappropriate for an "explanation",
and vica versa.

Of course, as with most questions of re-use, it is a value
judgement as to "how close" two concepts are to each other,
and how likely it is for them to evolve in divergent ways.

Cheers,
Geoff

Well, we need 

- the URI and
- error information (be it an HTTP status or a DAV:error element).

DAV:response is a container that can hold both, so why not re-use it?
