Looks like, MS-Explorer treat each resource with not empty
<DAV:resourcetype> as collection. For example, if resource type is

<DAV:resourcetype>
<DAV:version/>
</DAV:resourcetype>

this version is displayed as folder.
Does anybody knows how to solve the problem and make
this version visible as normal file (not folder) in MS-Explorer?
