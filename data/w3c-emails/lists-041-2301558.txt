Not only is DAV:version as a resourcetype not in RFC-3253,
it is explicitly forbidden in RFC-3253 (the DAV:resourcetype
of a version must be the same as the DAV:resourcetype of the
version-controlled resource that was checked in to create it).

And also note that this one done to some extent with the
WebFolders problem in mind ...  In particular RFC-3253 only
gives non-null DAV:resourcetype values to resources that have
no content (which means that it should cause no problem to
have them be treated as "folders" by WebFolders).

Cheers,
Geoff

a) AFAIK, there's no workaround for this particular problem in Microsoft's
compliant. Keep complaing to them.

b) But: why are you trying to specify a resourcetype of DAV:version at the
first place? That's not in RFC3253...
