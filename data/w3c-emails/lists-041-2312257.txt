RE: Microsoft WebFolders and resource typeThe WebDAV.org site is the best
overall source of information about WebDAV. The WebDAV working group site
also has a wealth of information:

http://www.webdav.org/
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/

But, since you've done a Google search, you undoubtedly have already found
these pages...

  Not only is DAV:version as a resourcetype not in RFC-3253,
  it is explicitly forbidden in RFC-3253 (the DAV:resourcetype
  of a version must be the same as the DAV:resourcetype of the
  version-controlled resource that was checked in to create it).

  And also note that this one done to some extent with the
  WebFolders problem in mind ...  In particular RFC-3253 only
  gives non-null DAV:resourcetype values to resources that have
  no content (which means that it should cause no problem to
  have them be treated as "folders" by WebFolders).

  Cheers,
  Geoff

  a) AFAIK, there's no workaround for this particular problem in Microsoft's
  compliant. Keep complaing to them.

  b) But: why are you trying to specify a resourcetype of DAV:version at the
  first place? That's not in RFC3253...
