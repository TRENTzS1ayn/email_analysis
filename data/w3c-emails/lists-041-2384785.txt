If the source property is removed, then how will the server respond to a
client that attempts to use DAV on a resource that is not DAV authorable
but is derived from other sources?  What is the interoperability mechanism?
I would prefer a source Link solution, myself, since that can be supplied
in a normal HTTP error response.

In my opinion, WebDAV needs to solve this issue before progressing on
the standards track.  It cannot simply remove it without abandoning the
pretense that it handles Web authoring.
