I would assume that all authoring-type requests (PUT, PROPPATCH) will fail
(403?).

The issue that we have to resolve is that RFC2518 *does* specify a property
that signals source resources, however the mechanism is underspecified, and
because of that (and other reasons) we don't have interoperable
implementations of it.

For RFC2518 to move forward, it will either prove interoperability, or drop
the feature.

My suggestion is to drop {DAV:}source in RFC2518, then to define a new live
property in a separate RFC (this wouldn't block RFC2518's progress).

So you'd prefer it to my an HTTP response header? We'd still need a PROPFIND
compatible live property that a user agent can use to discover the source
directly (without having to try to modify the resource).

I don't think I can agree here. RFC2518 has proven useful without anybody
supporting this property, so it's current state shouldn't block any progress
on RFC2518.
