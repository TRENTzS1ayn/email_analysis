What is the interoperability mechanism?
I would prefer a source Link solution, myself, since that can be supplied
in a normal HTTP error response.
>>
I like the source link solution also, but we have to demonstrate
interoperability.  People haven't been breaking down the doors for this and
no interoperability has been determined.  An additional proposal would have
to be made, and then implementations of that would be needed, and then
interoperability tested.  In the mean time the spec could not move forward
to the next stage.  But we have real important changes in store that are
already approved and time we spend on defining the DAV:source property,
which people haven't been requesting heavily, is time folks are
implementing 2518 with all it's warts instead of all the improvements we've
already approved.

<<
In my opinion, WebDAV needs to solve this issue before progressing on
the standards track.  It cannot simply remove it without abandoning the
pretense that it handles Web authoring.
>>
My thinking is, we need to move the spec forward and dav:source isn't
something people have been requesting heavily.  I suspect the reason they
haven't is because it's not heavily needed.    Before WebDAV we've had file
system access and FTP access.  These were used pretty easily for authoring
without a source property.  Folks just knew what part of the FTP or file
system namespace needed to be accessed to do their editing.  It's not a
terrible burden to expect the same to happen with WebDAV.  Servers will
often provide a WebDAV enabled URI space to access underlying resources
(much like what is accessed in the file system or via FTP).   Down the
road, if there is a demand, we'll spec a new DAV:source property that
points to the source URL tree that many folks have already been using.
