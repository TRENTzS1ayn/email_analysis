I agree. Authoring access to an unprocessed source representation of a
resource has been a WebDAV goal from the very beginning (see Section 5.5 of
RFC 2291). Removing RFC 2518's mechanism for accomplishing this doesn't help
reach the goal -- it's just a punt.

In what way(s) is this mechanism underspecified? From my perspective, it
provides sufficient information for an authoring client to discover a URL
where authoring can take place.

I assert that, given a few weeks of coding, we could easily demonstrate at
least two clients and two servers interoperating on this feature as
currently specified. There are no obvious technical impediments to doing so.
