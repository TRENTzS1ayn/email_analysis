I just dropped the xlink: from the href attribute, and got rid of the
xlink:role attribute entirely, giving e.g.:

<D:prop>
 <D:source-set>
  <D:source href="http://example.com/dav/source.xml">Source</D:source>
  <D:source href="http://example.com/dav/render.xsl">Stylesheet</D:source>
  <D:source href="http://example.com/dav/etc.etc"/>
 </D:source-set>
</D:prop>

which should satisfy your first and third requirements; I'm not sure
about "machine-readable" link descriptions being mandatory. My client
doesn't need to understand anything about the link, I just want it to be
able to display a menu of "URI: description" choices when there is >1
source available, so that the user can decide.

(Similarly, the minimum amount of server configuration I'd like to
require is saying e.g. "/dav/render.xsl is a source of /dav/*.xml")
