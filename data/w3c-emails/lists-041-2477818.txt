Joe,

- the point of a machine-readable link type is that a client may be able to
offer a better user interface if it knows what kind of link this is. For
instance, there might be a special "role" for the XSLT file used for
creating an HTML presentation of an XML file, and certainly it would be good
for client to be able to detect whether one of the sources plays this role.
No, we don't have  to define roles, but it certainly makes sense to have an
optional place where they *may* be reported. XLink reports them using URIs,
and I think so should we.

- you have removed the XLink compatible syntax without, but have stayed with
the href attribute. This makes your format both incompatible with XLink and
the standard DAV:href format (which can be used by RFC3253's expand-property
REPORT). Why did you do this? It doesn't make your format simple to
process -- it just saves a few characters in the XML representation. I think
HREFs should either be reported consistent with other WebDAV standards
(DAV:href, supported by the expand-property REPORT), or compatible with
XLink (which I would personally prefer). Unfortunately, we can't have both
at the same time...
