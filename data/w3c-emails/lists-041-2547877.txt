I just mean it's annoying to have to go and read Yet Another XSpec to
find out how to implement WebDAV.  If the DAV spec can explain that the
xlink:href attribute must contain a URI-reference, and that xlink:role
is entirely optional, then it's not really a problem.

It does mean requiring that clients resolve XML namespaces on attribute
names, which hasn't be necessary so far to implement a DAV client (in my
experience anyway); possible interoperability issues there.

I'll implement this source-set proposal sometime this week hopefully,
given that nobody else objects to using XLink.
