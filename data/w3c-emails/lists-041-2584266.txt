In this case I think we should be compatible with the XLink syntax. As
members of the broader community of Web standards developers, we should be
consistent with existing relevant standards, unless we have a strong reason
for deviating.

Since most clients do not currently support the source property, I suspect
the interoperability issues won't be very significant.

PS - I can't wait until Yaron sees we have added another XML attribute into
the DAV spec :-)
