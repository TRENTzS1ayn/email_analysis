Subject: [Moderator Action] Can WebDav be used with Servlet/JSP based Web
Application


Hello!!
Please first let me explain my problem. I am Java Developer working on a
Java based Web Application. I want to provide my user with the ability to
Check In, Check Out, Add and View files i.e. I want to build a version
control system that is integrated with my web site. The usecase would be
that the user would log into my Web Site and then be able to access a page
where he will get a list of files and then he can Check-In, Check-Out, Add
and View files.



I have heard that WebDav provides a sort of version control mechanism. Can
WebDav be integrated with a Servlet/JSP based application and allow the user
to perform the task that I have listed above. Please do reply.
