Yes it can.  I wrote a web component for our portal framework with JSPs using
JavaScript to provide browsing, upload, download, permission management,
property editing, etc. on a web page.

Subject: [Moderator Action] Can WebDav be used with Servlet/JSP based Web
Application



Hello!! 
Please first let me explain my problem. I am Java Developer working on a Java
based Web Application. I want to provide my user with the ability to Check
In, Check Out, Add and View files i.e. I want to build a version control
system that is integrated with my web site. The usecase would be that the
user would log into my Web Site and then be able to access a page where he
will get a list of files and then he can Check-In, Check-Out, Add and View
files. 


I have heard that WebDav provides a sort of version control mechanism. Can
WebDav be integrated with a Servlet/JSP based application and allow the user
to perform the task that I have listed above. Please do reply.
