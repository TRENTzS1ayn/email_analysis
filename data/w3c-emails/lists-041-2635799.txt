MessageYou can also program WebDAV requests/responses using a Servlet
Engine.  In addition to the doGet() method, the service() method of the
servlet class must handle the WebDAV methods such as PROPFIND, PROPPATCH,
MOVE, COPY... and any DeltaV methods that you end up supporting on the
server.

One "gotcha" with servlet engines is that some WebDAV clients won't talk to
a WebDAV server unless the root directory '/' responds to the OPTIONS
requests.  So the WebDAV servlet has to take over the root of the server
address space, rather than just be mounted as something like
myserver.com/servlet/webdav.

  Yes it can.  I wrote a web component for our portal framework with JSPs
using JavaScript to provide browsing, upload, download, permission
management, property editing, etc. on a web page.

    Subject: [Moderator Action] Can WebDav be used with Servlet/JSP based
Web Application


    Hello!!
    Please first let me explain my problem. I am Java Developer working on a
Java based Web Application. I want to provide my user with the ability to
Check In, Check Out, Add and View files i.e. I want to build a version
control system that is integrated with my web site. The usecase would be
that the user would log into my Web Site and then be able to access a page
where he will get a list of files and then he can Check-In, Check-Out, Add
and View files.



    I have heard that WebDav provides a sort of version control mechanism.
Can WebDav be integrated with a Servlet/JSP based application and allow the
user to perform the task that I have listed above. Please do reply.
