The server implmentation is fine but if we use a web-based application then, to talk to the actual server that processes the webdav requests we have to add an extra layer in the archectiure of the system. This new layer would sit between the web-browsers requests and the webdav implemenation. Wonder how this would affect performance?

You can also program WebDAV requests/responses using a Servlet Engine.  In addition to the doGet() method, the service() method of the servlet class must handle the WebDAV methods such as PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MOVE, COPY... and any DeltaV methods that you end up supporting on the server.
 
One "gotcha" with servlet engines is that some WebDAV clients won't talk to a WebDAV server unless the root directory '/' responds to the OPTIONS requests.  So the WebDAV servlet has to take over the root of the server address space, rather than just be mounted as something like myserver.com/servlet/webdav.

Yes it can.  I wrote a web component for our portal framework with JSPs using JavaScript to provide browsing, upload, download, permission management, property editing, etc. on a web page.

Subject: [Moderator Action] Can WebDav be used with Servlet/JSP based Web Application



Hello!! 
Please first let me explain my problem. I am Java Developer working on a Java based Web Application. I want to provide my user with the ability to Check In, Check Out, Add and View files i.e. I want to build a version control system that is integrated with my web site. The usecase would be that the user would log into my Web Site and then be able to access a page where he will get a list of files and then he can Check-In, Check-Out, Add and View files. 


I have heard that WebDav provides a sort of version control mechanism. Can WebDav be integrated with a Servlet/JSP based application and allow the user to perform the task that I have listed above. Please do reply.
