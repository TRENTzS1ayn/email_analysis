Hi Greg,
My objective is to establish a connection between an application (developed
in Java) with any mail  Server(Ex: Exchange/Lotus). Please guide me to use
WebDAV for this purpose. I mean help me to use WebDav to talk to any server
(using Java).
It'd be nice if you can send me the Java API to get started with WebDAV.

Regards,

Anand Deshpande
