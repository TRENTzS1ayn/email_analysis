x1: I consider it significantly more important that
a WebDAV feature be consistent with the WebDAV standard than that it be
consistent with some other non-WebDAV standard, W3C or other.

x2: I consider it significantly more important that a WebDAV feature
be processable with standard WebDAV aware parsers (which expect href
elements) than that they be processable with a non-WebDAV parser (such
as XLink).

x3: I consider adding a DAV:role element to be a superior way of adding
this functionality in a WebDAV spec, given the capability of later
extending the DAV:role element with additional structured values, which
is not available with a role attribute.

h2: The DAV:expand-property report is just a concrete instance of the
cost of being inconsistent ... if we adopt the xlink:href attribute
for the DAV:source property, every WebDAV feature that wants to do something
generic with DAV:href elements would have to be defined and coded to look
for both DAV:href elements and xlink:href attributes.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

I expected this one :-)

Pros for DAV:href syntax:

h1 - consistent with other WebDAV specs
h2 - can take advantage of DAV:expand-property report

Pros for XLink syntax:

x1 - consistent with W3C recommendations
x2 - can be processed using standard XLink aware code (for instance, in
browsers / xml based user interfaces)
x3 - provides a standard framework for the definition of rules as URIs

Thoughts:

h2: isn't really a problem. We just define a new REPORT (or extend the
existing one) to work on xlink:href elements as well. Note that xlink:href
elements may appear in other people's dead (and live) properties anyway, so
it makes sense to have a standard way to resolve them anyway. If there's
some interest in this, I'll make a proposal.

x3: I think any solution using non-XLink based syntax must define a way how
to express the role of the link. One way would be to reuse XLinks link role
URIs *without* using their syntax (which I'd consider lame :-).
