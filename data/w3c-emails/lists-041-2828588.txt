Yup.  And conversely w.s. is probably not signficant in values that consist
only of tags.

And we don't need to make it significant in known properties like
getcontentlength where we
can probably deal with leading and trailing spaces.  Buf if a server/client
isn't familiar with an incoming property,
they need to treat non tagged values in a way that preserves spaces.  This
also applies to known properties where there are
signficant reasons why the spacing should not be altered.

Right?
