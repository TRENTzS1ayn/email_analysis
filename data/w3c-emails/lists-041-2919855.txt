I found a server which requires you to ask for at least one property... 
Microsoft-IIS/5.0 (Windows 2000 Professional). If you ask for no 
properties, it replies with "400 Bad Request". The other servers I 
tested (Apple iDisk, Xythos Sharemation, Apache 1.3/mod_dav 1.0.2, 
Greenbytes SAP Portals Enterprise Portal WebDAV Interface) all work 
correctly with no properties.

So in the name of interoperability, I'll be asking for the resourcetype 
property like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<D:propfind xmlns:D="DAV:">
<D:prop>
<D:resourcetype/>
</D:prop>
</D:propfind>
