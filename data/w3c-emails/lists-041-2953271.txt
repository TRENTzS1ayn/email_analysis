Hi all,

I have been off doing other things for a while, just trying to catch
up with a big backlog of WebDAV mail.

In ignorance of SLP, is UDDI an option? I am not a UDDI expert, but
my understanding is that it allows businesses to publicise services
(including the protocol). For example, GILS is trying to use it to
publicize the location of GILS (which uses the Z39.50 protocol) servers.
It seems to have a bit of momentum in the commercial world with its
relationship to SOAP.
