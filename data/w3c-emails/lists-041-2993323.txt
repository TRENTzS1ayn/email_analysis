This may not be directly applicable to most regulars of this list, but it's
an interesting potential use of WebDAV.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: Applying WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and
                          Versioning)to Network Configuration Management
                          Problems

Filename: draft-presuhn-nmwebdav-00.txt
Pages: 12
Date: 31-May-02

This memo examines the potential of using WWW Distributed Authoring
and Versioning (WebDAV) technologies to address the problems of
network configuration management.  It reviews requirements and issues
that have been identified in IETF network configuration management
and operator requirements discussions, matching these requirements
and issues with various WebDAV facilities.  It concludes by
identifying areas for further exploration.
Comments are welcomed, both from the Operations and Management Area
in general, and from participants in the webdav and deltav working
groups in particular.  Please send comments to the author at

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
