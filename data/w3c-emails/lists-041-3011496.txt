Zesati is a web-native product lifecycle management application that is used
by engineering/manufacturing companies. We are implementing webDAV and
require help in implementing webDAV on a J2EE server. Please contact Krishna
Gorrepati at 248-396-8821 or email at kris@zesati.com for more information.

Cheers
