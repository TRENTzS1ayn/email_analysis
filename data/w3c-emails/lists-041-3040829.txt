It's important to understand that DASL consists of

a) a framework for the HTTP SEARCH method, enabling different kinds of query
grammars, and

b) one specific (and mandatory) query grammar, specialized in searching on
WebDAV properties (it has a single function for content matching, but this
is optional).

Definitively.

Well, that's up to you. Even if a DAV:basicsearch query affects both dead
(stored) and live (computed) properties, it may be able to come up with a
better query strategy that does not require a tree walk. See for instance
Elias' paper at [1].
