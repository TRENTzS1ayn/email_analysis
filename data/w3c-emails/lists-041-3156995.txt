Hi,

another bug report regarding Microsoft's webfolder client (posted here so
that it's archived in the mailing list archives):

When creating files on a WebDAV server, the clients submits a
"Content-Language" header with the PUT request (on my machine: always
"en-us"), even though the content language isn't known (and obviously may be
different). This can trick a WebDAV server to persist this information (and
to return it as DAV:getcontentlanguage property).

Is anybody aware of a fix or workaround for this problem (other than
ignoring the content language header for specific user agents)?

Julian
