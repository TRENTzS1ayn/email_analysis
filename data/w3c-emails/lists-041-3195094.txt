Back in May 2000, there was a discussion at 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2000AprJun/0005.html> 
of how extend was defined in the DAV header definition:

DAV = "DAV" ":" "1" ["," "2"] ["," 1#extend]

The consensus of that thread seemed to be that extend should be defined:

extend = Coded-URL | token

However, the issue is still listed as an open issue.

Why did I bring this up? Because I finally found an Apache 2.0 server I 
could test against to determine why our WebDAV client gave read-only 
access to those servers. The problem was caused by a combination of the 
Coded-URL in the DAV Header from the Apache 2 server and a bug in our 
code that handles DAV headers. To fix this problem, I need to handle the 
DAV header correctly. To handle it correctly, I need extend to be 
defined.

At this point, I guess I'll write my code to handle extend as defined 
above. However, it would be nice if this issue could be closed so that I 
don't have to worry about someone else throwing something new into the 
DAV header in the future that my code can't handle.
