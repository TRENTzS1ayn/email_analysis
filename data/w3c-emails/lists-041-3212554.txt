Have you investigated whether Web Folders submits a Content-Language header
with a different value if the user's system language is not "en-us"?  It may
be that the user's system language is the closed Web Folders can get to
knowing the language of the file.

If that is the case, then I would think it would be wrong of the WebDAV
server to ignore the value.
