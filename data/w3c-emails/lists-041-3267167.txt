I agree with Julian (i.e. that trailing slashes are allowed by
the syntax), but I also have argued vigorously that the RFC-2518
"guidance" is incorrect, and the next revision of RFC-2518 should
simply state "a URI with a trailing slash SHOULD identify the
same resource as the URI with the trailing slash removed".

Cheers,
Geoff

However:

segment       = *pchar *( ";" param )
param         = *pchar

pchar         = unreserved | escaped |
                ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

([1]) and

"The second convention is a BNF-like grammar, used to define the formal URI
syntax. The grammar is that of [RFC822], except that "|" is used to
designate alternatives. Briefly, rules are separated from definitions by an
equal "=", indentation is used to continue a rule definition over more than
one line, literals are quoted with "", parentheses "(" and ")" are used to
group elements, optional elements are enclosed in "[" and "]" brackets, and
elements may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
following element; n defaults to 0."

([2]). So it seems that "segment" may be empty.
