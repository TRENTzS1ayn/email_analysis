Thanks for the clarification, Julian.

I'd argue that it must state "a URI with a trailing slash MUST identify 
the same resource as the URI with the trailing slash removed". Using 
SHOULD would leave it up to the server to do whatever, and would make 
the rules for a PROFIND Request-Line different than the rules in RFC 
2616 for Request-Line. (In general, I dislike seeing SHOULD and MAY in 
specifications when the subject of particular rule isn't optional.)
