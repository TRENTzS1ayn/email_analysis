But do you also want this to be the case for non-collection resources?  
Perhaps you mean "if a URI that ends in a trailing slash identifies a 
DAV-compliant collection resource, then the same URI with the trailing 
slash removed SHOULD identify the same resource."  I would actually go 
for MUST in that case, although such a change would break some existing 
servers.
