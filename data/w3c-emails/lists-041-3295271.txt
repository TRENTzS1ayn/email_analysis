Yes, I would want the statement to hold, independent of what kind of
resource (if any) is currently identified by that URI.  I also would
prefer a MUST over a SHOULD.

Cheers,

But do you also want this to be the case for non-collection resources?  
Perhaps you mean "if a URI that ends in a trailing slash identifies a 
DAV-compliant collection resource, then the same URI with the trailing 
slash removed SHOULD identify the same resource."  I would actually go 
for MUST in that case, although such a change would break some existing 
servers.
