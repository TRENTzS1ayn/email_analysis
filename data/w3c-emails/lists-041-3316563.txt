I think the current approach in RFC 2518 works just fine, e.g.
to indicate in the Content-Location that this entity is really
located somewhere else.

It worked until Apache 2.0 and I do not see any benefit
in the new 301 for PROPFIND behaviour. Lack of deep insight
on my part most likely.

But even if /a and /a/ is the same from WebDAV point of view,
there are a lot of common use cases where GET on /a/b will
return 301/302 to /a/b/ no matter what WebDAV has to say about it.
The good old index.html trick...
