This topic is also discussed in RFC 2518, in Section 17.7 (Implications of
XML External Entities).

In RFC 2518, we didn't go so far as to outlaw external entities, since (a)
it didn't seem that likely they would ever get shipped across the wire, and
(b) they might be useful for extensibility. But, after several years of
implementation, I don't know of any uses of XML external entities, so I'd be
fine with prohibiting them.
