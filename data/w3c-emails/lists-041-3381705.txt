Indeed. Missed that part :-)

It think we should clarify. Right now, existing servers seem to either
ignore the external entitiy (mod_dav) or report an error (IIS). I think the
former is wrong because it means that part of the request wasn't parsed, so
the request shouldn't be executed. For the sake of clarity, I think it would
be a good thing to recommend that servers should fail the request.
