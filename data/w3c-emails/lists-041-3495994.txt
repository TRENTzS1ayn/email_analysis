I think it is a good idea to delay this change. The whole terminology needs
to be checked carefully if we update the draft to refer to RFC2396 rather
than RFC2068 (because the *meaning* of the term "URI" changed between the
two RFCs!).

Some more comments inline.

When 5.4 refers to source URIs, it needs to continue to do so. Source
resources may not be HTTP resources at all.

8.1:

"Each response XML element MUST contain an href XML element that gives the
URI of the resource on which the properties in the prop XML element are
defined"

needs to be fixed in that the DAV:href element must be defined to be a "URI
reference to be resolved relative to the request URI" (1). If we require a
URI (or URL), we wouldn't be allowed to return absolute URI references such
as "/collection/resource" (this isn't syntactically a URL or URI).

8.10.3: don't agree - resources may have alternate URIs which do not happen
to be URLs.

I think that's a section that we may have to remove anyway (issue:
INTEROPERABILITY_OF_102PROCESSING_STATUS_DEMONSTRATED).

Actually, this needs to be fixed. The definition should refer to RFC2396,
and use the term "URI reference".

As mentioned before, properties do not have URIs (at least there's no
one-to-one mapping unless we define it ourselves). The entire paragraph in
section 16 needs to be removed or rewritten.

Again -- needs to be fixed.
