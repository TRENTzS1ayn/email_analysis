A new version of the 2518bis is available. I'll submit it to the 
Internet-Drafts people shortly (to make the drafts cutoff).  There 
is a Word doc version as well as the txt version -- the Word doc 
version should have revision marks available.  Alternatively, you 
can take a look at the "RFC2518 Changes.doc" link to see a list of 
every change I've made and which of Jason's issues it's related to.
