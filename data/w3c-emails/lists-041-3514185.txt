As an addendum to this: there is work in progress on a new
version of RFC 2396, which should also include clarifications
about the usage of terms URI, URL and URN - among other things.

I think Larry Masinter has taken the lead on this activity and
I would consider it prudent to align the wording of a future
2518 with his findings. Maybe Larry can give us a hint at his
schedule?
