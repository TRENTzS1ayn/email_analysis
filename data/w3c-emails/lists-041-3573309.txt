The current wording is difficult to understand. I'd suggest that the wording
be changed from...

The timeout counter SHOULD NOT be restarted any time an owner of the lock
sends a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported methods, or
methods which are unsuccessful. However the lock MUST be refreshed if a
refresh LOCK method is successfully received.

To simply say...

The timeout counter SHOULD only be restarted if a refresh LOCK method is
successfully received.

If you like, we can mention that this is a change from 2518.
