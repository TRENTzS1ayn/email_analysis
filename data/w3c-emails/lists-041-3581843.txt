I'm not so sure about the wording you suggest. It drops the requirement that
the lock MUST be refreshed if a refresh LOCk method is successful.  How
about this:

 

"The timeout counter MUST be restarted if a refresh LOCK request is
successful.  The timeout counter SHOULD NOT be restarted at any other time."

The current wording is difficult to understand. I'd suggest that the wording
be changed from...

The timeout counter SHOULD NOT be restarted any time an owner of the lock
sends a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported methods, or
methods which are unsuccessful. However the lock MUST be refreshed if a
refresh LOCK method is successfully received.

To simply say...

The timeout counter SHOULD only be restarted if a refresh LOCK method is
successfully received.

If you like, we can mention that this is a change from 2518.
