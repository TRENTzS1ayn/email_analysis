This is the standard wording throughout 2518, cut-and-pasted into the
new status paragraph.  Do you think the wording should change
throughout?  I think it's sufficiently clear although not optimally
clear.

I think there is a word missing in the new text. I suspect it's "parent"
although that by itself doesn't quite fit either.

409 (Conflict) - A resource cannot be created at the destination until
one or more intermediate [parent] collections have been created.
