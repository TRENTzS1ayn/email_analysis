I like Lisa's latest proposal.

I have two concern, based on no experience but just reading the text:

1. is it clear that REFRESH on any resource controlled by the lock (not 
just the URI in the original request) refreshes the counter?

2. is it clear that server policy is allowed to refresh the lock for its 
own reasons?

Perhaps the following wording is true to the original but slightly 
clearer on these points?

The timeout counter MUST be restarted if a refresh LOCK request is 
successfully executed on any resource controlled by the lock.  The 
timeout counter SHOULD NOT be restarted as a consequence of any other 
client request.
