OK, so it looks like we may need some language explaining that due to
the definition of xml:lang, it can't appear more than once in the same
scope.  That's a good simplification.

I still think it's wise to say where the xml:lang attribute must appear
in order for the server to know that it must be stored along with the
property.  I don't think it's enough to say that any xml:lang whose
scope includes the property value counts.  Some XML parsers could put
"xml:lang" on the root element of the document by default, even when
that language value is actually inappropriate to the language value of
certain properties.  I do not believe the server should store that value
in that case.

I don't buy that argument.

The XML spec clearly states what the scope of xml:lang is (the
containing
element and all descendants). If WebDAV wants to override this rule,
there
should be a better rational than "it's too much work implementing what
the
XML spec says".

Regarding your questions:

> Please explain why it is important to be flexible in this case

I think it is important that XML-based specifications do not override
XML's
rules without good reason. In this case, I haven't seen one yet.

>  Also, if the lang attribute must be legal in more than one location,
explain if there is any semantic difference between the multiple
locations.

For each DAV:prop element, there's only one xml:lang declaration in
scope.
It is completely irrelevant to which attribute it is attached.

> Also, explain what happens if the lang attribute is present in
multiple
locations scoped to the same property, particularly if it has different
values in different locations!

Can't happen with the given scoping rules.

> If some servers will be slightly incompatible with RFC2518bis because
of
making the location specific, I understand that's undesirable. However,
I
think in the long run it will make interoperability more likely for this
feature, and the benefits will outweigh the costs.

I think this argument works both directions. The only problem with the
current spec is that it's silent on the issue, *possibly* causing
interop
problems for people not reading the XML spec properly. The non-intrusive
fix
to this is to clarify how the scoping rules defined in the XML spec
apply to
property values, NOT to change those.

A specific location for the lang attribute is good.  It is more tightly
constrained, which makes it easier for both clients and servers to
handle
XML with property values.

Please explain why it is important to be flexible in this case. Also, if
the
lang attribute must be legal in more than one location, explain if there
is
any semantic difference between the multiple locations.  Also, explain
what
happens if the lang attribute is present in multiple locations scoped to
the
same property, particularly if it has different values in different
locations!

If some servers will be slightly incompatible with RFC2518bis because of
making the location specific, I understand that's undesirable. However,
I
think in the long run it will make interoperability more likely for this
feature, and the benefits will outweigh the costs.

I agree with Geoff and Julian that the 2518bis wording is not right
because
it specifies a specific location for that attribute.

I also acknowledge that it's not easy to come up with a wording for this
behavior. Sorry Lisa :-)
