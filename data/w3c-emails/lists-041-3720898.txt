Well, the *attribute* xml:lang can appear more than once, but each and every
*element* is always only in the scope of one specific xml:lang attribute.

XML: "The intent declared with xml:lang is considered to apply to all
attributes and content of the element where it is specified, unless
overridden with an instance of xml:lang on another element within that
content." In XPath-spec: the closest xml:lang attribute on
"ancestor-or-self".

It must be stored when it's present. So if xml:lang is in scope (no matter
where), it needs to be stored with the property. I agree that RFC2518 should
be clearer about this.

No compliant XML parser will place an xml:lang anywhere unless explicitly
asked to do that. Reporting xml:lang on the root element when it wasn't
present in the parsed document clearly would be a parser bug.

If it's inappropriate where it was sent, then it shouldn't have been sent.
If it hasn't been sent and is reported by the XML parser nevertheless,
that's a bug in the parser.
