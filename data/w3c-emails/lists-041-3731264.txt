Agreed :-)

It's not central to the point of your posting as a whole, but I'll comment
on
this part.   I think you're suggesting that the source property could point
at
the resource itself.  I agree in prinical this can be done, but it does
create
another issue that we would then want to clarify.

Is the source property telling you where you can GET the source... or where
you
can PUT it.  Obviously if you do a GET on the dynamic resource itself, you
will
not get the source of the implementation.  Given your comment, we should
probably
be clear about that.

Okay.  And what is the mechanism for the server to do the "suggesting"?  (I
assume it's a mechanism that distinguishs between redirects that require
user confirmation and those that don't.)

Obviously if it didn't require it this might be yet another advantage to a
design.   Anyway... I understand that you're saying it's not important
in your opinion.

I'll take it to mean that just supporting 2 & 3 (& possibly 4) is fine with
you.
