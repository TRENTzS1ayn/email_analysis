1) Replace

"...encoded, at minimum, using the UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoding of the ISO 10646
multilingual plane."

by

"...encoded, at minimum, using any mandatory encoding for which the XML
specification requires support."

Note: this inclused UTF-16.

2) Replace

"...as well as the XML "encoding" attribute..:"

by

"...as well as XML declarations..."

3) Replace

" XML uses either IANA registered language tags (see [RFC1766]) or ISO 639
language tags [ISO-639] in the "xml:lang" attribute of an XML element to
identify the language of its content and attributes."

by a reference to the appropriate section of the XML spec (no need to repeat
the information here, especially not if it's not precise :-).

4) Replace

"Similarly, though the names of XML elements used in this specification are
English names encoded in UTF-8, these names are not visible to the user, and
hence do not need to support multiple character set encodings. "

by

"XML names used in this specification are always marshalled inside XML
request/responses, and thus benefit from XML's encoding support.

5) Replace

"The name of a property defined on a resource is a URI. Although some
applications (e.g., a generic property viewer) will display property URIs
directly to their users, it is expected that the typical application will
use a fixed set of properties, and will provide a mapping from the property
name URI to a human-readable field when displaying the property name to a
user. It is only in the case where the set of properties is not known ahead
of time that an application need display a property name URI to a user. We
recommend that applications provide human-readable property names wherever
feasible."

by
"WebDAV properties are identified by qualified XML names (pairs of
namespace name and local name). Although some applications (e.g., a generic
property viewer) will display the property's qualified names directly to
their users, it is expected that the typical application will use a fixed
set of properties, and will provide a mapping from the qualified name to a
human-readable field when displaying the property name to a user. It is only
in the case where the set of properties is not known ahead of time that an
application need display a property name to a user. We recommend that
applications provide human-readable property names wherever feasible."
