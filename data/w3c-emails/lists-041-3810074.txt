Hi all,

I'm currently looking in to using some webdav solution to let our users
access thier home catalogues on our system. Basically Solaris 8 on ufs
disks with user data in yp. Nowing that file sharing via samba and
webdav is a bad thing I still would like to give it a try.

My questions are:
Is this possible? If not will it ever be?
Which webserver have this capability? If I run on Apache I will have to
run it as root and even then I doubt he will access the files as the
logged in user...
