Subject: [Moderator Action] implementation of WebDAV with Web Folders


Hello All,

I am developing Document Management System. For that, I want to give users
client acces to web folders on Microsoft Platform. We are using ColdFusion
for scriptiong and Windows development environment.

Can anybody tell me, from where I can get good referances and guidelines. I
surfed the WebDAV site, but i find it very confusing and hard to abstract
data from it.

I want to give acces to web folders on base of access controls of authorised
users.

Thanking You
Maulik
