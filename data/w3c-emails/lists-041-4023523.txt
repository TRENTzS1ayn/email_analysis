I'd like to mark the UNLOCK_BY_NON_LOCK_OWNERS issues item as resolved.  As
far as I can tell, we have consensus, although not unanimous.  You can pick
up the discussions at the following URLs and search forward and backwards
from these.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001JulSep/0157.html
(the start of discussion)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001JulSep/0214.html
(the compromise proposal)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001JulSep/0215.html
(the only dissenting opinion)

Has anyone changed their position?  Any further comments?

J.
