All,
   Dan and Lisa have suggested that we need to more clearly define either
the use of the lockowner field or that we need a way to identify the owner
of the lock.

Just as a point of information, I'd like to point out we have an issue on
the issues
list that is somewhat related: DEFINE_PRINCIPAL.
In that issue Mark D Anderson says:

  The term "principal" is never defined in the WebDAV
   specification, or the HTTP or Digest specifications.
   It should be defined.


Lisa and Dan,
  Could you define the requirement before we start the discussion?  For
example, is it for the server or the client that we need to make the
clarification below?  (I'll reference your clarfication from the issues
list.)

J.
