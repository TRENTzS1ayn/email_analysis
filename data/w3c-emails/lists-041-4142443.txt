A single MOVE, DELETE, or PROPPATCH request is idempotent
(repeating the same request multiple times produces the
same result as just doing it once).
A sequence of DELETE's is always idempotent.  A sequence of PROPPATCH's
is always idempotent if the same property isn't updated by different
PROPPATCH requests in that sequence.  A sequence of MOVE's is always
idempotent if none of the Destination URLs overlap with any of the
request URL's.

Cheers,
Geoff

Looking at RFC2616:

"8.1.2.2 Pipelining
Clients SHOULD NOT pipeline requests using non-idempotent methods or
non-idempotent sequences of methods
(see section 9.1.2). 

So it seems that pipelining wouldn't be allowed for anything except PROPFIND
(MOVE/DELETE/PROPPATCH aren't idempotent), right?
