Subject: [Moderator Action] How do I make my app DAV-aware?


Hi!

I'm a newbie to WebDAV and have just recently started
looking at some WebDAV resources.

I have an application that prompts the user for the
filename and location to where he/she wants to save
the
data file that my app creates.  This prompt is just
the
common save dialog and works well if the data file is
being saved to the local drive of the user's PC.  But,
when the location is on webfolder, I get the following
message

  "You cannot save in the folder you specified.
Please choose another location."

I've tried creating a dummy text file with both MS
WordPad and
Notepad (on a PC using Win2K), and tried to save (via
the common
save dialog) to the webfolder.  Both cases give the
above message.

But, when I tried to do the same test using Microsoft
Word 2000, the
save operation works.

Also, I tried another test with Webdrive
(www.webdrive.com) and mapped a
drive letter to the webfolder, used that drive letter
and filename
in my app, and that worked.

So, my question is, how do I make my app work like
Microsoft Word in
it's use of the common save dialog?  Or do I have to
write a network
redirector (which I have no idea how to do yet) to
mimic what the
Webdrive software is doing?

I just want to allow my app to support the user's
action of
browsing to the webfolder (in the common save dialog
of my app) and
clicking on the Save button.

Any info would greatly be appreciated!

Thanks!

-Michael
