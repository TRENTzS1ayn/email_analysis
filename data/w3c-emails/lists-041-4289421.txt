Yes, you would have to write a network redirector, which might involve
modifying the application, or install WEbDrive.  I don't believe Microsoft
makes its Web Folders API available for common use, but you might look into
that as well.

The reason Word works but Notepad doesn't, is because Word has special code
to use Web Folders (part of Network Places in some Windows OS) and Notepad
doesn't have that special code.

In other words, Web Folders can't be used by just any application
automatically -- special code has to be added.
