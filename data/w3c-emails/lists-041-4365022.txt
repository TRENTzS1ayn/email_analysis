I do not fully understand. There is always a principal for a request
(and be it {DAV:}anonymous), so it would be easy for a server to keep
this information with an active lock.

When there is a ACL privilege {DAV:}can-unlock and this is granted
to a particular principal on the locked resource, the usualy ACL
matching of principals would apply.

So, I do not see the problem with reporting a locking-principal
as part of an active lock. What am I missing? Servers without ACL?
