Do you want to handle the Webdav calls by a script or an ISAPI extension?
I think the ASP-dll won't let you do this - maybe perl or php via cgi or isapi...

but what you can do is:
build an ISAPI-filter manipulating the requested file by adding a new extension - saying ".dav" and than let IIS handel all incomming calls by a second ISAPI extension that does your job.
This works fine throughout IIS3+.
