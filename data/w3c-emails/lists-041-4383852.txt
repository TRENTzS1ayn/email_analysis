I can see how this draft is applied to servers like Sharemation
which have a separate collection hierarchy for each user. 

I have more trouble applying it to servers where it is common 
that more than one user has write access to collections. Imagine
that Sharemation has a collection containing all your user
collections. How would the quota properties appear on that
collection?

Where I see a real problem is a server supporting bindings.
Suppose I have the following hierarchy:

  - A
  |-B
  | |- b'
  |
  |-C
    |- b"

where b' and b" are bindings to the resource b. How will a server
show the quota properties on B, C and A? Will space-used-bytes
count b' and b" for B and C and will the space appear duplicate in
A?
