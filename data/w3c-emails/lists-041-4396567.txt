   I do not fully understand. There is always a principal for a request
   (and be it {DAV:}anonymous), so it would be easy for a server to keep
   this information with an active lock.

No, there are credentials for a request, but those credentials
can match a variety of principals in a variety of different
principal spaces relevant to the ACL on a resource.

   When there is a ACL privilege {DAV:}can-unlock and this is granted
   to a particular principal on the locked resource, the usualy ACL
   matching of principals would apply.

It is not matching of principals that takes place, but rather the
matching of the client credentials against the principals identified
in the ACE of an ACL.

   So, I do not see the problem with reporting a locking-principal
   as part of an active lock. What am I missing? Servers without ACL?

I think the only thing being missed is that a client has credentials,
and that these credentials match a variety of principals, as opposed
to identifying the client as *being* a particular principal.

Cheers,
Geoff
