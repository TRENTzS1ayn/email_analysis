...scanning acl spec...done.
I see what you mean. There could be an ACL server which just has
"group" principals and no principals with one-one relation to users
(well it could even skip user credentials and just have credentials
matching groups).

As for identifying the owner of a lock this means one of the following:
a) the server has a "primary" principal and could report it as lock owner.
   It may nevertheless choose not to do so, due to confidentiality reasons.
b) the server has no such thing and thus cannot report who owns a lock.
   It only can tell if your credentials are sufficient to lock/unlock
   a resource.

That leaves possible lock-owner information up to the client. Either it
provides something meaningful to others (e.g. mailto:) or it is silent.
Would that be a feasible way forward?
