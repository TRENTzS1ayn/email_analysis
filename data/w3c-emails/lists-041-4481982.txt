If a client does an UNLOCK, it would be good for it to know
the set of resources that will be affected by the UNLOCK (especially
if it is an adminstrative override of a lock held by some other
principal).  This would provide that information.

Cheers,
Geoff

I don't want to distract the discussion, but why is this necessary?  Do we
have a specific reason?
