In addition to Geoff's answer:

If you are an administrator trying to unlock a resource obtained by 
someone else, you have to be able to figure out which resource to 
unlock.  You can't unlock an internal member of a collection that's 
locked by a depth-inifinity lock without knowing which collection was 
actually locked.  Then you can decide whether unlocking that is the 
right thing to do.
