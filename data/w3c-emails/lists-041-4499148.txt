But (b) misses the point of my requirement, which is that a client 
needs to be able to issue a request that says "am I the <credentialed 
id> that obtained this lock"?  The client is *not* asking an ACL 
question: can I unlock this resource; the client is asking a workflow 
question: would I be unlocking someone else's lock if I did unlock 
the resource?  It's the workflow question that's at the heart of the 
requirement.

So, Geoff, given ACL's (desirable) vagueness about "principals", and 
building on your language about "request credentials", can we alter 
the DAV spec language so that servers can return info about "is this 
request authorized with the same credentials as the lock request" and 
still be compatible with ACL?

     dan

P.S. Another way of looking at this is to say: the ACL info provides 
a way of distinguishing between principals (i.e., they have different 
capabilities), but that way of distinguishing is not required to be 
fine-grained enough to support what I claim is the "workflow 
intuition" behind DAV locking: locks are held by a particular 
<workflow user identity> and are only allowed to be used (in the 
absence of ACL or other server admin magic) by that <workflow user 
identity> regardless of token.  My requirement is that users be able 
to determine whether they are currently authenticating requests as 
the same <workflow user identity> as the request that locked the 
resource was. -d.
