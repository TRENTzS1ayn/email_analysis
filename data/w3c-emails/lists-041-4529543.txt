Not even that liberal: the client should only *remove* another client's lock
on explicit request by the user.  The client should never reuse another
client's lock.  Ever.  (The ambiguity may just be in the word steal - I'm
not sure what you intend here Geoff)

No, this info is not necessarily available in the DAV:owner field.  Because
the client can submit this field, the client can submit bogus information,
and it's not necessarily possible for the server to decide if the
information is bogus.

It's not necessarily an issue of privilege, it may be an issue of system
policy.  I'm not sure if using can-lock and can-unlock privileges addresses
that.
