I opened an incident with Microsoft last fall around mapping a drive with XP
using the mini-redirector.  We were encountering issue #1 where we could not
authenticate to the WebDAV server.  A workaround for the issue was to choose an
alternate user to log on as vs. the current user when mapping the drive.  This
appears to also affect using UNC pathing for the redirector.

Hi,

I've been trying to get the WebDAV "redirector" (UA
WebDAV-MiniRedir/5.1.2600) in Windows XP to mount our WebDAV server. I've
found three issues for which I have workarounds, however, I'm still not able
to mount from my server.

Problem #1: basic authentication seems to be broken if the redirector
*prompts* for the credentials. If you supply them on the command line:

     "net use * URI password /user:username"

it seems to work.

Problem #2: given a URI like "http://server/a/b/c", the client tries OPTIONS
and PROPFIND on "http://server/a" (which is wrong because this resource may
not be WebDAV enabled). A similar (known!) problem exists in IE's "open as
web folder", while mounting a web folder using network places behaves
correctly.

Problem #3: the URI may not contain a port number (even if it's 80!)

All these problems lead to error message 67 ("network name not found") with
absolutely no useful additional information.


After working around these issues, I can get the redirector to issue a
PROPFIND (Depth: 0) against by target URI (with correct Basic Authentication
credentials), and my server is responding with 207 (MULTISTATUS) and a
response body which seems to be just fine (and is accepted by the webfolder
client). However, I'm still getting error #67.

Did anybody else have a similar problem and knows what might be going wrong?

Julian
