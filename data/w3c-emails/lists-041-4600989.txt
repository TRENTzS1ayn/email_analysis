Developing a standard format for the DAV:owner field would
be fine with me.  This addresses the client/client interoperability
problem without introducing the overhead and security hole
that capturing and displaying a "principal" introduces.
The ability to submit "bogus" information is a security feature,
not a bug.

Cheers,
Geoff

Furthermore, there is no standard format for this information, but this
would be needed for a interoperability.
