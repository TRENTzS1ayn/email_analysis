   *How* would a client present this information if the contents of
   DAV.owner is not specified at all?

The same way it presents DAV:displayname and DAV:comment information:
copying out the value of the field as a string, unless it recognizes
something about the string (e.g. some nested XML or HTML), in which
case it can massage the string first.  If we want to develop some standards
for the DAV:owner field format, that is fine with me.

Cheers,
Geoff
