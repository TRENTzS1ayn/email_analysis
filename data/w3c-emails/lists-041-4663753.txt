It probably makes sense to include both,
i.e. "better support for pipelining" and "transactions"
I personally am more optimistic that we can agree on
an interoperable way of improving pipelining than that we
can agree on an interoperable way of doing transactions.

Cheers,
Geoff

I would say "yes" if you phrase it in terms of general 
transactionality, not batch operations in particular.
