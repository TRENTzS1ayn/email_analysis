Yes, you can.

Problem is, there are no less then four different Microsoft WebDAV clients:

- web folders
- web folders as updated by the Sharepoint client software
- the libraries used by Office
- the XP redirector

All have different kinds of known bugs, and haven't been updated for a long
time (except obviously for the XP stuff).

The XP WebDAV redirector is not available from "network places", nor from
IE.

You'll have to use the command line tool "net", for instance:

net use * URI passwrd /user:username

Yes.


Hope this helps,
