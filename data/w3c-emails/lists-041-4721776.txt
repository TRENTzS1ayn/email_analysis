Subject: [Moderator Action] Help on Dav Explorer


Hello,
I'm learning WebDav, I downloaded dav explorer and everything went fine, I'm
using my IIS as WebDav server (on my local machine).
I connect to the server (localhost).
But when I try to create a collection (file=>create collection) i get a
message: 403 forbidden.
Somebody can help.
Many thanks in advance.
