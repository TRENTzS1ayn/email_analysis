And of course:
The value specified in the DAV:lockowner field of a LOCK
request is available in the DAV:lockowner field in the DAV:lockdiscovery
property.

Cheers,
Geoff

I would describe our conclusion as:

We need to define a new field, say DAV:lockowner, that is specified
in a LOCK request, and that takes an XML value.  We will define
some standard elements for that value.

We should then deprecate the use of the DAV:owner field, as a field
that contains non-interoperable data about the lock owner.

Cheers,
Geoff

It sounds like we've concluded that we can't reuse the lockowner field
because we've already specified that it's free text.

Do we still have the requirement mentioned at...

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2001JulSep/0218.html
says...

regarding identifying the owner of a lock?  If so, now that we've had some
discussion on this topic, can someone provide an improved definition of the
requirement?    And a proposal?  Dan?  Lisa? Geoff?  Julian?
