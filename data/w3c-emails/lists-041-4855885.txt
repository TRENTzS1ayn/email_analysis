Hmm, to quote section 8.3.1 of http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt:
"A MKCOL request message may contain a message body.  The behavior of
a MKCOL request when the body is present is limited to creating
collections, members of a collection, bodies of members and
properties on the collections or members.  If the server receives a
MKCOL request entity type it does not support or understand it MUST
respond with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code.  The exact
behavior of MKCOL for various request media types is undefined in
this document, and will be specified in separate documents."
