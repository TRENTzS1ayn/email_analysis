What I would find most useful would be a lock owner field with a value
defined by the server.  Since the server is likely to have authenticated the
user, they presumably know how to identify the user.  Existing support for
the ACLs spec would mean that a Principal URL could be available.  Allowing
the server to set this value means that the information is more reliable.
