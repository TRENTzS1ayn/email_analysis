The ACL spec does not associate a principal URL with an authenticated
user, and therefore a principal URL is not in general available.  The ACL
spec
only assumes that the server can "match" a users credentials against
the principals identified in the ACL of a resource, but it does not assume
that the server can pick one of these principals as "being" the user
(several can match).

In addition, it is a security hole to require a server to provide more
identification about a user than that user's client wishes to provide.

Because of these reasons, I strongly object to the introduction of a
server defined principal field.

Cheers,
Geoff

What I would find most useful would be a lock owner field with a value
defined by the server.  Since the server is likely to have authenticated the
user, they presumably know how to identify the user.  Existing support for
the ACLs spec would mean that a Principal URL could be available.  Allowing
the server to set this value means that the information is more reliable.
