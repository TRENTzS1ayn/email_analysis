Subject: [Moderator Action] WebDav question


Can You Help me with this.



When attempting to use WebDav we have to include the port number in the
URL.
http://customer1.magnifi.com:7011/webfolder
<http://customer1.magnifi.com:7011/webfolder>

It will not work with   http://customer1.magnifi.com/webfolder
<http://customer1.magnifi.com/webfolder>

Apache is listening on port 80 and passing requests to Weblogic
Application
Server.

WLS is listening on port 7017

The problem is that when we create a WebDav folder on the PC desktop
the URL
needs to include the WLS port number and thus exposes WLS to the
outside
world.

We ! ! ! only expose port 80 to the outside world and therefore our users
will not
be able to use the WebDav feature

Thanks.
