Hi,

the Webdav Access Control Protocol standard says under "4 Principal
Properties":

Additionally, a principal MUST report the DAV:principal empty XML element in
the value of the DAV:resourcetype property in addition to all other reported
elements. For example, a collection principal would report DAV:collection
and DAV:principal elements.

Do I understand it right, that a resource can have more as one
DAV:resourcetype?

regards

Eckehard
