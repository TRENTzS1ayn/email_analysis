I would have said our conclusion was:

We need to define a new XML-valued field, say DAV:lockowner, that is 
owned by the server and returned as part of lockdiscovery.  We will 
define some standard elements for that value which the server can use 
to reveal as much or as little as it wants about:

- the principal owning the lock (e.g., a "login name")
- the relationship between the owning principal and the requesting 
principal (e.g., requestor is/is not the owner)
- the capabilities of the requestor with respect to the lock (e.g., 
requestor has/has not the same capabilities as the owner; requestor 
has/has not the ability to use or unlock the lock).

I would have said:

We then need to explicitly reserve the use of the DAV:owner field to 
be for clients to use at lock request time (in order to provide for 
client-to-client conventional communication).  We need to forbid 
servers from rewriting the client-specified value (other than 
clarifying that the DAV:owner field is XML-valued, and thus subject 
to parsing/regeneration by the server).

We then need to resolve the issue about whether the client can 
rewrite the lock:owner field as part of a lock refresh request.  (I 
believe this was an outstanding issue as to whether clients can 
change any aspect of a lock in a refresh request.)  I would recommend 
that clients be able to do this.
