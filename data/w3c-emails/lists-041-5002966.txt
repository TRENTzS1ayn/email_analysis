Daniel,

I think you need to go back again through the mails that were exchanged.

My summary:

a) We agree that server-supplied information (if at allI) should be handled
by ACL locking privileges. I think we also have an agreement that locking
privileges should become part of the ACL draft/spec.

b) The current DAV:owner element is something that the client sets and MUST
not be touched by the server. However, it's contents is undefined and thus
can't be used for interoperability *between* clients. Q: do we want to
deprecate it because of this?

c) Because of b), we need a new client-supplied lock owner information
element, in which it reveals whatever the user of the client software wants
to reveal using a *standard* format (so that one client can actually
*process* the information a different client has set). My initital proposal
for this format is:

<contact-URI-set xmlns="DAV:" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xml:lang="en">
  <contact-URI
xlink:href="mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de">EMail</contact-URI>
  <contact-URI xlink:href="tel:+492512807760">Work Phone</contact-URI>
</contact-URI-set>

DTD fragment:

<!ELEMENT contact-URI-set (contact-URI*)>
<!ELEMENT contact-URI #PCDATA>
<!-- contains human-displayable information qualifying the link -->
<!ATTLIST contact-URI
xlink:type      (simple)        #FIXED "simple"
  xlink:href      CDATA           #IMPLIED
  xlink:role      CDATA           #IMPLIED
  xlink:title     CDATA           #IMPLIED>
