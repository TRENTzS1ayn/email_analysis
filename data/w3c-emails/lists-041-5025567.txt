I agree with Julian's expanded summary.  In particular, although 
a "server generated lock principal property" has been proposed, this
proposal has had strong opposition (for security and ACL related reasons
that are detailed in this email thread),
while the additional client-defined owner
field with a standard format was acceptable to everyone (at least,
nobody objected, and several people support it).

Cheers,
Geoff

Daniel,

I think you need to go back again through the mails that were exchanged.

My summary:

a) We agree that server-supplied information (if at allI) should be handled
by ACL locking privileges. I think we also have an agreement that locking
privileges should become part of the ACL draft/spec.

b) The current DAV:owner element is something that the client sets and MUST
not be touched by the server. However, it's contents is undefined and thus
can't be used for interoperability *between* clients. Q: do we want to
deprecate it because of this?

c) Because of b), we need a new client-supplied lock owner information
element, in which it reveals whatever the user of the client software wants
to reveal using a *standard* format (so that one client can actually
*process* the information a different client has set). My initital proposal
for this format is:

<contact-URI-set xmlns="DAV:" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
xml:lang="en">
  <contact-URI
xlink:href="mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de">EMail</contact-URI>
  <contact-URI xlink:href="tel:+492512807760">Work Phone</contact-URI>
</contact-URI-set>

DTD fragment:

<!ELEMENT contact-URI-set (contact-URI*)>
<!ELEMENT contact-URI #PCDATA>
<!-- contains human-displayable information qualifying the link -->
<!ATTLIST contact-URI
xlink:type      (simple)        #FIXED "simple"
  xlink:href      CDATA           #IMPLIED
  xlink:role      CDATA           #IMPLIED
  xlink:title     CDATA           #IMPLIED>
