Yes.  A server must be able to check if the current user
"matches" a given principal URL, but this could be one of
many principal URL's (from the same or different domains)
that the current user matches, and
there is no interoperable way for the client to ask the server 
"what principal am I", and then try to match that principal
against the one stored with the lock.

Cheers,
Geoff

The ACL spec does not associate a principal URL with an authenticated

Geoff, could you explain what this sentence means?  Are you saying a server
can't necessarily map an authenticated user to a principal URL.  But it can
(and actually must be able to) check if a *given* principal URL includes a
given authenticated user?

Please elaborate.

J.
