Hi.

Currently, RFC2518 says in 12.12.1 [1]:

   <!ELEMENT keepalive (#PCDATA | href+) >

So individual properties are identified by "href" (which doesn't make sense
in the general case).

So (assuming that propertybehaviour/keepalive isn't dropped anyway), this
will need to be changed to:

   <!ELEMENT keepalive (#PCDATA | prop+) >

where DAV:prop contains property elements.
