...

So my position is pretty similar to Dan's: make it clear that DAV:owner is
owned by clients, and don't add any way for servers to insert lock owner
principal information.  I prefer any other extensions to DAV to be done
outside the base spec since they are clearly not needed for basic
interoperability and would delay Draft Standard.
