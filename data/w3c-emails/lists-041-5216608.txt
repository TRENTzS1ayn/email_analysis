> (b) Add it to a DAV extension.

Given the current grammar, have we left a route to do this?   Not as a
child of DAV:lockinfo I believe.  Perhaps as a child of DAV:owner?

I believe one of the things we were going to do was define what it meant
for the server to maintain DAV:owner.  At least one person thought there
was some ambiguity there.  Do we still feel that this is an issue?
