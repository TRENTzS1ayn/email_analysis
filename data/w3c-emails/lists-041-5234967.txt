My intuition is that the quoted paragraph addresses an 
interoperability "problem" that doesn't exist: client programs 
needing to contact people.  The actual interoperability problem faced 
by (at least) Adobe clients was for clients needing to contact 
clients, or more precisely: our clients use specific conventions 
about lock ownership that the spec doesn't provide for, and they need 
to keep this conventional information with the lock in a way that 
works against any server and can be discovered.

Our solution was to interpret this paragraph more along the lines of:

The owner XML element provides a way for clients to store 
owner-controlled conventional information with the lock that other 
clients can discover and make use of.

I would propose that we further clarify this with language along the lines of:

Since the possible client conventions around such information are 
beyond the scope of this specification, servers MUST NOT rewrite such 
information (i.e., the DAV:owner field must be treated as a dead 
property).  In addition, clients who make conventional use of the 
DAV:owner field SHOULD document these conventions for use by other 
clients.

My belief is that there are three real-life interoperability problems 
that are left unaddressed by this DAV:owner clarification and that 
would be worth adding a new element for:

1. a way for clients to specify a human-readable string that other 
clients should display in order to identify the lock owner.

2. a way for clients to specify contact addresses in known protocols 
(e.g., mailto:, http:) whereby human users can contact (or get 
information about) the lock owner (or lock purpose, etc.).

I would not be averse to adding a DAV:ownercontact field in this spec 
go-round to address this problem.  In general I'm in agreement with 
Julian that adding a new field to the lock discovery information 
would likely not be damaging to earlier clients.
