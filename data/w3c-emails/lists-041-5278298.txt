I've added this to my local copy of the issues list.  Anyone want to
comment on it?  Support?  Dissent?

Julian alluded to the possibility of keepalive going away.    FWIW... I
don't see anything like that listed on the issues list.

Hi.

Currently, RFC2518 says in 12.12.1 [1]:

   <!ELEMENT keepalive (#PCDATA | href+) >

So individual properties are identified by "href" (which doesn't make sense
in the general case).

So (assuming that propertybehaviour/keepalive isn't dropped anyway), this
will need to be changed to:

   <!ELEMENT keepalive (#PCDATA | prop+) >

where DAV:prop contains property elements.
