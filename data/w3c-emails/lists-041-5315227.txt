I do remember a discussion of keepalive going away
because it appears not to be implemented (and I 
certainly support it going away).  That is my preferred
solution to this issue.

In any case "REMOVING_KEEPALIVE" (or some other appropriate
name for it) should be on the issues list.

Cheers,
Geoff

I've added this to my local copy of the issues list.  Anyone want to
comment on it?  Support?  Dissent?

Julian alluded to the possibility of keepalive going away.    FWIW... I
don't see anything like that listed on the issues list.

Hi.

Currently, RFC2518 says in 12.12.1 [1]:

   <!ELEMENT keepalive (#PCDATA | href+) >

So individual properties are identified by "href" (which doesn't make sense
in the general case).

So (assuming that propertybehaviour/keepalive isn't dropped anyway), this
will need to be changed to:

   <!ELEMENT keepalive (#PCDATA | prop+) >

where DAV:prop contains property elements.
