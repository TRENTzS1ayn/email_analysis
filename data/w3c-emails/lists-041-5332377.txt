There is a much deeper issue with keepalive, and that is that no client at
the interop claimed to use the  feature.  Therefore interoperability has not
been, and cannot easily be, demonstrated.

Are there now clients out there that can demonstrate that keepalive works?
Or is it one of those ideas that just isn't useful enough to clients for
them to implement?

If its not useful enough for clients to implement, then it should be removed
from WebDAV so the protocol can go to the next phase of standardization.
