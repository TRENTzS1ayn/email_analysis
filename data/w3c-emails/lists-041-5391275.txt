We originally envisioned that there would be servers with multiple sets of
live properties active in different parts of its namespace, in which case it
was unclear how to handle the semantics of a COPY from one live property
space to another. Keepalive was designed to make these copies more
predictable from the client side.

But, these kinds of servers aren't prevalent, and it's not clear that
clients really want these semantics anyway. The lack of adoption speaks
volumes.

I'm in favor of dumping it -- a later extension could add it back in, if
desired.
