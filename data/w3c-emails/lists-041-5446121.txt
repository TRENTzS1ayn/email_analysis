Jason,

I think we should add: "if a decision is made not to change the namespace
name for DAV, the new spec should explain that a) defining a new URI scheme
and b) using the scheme name as namespace name were bad design decisions and
shouldn't be repeated".

(I mention this because I just found yet another example of this abuse, and
it seems to be inspired by WebDAV)

Julian
