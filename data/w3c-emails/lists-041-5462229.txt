2518 is at best ambiguous, and a worst, contradictory on this topic.

I would vote for (a) property not found.

(b) is a possible interpretation, but an empty value
violates the DTD for this property.
The comment about "mandatory properties" in section 7.4 is not
very useful, because "mandatory properties" is never defined in 2518.

(c) violates the requirement in 8.1 that missing
property errors be reported

(d) is just obviously wrong (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hey everyone...

The following posting about four months ago was not answered.   Do we have
an answer?   Is this a general problem for properties?  Let's hear what you
think...

BTW... I'd like to mention, but not necessarily recommend an option.  See
(d) below.

 d) Return a fixed but not correctly supported value.  For example, always
    respond with 1/1/1990.
