Well, there always is that question about whether <foo></foo>
is a node with no children, or a node with a single empty
string child.  Since section 2.4 of the xml spec says:
"All text that is not markup constitutes the character data of the
document",
and since I do not consider "nothing" to be "text", I go with the
interpretation that says <foo></foo> contains no character data,
and therefore does not match a #PCDATA declaration.

Cheers,
Geoff

Why would that be a violation?
