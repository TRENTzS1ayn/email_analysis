Yesterday we had internally the discussion about the mime-type of
a resource with length 0. I think we did not come to a good conclusion
and the whole mime-type handling is a mess anyway.

The only thing we could agree upon is that a client supplied mime-type
on PUT should be persistet (if possible) and override any name extension
guesswork.

Returning 409 sounds reasonable.
