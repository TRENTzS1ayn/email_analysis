Application/octet-stream is the generally accepted "don't know what else to
use" MIME type, the default MIME type.  At least if we specify it, behavior
will definitely be consistent.  What's the virtue of not specifying it?

I do agree that when a content-type is included in a PUT overwriting the
empty resource, that should become the new content-type.  However isn't that
always the case, whether the resource was previously empty or not?
