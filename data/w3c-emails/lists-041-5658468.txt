Can we specify answers for all questions below?

1. When a client creates a resource with 
"application/octet-stream", should
the server make a guess and replace octet-stream with another mime type?

2. When a client creates a resource without mime type, should
the server make a guess or report application/octet-stream?

3. When a server reports application/octet-stream, should a client take
a guess in order to open an application/show an icon?

4. When a server reports another mime type, is a client allowed to take
a guess anyway and disregard the server supplied mime type? How does
a client know that the mime type was not "guessed" by the server?

Yes. The question is more what content-type to report on an empty 
resource.
