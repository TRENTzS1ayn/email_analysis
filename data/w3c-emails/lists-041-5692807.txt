I'm not sure this is workable.  You're right that defaulting to
application/octet-stream doesn't help anybody, but it may hurt less.  When a
client creates a resource without a MIME type, then a client asks for the
resource using GET, the server must put some value in the Content-Type
header.  Since "getcontenttype" is defined as the type that would be
returned in the Content-Type header were the client to do a GET request, it
must have the same value.

This isn't a DAV problem only -- any Web server might have the same problem.
