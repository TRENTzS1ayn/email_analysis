No, it doesn't (as far as I can tell). RFC2616 says that the Content-Type
SHOULD be present, but then goes on saying what a recipient is allowed to do
when it's absent. So if you PUT without content type, cou can't *expect*
that the magically will invent one.

Right, that's why RFC2616 is relevant.
