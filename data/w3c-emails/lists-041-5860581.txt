A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring ? WebDAV 
                          RFC2518 bis
Author(s): Y. GOLAND et al.
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-rfc2518bis-00.txt
Pages: 87
Date: 20-Feb-02

WebDAV consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types 
ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, 
creation and management of resource collections, namespace 
manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance). 
RFC2518 was published in February 1998, and this draft makes only 
minor revisions mostly due to interoperability experience.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-rfc2518bis-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
