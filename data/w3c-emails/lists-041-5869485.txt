Hi all,

 the ACL Standard says under 3.7 that the DAV:write privileg MUST NOT
contain the DAV:read privileg. What sense does it make to give someone the
right for doing updates or delete a resource but not to allow to read the
resource? What is the reason that a DAV:write most not contain a DAV:read?

regards

Eckehard
