I thought (per RFCs 2396 and 2616) the "http" scheme just specifies a
mapping for each part of the URL from US-ASCII to a sequence of
octets, and the mapping from those octets back to characters (if any!)
is at the whim of the server.  %-escaped UTF-8 is *recommended* for
new schemes (and for HTML that embeds URLs containing invalid
non-ASCII characters), but a server that uses Latin-15 should be able
to send Latin-15 in PROPFIND responses without having a client
complain about or mangle perfectly workable URLs just because it can't
display them nicely.
