The only reason we had to do this is that we translate UTF8 into MacOS 
Roman on the backend. One of the requirements was for OS9 users to be 
able to interop with OSX and vica versa via the iDisk service.

In most cases, we use this hint "x-mac-japanese" to unambiguously 
translate UTF8 into Mac OS Roman. Further, for some reason OSX prefers 
fully decomposed UTF8 on the return trip. Based on a suggestion from 
Julian, I believe, we only provide this functionality to non OSX based 
User-Agents.
