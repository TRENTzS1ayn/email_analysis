I strongly feel that a revision of RFC 2518 should state that the "dav:"
property namespace is reserved for use by IETF-approved Standards-Track
specifications, and that client implementations MUST NOT use this namespace
for application-specific properties.

Pragmatically, I think existing exceptions to this rule should be
grandfathered.
