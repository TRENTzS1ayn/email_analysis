This definition is an attempt to provide some (minimal) common 
semantics to DAV:read and DAV:write.  Without this definition,
some servers would implement them as orthogonal privileges,
and others would (as you suggest) implement DAV:write as a
composite privilege that includes DAV:read.

There are some cases where
it is reasonable to give DAV:write but not DAV:read privilege to
a resource (e.g. a "closed-bid" resource that you can append to,
but not see what else has been written there).  If a resource is
both readable and writeable, then just return both DAV:read and
DAV:write as granted privileges.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi all,

 the ACL Standard says under 3.7 that the DAV:write privileg MUST NOT
contain the DAV:read privileg. What sense does it make to give someone the
right for doing updates or delete a resource but not to allow to read the
resource? What is the reason that a DAV:write most not contain a DAV:read?
