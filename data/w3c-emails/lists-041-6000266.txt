The paragraph referred to was in section 9.8:

   The timeout counter SHOULD be restarted any time an owner of the lock
   sends a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported
   methods, or methods which are unsuccessful.  However the lock MUST be
   refreshed if a refresh LOCK method is successfully received.

Unfortunately, I cannot remember the rationale for removing this
paragraph, although it might have been that servers aren't actually
doing this in practice?

Cheers,
Geoff

What does the following text from the SLC IETF meaning mean?

> Refreshing Locks....
>
> Consensus was to delete paragraph on lock refresh.
> Eric - clients seem to be expecting locks to hang around, when they
expire it causes problems.
