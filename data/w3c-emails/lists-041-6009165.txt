I would answer "yes" to both questions.  Although some servers may
have gone ahead and defined some custom live properties in the DAV:
namespace, are there any clients that depend on the ability to set
dead properties in the DAV: namespace?

Cheers,
Geoff

So,

going back to my original question...: it *is* permissible for a server to

- deny setting the property DAV:contentclass (until it is defined in an IETF
specification) and to
- report "not found" upon PROPFIND without actually *checking* dead
properties.

Right?
