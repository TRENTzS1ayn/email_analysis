It's good to know this.

Please forgive me if I'm being dense, but isn't this out of the realm of
WebDAV?
Although there have been some exceptions when people said a given feature
was unimplementable, we've usually said that we are only officially
concerned with
server  behaviors that are exposed to and testable/verifyable by a WebDAV
client.  If  we agree that this is still our philosophy, and that the use
of files in an
implementation is not visible to a client, then perhaps instead of adding
it to the base webdav spec,  someone should draft an RFC on this apart from
WebDAV that documents and resolves this issue.
