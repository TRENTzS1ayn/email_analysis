Sorry, I misunderstood. I agree with you. Proprietary 
properites MUST NOT use the DAV: namespace.

Alan,

that's fine.

My position is that proprietary properties MUST not use the DAV: namespace.
If my server can rely on this, it can report all DAV: properties it doesn't
know as "not found" without even bothering to ask the persistence layer.
