There were several issues in this:
1. unsupported methods might not even be seen by the WebDAV server
    application (or recognized as WebDAV methods).
2. Refreshing locks on PROPFIND by _any_ client (PROPFIND does not
    check on If: headers) will give unpredictable timeout behavior.
    Checking with PROPFIND if a lock is still there has counterproductive
    side effects.

That's the, most likely incomplete, list I remember.
