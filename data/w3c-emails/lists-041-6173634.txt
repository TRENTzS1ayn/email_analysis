Hi Julian ...
    I am not sure if you have tried, but I am not able to "net use" a URI
that uses https://. If I use http:// to the same server, it works fine, but
since I am transmitting id/pw, I need the SSL. I have scoured the groups and
MS's site and cannot find anything useful.  It seems as if we are the only
ones dealing with MS's mess.

Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Thanks,

OK,

we finally fingured out the WebDAV redirector was refusing to
connect: it
*requires* that XML elements in the DAV: namespace use a prefix. This
means,
it won't recognize

 <multistatus xmlns="DAV:" />

while

 <anyprefix:multistatus xmlns:anyprefix="DAV:" />

will work.

Sigh.

It would be really great if Microsoft would start fixing the WebDAV
support
in their clients and servers.
