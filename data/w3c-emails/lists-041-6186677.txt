Hi Philipp,

Good questions -- it has been awhile since a status report has been made to
the WebDAV WG.

In brief:

DeltaV specification: it has been approved by the IESG, and is awaiting
publication as an RFC. I expect this to happen sometime in March -- I'm a
bit surprised the RFC hasn't been issued yet, but it is rather long.

Access control specification: it has passed a WG last call for comments, but
several substantive pieces of feedback have been received since this time.
There will be at least one more draft of the ACL specification, and at least
one more WG last call, before it is sent along for approval by the IESG.
This will probably be completed sometime in early summer 2002.

Advanced collections work is currently on hold. After ACLs, the next major
piece of work will be completing the DASL specification. DASL is looking
like it will be finished in late 2002.

Hope this helps,

- Jim
