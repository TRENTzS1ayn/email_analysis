I think the point is that for every method other than GET, the method
operates on a particular source object, not a set of them.  dav:source is
actually trying to track one level beyond that.  Translate: F, or GETSRC, is
just trying to get back the same contents that were PUT to that location.

The only time Translate/GETSRC is relevant is for executables (cgi's,
servlets, etc.) at a particular URL which generate some dynamic content.
So, there are really three different sets of content we are looking at:

  1)  the generated output returned by GET

  2)  the executable that generates the content for GET, and which is the
object of all other methods (PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE, COPY,
...)

  3)  the multiple source files that were used to generate the executable


The GET method returns resource #1, dav:source (if it were actually
implemented by anyone) would list #3.  Translate: F, or GETSRC, returns
resource #2, which is the one logically consistent with the other WebDAV
methods.

Actually figuring out #3 is something the equivalent of makefile dependency
tracking, and is not generally available even in a development environment,
which is something that WebDAV is certainly not.

Real-world experience has shown that:

* nobody actually tracks multiple source files for an executable
* people sometimes want to actually get the executable contents

Nobody has actually come up with a real-world use-case for dav:source, but
whether or not dav:source is deprecated or not, it's actually identifying a
different set of content than Translate: F / GETSRC.

And, once you realize that you need Translate: F or GETSRC, you might as
well use Translate: F, as you will have no problem getting interoperable
implementations, and it is functionally equivalent to GETSRC.
