  Hi,

  This also surprises me...(see this section from the Salt Lake City IETF
meeting
  minutes....



          Getting source code...

          DAV:source too complex?
          Take out of 2518, put in it's own spec if people need it.
          Translate only does 1:1
          We took a vote and 4 people were in favour of removing DAV:source,
          #nobody opposed this.
          Translate header works well because it's Microsoft and because
most servers have one-2-one mapping...eg they    edit JSP but not CGI (eg C
code)

          Larry - Why not use a proxy that translates the Translate header
into a DAV:source request??
          Geoffs objection to translate is that it needs defining for all
methods not just a few as it is today.
          Clients put the translate header on every request if it is working
on the source (eg in authoring mode).

  The proposal would be that Translate: F would only have an effect on the
GET method, and could be either ignored or forbidden on other methods ( one
of the nits that Geoff picked at at the dinner where we won him over)...

  I seem to remember (and the above enforces this memory) that we took a
vote to remove DAV:source
  from RFC2518 and we agreed.  If we fix DAV:source or if we use the
Translate header I still think
  it needs to go into a separate specification for several reasons:

  - For RFC2518 to move through the standards track we need to show
interoperability of this feature
    and we cannot do that today, we cannot even agree on the best solution

  There is certainly interoperability for Translate: F, so I don't see why
that needs to go into a separate spec.

  - As far as I know we have not seen any clients/servers use the DAV:source
property (eg it is not
    implemented).

  Agreed.  dav:source is basically useless with today's servers

  - I am also interested in managing more than just websites and may need a
more advanced way of
    navigating relationships (perhaps between design documents and the code
that implements them or
    between firmware and circuit board designs etc).  This can best be
addressed in another specification.

  The issue of how the executable is generated is a separate question from
getting at the executable content itself (see my reply to Julian's email).

  Eric,

  that comes as a suprise.

  As far as I remember the discussion we concluced that:

  a) the Translate header (or GETSRC) solves only a very specific part of
the
  problem (when there's a one-to-one mapping between source and output),

  b) the source property needs additional work to become usable, but it's a
  more generic solution.

  So as far as I am concerned, the plan was to fix the source property
(maybe
  be taking it out of RFC2518bis and to fix it in a sperate draft).

  If there were out-of-band discussions, I'd certainly like to hear about
it.

  Julian
