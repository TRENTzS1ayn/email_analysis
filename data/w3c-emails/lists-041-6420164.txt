I am in favor of DAV:source and agree it needs work and can accept it going
in a seperate spec.  This need not be to the exclusion of another option.

My priority is in getting 2518 updated, but I'd be eager to take part in
the discussion of DAV:source and it's alternatives.  I think it's an
important issue.

J.
