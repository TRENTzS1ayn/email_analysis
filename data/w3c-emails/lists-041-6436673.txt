I think a fundamental web architecture issue is being
ignored if we simply look at URL space as a functional
categorization. IMHO, it should be viewed
as a means for classification (as originally intended)
of information, and thus humans should be able to find
resources given an information architecture.  If we assume
a separate/distinct namespace is a requirement, we throw away
the ability to maintain a valuable abstraction.  There
is precedence in presentation of information given
context (.e.g., role) and making DAV:source work would
satisfy this.

As I recall, I was willing to consider the Translate header
or a GETSRC method, if I was the only one who found them
objectionable.  I consider a separate URL space for authoring
a superior approach, since I believe separate URL spaces
are a simpler model, and one that will prove to be more
extensible.  It also is very compatible with common web server
extension mechanisms, which allow you to dispatch to different
modules based on what part of the URL space you are operating in.

So with support from Julian, it no longer is "just me", so I
revert to my natural position, which is against both the
Translate header or a GETSRC method.

Cheers,
Geoff

To all: please do not post in HTML. It makes commenting hard, and it breaks
the web archive.

GET method, and could be either ignored or forbidden on other methods ( one

I see. I guess he dind't have to pay his bill either :-)

>There is certainly interoperability for Translate: F, so I don't see why
that needs to go into a separate spec.

It's not defined in RFC2518, so it can't easily be put into it's revision.
If you want to put it in, you'll have to get agreement on lots of issues
(some of which we already discussed). As there currently is *no* technical
documentation about the Translate header, it will be hard to get proper
definitions of it's semantics (saying: "whatever Frontpage does" doesn't
count).

I think you currently consider only a few special use cases. DAV:source was
designed to address a more generic problem. I think it can be fixed, and we
should try this.
