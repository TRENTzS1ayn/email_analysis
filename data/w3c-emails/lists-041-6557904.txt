I thought the intent of dav:displayname was to be able to hold information
like the <title> element that could be parsed out of an HTML file.  I think
that the collection member name is more of a default value for displayname
than something that is required to correspond to the appropriate piece of
the URL.

I don't think we should make such a change.
