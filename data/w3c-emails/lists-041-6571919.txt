I think you need to prove that if you want to introduce a second model for
something that could be solved using DAV:source.

Having a new GET method that returns completely different resources than
GET, and defining that PROPFIND operates on DAVGET rather than GET is not
only a new model, it would change WebDAV at it's core. Why do this if this
isn't needed????

It can *easily* be solved using DAV:source.

That's a broad claim. Can you prove it?

Why would that take so long?

No, they don't.

Nobody says that they *have* to set aside a special URL space.

For instance, for any "output" resource "x", you could have a source
resource "x" + ".~~~~~source~~~~~" which represents the editable source code
of this resource. No separate URL space.

The only difference is that you might have more than one source. It escapes
me why the special case of having just one source justifies breaking basic
Web axioms by having different resources with the same URI.

No, it's not.

Maybe you could step back and describe why you think it's so much more work
generating a second URI for the editable source resource.
