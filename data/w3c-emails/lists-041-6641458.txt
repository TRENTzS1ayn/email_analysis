If it doesn't (which is completely OK), then DAV:source will be empty,
GETSRC will fail (?) and GET/Translate:f will something unspecified, right?

I think you can't have both. Either do DAV-enable your output-resources, or
don't. If you do, this is a WebDAV problem, and WebDAV has a solution for it
(DAV:source). If you don't, it's outside the scope for WebDAV.

IMHO it makes perfect sense to only DAV-enable the source resources. Why
would you want to Author or Version output resources?

Is it really at the same *URI*? Or does it only happen to be stored in this
place in the local storage of the fileserver?

If it is, it would be the same resource (as per definition of URI). Is it? I
think this is a key question.
