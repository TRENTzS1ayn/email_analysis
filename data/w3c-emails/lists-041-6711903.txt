You forgot the smiley face around "piece of cake" (:-).

Note that getting everyone to agree on a format for embedding
headers in URL references is only part the problem (and html is only
one of the many locations where URL's might appear).  Getting everyone
to upgrade their search engines to repeat their requests with the
appropriate headers (or using the appropriate variant GET methods)
is another part.  And given the limited number of resources that will
actually support the variant access mechanisms, the cost of re-trying each
request
with each of the possible variants is also a negating factor.

Cheers,
Geoff

Not speaking of the problem how the heck google is to
display search results for such source documents...

But by then we probably have extended HTML to handle
<a href="http://xyz/doc.asp" translate="F">link to interesting 
source</a>
in all browsers.

Piece of cake really.
