I agree with all of this!  I have no bones whatsoever to pick about 
the superiority of keeping source and display resources separate, or 
its happy consequences.  For an integrated content management system 
you would definitely want this, and it would be pretty darn cool.

What I disagree with is the _requirement_ to keep the two spaces 
separate, which burdens administrators with a lot of extra 
configuration, isn't understood by most content-generation software 
today (if any), and often confuses the end-users who can barely use 
Dreamweaver/Golive/FrontPage much less understand why their "browser" 
URL is different from their "Dreamweaver" URL.  For most 
installations, keeping the URIs the same is a desireable thing and 
does not cause anyone to lose any functionality that they care about. 
Most people don't care about indexing their source, and we have 
specialized crawlers already for indexing display content.

I'm just saying that the simple things should be easy.  It's a basic 
rule of design.

I'm not stuck on the GETSRC idea. I'll implement Translate almost as 
happily if that's the direction the group goes.  If the group doesn't 
come up with anything at all, then Translate is likely to become the 
de-facto standard, and you'll end up putting it into RFC-2518-bis2 
anyway.
