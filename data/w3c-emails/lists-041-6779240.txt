Based on basic data modeling considerations, I agree
with Julian that the source(s) and the output should not 
be considered variants of the same resource. Hence, 
they would seem to require different URI's.

Thanks, Geoff.

Sorry if I keep repeating myself, but:

are the source and the output resource 

a) different resources, or

b) variants of the same resource [1].

I say "a)", and thus they need to have different URIs.
