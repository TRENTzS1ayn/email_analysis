Ok, let's try a different tack.

Let's keep the model that says source and display URIs are different, 
and keep/fix DAV:source, and leave all that the way it is.

Let's just require that DAV clients add a special field to the 
request so that servers know they are talking to a client that is 
likely to send MKCOL, PROPFIND, and other DAV-specific methods.

That way the URI model stays the same, and servers can tell when a 
GET request was generated by a DAV client.  Servers that only want to 
provide DAV access to source URIs may do so without creating new URI 
spaces.

Call it DAV-Enabled.  The value must be present but is ignored.  (If 
someone got ambitious it could be used by the client to indicate its 
capabilities.  But one problem at a time, OK?)

How's that for a solution?
