The problem with always sending back such a header
when it wasn't explicitly asked for is that the amount
of "interesting" information can be very large.
That is why we have an explicit "PROPFIND" call, rather
than returning all properties every time in headers.

Cheers,
Geoff

Oh, I don't mean a Translate-like request header that asks for the
source resource at an overloaded URI, just that sending the source URI
in a response header could be a smaller burden than having every
output resource generator implement PROPFIND just for the sake of
answering a request for {DAV:}source for output resources that have no
other noteworthy DAV properties.  Like so:
