Yeah, but it's OUR problem, and not yours.  If our DAV implementation 
is unsatisfactory to our customers then we have to change it.  But 
this would let us (and other implementors) give our customers what 
they want, which is DAV access to their source files with virtually 
no configuration necessary.

All we need from the protocol group is a sure way to know that a GET 
command originated from a DAV client.  Is that so much to ask?
