No configuration is necessary with dav:source other than what was already
done to create the dynamic resource.

No, the problem is that your question starts off with an awful design
decision and expects the WG to validate that through another unnecessary
and completely lame hack.

A DAV client doesn't do a GET in order to start editing a resource.
It MUST, for many reasons, perform a PROPFIND on the resource.  When it
does that on a resource that is not capable of being edited, such as
a dynamic-content resource, it will receive the information necessary
to tell the it and the user that to go edit these other URI (as provided
by dav:source) in order to modify the content.  When the user picks one
of those to edit, the client software will then do a PROPFIND on that
other URI, and will continue this recursively until it gets to a resource
that is static and authorable.

There simply is no other way to implement authoring using the Web interface
without assuming that everything is a static file, and not assuming that
was the whole point of defining a WebDAV protocol in the first place.
If editing files was good enough, we'd just us FTP and rsync.
