apart if your company's name is Microsoft, right? Because that's precisely
what they did with 'Translate'.

It seems like we are pretty much done with this thread. Just want to add one
little thing : in the SOAP specifications, POST requests MUST have a
SoapAction field. It is not specified what this field should contain, just
that it has to be there. And noone complained that it's breaking the holy
POST.

Soap is of course a completely different protocol compared to DAV, but it's
still interesting I believe to think about why the spec writers made this
choice (or shall I say a lame hack Roy?)
