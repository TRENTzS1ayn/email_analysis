Preservation is forbidden, since parsers are required to replace
unencoded CRLF or CR in an XML document (or other external parsed
entity) with LF.  AFAIK you can use &#xd; to embed a CR in a search
string, and it might be safest to encourage clients to avoid line
breaks in search strings and use &#xd; and/or &#xa; rather than rely
on every XML parser to handle line breaks correctly.
