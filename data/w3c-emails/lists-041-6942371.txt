as far as I know, GoLive wasn't even able to connect to the Xythos server during the last interoperability test (Oct 2001). But I know, we're able to set shared locks on IIS and Apache (mod_dav).

Is there any solution/workflow implemented upon shared locks? Currently we're using the exclusive locking scheme only, even within our new workgroup system in GoLive 6. So, our Adobe Web Workgroup Server doesn't support shared locks either.

Best, Frank
