Agreed.  But this is irrelevant to most users.

If it is so trivial, why isn't it implemented?  It's not because the 
programmers are simply lazy.  Look at all the stuff the *is* 
implemented wrt DAV.  Even fairly hard stuff like locks and storing 
arbitrary properties is implemented.  But this one trivial thing is 
not.  The *concept* is simple, yet it remains unimplemented after 
three years.

As long as people keep insisting that it is simple, I'm going to keep 
pointing that out.


I'm thinking now that I like the DAV-Enabled field idea better than 
GETSRC, since it doesn't mess with the data model.  But I realize the 
same people will protest it for the same reasons.
