This *is* the problem. GET is GET. It's an HTTP method. Once you are making
it depend on the type of client, you *are* breaking the HTTP model.

People want to send around URL that point to output resources. They *also*
want to send around URLs that point to source resources. This isn't possible
if the URLs are the same.

Now what?

But maybe they would be able to understand my previous argument?

I disagree. Your proposal breaks GET in a very fundamental way.
