You mean like a "DAV-Enabled" header field?  In which case 
"DAV-Enabled" would appear in the Vary field of the response?

A "resource" is a rather malleable concept, and as you've stated here 
there may be many representations of that resource.  I don't see that 
it would be so horrible to allow the idea that one of the 
representations of a resource could be its raw source.  What 
representation you receive is a matter of server policy.  And some 
way of identifying that the server is talking to a DAV client would 
help with managing that policy.
