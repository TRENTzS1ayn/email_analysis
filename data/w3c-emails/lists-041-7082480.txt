GET returns different things for all kinds of different reasons.  The 
time of day, the browser in use, the phase of the moon, 
authentication credentials, your IP address, how much coffee is left 
in the coffee machine, etc..

The body that is returned from GET is a policy matter that is 
determined by the administrator, not by this list.

Again, not your problem.  If someone *wants* to have a special URI 
space for DAV access, then they are welcome to configure their 
server's policy accordingly.

Eventually.  But they would rather the thing "just work".  Latter on 
they'll read the manual, figure out other configurations, and decide 
if they want to change how they're doing things.

>I disagree. Your proposal breaks GET in a very fundamental way.

Nah...  It is still GET.  I'm just asking for the input I need for 
policy decisions.  The bandwidth is minimal, the processing time 
required is about nil, what's not to like?
