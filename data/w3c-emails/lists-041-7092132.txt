At least with mod_dav users, I think it's not been implemented yet
because you don't *need* the source property to be able to author
dynamic resources, since you can say to your users "use URL 'A' for
authoring and URL 'B' for browsing".  People may be used to that anyway:
"use this ftp:// URL for authoring, and this http:// one browsing".

Zope's DAV support does (or did) include support for the source
property, although, according to this thread, not in a useful form:
