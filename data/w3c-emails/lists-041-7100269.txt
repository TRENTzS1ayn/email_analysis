CJ,

first of all: What is the *meaning* of "DAV-Enabled"? As you are proposing
this header, you should define what it means. Is an HTML editor that uses
PROPFIND/GET/PUT/LOCK to author HTML files "DAV-Enabled"? If yes, what do
you do if it has a test function that needs to access the output resource
rather than the source resource?

I think "Translate" is much clearer than "DAV-Enabled" because it at least
it says what you want.

And yes, if you *do* take the position that the source and it's output are
different representations of the same resource, then the "Translate" header
*does* make sense (and you should list in in the "Vary" header when
responsing).

As I've said numerous times: make up your mind whether the source and it's
output are the same resource or not. If they are, you can use "Translate".
If they aren't, they will have different URLs.

HTTP takes the position that they are different resources (see introduction
to "GET"), and I don't see how a different working group could change this
view.

The most horrible thing being that the source resource doesn't have it's own
URL and thus cannot be properly referred to using just a URL. Could you
please explain why you think this particular problem *isn't* relevant?

No, "DAV-Enabled" vs. "Translate" is the completely wrong approach.
Following your proposal, a "DAV enabled" client never would want to GET the
output resource. This is obviously a wrong assumption.
