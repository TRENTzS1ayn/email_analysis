Then let's spec Translate and make it part of DAV.  Interoperable 
implementations exist.

They are if the administrator says they are.  Again, that's policy. 
I don't set policy, I just make the tools my users want.

    The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
    entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
    to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be
    returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the
    process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.

If DAV is responsible for processing GET, and it makes the policy 
decision that the correct output is the the same as the source text 
(and the security sub-system gives the go-ahead) then it should be 
able to return the source text if that's the policy.

Because in practice most people don't want to view the source in a 
browser.  They use DAV for working with their source, and they only 
use it for working with their source.

Sure you could.  If the administrator decides that's a good thing, 
and wants to separate the URIs for source and display, then you could 
certainly GET the output resource with your DAV client.  And if 
DAV:source ever gets fixed and implemented then you could even have 
automatic linking between display and source  URIs.  Its all about 
how the administrator wants to set up the policy.
