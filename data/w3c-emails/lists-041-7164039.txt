Eric,
  Nice post.

I think you're right that a lot of those properties have limited value for
a dynamic resource.  Sometimes they are hard to implement efficiently.
Sometimes the correct value for the server to return for a property might
be ambiguous.
   OTOH... for the underlying source resource, these properties are
probably useful, very clearly defined and easy for the server to return.
That seems to be a good reason to keep the source resource seperate from
the complexity and ambiguity of the dynamic resource.

This is just a response to the first part of your note.   It doesn't
respond to the second part of your note about MOVE which requires more
thought.

Again... thanks for your thoughtful note.

J.
