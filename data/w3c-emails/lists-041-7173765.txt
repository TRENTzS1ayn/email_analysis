Hi 
   Can you please tell me how using the webdav we can
save files on internet, means i want to write a
program for opening a file through a site of the
format of MS Word or Excel, edit it and save it back
on the remote computer, from where it was opened.
Please tell me urgently how to do it, using webdav or
