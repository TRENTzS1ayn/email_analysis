There are many libraries that can be used to access a WebDAV repository and
achieve the goals you describe. A list of these APIs can be found at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/
(look about 1/2 way down the page)

The file can be retrieved using the GET method (standard HTTP/1.1). Using
the WebDAV LOCK method will ensure that only one person can edit the file at
a time.

As for actually editing a .doc or .xls file, this requires knowledge of the
internal structure of these file formats. The WebDAV protocol does not know
anything about these file formats -- it's out of scope.

Reading the following paper may give you some insight into the high-level
design goals for WebDAV:
