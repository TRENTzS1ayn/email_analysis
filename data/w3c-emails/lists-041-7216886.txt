Just because there's a proposal that I think is even worse doesn't make the
Translate header a good solution.

If you want to go ahead, you'll have to:

1) Clearly define what Translate means for every HTTP method defined in HTTP
1.1, WebDAV (and preferably ACL and deltaV).

2) Note that ths definition must be compatible with what the base specs do
today.

I personally do not agree that this is a question of policy. It should be
*consistent*.

DAV is not responsible for "processing" anything. DAV defines semantics of
new HTTP methods, and in particular, it doesn't define GET.

It's not a question of seeing the source in a browser, it's about being able
to *refer* to it. What do you do when somebody sends an email asking for a
link to the source resource? Do you send the URL and add wording to explain
what program will be needed to open it?

OK, so you agree that this is a problem with your proposal, while it isn't
with separate URLs?
