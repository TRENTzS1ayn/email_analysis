If there is a single source for a resource, the client is free to
GET the source and store it locally under the name of the resource.
It then only needs to remember the source uri for the PUT when
changes need to be applied. I think this is trivial for a client
to do.

So, with a little effort on the client side, the user will experience
the same behaviour as with the broken Translate header.

The problem to solve is when to add sources to a copied tree. Where
shall the client perform the PUT? Maybe this is something for the
parent collection to hint at. For new collections, this could be
recursively applied when uploading changes to a server.
