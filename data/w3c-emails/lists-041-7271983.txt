No, I don't agree that this is a problem.  In most cases it is the 
_desired_ effect because users generally only use DAV for messing 
with their source, and they don't care about using DAV with the 
output.  But they _do_ want to use the same URLs for both editing 
source and viewing output.  If the administrator wants something 
different he should be able to configure his server accordingly.

Separating "source" and "display" into different resources with 
different URIs is a very nice idea, but not terribly useful to most 
people.  Maybe once the DAV:source property is fixed and DASL gets 
off the ground, this will become a more useful configuration.

I believe the DAV spec needs to allow both scenarios, and the 
simplest way to do that is to either:

- have a definitive way to know when a client expects the source or
- know when a GET method originates from a DAV client
