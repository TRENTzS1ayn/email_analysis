I think we can all agree on that.

What we're disagreeing on is that the source can be the same URI as 
the output.  They can be two views of the same resource.  That is how 
most people think of it, and it would be practical to accomodate 
them.  But the current spec is very inconvenient in that it 
effectively prevents it (without explicitly forbidding it).

I think Eric mentioned that some of these values are required, so you 
can't not return them.

It is common because it is the only way to deploy DAV under the 
current spec.  It causes no end of confusion amongst people who are 
deploying/using DAV for the first time.  It is counter-intuitive, and 
is not really useful in most situations.

Someone claimed that Translate/GETSRC would require implementation 
changes.  Eric was just pointing out that implementations have to 
change anyway because of these very issues, therefore the argument is 
irrelevant.
