I have to not return them if they don't exist. I can't return the headers
upon HEAD or GET either. If you understand RFC2518 as saying that
DAV:getcontentlength MUST be returned any may not be an empty string, this
indicates that we need to fix RFC2518.

These are completely subjective arguments. Some people like the one
approach, some like the other.

Agreed, unless somebody claims that "adopting" the Translate header can be
done without breaking existing code.
