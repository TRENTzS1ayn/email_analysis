I see your point.  Defining "Translate: F" would probably be better 
than just knowing if the client is DAV-enabled, since that tells you 
if the client wants the source or not.  That way you could have a 
client that could view output or source at the same URI.

Otherwise you would have to define the DAV-Enabled field to only be 
sent when a client wanted to GET the source view of a resource, which 
is a little silly.
