You are saying that the protocol should have a one-to-one correspondence
with the way that a client application presents information to the user.
I am saying that the protocol must be unabiguous and compatible with
HTTP/1.1, but that doesn't stop the client from presenting it to the
user as if they were the same resource.  The only difference is the URL,
which is something an authoring client can and will present to the user in
a way that is meaningful to that user.  DAV is the access mechanism, not the
user interface.
