The DeltaV protocol specification was released as an RFC today! RFC 3253 is
"Versioning Extensions to WebDAV", which extends RFC 2518 with capabilities
for versioning and configuration management. RFC 3253 is a Proposed
Standard, meaning it has resolved known technical tradeoffs, and is
considered a stable base for widespread implementations.

Major congratulations are due to Geoff Clemm, Jim Amsden, Tim Ellison, Chris
Kaler, and the members of the DeltaV Design Team, and the DeltaV Working
Group, for a job well done after 3.5 years of very hard work.

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types
   that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
   versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.  WebDAV versioning
   will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of
   interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to
   facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing
   the WebDAV Versioning services.  WebDAV versioning includes automatic
   versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history
   management, workspace management, baseline management, activity
   management, and URL namespace versioning.
