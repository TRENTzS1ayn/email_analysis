Microsoft Office 2000 and XP support WebDAV on Windows platforms. This is
accessed via a feature called "Web Folders". An explanation of how to set up
and use Web Folders from the Windows file system can be found at:

http://www.mydocsonline.com/info_webfolders.html


From Office, once a Web Folder is created, you access it via the File ...
Open dialog box (a Web Folders icon is in the bottom left of the dialog
box).

Mac versions of Office do not support WebDAV, as far as I know. The Mac
version of Office is a distinct code base from the Windows version.

Mac OS X supports mapping a WebDAV server to a drive -- I can't find any
documentation on the net for how to do this. Office on the Mac can
read/write to a DAV-mapped drive.

A fairly complete list of DAV-supporting applications can be found at:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/
(About 1/2 way down the page).

Adobe DAV-supporting applications (Photoshop, Illustrator 10, Acrobat 5,
InDesign 2, others...) support DAV evenly across the Mac and Windows
platform.

This information would be great. We're a volunteer organization here, so if
you do develop this kind of information, we would gladly host it on
WebDAV.org.

You would map the information to spaces served by a DAV server, and then set
the local permissions in the DAV server such that only the appropriate
authors had access to specific areas (i.e., except for the being served by a
DAV server, the answer is much the same as for a local file system).
