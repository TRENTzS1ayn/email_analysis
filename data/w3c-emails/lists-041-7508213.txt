 From the Finder, use the "Go" menu and select "Connect to Server..." 
(or just hit apple-K).  Enter the URL that you want to connect to. 
eg: http://www.my.org/naturalSciences/

You will be prompted for your username and password.

The finder-based DAV is very cool because it lets you use your DAV 
server like a  disk.  But it doesn't support locking, last time I 
checked.  But Goliath does, and works on MacOS X.

That is really dependent on your server software, but you control DAV 
access just like you control any other kind of access to your web 
server.
