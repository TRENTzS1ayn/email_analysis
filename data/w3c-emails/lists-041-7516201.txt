And if the URL doesn't go to a WevDAV-enabled server directory (i.e., 
it's an URL to some random web page), the mount will fail with an error 
19 (no device... the best error code we could map it to).

You'll be prompted only if the WevDAV-enabled server directory requires 
authentication. For example, <http://idisk.mac.com/jumplong/Public> 
requires no authentication.

The Mac OS X WebDAV file system does use the LOCK method.

DAV class 1 WebDAV servers are mounted as read-only volumes because the 
LOCK method isn't required for class 1 resources.

DAV class 2 WebDAV servers are mounted as read-write volumes. On these 
servers, when a file (resource) is opened with write access, the WebDAV 
file system uses the LOCK method to acquire a lock on the file being 
opened with a timeout of 10 minutes. If the lock cannot be acquired, 
then the file cannot be opened with write access. The lock is refreshed 
every 5 minutes until the file is closed. When the file is closed, the 
UNLOCK method is used to unlock the file. The WebDAV file system does 
not acquire a lock on files opened with read-only access.
