The first implementations of (WebDAV+iDisk) were using Basic authentication.
Some users expressed security concerns about exposing their passwords so
Apple must have switched to MD5-Digest (with OSX 10.1.1)

If it is indeed the case and that GoLive does not support MD5 yet (GoLive 5
didn't as far as I know) then you just can't access your iDisk using GoLive.
