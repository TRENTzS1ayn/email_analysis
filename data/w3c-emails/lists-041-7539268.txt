Apple's iDisk WebDAV servers currently challenge with both a Basic 
access WWW-Authenticate header and a Digest access WWW-Authenticate 
header and the server will accept either Basic or Digest authorizations 
from WebDAV clients. The servers were switched to allow Digest in 
addition to Basic at the same time Digest support was added to Mac OS X 
WebDAV file system (Mac OS X v10.1.1).

So, authentication isn't the problem.

The only thing that is lost between upload to the iDisk server from the 
Mac OS X file system and downloading with another client are the 
AppleDouble file which store Macintosh specific Finder metadata and the 
resource forks of files -- the AppleDouble files are hidden from non-Mac 
OS X file system clients.
