There was some amount of consensus a while back on the DAV WG list that the
DAV: header should allow Coded-URLs in it. mod_dav took this approach, so an
OPTIONS response looks like:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Mar 2002 13:10:17 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.19 (Unix) DAV/1.0.2
Content-Length: 0
MS-Author-Via: DAV
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, DELETE, TRACE, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK
DAV: 1,2,<http://apache.org/dav/propset/fs/1>
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/plain
