If Greg's approach is taken to avoid conflicts, then I see no strong reason
to prefer live properties over OPTIONS header values in the general case.

However, if the feature is one which relates only to some resources (e.g.
all collections support the feature, or all resources in the directory foo,
etc) then it might be helpful to advertise support for the feature only on
those resources, using a live property as suggested.

OPTIONS * still seems to be the most appropriate place to marshall
server-wide features, with the conflict-avoidance caveats already mentioned.
