I don't think you understand.  If I'm sitting inside a large company, trying
to author a page from a site that's out on the internet, that page may
already be subject to transformations from transparent edge services.  For
example, the company firewall may be filtering viruses downloaded via HTTP.
More insidious, if I get my internet service from a struggling ISP, they
could replace banner ads on incoming messages with their own banner ads.

The OPES WG at the IETF is dealing with these issues directly.  The IAB has
suggested that edge services should not be transparent -- that clients must
explicitly ask for edge services.  However, even an IETF demand for there
not to be transparent edge services isn't a guarantee that there won't be
any.  You could say that the authoring issues are an argument against
encouraging transparent edge services, but those issues certainly don't make
transparent edge services not exist.
