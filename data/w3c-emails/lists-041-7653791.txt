I don't think that DAV clients should be able to bypass that one, but they
can via a tunnel.

I don't think people will allow banner ads to be edited through anything
less secure than a VPM or SSL tunnel, for obvious reasons.

I wouldn't argue that at all.  What you should consider, however, is that
if there is a plain HTTP mechanism for routing requests unmolested through
an interception device (which is not called an edge service), then what
makes you think that only DAV clients would want to use it?  And, once that
happens, why would the molesters honor the plain HTTP mechanism?
