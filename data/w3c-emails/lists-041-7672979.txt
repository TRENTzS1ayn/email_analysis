(I am splitting my comments into separate mails so that we get distinct discussion threads)

- I happen to have tested the TeamStream client two days ago (with our server). It's good that there *is* a versioning-aware client, but the current implementation shows that it's not trivial to support the more advanced features. As far as I understand, it currently can *show* a (linear) version history (minus DAV:comment property), but it doesn't really support actions on the version resources (like opening, deleting and so on...)

- Technically, our remote WebDAV adapter *is* a DeltaV client, and it's goal is to interoperate with any RFC3253 server. So far, we haven't found any server to test against except our own (Subversion and Xythos interop fails for various reasons). So I think an interop testing event with a special focus on deltaV would be extremely useful.

- I think it would be a good thing to automate as much as possible. Test suites like Litmus are welcome and server developers should have a public test site for their latest code.

- Clarification: I'm not planning separate drafts. The plan is to issue new drafts as each of the sections becomes stable (framework, basicsearch, QSD...). Right now, the framework (SEARCH method, grammar discovery, error reporting) seems to be stable. The first draft will be submitted as soon the IETF accepts them again.

- That would be welcome. Ideally, DASL would just be about *applying* the basics from XML Query / XSLT to the WebDAV specific case.

- Clarification: it doesn't predate XML Schema -- it's completely in sync with it:

> - Ordering

- Draft 03 will be submitted next week (unless problems with the draft are reported before):

- We would be interested to revive the BIND protocol / draft.
