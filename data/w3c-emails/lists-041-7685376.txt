We still have the open issue to define a protocol extension that allows to PROPFIND all dead properties plus a set of named live properties in a single call. Proposal at:

Question: is there any intention to bundle all RFC2518 extensions (allprop behaviour, live deltaV properties, REPORT method, DAV:source property...) into a single WebDAV extension RFC? I think this would make a lot of sense.

...and should be clarified to Microsoft as well :-).

I think it does, but there are several other problems with the current definition (already captured in the issues list).

I don't want to restart the thread, but the "advantage" mentioned here is that the Translate header "solves" a problem that you wouldn't have in the first place when properly distinguishing source and output resources :-)
