I have used it in a commercial application. But it is rather painful to 
use and quite limited,
so we are no longer using it and rolled our own library.
Essentially, you need to use the interfaces specificed in the OLE DB 2.5 
SDK:
IRootBinder, IBindResource,  IRowset, ICreateRow, etc.
For example, for a PROPFIND, you get the IRootBinder interface, from 
that the IBindResource interface,
then you call Bind on that, with a request for an IRowset interface.
You can then use the standard OLE DB functions to operate on the rowset.
File reading/writing is done through an IStream interface.
So you have to think in database terms, and, of course, COM knowledge is 
required.
