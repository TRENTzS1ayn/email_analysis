That would set us back to sending Translate headers.

Hmm, 2616 is only speaking of content (and Content- headers). The
examples are with server responses.

I think modifying client requests is a no-no. Otherwise I
hope Internet Explorer sets "no-transform" when I'm online
shopping...

Everyday you learn some new HTTP Headers...;)

Can a "source" resources (listed in some other resource's
DAV:source property) have own DAV:source properties?
Must a resource designated as "source" be editable (e.g. support
PUT) and will that PUT influence the content of its
derived resource? When?

I think we need clarification of the "source" concept. When
do resources have a "source" relation?
- ASP/JSP pages
- shtml
- executables, object files and source code
- resources derived from a "master" with stylesheets
- ...

Which of these examples do we want to provide a solution
for with DAV:source?

I'm not really a fan of new HTTP methods, but just for interest:
Wouldn't a new method like "EDIT" which retrieves the editable
content of a resource make our life easier? It could respond
with a Content-Location where a PUT can be applied...
