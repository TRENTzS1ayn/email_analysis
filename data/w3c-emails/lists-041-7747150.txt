If you have a URL for the source (i.e. the one that PUT
can be applied to), what benefit would EDIT (previously
called GETSRC in the recent thread on this subject) have,
other than saving you one roundtrip, i.e. instead of a
"PROPFIND, GET" you would do an EDIT?  

In particular, if you are going to use locking for your
authoring (which you should :-), you don't want to issue the GET
until you have successfully LOCKed the URL (i.e. your sequence
will be PROPFIND(source)/LOCK(source-URL)/GET(source-URL).
So unless you also want to bundle an implict "LOCK" into the EDIT,
you need to do the PROPFIND first anyway.

Cheers,
Geoff

I'm not really a fan of new HTTP methods, but just for interest:
Wouldn't a new method like "EDIT" which retrieves the editable
content of a resource make our life easier? It could respond
with a Content-Location where a PUT can be applied...
