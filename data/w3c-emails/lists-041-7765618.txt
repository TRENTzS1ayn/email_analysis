I think it can be possible that PUT is possible even if the GET varies. This
just means that the PUT will actually overwrite varying entity bodies as
well.

May be we need a new live property indicating that it's "meaningful" to edit
a particular resource? Note that the absence of DAV:source (or it being
empty) wouldn't really mean the same thing...
