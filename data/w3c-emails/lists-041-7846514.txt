I have just started learning about WebDAV and have
a few thoughts/questions that someone on this group
may be able to help with.

I understand WebDAV to be a HTTP-extension-based
protocol that enables functionality that is important
to distributed authoring.  When I looked at the draft
specs, it appears that the method extensions seem to
map to operations performed on authored resources and
the payload of the message seems to be arguments of
sorts to the WebDAV server for the method being
invoked.

I was wondering if the WebDAV specs (and sub-specs)
would be amenable to extrapolation to a
general-purpose
Web-Services interface definition and whether there
would be any point in thinking this way.  As a 
newbie to this technology, it seems like an obvious
connection to me.  In fact I suspect that I will find
a whole bunch of other initiatives to define WSDL
interfaces for "content managerment" or "distributed
authoring" or..

Thank you for any pointers to discussions or
links to related topics!
