Please reply directly to skronberg@viack.com

I'm trying to customize OWA to include a list of all users in our global
address book (GAL).  The search URL looks like this, however I'm looking
for a "wildcard" for the display name (DN=)

https://mail.viack.com/exchange/?Cmd=galfind&DN=**&LN=&FN=&TL=&AN=&CP=&D
P=&OF=&CY= 

So, where the ** is in the above URL, I need a wildcard that works -- do
you know of one?

Thanks,
Sean
