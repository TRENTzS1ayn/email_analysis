A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV Ordered Collections Protocol
Author(s): J. Slein, E. Whitehead, J. Davis,
                          G. Clemm, C. Fay, J. Crawford, J. Reschke
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-02.txt
Pages: 43
Date: 28-Mar-02

This specification extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
to support server-side ordering of collection members. Of particular
interest are orderings that are not based on property values, and so
cannot be achieved using a search protocol's ordering option and
cannot be maintained automatically by the server. Protocol elements
are defined to let clients specify the position in the ordering of
each collection member, as well as the semantics governing the
ordering.
Distribution of this document is unlimited. Please send comments to

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
