Hi,

to clear up some possible confusion:

For some reason, IETF has decided that the last submitted draft was version
01, and therefore assigned number 02. So now we have a March 2002 and a
December 1999 version of draft 02.

I feel that the protocol itself is stable and ready to be implemented.
Before going to experimental RFC I'd like to rewrite some of the error
reporting to be more in line with RFC3253 (WebDAV versioning).

Our (greenbytes / SAP Portals) implementation of ordered collections is the
only one I'm currently aware of. Does anybody know of another
implementation?

Regards, Julian
