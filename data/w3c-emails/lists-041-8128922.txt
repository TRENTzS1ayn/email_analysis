One other related question.  Does a resource whose name ends with a slash always
represent a collection?  RFC 2518 section 5.2 doesn't explicitly say this.

For example, say that we receive a PUT request for /dir/ and that /dir/ does not
exist.  Do we treat /dir/ as a collection and fail the request as implied in RFC 2518
Section 8.7.2 paragraph 1 or do we ignore the trailing slash and perform a  PUT on
/dir?

Thanks,
