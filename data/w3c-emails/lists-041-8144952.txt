Hi,

Is there a simple example of how I can lock/unlock (using java 
preferably) a resource on a server?

Explantion:
I have an app (content management for client sites) that has its own 
locking system which needs to tell the webdav whether a file is locked 
or not. It also needs to read whether a resource is locked or unlocked.
----------

I also want to explain the file-system/apache structure for the app to 
see if there are any problems. All 3 views work off the same directory. 
The app has 3 views:

1. authoring or development - this is the main app accessed by 
https://myappco.com/appname/
-- using the servlet container's config to set the approot to: /sites/myapp

2. certification - a generated version of the site accessed by:
https://clientsite.myappco.com/

-- using the apache httpd.conf to set a
<VirtualHost *>
DocumentRoot /sites/myapp/clientsite
require group clientsite_qa
</VirtualHost>

3. webdav - set to give authorized webdav access:
https://myappco.com/appname/clientsite/
-- using the apache httpd.conf to set a
<Location /myapp/clientsite>
#directives
require group clientsite_webdav
</Location>

Thanks for any help/advice,
-Rob
