<<
The W3C has decided to treat link roles as URIs. If we decide to define a
different mechanism, we will
sooner or later have to define a mapping of XLink role URIs to our role
schema (because other systems with which a WebDAv server connect may have
decided to use standard Xlink roles).
>>
I assume Geoff or others will respond to this and hopefully also to my
questions.

<<
 Furthermore this brings *us* into the
business of defining roles (I think the spec should only define a mechanism
to marshall them, that's it).
>>
By *US* I take it you mean the WebDAV community.  Is it your view that some
non-WebDAV entity will end up defining XLink roles that are also pertainent
to
WebDAV?
