Not exactly the WebDAV community in total, but the subset of it actively
working on fixing RFC2518.

Regarding role URIs: yes, I'd expect this: see, for instance:

http://www.rddl.org/#role

BTW: just because a role is identified by a URI, it doesn't need to be
opaque. For instance, the role URI may identify a HTTP-GETtable resource in
a specific format. There's a reason why the ACL spec identifies principals
by URI instead of marshalling all principal information in each PROPFIND,
right?

  <<
  The W3C has decided to treat link roles as URIs. If we decide to define a
  different mechanism, we will
  sooner or later have to define a mapping of XLink role URIs to our role
  schema (because other systems with which a WebDAv server connect may have
  decided to use standard Xlink roles).

  I assume Geoff or others will respond to this and hopefully also to my
  questions.

  Furthermore this brings *us* into the
  business of defining roles (I think the spec should only define a
mechanism
  to marshall them, that's it).
  >>
  By *US* I take it you mean the WebDAV community. Is it your view that some
  non-WebDAV entity will end up defining XLink roles that are also
pertainent to
  WebDAV?
