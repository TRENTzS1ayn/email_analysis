Well, one possibility is that a set of custom WebDAV properties (or at
the limit, just one) could be expressed in an XML schema, and that
schema could be registered. Another possibility is that committed
individuals could work with Mealling to see if it's feasible for the
registry specification to include specific element names.

I'm not sure... this is a registry for namespace names, DTD identifiers,
XML
schemas or RDF schemas -- not for specific element names. How do you
think
it can be applied to WebDAV properties?
