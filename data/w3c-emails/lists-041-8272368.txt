Julian, I've made a number of your suggestions exactly, or used them to
guide me to do a better job. I have comments on some others.

I think this is part of a larger discussion... I don't recall any
opinions from others yet.

1) What is XMLINFOSET? 
2) This definition of a property value adds significant definitions to
the specification. Are the implications of each of these consistent with
existing implementations?

Any reasons? Any suggested text?  Is it OK for these particular
properties to be not present?

We did reach consensus on removing propertybehavior, IMO. I attempted to
turn the vague idea into text. This particular text existed before, by
the way so is in some sense a different issue.

You may be right. Do you have another suggestion?
