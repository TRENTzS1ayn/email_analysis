It adds definitions where the spec used to be silent. I think this is a good
thing. What may be controversial is the requirement to persist attributes
attached to the property element itself, but AFAIK this is supported both in
IIS and moddav (will have to check).

The reason is that "being blank" is *different* from "not being present".
This is something we need to sort out for all resources, not only the
formerly lock-null-resources. So the text *here* probably shouldn't say
anything at all, and then we should clarify which DAV: properties are really
required.

Please do not require to report "reasonable defaults" for things like the
content type when the server doesn't know. That would break HTTP.

Correct.

Maybe MOVE and COPY need to be treated differently. If a server can't move a
resource with it's live properties staying alive, I'd claim that it actually
can't move the resource at all, and thus MOVE should fail (requiring the
client to fall back to COPY/DELETE).

Opinions?

Just remove it. "Duplicating" a property value is well-defined, as long as
the "property value" is well-defined (which we're trying to fix).
