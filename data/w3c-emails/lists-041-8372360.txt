Advantage: this is the current situation with RFC3253 and the ACL spec, and
this doesn't seem to cause any confusion at all. All we need is to clarify
RFC2518.

I agree that the name "allprop" will be a bit confusing. But that's
something that can be solved by properly explaining it, right?

Yes, but at greatly increased cost, both in number of roundtrips, client
complexity and computation time in the server. I've explained this in
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002JanMar/0186.html>:

"The client will issue two calls: first it will use
propname to find the list of properties. Computing whether a live property
exists maybe as expensive as computing it (for instance, to find out whether
something is checked in/out). *Then* it will submit PROPFIND / prop will all
these properties. So as compared to the current situation, the server may
have to compute things twice which wouldn't have been computed at all before
(since asking for allprop wouldn't require computing live deltaV
properties)."

In particular this means that if a client really *wants* propname, the
server will have to compute whether each and every live property is present,
while with the current RFC3253 definition of allprop, adding new live
properties doesn't cause any additional overhead *at all*.

Could you please address this concern?

Actually, I'd like to see a broad discussion before changing the *current*
status, as defined by RFC2518/3253.
