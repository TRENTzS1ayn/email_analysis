   Advantage: this is the current situation with RFC3253 and the ACL
   spec, and this doesn't seem to cause any confusion at all. All we
   need is to clarify RFC2518.

   I agree that the name "allprop" will be a bit confusing. But that's
   something that can be solved by properly explaining it, right?

I agree.  I have little concern over any confusion resulting from the
name "DAV:allprop".  The concept of "all dead properties plus 2518
defined properties" is very simple, and should be easy to convey.  And
even if an implementor gets it wrong and returns some (or all)
non-2518 live properties as well, little or no harm is done.

I think this disadvantage significantly outweighs the minor benefits
of a slightly better name for this concept.

   Yes, but at greatly increased cost, both in number of roundtrips, client
   complexity and computation time in the server. I've explained this in
   <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002JanMar/0186.html>:

I agree that it is valuable to have a simple mechanism for retrieving
all dead properties in one request (especially for a non-zero Depth
PROPFIND), and I agree that using DAV:allprop is the most interoperable
mechanism for providing this mechanism.

Cheers,
Geoff
