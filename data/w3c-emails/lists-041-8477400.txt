I've changed the issue name to the one on the issue list that seems more
appropriate. See new Subject: line.

The other question of that issue is... do we agree that if you request an
UNLOCK
on a resource that is not locked by that lock, that the request should
fail?

I believe in previous discussions it was suggested that we should not allow
one
to specify a URL other than one that is locked by the lock.  The reasoning
was
that in a virtual website where the URI space might be partitioned and
delegated
across several machines (perhaps using intermachine BIND requests), it
might be
burdensome for all machines of the virtual website to be familiar with all
locks.

Anyway, regardless of folks believing this, I'd like to confirm that UNLOCK
requests
specifying a request URI of an unlocked resource should be rejected.

Opinions?

(going back to an old discussion...)

RFC2518, 8.11 says [1]:

"The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in the
Lock-Token request header from the Request-URI, and all other resources
included in the lock. If all resources which have been locked under the
submitted lock token can not be unlocked then the UNLOCK request MUST fail.
"

So do we have agreement that *any* of the URIs affected by a deep lock can
be used to do the UNLOCK operation?
