Just giving this one a new subject line to distinguish it from the

   Maybe MOVE and COPY need to be treated differently. If a server
   can't move a resource with it's live properties staying alive, I'd
   claim that it actually can't move the resource at all, and thus
   MOVE should fail (requiring the client to fall back to
   COPY/DELETE).

   Opinions?

I agree that MOVE and COPY need to be treated differently, and I
further agree that MOVE should fail if live properties cannot be
maintained (requiring the client to fall back to COPY/DELETE).
