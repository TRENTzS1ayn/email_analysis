Hi,

First how do i join the list, just came accross it.

Second i have a java implementation of a webdav server running on resin
(webserver). Resin allows one to specify character encoding in the conf
file. However when used with other webservers or OS ( using windows just
now) it isnt possible to set the character encoding. Therefore when my
windows explorer client sends the encoded request the server doesnt
recognise it and spits out a bad request 400. DO i now have to go and
implement the character encoding too?

Is this even the correct list to ask this question.

Cheers

Andy
