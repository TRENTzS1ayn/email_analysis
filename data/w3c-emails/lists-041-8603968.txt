I'd like to see us try this requirement for MOVE and see how much trouble
folks have complying.   I think it will require some coordination between
resource authors and server writers to insure the authors concept of
"resource" is supportable in server's implementation of MOVE.

I should then enhance the description of issue:COPY_LIVE_PROPS to make sure
that's the case after we define the properties well.   Hopefully we'll also
define the default behavior of unknown dead properties clearly enough so
that COPY/MOVE behavior is clear for them also. (PROP_ROUNDTRIP)
