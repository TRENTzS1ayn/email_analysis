I would like to -- but am having trouble -- extracting from
this discussion a set of requirements that a revised RFC 2396
URI specification would need to meet.

What about the usage of the terms URI, URL and URN do you
actually need?

In what way does the definition of these terms affect the 
WebDAV specification? Most of the terminology is really just
advisory.

Another alternative would be to establish specific WebDAV terminology
and then define that terminology in terms of the various URI
RFCs.
