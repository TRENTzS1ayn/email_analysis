I don't think this is supported by RFC2396. Two URNs may identify the same
resource. If you disagree, you'll have to prove that.

I disagree. URLs are just a subset of URIs. When we talk about URIs that
identify WebDAV resources, we can talk about URLs (because we know that they
use the http: or https: scheme). Otherwise, we shouldn't make any
assumptions.

I think you are in disagreement with the current usage of terms, and with
the intended purpose of the source property. Source properties define links
to other resources, and whether these resources are identified by a URL or
URN should be completely irrelevant. You might want to take a look at
<http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uri-ig-02.txt>.

Yes, but it doesn't mean that there can't be a non-URL URI that identifies
the same resource.

That will break existing code for no good reason. One of my repository
managers uses the http: scheme to identify lock tokens.


So in general

- only use URL instead of URI when we *know* it to be a URL (so for http: or
https:)
- don't touch anything else, except for the purpose of updating from RFC2068
compliance to RFC2396 compliance
