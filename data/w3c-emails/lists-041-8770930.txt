I  mis-read what you wrote, but I still disagree (now in a different way). A
URI (no matter whether URN or URL) identifies a resource. So two different
resources can't have the same URL either. That's by definition.

RFC2518 has defined that lock tokens are identified by URIs with no
restriction. An attempt to restrict lock tokens to specific URI types (are
you trying to do that?) can break existing code with no benefit -- the only
thing a client should do with a lock token is to remember it, and to
resubmit when needed -- from it's point of view it just a string, and
clients MUST not make any assumptions about the type of the URI scheme in
use.

I disagree that the source link MUST use "locatable" resources. We may want
to clarify with Roy.

Example: I might want to have a source link from

http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc3253.html

to

urn:ietf:rfc:3253

Do you say this is wrong?

This is just s statement about a typical use case. It doesn't say anything
about other use cases.

So who defines whether a URI is a URN? Is

urn:isbn:(some-isbn)

a URN? Is it a URL? If it *is* a URN (it clearly says so :-), does it become
a URL as well if I install a custom URI resolver in my system which knows
about the urn:isbn: scheme? I think the concept of *partitioning* URIs into
"locatable" und "naming" is bogus -- both types can be used both ways. The
joint IETF/W3C URI interest group is currently trying to clarify this, and
we should not to rely on outdated definitions.

Who says that the URI must be usable to "access" the resource? It's
certainly not in the current definition.

URLs name resources as well. So are they a superset of URNs? Just wondering.

URLs are URIs. URIs *identify* resources, so they provide *identifiers* for
resources. Are you saying that an "identifier" is not a "name"?

Resources never are *available* at a URI. *Representations* of resources may
be available. I think you are saying that any URI that can be used to locate
a representation of a resource is a URL. That may be technically correct (so
*I* can basically turn every URN into a URL by implementing a resolver for
the scheme). However, most people clearly have a different understanding of
URLs. We should try to *avoid* additional confusion, instead of adding to
it.

I don't think that RFC2396 says that. For instance, "urn:isbn:" clearly is a
URN scheme, but I still can use that URN to access a representation of the
resource (the resource for instance being a book).

How would a *URI* provide that ability? The URI itself is just a name. For
specific URI schemes, my computer may have software installed to resolve it,
but that's it. RFC2396 characterizes a URL as a URI "that identify resources
via a representation of their primary access mechanism (e.g., their network
"location")", but that doesn't mean that a non-URL URI can't be used to
locate the resource as well.

Well.

If you agree that a HTTP URL can be used to identify a lock token, thus it
*is* both a URN and a URL, could you please give an example of a HTTP URL
that doesn't share these properties (thus *isn't* a URN)?
