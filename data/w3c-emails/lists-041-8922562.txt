Magazine




Hi,

I'm the managing editor of WebSphere Advisor Magazine, and I'm running an
article on WebDAV in my September 2002 issue. I have one quick question for
you: Have the versioning capabilities already been implemented in WebDAV?
I've heard they're still in progress. Do you have any idea (ballpark figure
is fine; i.e., end of 2002, Q1 2003) when the versioning capabilities will
be established?

Unfortunately, I'm on deadline, so your quick response is much appreciated.
If you'd also like to send your address, I can be sure to mail you a few
copies of the magazine when it hits the streets.

Thank you in advance,
Ellie
