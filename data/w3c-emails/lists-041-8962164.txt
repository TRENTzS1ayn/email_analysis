Yes.

I think this is just a misunderstanding. All properties used within the
WebDAV protocol are "DAV properties" (as discussed in this section) -- they
aren't limited to those listed in that section. Maybe that should be
clarified.

No. That's a property with the name "integer" in the namespace "DAV:", while
the earlier example described a property named "foo" (in the namespace
"DAV:").
