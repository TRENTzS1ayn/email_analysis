Subject: [Moderator Action] message board on webdav




Hi

I would like to create a message board on my website which is hosting in
Webdav. Is there any resources / technical supports I could find on
regarding a message board on webdav so that I have a clearer idea in doing
so?

Thanks and I'm looking forward to your reply

Moshea
