<<
Section 4.2: Lock-null resources removed

Text mentions: "SHOULD default to reasonable, or reasonably blank, values
for other properties like getcontentlanguage"

I disagree: unknown properties should be treated as not being present (just
like the relevant HTTP headers), NOT as blank.

If a server creates a resource as a result of a LOCK request on an unmapped
URL,  I believe Julian is suggesting that if there is any doubt about what
the property value should be, the property should not be created rather
than set to NULL.

Julian, did I get that right?  Would you care to elaborate?   What about a
few examples?
