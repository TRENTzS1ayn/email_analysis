I don't quite understand the first part of the question.
If we say that the live properties must continue live at
the destination, what more do we need to say?  (I.e. what
situation is left ambiguous?).

For the second part, a 403 (Forbidden) seems right to me.

Cheers,
Geoff

If a MOVE operation MAY fail when live properties can't be continued as
live properties at the destination, what should we say about when the
server can allow the MOVE and when it can't? Is it entirely up to the
server or should we make a recommendation?

Then, if the server does fail, what error code should be returned?
