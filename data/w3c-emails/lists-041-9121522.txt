not used ;) by me.

not used.

currently not used.

Our server code implements all these features.

Removing the "NOT" production is Ok with me, if we need it
for proven interoperability. I feel however that the "NOT"
production makes the "IF" grammer more complete and see no
great burden in its implementation.
