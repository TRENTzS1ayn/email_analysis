We don't "extend" - we clarify. Any XML parser is required to support UTF-8
and UTF-16. RFC2518 requires that an implementation uses a conforming XML
parser.

Both MUST support both, otherwise they break XML.

On the other hand, it may make sense to *discourage* any other encoding
(such as ISO-8859-1 or win-nnnn).
