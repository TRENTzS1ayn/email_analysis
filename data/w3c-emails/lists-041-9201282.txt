Agreed. Also, this update shouldn't cause much problem anyway, as
everyone seems to have gone with UTF-8.

Hmm, do you mean by MUST NOT? Banning use of other encodings in the
spec sounds too aggressive to me. Simply keeping it optional (as XML
does) should be effectively the same.

For world-wide interoperability, it is good to have Unicode as a MUST.
But why not allow use of other encodings under controlled or non-public
environment?
