Well, if a client/server uses an optional encoding (and any except UTF-8 and
UTF-16 *is* optional in XML), it may have to live with the fact that the
other side requests the message, so there's no guaranteed interoperability.

If you control both sides, that's fine. But the whole point in *having* an
open internet protocol is to take care of the case where you *don't* control
both sides.
