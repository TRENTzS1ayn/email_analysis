I'd prefer the stricter alternative, but I could live with
the former if it said "SHOULD" instead of "MAY".

Cheers,
Geoff

It depends on the precise wording of the language. One alternative is to
be loose, allowing servers compliant with 2518 to still be compliant
with 2518bis (with either MAY or SHOULD, I'm not sure yet):

"A MOVE operation MAY fail (403 Forbidden) if the live properties of the
source cannot be live properties of the destination.  The server MAY
remove live properties that are no longer appropriate at the
destination."

A stricter alternative:

"All live properties on the source resource MUST become live properties
on the destination resource with appropriate values and the same
semantics. If the server cannot guarantee this, it MUST fail the request
with 403 Forbidden."

The problem with the stricter alternative is that it forbids a server
from removing a live property.  E.g. in collection "drafts", the
property "draftstatus" (in some custom namespace) can be set by clients
and the server allows certain actions on the resource based on the value
of this property.  Therefore "draftstatus" is a live property. When the
resource is moved to the "publish" collection, "draftstatus" is no
longer appropriate as a live property at all.  May the server remove it?
