I think this is a good change, though I think it would be good for 2518bis
to explicitly note that this means UTF-8 and UTF-16, since the mandatory
encodings specified in the XML REC are not common knowledge.

I think UTF-16 use would, at present, cause multiple interoperability
problems. It would be very useful to add some UTF-16 tests to the Litmus
compliance test tool, to strt moving the community in the right direction.
