Hi,

Apologies if this is not the right list for this discussion. Pointers 
greatly appreciated.

The OS X WebDAV client appears to send the same request multiple 
times (on different connections). For example, it sent "PROPFIND /" 8 
times to my WebDAV server when I first logged in. Is there any 
reasonable explanation for this? Seems like an incredible waste of 
resources for both sides. Is there anything I can set on the server 
side to prevent this? Does anyone know the appropriate place to send 
feedback to Apple on this?

Thanks very much,


John DeSoi, Ph.D.
