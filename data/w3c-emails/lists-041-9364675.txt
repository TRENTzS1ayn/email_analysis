John,

The problem you described below has already been written up and fixed 
as Bug IDs #2929972 "webdavfs uses a different socket pair for each 
transaction" and #2986553 "statfs requests that might go to the server 
should be serialized" (I noticed the first problem a couple of months 
ago and the second a few weeks ago).

However, anytime you see something you think is wrong or can be 
improved in the Mac OS X WebDAV file system, feel free to write up a 
report. The correct way to send bug reports and enhancement requests 
for any Apple product can be found at 
<http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/>. The component for WebDAV 
file system bugs is "WebDAV FS" version "X".

Thanks,

Jim Luther
