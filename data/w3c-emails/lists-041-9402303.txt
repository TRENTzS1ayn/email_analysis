It appears below that Julian and I agree on most aspects of
this issue, with the only remaining question being "what kind
of URI should be placed in a DAV:dst field".

I believe that the answer will always be somewhat vague, and
of the form "a URI that the user can effectively use to
author (i.e. modify the content of) the resource".

In order to author a resource via the DAV:dst URI,
minimally, you have to locate the resource (i.e. the
URI must be a URL), but further, you then need to be
able to modify/author that resource once you've located
it (but we don't have an acronym for an "authorable resource").

I also believe that it would be valuable to have a standard
property that identifies a URN for a resource, and that is
one goal of the binding spec (which we should be able to finish
up as soon as we have the ACL spec wrapped up).  In particular,
the binding spec introduces the DAV:urn property for this purpose.

I wouldn't want the DAV:source property confused with the DAV:urn
property.

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree, as long as the wording makes clear what is meant.

I don't buy that. You seem to argue that if a source for a document is not
authorable (which actually is the case in my example), then it's not worth
mentioning it as source. I think this is wrong.

It seems that you now require the URL to be either a http: or https: based
one. What about "mid:" or "ftp:"? These schemes define locations, but do not
have a concept of "methods".

See Roy's comment in
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002AprJun/0183.html>:

"That is not relevant.  The resources might just as easily be ftp or file
URLs, or might only be authorable by someone with authorization or coming
from a particular IP address.  Identifying the source does not imply
authorability on that resource, nor does it need to in order to be useful to
the user."

I disagree with the attempt to (now) require the source to be identified by
a URL. It doesn't help the client at all. Even if the server firmly believes
that a URI has "locator" quality, it can never be sure that the client
agrees (== has the same resolver software installed). Except of course it
happens to be an http: URL.

Given an arbitrary URI, what is the mechanism I can apply to it to find out
whether it has the URL-property?

I completely disagree, unless you can describe a sane algorithm that makes
this decision.

Maybe this definition should be added somewhere...

Such as? Just because the spec doesn't define the *specific* behaviour for
GET, this doesn't mean that GET should fail. Do you propose to fail an
attempt to GET a representation of a VHR? If so, what HTTP response code
would you propose? 204 (no content) seems to make sense, but it wouldn't be
a failure code, thus the VHR *would* support GET.

So it can be any method? For instance, if GET on a URI returns 404, can I
say that the resource identified by "a" is "available", just because a PUT
on it would succeed?

So what happens to URLs using that scheme that happen to be already stored
in DAV:source properties? Would it be illegal for a server to keep them? How
would the server know that something it accepted in the past as valid URL
has lost it's URL property?

Yes. I didn't propose that interpretation.

It will still depend on the point of view. From the client's perspective,
it's really irrelevant whether the internal implementation has changed, as
long as the abstract resource identified by the URI is the same.
