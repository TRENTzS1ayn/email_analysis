I support Geoff's proposal.   COPY seems like a difficult species to
define, and what Geoff proposes below seem like the best definition that we
are likely to come up with.

I believe this definition will work in enough cases for the
implementor to be able to extrapolate what to do in those
multiple-representation cases (and I'll bet is very close to how
Xythos actually does implement its cross-repository MOVE).

In particular, I believe we have to say something to clarify the
distinction between MOVE and COPY, and that this would be a reasonable
compromise between "fully defines every case" (not achievable) and
"undefined" (pretty much what we have in 2518).  But I'm always open
to replacing it with something better!

Cheers,
Geoff

This won't work (in all cases).

The resource may have multiple representations (depending on request
headers), but a simple sequence of GET/PROPFIND-PUT/PROPPATCH will only
copy
one of the representations.
