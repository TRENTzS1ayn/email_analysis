"COPY should do the equivalent of a GET/PROPFIND followed by PUT/PROPPATCH."

I think *if* we say something like this we should warn that this may not
produce a new resource that behaves the same under variant handling (because
only one of possible multiple variants would be copied).

  Unless I hear otherwise, I'm going to mark COPY_LIVE_PROPS as resolved...

  Resolved: 8/1/02: COPY should do the equivalent of a GET/PROPFIND followed
by PUT/PROPPATCH. - MOVE should maintain the integrity of the resource in
that all live properties and behaviors should remain live and have the same
semantics at the new location as at the old location. If there is any doubt
"same" is defined according to the resource author's concept of "this
resource".

  If you'd like this changed, just speak up. :-)
