See, that's the issue. Whether you consider two resources to be the "same"
depends on your POV, and the layer you're look at. Consider the URI:

humanlanguage:en:HTML%20version%of%RFC2518

I just made it up, and it identifies an abstract resource. I can claim that
the following URIs identify the same resource:

http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html
http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/rfc2518.html

However, nobody will argue that this is the same type of "sameness" as
described in the BIND protocol. So, no, I wasn't talking about inter-server
bindings.
