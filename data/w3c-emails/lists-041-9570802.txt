I think "same resource" only works when using it in a very technical sense.
It won't when using it in the generic sense when identifying abstract
concepts.

RFC3253 counter example: DAV:version-tree report -- could have been replaced
using a DAV:version-set report and the DAV:expand-property report

Another one: why have the report DAV:locate-by-history if a
DAV:version-controlled-resource-set property would offer the same
information?

I'm not convinced: the set of bindings of a resource is *not* a quality of
the resource -- it's a quality of the collections that contain them.
Computing all binds can be *very* expensive (for instance and AFAIK, in a
plain old Unix filesystem you'll have to traverse the full namespace to find
all bindings).
