I agree that if PROPFIND MAY refuse to process a Depth:infinity
request, than it should also be the case that REPORT MAY refuse
to process a Depth:infinity request.  For REPORT, I'd also define
a DAV:error value for this condition, so that a client can tell
that it is non-support for Depth:Infinity that caused the failure.

But note that I think it is fine for specific reports to return 400
(meaning that the report by definition does not allow
the specified Depth), while other reports return 403
meaning that this implementation
does not support it, even if it the report is defined for
that Depth.

Cheers,
Geoff

Sorry for not being clear.

What I meant is that for the same reasons a server may want to reject
PROPFINDs with depth infinity, it may want to reject REPORTs with depth
infinity as well. In particular, I can use DAV:expand-property to simulate a
PROPFIND/DAV:prop, so it doesn't seem to make sense to change RFC2518 to
make PROPFIND/DAV:prop/depth-infinity optional, while requiring support for
an equivalent REPORT (DAV:expand-property).
