Not only deltaV clients may be able to distinguish, but ACL clients
could. For example, in Xythos WFS, when a file is copied the server
initializes the ACLs like a new file.  On the other hand when a file is
moved, the server copies the ACLs intact.

Xythos WFS also tracks access logs on files, and when a file is moved we
want to keep the access logs on it, but when it's copied we don't want
to duplicate the access logs, just keep the access logs for the
original.

Overall, the new distinction between MOVE and COPY seems more often
useful than problematic.
