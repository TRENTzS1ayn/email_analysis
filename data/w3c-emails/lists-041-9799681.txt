RFC2616 says: "http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [
"?" query ]]"

I can't find a definition of the host part.  It does however say "The
use of IP addresses in URLs SHOULD be avoided whenever possible (see RFC
1900 [24])."

So: 
 - Does the wording in RFC2616 require support for IPv6 for HTTP
servers? Or does it merely skirt the issue?
 - Does anybody have any idea how HTTP servers and clients handle IPv6
addresses in practice?

I assume RFC2518bis should update its references to RFC2396 to RFC2616,
which results in removing the restriction to IPv4 addresses only.
