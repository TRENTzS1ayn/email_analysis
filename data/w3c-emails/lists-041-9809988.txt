It doesn't say anything about it.

Origin servers don't see them in practice.  I think we enabled IPv6 
literals
for Apache httpd's mod_proxy in 2.0, but I haven't verified.  I don't
know about clients -- check the Mozilla port to IPv6.

2616 defines the http URI scheme (poorly).  2396 defines all URI.
You will need both references.
