It only says "literal IPv6 addresses are not supported". In no way does
it say, "a name which only has an AAAA/A6 record is invalid". If you
*do* want to do literal IPv6 addresses, the accepted form is
[host]:port, e.g:
[3ffe:8001:c:1001::c0ff:ee]:80 for my home machine. I'm running IPv6
servers and clients with absolutely no issues.
