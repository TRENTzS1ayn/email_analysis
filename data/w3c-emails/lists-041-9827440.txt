Host headers may contain IPv6 addresses though, clients will send these
(at least Mozilla will).

It looks like the URI parser in 2.0 doesn't know about the IPv6 address
syntax from RFC2372... a request like this fails with a 400 error:

MOVE /dav/a HTTP/1.1
Host: [feed::1]:8080
Destination: http://[feed::1]:8080/dav/b
