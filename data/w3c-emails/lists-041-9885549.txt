Proxies?




Hello Greg,

I was wondering if you had any info about how best to make use of WebDAV,
from a Windooooz machine,
over a Netscape Proxy?  Any recommended clients, other than IE and the web
folders schema?

It seems Netscape proxy's do not support WebDAV.

Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
