One thing you do NOT want under any circumstances are 
begin-transaction, end-transaction, and abort-transaction 
methods. That approach simply does not scale beyond a single
user, and is a performance disaster.

You absolutely need to stick to single method calls that can 
Perform Multiple operations on the server in a single 
Transaction. Batching up operations is a valid approach.

Transactions aren't that easy to deal with. That becomes
Even more true when multiple servers are involved. Someday,
WebDAV might get that far.

Transactions aren't new. They're decades old. The effort would
Profit from the decades of thought that has gone before.
For example, see the DMA standard for one approach. (But
remember: DMA specifies an API, not a protocol, and WebDAV is a 
protocol.)
