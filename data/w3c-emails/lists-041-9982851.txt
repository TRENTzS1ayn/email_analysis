Yes, it should appear.  All versions of the spec say it should.

A directory?  At the protocol level?  Or
just in the gui?

rfc2518 says there should be nothing.  rfc2518bis
(new spec) says there should be a resource.

rfc2518 does specify some odd lock-null behavior while it's
still locked, but neither protocol specifies any odd
behavior after unlocked.

Check at the protocol level to determine what's happening
there.  The gui might just make it look like a directory
even if the protocol is doing something different.

Let us know what you discover.
