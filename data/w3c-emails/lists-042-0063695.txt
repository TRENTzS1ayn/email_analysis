Hello Greg

Do you know if the proxy software 'WinProxy' by OSITIS supports WebDAV
protocols?

I'm having trouble getting .mac website features to work correctly through
an older version of this proxy, and will upgrade to the latest version (5)
if it supports WebDAV protocol. Otherwise I'll change to one you recommend
on your site.

Kind regards...
