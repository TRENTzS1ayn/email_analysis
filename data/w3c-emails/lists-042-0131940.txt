I've been looking into WEBDAV and trying to understand how we might make 
use of it. I've come up against an implementation issue that I have not 
been able to find much information on. I thought I might be able to get 
some enlightenment here.

The issue concerns the uploading of very large files over slower 
connections (i.e., cable modem).

Our web server has a default request timeout of 90 seconds. I know how 
to increase that. However, I heard some unsubstantiated rumor that 
increasing this very much comprises security. I have not been able to 
figure out the security implications of changing this value. I recognize 
that there are some potential Denial of Service attacks by allowing 
large files. A lengthly request timeout probably has some Denial of 
Service problems.

What considerations might be involved in raising the timeout to handle 
large files?

Is WEBDAV a viable solution for handling large files in these circumstances?

Thanks,

Jeff
