Jeff,

are you sure that the request timeout affects uploading of large files? 
Most
timeout values reflect inactivity on the connection. So the timeout 
would
strike when 90 seconds of inactivity are encountered.

When uploading large files, this timeout should not cut the connection, 
as
packets should continue to come, even from a slow connection, in smaller
intervals than 90 seconds.

Best Regards, Stefan
