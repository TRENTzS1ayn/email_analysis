Good catch.  I agree, 200 is best used when there's a body and 204 for
no-body successes.  Who knows, there may be minor glitches when a proxy sees
a 200 and no body (or Content-Length or Content-Type headers).

Hello,

The BIND method will return 201, if the bind was created and 200 is the
existing bind was overwritten.

In case of overwrite; wouldn't a response code of 204 better comply with
other commands in the WebDAV standard, e.g. PUT?

Best regards,
