Hi all,

I am wondering if somebody can reference me a practical statistic of
comparing the HTTP functionality to the WebDAV functionality with regard
to remote Web authoring. I'm especially interested about the rate of
speed, security, and flexibility. Any thing more is most welcome.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,
Bita.
