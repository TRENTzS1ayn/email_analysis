Lisa,

I haven't expressed my question correctly - sorry. By WebDAV and HTTP, in fact
I meant comparing the process of communication between the WebDAV servers and
clients compare to the HTTP ones.

I agree with you that WebDAV is an extension on HTTP and provide all
functionality of the HTTP, added some new functionality regarding the metadata,
access control, locking and so on. However, since there is more processing for
those new functionality in environment based on the WebDAV protocol, I am
wondering how much this would effect on the speed. Also many functionality of
the WebDAV can be implemented by HTTP POST method, Soap and so on ( as you
mentioned like Microsoft FrontPage). So if the security is the same and if the
speed may be low (not sure), why would the user choose WebDAV rather HTTP?

Thanks,
Bita.
