Hello, all--

I am working on WebDAV support for the 4Suite XML server
(http://4suite.org), and I am trying to determine, from a practical
perspective, how important it is to provide Digest authentication. Of
course, full compliance with the relevant specs is one of our goals, but
due to time constraints that is probably not going to happen the first
time around.

Anyway, I have been trying to find out which WebDAV products (clients
and servers both) actually use Digest authentication, but have found
virtually no helpful information on the Web. 

Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

Thanks in advance for any information you have.
