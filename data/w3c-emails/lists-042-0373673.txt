Are there any more opinions on the use of DTDs?  Has the consensus reversed?
I thought the consensus was clear way back when I made the change to move
from a specific list of children to the definition form of ANY (where
appropriate) plus a list of possible children in English rather than DTD.  

Originally, there was a lot of discussion that overall seemed to favour DTDs
that allowed both extensibility and validation.  FOr example:

Are we back to the idea of throwing out the DTDs altogether?  That would be
OK by me. Sometimes English can be more accurate than a limited formal
language.

Say, why do so many names on this list begin with 'J'?  Clearly Geoff should
spell his name Jeoff & I should change my name to Jelisa or something.
