Yes, we did. We also discussed this in January during the Interim meeting,
and therefore changed the syntax. Don't you remember? (I think by accident
you've been looking at the original proposal rather the updated one).

The client sometimes can be a library or a proxy/gateway that simply has no
knowledge about what *it's* client will be interested in. Consider an API
that offers access to dead properties of a remote resource. It will perform
much better if it's able to simply get *all* properties in one request.

Yes, that's why ww decided to extend "prop" instead.

1) This breaks RFC2518 servers (prop and propname are not allowed at the
same time) and

2) the client still will need to requests where before one was enough.


So again, here's what we dicussed in January and agreed upon:


---

during the WG meeting, we briefly discussed our allprop/include proposal
(see [1] for latest draft). Among the attendees (:-)), there was consensus
that a feature like this is useful and should be incorporated into
RFC2518bis.

A slight change was applied to the syntax -- instead of using DAV:allprop
with a specific include extension, the logic was reversed, such as:

<propfind xmlns="DAV:">
  <prop>
     ... named properties...
  </prop>
  <dead-props />
</propfind>

The updated DTD for propfind thus would be:

<!ELEMENT propfind (allprop | propname | (prop, dead-props+)) >
<!ELEMENT dead-props EMPTY >

(one advantage being that we're not extending DAV:allprop which is already
increasingly misnamed).

---

(see
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2003JanMar/0073.html>).

BTW: in the meantime I updated my original proposal with an appendix
describing January's agreement:
