I think it's important to retain some of the ordering constraints given
by the DTD fragments in 2518 - specifically it is useful that a client
can assume that in the response element, a propstat MUST be preceded by
an href.

Since a propstat cannot be interpreted without knowing which URI it
applies to, if this constraint is missing, the client is required to be
able to batch propstats in memory until the href arrives.  With this
constaint, propstats can always be processed on the fly.
