I think the new wording would be much better.

From [1]:

"Any HTTP/1.1 message containing an entity-body SHOULD include a Content-Type header field defining the media type of that body. If and only if the media type is not given by a Content-Type field, the recipient MAY attempt to guess the media type via inspection of its content and/or the name extension(s) of the URI used to identify the resource. If the media type remains unknown, the recipient SHOULD treat it as type "application/octet-stream". "

This sounds to me like a client MUST NOT ever guess the content type when it's supplied by the server. Thus the server should not try to guess the type itself, unless it happen to know it.

I think that is the same discussion. If we can agree on the fact that an absent content type is better than a "guessed" content type, this will automatically apply to those empty resources created by LOCK as well.

No no no. If the server doesn't know the content type, don't guess. The client may know more than the server. However, if the server starts guessing, a client MUST NOT try to guess on it's own. See [2]:

"The following are the key architectural points of this finding:

1. MIME headers sent by a server are authoritative. [Design choice]
2. User agent behavior that misrepresents the user or the server is harmful. [Principle]"

> What else needs to be said?

I'm not sure how interoperability is improved by mandating a specific content type. An empty resource created by LOCK doesn't have entity body yet, so the question about the content type is really moot. Nobody knows until such time that the client actually PUTs something.
