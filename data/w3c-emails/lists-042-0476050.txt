OVERLAP_5.3_AND_8.7.2: This issue is redundant with issue REMOVE_SECTION_5.3.  Section 5.3 is removed so this issue must also be closed.

XML_LANG_CLARIFY: This issue can be marked as "inBis" if not CLOSED.  I believe the current language arouses no further objections:
"XML's support for multiple human languages, using the ???xml:lang??? attribute, handles cases where the same character set is employed by multiple human languages. Note that xml:lang scope is recursive, so a xml:lang attribute on any element containing a property name element applies to the property value unless it has been overridden by a more locally scoped attribute."

COPY_LIVE_PROPS:  This issue can be marked as "inBis" if not CLOSED.  A "COPY/MOVE behaviour" section was added to each property definition in 03 and changes made to section 8.10, and there have been no objections to this.

302_AND_MULTISTATUS: This issue can be marked as "inBis" if not CLOSED.  Section 12 of draft -03 contains an explanation of how the Location header may appear on a Multistatus response and how the client must handle that.
