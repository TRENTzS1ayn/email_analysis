Agreed. We should close this after the next draft is submitted and everybody had a chance to look at it (unless it didn't change since -03 in case we can do that right now).

Agreed.

Agreed (note that the Terminology section indeed defines "null resource").

> CONSISTENCY:  The issue is described as "Disagreement over 
> whether a DAV URI namespace needs to be consistent."  Roy

I think 5.1 is sufficiently clear, so mark this one as closed.
