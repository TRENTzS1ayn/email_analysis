Sorry, I was sufficiently clear which were changed in 03.  The null resource definition will be deleted in draft 04 -- I only got around to that recently.  All the other changes were made in 03 and I currently do not have plans to change that text in 04.

Obviously I'm working on 04 this weekend.  I plan to submit the draft by the draft deadline if not before.  

Lisa
