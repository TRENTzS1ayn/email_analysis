It doesn't say anything specific about MKCOL and redirects. Or am I missing something?

Speaking of which: section 12.1 talks only about 302 and 303 in Multistatus. It should talk about all 3xx codes, in particular 301.

Agreed.

Agreed.

I think Roy has made a very good point about clients that do DELETE and are not aware of 207 being a valid (error) code for DELETE. Thus my proposal is not to use 207 when the operation did not entirely succeed, but instead use a 4xx code (keeping the multistatus response body). I think at this point there are only few clients which will actually properly process a 207 on DELETE, and those can probably easily upgraded.
