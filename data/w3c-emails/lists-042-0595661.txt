I'd suggest that we start with a generic statement that DTD implied
ordering is to be ignored, but that the definition of a particular
element can explicitly declare that ordering matters. 

WRT this particular case, I don't think that the amount of memory/time
required on the client to read in the propstat before knowing what
URL it is for is significant enough to matter (but like Julian,
I don't care strongly either way, so I wouldn't object if the consensus
is to make ordering matter in this particular element).

Cheers,
Geoff
