Hi,

In this respect the -03 language doesn't make them uncompliant, just 
weakly compliant, IMO.

I don't see this as a problem and think it would be a good idea all 
around for mod_dav and IIS to upgrade and support ETags.

Agreed.

>IF the language must be weakened, is there any point to this at all?  I'm afraid we've got to make a hard choice.  Either we do something real to encourage ETag support, even though it makes existing servers "uncompliant".  Or we do nothing, and we leave the problem unmitigated.

I wish there was something stronger than SHOULD and weaker than MUST, 
something along the lines of 'REALLY, REALLY SHOULD'...  :-) 
 Personally, I'm in favor of MUST, even with the difficulties it would 
create - growing pains are temporary and, as has been pointed out on 
several occasions, the benefits to both client authors and end users are 
clear.

Side note: Correct me if I'm wrong, but generating strong ETags just 
doesn't seem all that difficult to me...


Cheers,
Elias
