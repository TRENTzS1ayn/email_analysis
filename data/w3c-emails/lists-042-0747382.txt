Obviously not an *official* term!  :-)  Perhaps another way to put it 
would be to say that they would be 'barely' compliant? The general idea 
being that if a server were to satisfy all of the MUST level 
requirements but not the SHOULD level requirements it could be said to 
be compliant with the spec, but just barely compliant.

I can't speak for the server implementors, but I imagine the issue is 
one of performance (as opposed to difficulty).
