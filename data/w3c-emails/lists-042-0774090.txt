Well it says 
"11.2302 Found
   Any WebDAV request may be redirected using this status code."

Let's check 2616
 - 201 can use the Location header
   Although in WebDAV a MOVE or COPY may create new resources, currently
   the spec says that the server should not return 201 in Multi-Status for
   these methods.  Is that sufficient reason not to mention 201?  If you
   think something should be added here, please tell me what.
 - 300-303, 305, 307 all use the Location header
   I'm happy to mention all of these.

Lisa
