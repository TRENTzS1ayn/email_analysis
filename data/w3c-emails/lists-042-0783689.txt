Yes, but the issue was:

"The specification is ambiguous on the handling of 302 by MKCOL.  It should explicitly state that MKCOL is redirected by a 302."

...so I was looking for something specific to 302. However I'm happy to resolve this by saying hat 302 considerations apply to *all* methods.

This being said: I'm not sure that I understand the original issue. An MKCOL request can possibly return a 3xx if and only if the request URI identifies an existing redirect ref resource -- in which case RFC2518 says that it should be a 405:

"405 (Method Not Allowed) - MKCOL can only be executed on a deleted/non-existent resource."

I think the difference here is that PROPFIND was developed as a container for multiple HEAD results (at least this is my understanding). HEAD will never return 201, so therefore hardwiring all success codes (2xx) to "200" is defensable. So yes, 12.1 should say that multistatus can use all 3xx codes.
