I think that's just a matter of what you mean by "support redirect reference resources". If it can return 302s, it knows about redirects. It may not support to *author* them, but that's a separate issue.

So what does this mean? If a client does a MKCOL on a URI and receive a 302 with Location header, what is it supposed to do?

a) consider this a failure, just as a 405 (resource exists)
b) redirect the MKCOL to the URI specified in the Location header?

IMHO, the answer must be a), thus the request is not really redirected -- it just fails, because the resource identified by the request URI already exists, and MKCOL is defined only to suceed on null resources.
