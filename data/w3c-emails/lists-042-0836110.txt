Why do you think the answer is "a"?  If the URL to which the
302 is redirecting the client is not mapped to a resource,
a MKCOL to that URL can succeed (privileges permitting), so
I would conclude that "b" is the correct answer (and therefore,
MKCOL acts like any other method wrt 302 handling).

Cheers,
Geoff
