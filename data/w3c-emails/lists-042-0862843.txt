Jason says yes.

Fixed (thanks for noticing that!)

In this case, http://foo/x and http://foo:81/x identify the same 
collection,
so of course a DELETE of a binding in http://foo/x will be reflected in 
all
other URIs that are mapped to that collection (e.g. in http://foo:81/x).
So this behavior is as predicted by the semantics of bindings.

Good point!  Fixed.

Done.

Currently, this is specified by DAV:locked-overwrite-allowed, but that is 
not
a good tag name.  I'll change this to be: 
DAV:protected-source-url-deletion-allowed.

Thanks for the careful review!  I'll send this off as a new internet 
draft.
