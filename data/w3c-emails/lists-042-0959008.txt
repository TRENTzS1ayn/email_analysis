What I hope to do is provide WebDAV-enabled sites to thousands of 
students and hundreds of faculty at our university on a very limited 
budget and without obsoleting investments already made, to wit:

o several XServe units running the latest MacOS X Server software 
(10.2.6) with includes the Apache webserver with mod_dav precompiled. 
See: http://www.apple.com/macosx/server/

o several MacOS X towers running the latest WebSTAR V Server Suite 
(5.3.x).  NOTE: WebSTAR V supports WebDAV with a very elaborate 
security model that is great for many people working on a single web 
site -- the conventional application of WebDAV.  See: 
http://www.webstar.com

I would like to be able to provide individual web site accounts 
programmatically in batched and on-demand formats using a GUI front 
end not unlike what is available to MacOS X Server and WebSTAR V 
Server Admins.

That this is possible is difficult to deny.  I now have several 
existence proofs as follows:

1) Sharemation (see: http://www.sharemation.com)
2) Apple's iDisk (part of dotMac) (see: http://www.mac.com/)
3) WebCT 3.8 and WebCT Vista (see http://www.webct.com)
    NOTE: WebCT Vista uses the BEA WebLogic server.  WebCT is a 
Courseware Management System (CMS) widely used in higher education. 
WebCT Vista has been adopted system-wide in Georgia's University 
System.  Interestingly, I see no mention of this at www.webdav.org in 
the way of an announcement.

FTP Servers offer this functionality.  Two examples include Rumpus 
(http://www.maxum.com) and the FTP client bundled with the WebSTAR V 
Server Suite (see http://www.webstar.com).

Clients will report the soft limit and hard limit warning messages 
issued by these FTP servers.

 From the client perspective, such functionality is needed in a way 
that **appears** to be integrated with the editing experience is 
desirable.

Admins need to be able to set pw criteria (# chars, composition, even 
checking pw history in a database) and enforce a pw change schedule. 
On the client side, users need to have the means with which to easily 
comply with these requirements/policies - a pw changing interface. 
Again, we seek only the **appearance** of integration from the 
client's perspective.
