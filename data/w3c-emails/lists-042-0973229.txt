That's not true.  If I create a URI scheme where the scheme name is
"http://www.xythos.com/storageServer/locktoken/", without registering this
with the IETF, it can still meet the uniqueness guarantee.

For that matter, a sufficiently long randomly generated set of characters,
as long as it meets the URI formatting requirements, statistically meets the
uniqueness guarantee.
