You can't create a URI scheme with that kind of scheme name. The scheme part
of a URI is the string before the first colon, so the URI scheme for that
URI is just "http" (which indeed *is* a registered URI scheme).

And yes, you can use these kinds of URIs for lock tokens.

How do you "statistically" meet a requirement?
