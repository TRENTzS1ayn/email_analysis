If your WebDAV server integrates with your directory service (LDAP, 
ActiveDirectory,
NetInfo, YP, etc.), then these accounts would appear as soon as the 
user's account
is created in the directory.  I do know of vendors that produce such 
servers ;).

Again, directory service integration would give you what you want.  
When the
user changes their password using their standard password change 
mechanism,
that password change goes into the directory, which of course the server
will pick up immediately.
