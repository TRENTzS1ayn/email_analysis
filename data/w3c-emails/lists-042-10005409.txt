RFC2518 isn't clear on this, but implementations definitely do return
multistatus in response to operations on single items.  It's a single code
line for the server, rather than two.  So the cat's more or less out of the
bag on this one.

Subject: non-collecton and multistatus response?


From reading the RFC2518, it's not clear to me that
if I'm using a delete method to remove a non-collection
resource, is it possible that server still returns a multitasks
response?
 
Is there a method that if my resource is a non-collection type,
I'll be guaranteed that a multitasks response will never be 
returned?
 
 
Thx,
