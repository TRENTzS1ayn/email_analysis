MessageLisa,

Then, probably the following statement in RFC2518bis needs 
to be reworded:


8.9 COPY Method

COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources

After a successful COPY invocation, all properties on the
source resource MUST be duplicated on the destination resource,
subject to modifying headers and XML elements, following the
definition for copying properties.  

Thx,

-Stanley

  You are correct, but this functionality hasn't been widely implemented.  It turns out the
  server knows more about what properties can and should be kept live on a COPY 
  operation, so the clients never provided this information and servers didn't need it
  anyway.  In RFC2518bis this has been removed.

    Hi,

    Maybe my reading of RFC 2518 is not thorough enough.  It seems to me that:
       XML elements are allowed in a copy method to modify the copying behavior.

    But, what kind of XML elements are allowed and how should they be
    interpreted?

    Thx,

    -Stanley
