I've only seen a couple people express interest in this new proposed
property.  
I'd like to know more to see a clear consensus:
 - Should we add this property, yea or nay
 - Should it be protected or writable (a writable last modified value would
be very useful to 
clients doing backups or migrations)
 - Who will implement it, if it is added to 2518bis (ie within a year or two
of its addition)

I would prefer a more general new property, e.g. DAV:modificationdate as
proposed by Julian some days ago in another thread (I added a few words
about *bindings* of a collection to Julian's wording): 

    "A proper way to address this may be to define a new optional property 
    (if we make it optional, we may be able to get it into RFC52518bis), 
    for instance: 

    Name:        modificationdate 
    Namespace:   DAV: 
    Purpose:     Records the time and date the resource was modified. 
    Value:       date-time   
    Description: The creationdate property should be defined on all DAV 
            compliant resources.  If present, it contains a timestamp 
            of the moment when the resource was last modified (i.e., the 
            moment when content and/or properties last changed, 
            or, when the bindings of a collection last changed). 
            This property is live and protected. The Internet date-time 
            format is defined in [RFC3339], see the ABNF in section 5.6. 
    COPY/MOVE behavior: This property value SHOULD be kept during a 
            MOVE operation, but is re-initialized when a resource is 
            created with a COPY. It should not be set in a remote COPY. 
    
    <!ELEMENT modificationdate (#PCDATA) >" 

Probably, w.r.t. properties, we need to clarify whether: 
1) changes to *all* properties ought to be taken into account for setting
the modification date, 
or only 
2) changes to the *dead* properties plus some selected live properties (e.g.
non-protected properties). 

I would go for 2). 

Regards, 
Peter
