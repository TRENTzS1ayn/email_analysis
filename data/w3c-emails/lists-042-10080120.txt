It seems to be a good idea to add these kinds of notes. Looking at your

...we probably should make clear what kind of behaviour indeed is ok 
according to the spec (to avoid implementers saying "but RFC2518 says 
it's ok to do this..."). For instance, changing the value of the 
Last-Modified header to an earlier value as a result of a namespace 
operation is something I'd call a RFC2616 compliance issue.
