I think it's useful to define this property, even if it's not widely 
implemented. For instance, when discussing the behaviour of 
DAV:getlastmodified (see previous mail) we'd be able to point to this 
description and say "this is what many people expect DAV:getlastmodified 
does, but it doesn't".

Regarding how to proceed: we probably would be able to implement this 
property relatively soon. It would be interesting to hear from the 
Apache/moddav people (Greg?), though...

An alternative approach would be to start a separate document that 
contains all the new things we'd like to see in WebDAV++, but currently 
don't want to put into RFC2518bis. This document could also serve as new 
home for an updated description of DAV:source, for instance.
