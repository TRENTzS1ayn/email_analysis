Yes. This, and: "we are aware of the fact that this was a mistake".

BTW: we want to do this because it seems that many abuses of ad-hoc URI 
scheme usage was indeed inspired by WebDAV.

I agree with the statement that "DAV:" and "opaquelocktoken:" are URI 
schemes, not URI namespaces. I'm *not* sure that I agree with the rest. 
"Instructions to Request for Comments (RFC) Authors" says in 
<urn:ietf:id:draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-07>:

       Any RFC that defines a new "namespace" of assigned numbers should
       include an IANA Considerations section specifying how that space
       should be administered.  See "Guidelines for Writing an IANA
       Considerations Section in RFCs" [IANA98] for a detailed discussion
       of the issues to be considered and the contents of this section.

RFC2518 does define several namespaces: the space of WebDAV property 
names, the space of WebDAV protocol element names, and so on. I think 
it's correct to mention that in the IANA Considerations section.

In general, I disagree. Publishing an RFC is actually the correct way to 
register a URI scheme.

As RFC2518bis is supposed to "obosolete" RFC2518, it should contain the 
same information. Quote from <urn:ietf:id:draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-07>:

          Obsoletes

             Specifies an earlier document that is replaced by the new
             document.  The new document can be used alone as a
             replacement for the obsoleted document.  The new document
             may contain revised information or all of the same
             information plus some new information, however extensive or
             brief that new information may be.

I like that except for "...are inconsistent with current best practice". 
The usage of a URI scheme name as a URI indeed does not comply to the 
URI syntax (according RFC2396, there is no such thing as a URI with an 
empty scheme-dependant part).

If we want to get really verbose we can also state that RFC2396bis 
(<urn:ietf:id:draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis-03>) is going to lift this 
restriction in order to make usage of URIs auch as "dav:" or "about:" 
legal 
(<http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/ietf-uri/rev-2002/issues.html?rev=1.55#014-empty-opaque_part>). 
But that's a future IETF document we probably don't want to wait for.
