I would be surprised to hear this -- I'd like to see what 
makes it unacceptable.  I agree it's not well specified, so to
believe it's acceptable means you have to assume that the 
definition for the DAV: scheme allows a null URI after the
scheme part.  But why would you assume that would be 
unacceptable? Most URI schemes require something after the
scheme name, but clearly DAV: doesn't.

That's a good point.  It *is* possible to create new URIs
under the DAV: scheme name, now that it's defined.  E.g. we
could have defined "DAV:deltav", "DAV:bindings", etc as
namespaces for various extension elements.  There isn't anything
written down, however, about how to construct valid URIs using
the DAV: scheme.

But that's a future IETF document we probably don't want to wait for.
