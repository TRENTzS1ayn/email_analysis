It should also be mentioned in:

It isn't an absolute URI because absolute URIs have non-empty 
scheme-dependant parts. It's not a URI reference either because it 
contains an unescaped ":".

Again - see the entries on the issues lists for RFC2396 and RFC2518.

No, no, that's incorrect. The syntax of "DAV:" URIs MUST comply to what 
the URI specification says (see above).

...because we are too lazy, and this doesn't seem to be an issue. What 
we *should* state is: only WebDAV WG standard tracks documents may 
define/use new URIs in the DAV: scheme (that's the "change control" part).
