Lisa,

My reading of this is the same as Julian's.  The URI RFC stipulates the admissible syntax of URIs, with a modest variety of flavors.  None of the rules currently allow "DAV:" as a valid URI form.  And the editor of their -bis document has accepted a modification that allows the empty part. 

Julian,

I think a bigger part of the change control has to do with use of a DAV URI as a namespace identifier.  Something similar should be stated in that respect, along with the condition on who gets to create URIs in the DAV scheme.  I think that means I am also aligned with what you say about defining the "namespace" in your other note with this subject line.

It isn't an absolute URI because absolute URIs have non-empty 
scheme-dependant parts. It's not a URI reference either because it 
contains an unescaped ":".

Again - see the entries on the issues lists for RFC2396 and RFC2518.

...because we are too lazy, and this doesn't seem to be an issue. What 
we *should* state is: only WebDAV WG standard tracks documents may 
define/use new URIs in the DAV: scheme (that's the "change control" part).
