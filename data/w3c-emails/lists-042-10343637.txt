 Technical Summary
   
   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, 
   properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the 
   WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client 
   to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server 
   whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as 
   HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given 
   principal. A lightweight representation of principals as Web 
   resources supports integration of a wide range of user management 
   repositories. Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of 
   principals using human names.
