Yeah! After over five years of work, we now have an access control protocol
standard.

Many thanks are due to Julian Reschke, Geoff Clemm, and Eric Sedlar for
pushing this draft through to completion. Additionally, there have been
many, many people over the years who have contributed to this specification
through direct work, list messages, implementation experience, reading
drafts, etc. Most of these are captured in the acknowledgements of this
draft (let me know if you think there are any omissions) -- my sincere
gratitude to everyone who has contributed.

There were many times when I didn't think this draft would *ever* see RFC
status, and so it's very gratifying that this important piece of the WebDAV
protocol architecture is now complete. We now have the basis for
interoperable access control across a wide range of client applications,
opening up WebDAV servers for many new kinds of applications.

Let's now turn our attention to DASL and bindings, and finish the final
pieces of the WebDAV protocol suite.
