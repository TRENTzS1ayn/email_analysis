The WebDAV community also had a milestone of a different sort this week,
with the publication of the first book dedicated to WebDAV. It's titled,
"WebDAV: Next-Generation Collaborative Web Authoring,"
by our WG Co-Chair, Lisa Dusseault.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130652083/

The book is published by Prentice-Hall, and is 544 pages long. It describes
the WebDAV and DeltaV protocols, and gives examples of how to write WebDAV
applications. There are currently no other books available that describe the
WebDAV protocol as thoroughly.

Congratulations, Lisa, on the successful completion of this challenging
project!
