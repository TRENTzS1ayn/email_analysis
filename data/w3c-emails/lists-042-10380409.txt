1) PROPFIND never returns a 200 code.

2) If a method returns 207, the content type MUST be */xml, and the 
response must have a DAV:multistatus root element.

3) Servers *may* return a */xml response for 4xx and 5xx status codes, 
in which case a client can test for a DAV:error root element or a 
DAV:multistatus element to extract more information.
