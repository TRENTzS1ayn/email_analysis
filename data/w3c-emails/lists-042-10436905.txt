I'll not be able to attend the meeting, but here's a status update on 
redirect refs...:

- the latest submitted draft is 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-06.html> 
(October 2003)

- the latest edits are here: 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-latest.html>

The main remaining issues are listed at after the TOC:

- get rid of MKRESOURCE if favor of a simpler method that can only 
create redirect reference resources; this should also allow to *update* 
redirect reference resources (with a new target)

- allow authoring of 301s as well,

- finish the synchronization between RFC2518bis and the redirect ref 
spec on how PROPFIND should behave when a collection contains redirect 
references

- almost all other issues are editorial or about terminology -- 
proposals how to resolve these (replacement text!) are welcome

Another issue that's not listed yer:

- COPY applied to a collection containing redirect refs currently is 
specified not to copy the redirects (unless the client explicitly 
specifies that using "Apply-To-Redirect-Ref"). Thus, non-redirect-ref 
aware clients will always get a 207 (that is, only a partial success) 
when attempting the COPY. We should consider allowing he COPY to succeed 
if the server is able to recreate an equivalent redirect reference at 
the target.

Note that I sent an issues list one week ago 
(<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2003OctDec/0140.html>), 
I haven't seen any feedback since.
