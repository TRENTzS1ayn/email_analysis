I'd say almost editorial. However it would be welcome if someone who was 
part of the WG during the '2000 last call could make suggestions for 
replacement text (or alternatively state why we don't need to make a

OK, so we'll say that if a non-referencing-protocol aware client issues 
a COPY, the redirect references should be copied as well (instead of 
leaving them out and producing 302 status entries in the multistatus).
