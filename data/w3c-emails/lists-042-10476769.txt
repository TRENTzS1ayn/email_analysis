True. This is a simplification that works well as long as the quota is 
not authorable. If it becomes authorable (by means of this additional 
property), there's a big issue because the behavior of the server 
becomes completely unpredictable.

Nope. Somewhere on page 3 it says:

"Note that there may be a number of distinct but overlapping limits, 
which may even include physical media limits."

(wouldn't it be nice to have section numbers?)

Please.

Change:

     None of these properties need be returned in a <DAV:allprop> request
     though the server may include them.  However, these property names
     MUST be returned in a <DAV:propname> request for a resource that
     supports the properties, except in the case of infinite limits which
     are explained below.

to

"A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the properties 
defined by this document."

(or just refer to RFC3253, section 3.11)
