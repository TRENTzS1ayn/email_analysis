Frank, essentially what you're saying is that quotas are a good thing. I 
don't think anybody disagrees. As a matter of fact, some WebDAV servers 
indeed support quotas (for instance, the Xythos server or (I think) 
Apple's IDisk server).

The discussion that we're currently having is how a server can *expose* 
quota information to the client. This has little to do with actually 
*enforcing* the quota (as the current implementations show). All this 
new protocol is supposed to add is

- an interoperable way for clients to find out about their quota situation
- and possibly a way to modify quotas from the client (although it seems 
to be hard to define an interoperable way to do that)

Regards, Julian
