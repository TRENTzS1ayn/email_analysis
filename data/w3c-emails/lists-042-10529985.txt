Obviously SASL support for HTTP is of wide interest to this group... please
let
the group (plus Alexey and Magnus) know if you can review this.

Hi Lisa,
Magnus and I are working on a document that adds SASL (RFC 2222) support 
to HTTP. We think we are close to Last Calling the document (currently
draft-nystrom-http-sasl-09.txt) and we are wondering if you 
could review the document (from HTTP prospective) or can recommend 
somebody to review it.

Thank you,
Alexey
