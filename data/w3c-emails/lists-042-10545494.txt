It should be simple to make things predictable by saying that the
server MUST (SHOULD?) support only one quota if it allows that quota
to be authored via the mechanism in this draft.

In practice, there is usually one important size limitation.  On a 
service like sharemation or Apple's iDisk, that's the quota.  On a
hard drive that's the drive size.  Even though in theory there may
be a size-limited hard drive behind a quota-limiting system, it won't
change how things work except in extremely rare cases.  And let's not 
design a system that is optimized for the extremely rare cases.
