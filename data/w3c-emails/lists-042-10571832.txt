I am certain I have said this before, though it was several years ago.
The RESOURCE IS NOT A STORAGE ITEM ON THE SERVER!  Failure to get 
straight
on that one bit is what causes webdav to trip over HTTP whenever it
tries to "author" anything other than a boring old file.

In this case, there must be two different URIs -- one for the resource
and one for the configuration of that resource.  That configuration
may be as simple as a URI, maybe a status code and a URI, or maybe even
an XML document -- that is what must be defined by the redirect 
protocol.
The actual URI which responds to requests with a redirect should have a
link to its configuration URI, such that an authoring tool can discover
the authorable resource that causes this resource to redirect.  That is
why webdav requires a source link in order to perform HTTP authoring.

The same principle holds for all dynamic content.
