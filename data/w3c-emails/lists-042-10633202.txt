Brian,

as far as I can tell, there's nothing confusing with what NFS says. The 
confusion arises because the quote spec

- marshalls disk limits and quota using the same mechanism (contrary to 
NFS) and
- the quota spec introduces a new property for authoring quota.

Why doesn't the quota spec just *copy* the relevant parts of NFS (all we 
  need to is map four property names)?
