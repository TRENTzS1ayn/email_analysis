Julian,

I'm planning to do so in today's meeting, but to restate for the 
mailing list,
Stefan pointed out that if we used quota-limit, then quota-limit would 
not be
a fixed value (which is the reason we defined things in terms of 
quota-limit
to begin with).  Thus, instead of quota-limit, the new draft uses NFS's
quota-available.  This has the semantics that it isn't fixed.  Problem 
solved.
Note, quota-available is consistent with the rest of the the quota 
definitions
we pulled from NFS, so it's conceptually attractive too.

I still don't know what you find confusing, so I can't comment on that 
yet.
