I agree on both counts.  Any help on making the example less confusing
would be appreciated.

I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying.  On BSD, for 
instance,
quota is specified per-filesystem.  Therefore, if I've got the 
following mount
points and quota specified:

     /home/briank/           # my home directory, quota 1GB
     /home/briank/mp3s       # quota 100GB
     /home/briank/video      # quota 50GB
     /home/briank/small      # quota .25GB

So here, the 'set' is a filesystem.

I presume the server would just not return DAV:quota-assigned-bytes
if it isn't set.  Hmm, that should be stated in the document.  Will fix.

The generic client should allow the user to change quota wherever
it can be.  It is up to the user to understand the quota model.
I don't know what else can be done.
