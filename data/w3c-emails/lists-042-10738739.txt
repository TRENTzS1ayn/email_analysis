On 8/4/2003, I asked about PROPFIND results in presence of bindings.  I
don't know that
that has been clarified.
 
On 3/8/2003, I proposed language for clearer requirements on DELETE
behavior. This applies to MOVE too.  The discussion started earlier,
3/4/2003 or before.
 
I believe I asked for more lock requirements -- what the server MUST do when
a client locks a binding.  I haven't found that email yet.
 
It's quite possible that the bind authors believe they've already dealt with
these issues.  If so, I'm unaware of the resolutions.

Like Julian, I have no memory of Lisa raising this issue on 
the mailing list (at least, not since the activity on the BIND 
protocol was resumed a year ago). A pointer to that email would be
appreciated, 
since both Julian and I work very hard to maintain accurate issue 
lists and to make sure that all issues that are raised on the mailing 
list are addressed.  There was a discussion in the design team 4 or 
5 years ago, about whether the spec should leave the question of where 
the state of a binding resides up to the server (i.e. is it in the 
parent collection, the child resource, or both), and the consensus 
was that effective interoperability required us to specify where 
this resides, so that access control and locking behavior could be 
defined (i.e. was the removal/addition of a binding controlled by 
a lock/acl on the parent collection, on the child resource, or both). 
The choice of the parent collection was motivated by the use case 
of two bindings to the same resource in a single collection, and by 
the use case of different collections needing to give different names 
to a single resource. 

Cheers, 
Geoff
