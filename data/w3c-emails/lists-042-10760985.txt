I think this is the open issue that I mentioned. The proposal that I 
made two days ago 
(<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2003OctDec/0200.html>) 
should take care of the issue you raised.

In draft 02, BIND was rewritten to have both DELETE and UNBIND. As far 
as I can tell this took care of the issues from those who felt 
uncomfortable requiring DELETE to be atomic (this included myself). In 
the current spec, a server can implement DELETE non-atomic.

Interaction between locks and multiple bindings is defined in GULP, and 
as far as I can tell, the only missing thing is to integrate it into 
RFC2518bis, just like discussed many times (both on the interim WG 
meeting in January and the mailing list).

To summarize:

1) is open (it's the only open issue, and we're just trying to resolve it),

2) DELETE changed in draft 02, so please re-check,

3) there was agreement to do this in RFC2518bis -- if you think there 
are issues left with the latest GULP version, please describe those.
