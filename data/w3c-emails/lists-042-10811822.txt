I agree to that view on submitted lock-tokens. In this, GULP needs a
simplification.

It is advisable for clients to create If headers which are tagged with
the lock-root of the lock. However it is also valid to use the uri of
an indirect-lock resource in a If header. The lock-token should then
be regarded as submitted, too, otherwise modifications of the
resource would fail.
