Clarification: I confused "being submitted for LOCK evaluation" with the 
If header handling. So yes, GULP should state that a lock token is 
submitted when it appears in the If header at all.

However, this doesn't mean that for "If" header processing, lock tokens 
can be supplied un-tagged or with the wrong URI. I'm mentioning this 
because that would be a change from RFC2518, and I don't think we've 
reached consensus on that.
