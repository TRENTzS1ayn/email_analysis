Here's another thought. You could get rid of any changes to OPTIONS 
altogether by specifying:

A PATCH request with no or unknown content type must result in a 4xx 
status, and a "Patch" response header summarizing the supported content 
types. Then a client can simply submit a PATCH request with no 
Content-Type header (and no body) to get the list of supported types.

I think this would be a good simplification as it makes PATCH 
independant of all other HTTP methods.
