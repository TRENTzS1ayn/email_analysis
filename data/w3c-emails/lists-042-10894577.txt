The OPTIONS changes are as much to find out if the server supports PATCH, as
to 
indicate which patch formats are supported.  It's nice for clients to be
able
to discover all major optional features supported by the server in one
OPTIONS request, rather than trying features which might not work.

Here's another thought. You could get rid of any changes to OPTIONS 
altogether by specifying:

A PATCH request with no or unknown content type must result in a 4xx 
status, and a "Patch" response header summarizing the supported content 
types. Then a client can simply submit a PATCH request with no 
Content-Type header (and no body) to get the list of supported types.

I think this would be a good simplification as it makes PATCH 
independant of all other HTTP methods.
