Lisa, I pointed out multiple times that your proposals (both RFC2518bis 
and the PATCH spec) indeed contradict RFC2616, which says:

"If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is 
intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific 
resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on the 
resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of 
method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the 
capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test a 
proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof)."

Yes. Please stick to them.

I agree that it would be nice if the servlet spec would allow us to do 
something here. But it doesn't. If you feel this is a big problem, raise 
it in the servlet community.

However I feel it entirely unacceptable to add new "must" level 
requirements (RFC2518bis, section 9.1) when

a) this contradicts RFC2616 and
b) it clearly is impossible to implement for a generic Java servlet.

If you feel strongly about adding this to WebDAV, please discuss it 
first. However just silently putting it in without any prior discussion 
IMHO really isn't constructive.

Regards,

Julian
