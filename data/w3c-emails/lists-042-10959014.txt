Hi,

the specification is a bit unclear on what we are supposed to return in 
the case that a MOVE cannot be completed because request URL and 
destination URL are on different servers or are on different 
subnamespaces on a single server.
I would expect some return value that signals to the client that the 
URLs are on different "drives". The client could then try to implement 
the MOVE logic on the client side (eg using PUT to dest then DELETE in 
src).
Any suggestions?

Thanks,
   Helge
