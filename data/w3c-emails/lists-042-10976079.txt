Right now, RFC2518 allows both -- rejecting the request, or doing a 
"best effort" approach on the server.

The BIND draft (<http://wwww.webdav.org/bind>) clarifies that a client 
that really wants to move resources (keeping all live properties and 
resource-ids) can do a REBIND method call that is guaranteed to fail if 
a "real" move operation is impossible.

If a server wants to reject MOVE, that's certainly possible although 
existing clients may not be handling this very well. A 403 (Forbidden) 
seems to be the right status code in this case. It would be nice if 
there'd also be a precondition code for this case (Geoff, could we add 
that to BIND as additional MOVE semantics?).
