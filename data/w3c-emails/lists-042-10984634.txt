I'm not so sure about clients assuming "any resource under /".  Do
you have actual cases there?  For example, even though OPTIONS *
would return "LOCK, UNLOCK" in the Allow header for a WebDAV
Level 2 server, WebDAV clients don't necessarily assume that all
collections really support LOCK.  They can't, because for example
IIS 5.0 collections don't.  Other situations might arise when the 
principal-URL space doesn't support LOCK even if the regular 
resource space does.  So I think it's already well understood, that
OPTIONS * means only that the server may in some sub-namespace
support a feature.
 
I didn't mean to denigrate anybody making any points, valid or otherwise.
Perhaps I should be more clear: if this is a HTTP problem, it needs to be
brought up in the context of HTTP design (e.g.
http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/).
I haven't heard HTTP implementors (and there are many, many) outside
of the WebDAV WG complain about OPTIONS *.
 
Whenever WebDAV defines OPTIONS headers or bodies, WebDAV needs
to define their behavior in OPTIONS * as well as OPTIONS /specific/uri.
How could we not define this, when clients use OPTIONS * and servers
support it?

One of the problem with "OPTIONS *" is that it is easy for 
a client to misunderstand the scope of the "server" that is 
answering the request.  Commonly, a client will assume that 
it refers to "any resource under /", but this will not be 
the case when different servers are handling different 
resources under "/". 
  
So "OPTIONS *" is reasonably well defined in simple cases 
where there is one server handling the entire web site, 
but we shouldn't be defining protocols that only work for the 
simple cases. 

Note: It doesn't particularly matter if only a "few people 
on the WebDAV mailing list" make a point, if that point is 
valid.  Most people building web servers only read the 
WebDAV mailing list infrequently, if at all, and even fewer 
of them feel comfortable or have the time to post.  So we should 
make optimal use of those that are consistent readers and 
posters. 

Cheers, 
Geoff
