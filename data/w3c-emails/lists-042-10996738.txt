This paragraph specifically *does* say that the client can test
the capabilities of the server.  How are the RFC2518bis or PATCH 
proposals in opposition to this?

As you know by my disagreement, I don't see how this contradicts 
2616.  So I'm not trying to add this particular functionality to 
contradict 2616.   I've also pointed out that it's not impossible 
for an application that uses Java servlets, so I'm also not trying 
to break those applications.

As for discussion, we *are* discussing.  I-D documents *are* what
we discuss.  The IETF process is to submit proposals, that not everybody
may agree with, as I-Ds.  These are discussed and frequently change as
a result.  By the very act of publishing an Internet-Draft, I am being
anything but silent about suggested text, possible solutions, proposals,
and so on.

I appreciate your attempts to help gain consensus.  It is my opinion,
and supported by IETF practice in many working groups and by RFC 3160,
(The Tao of IETF) that publishing I-Ds with specific new proposals to 
discuss is a useful way to achieve consensus:

"Internet Drafts are tentative documents -- they're meant for readers 
to comment on, so authors can mull over those comments and decide which 
ones to incorporate in the draft."
