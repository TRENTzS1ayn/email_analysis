That's because

- RFC2518 doesn't require it and
- RFC2518bis has added it without any announcement whatsoever.

How would an HTTP implementor outside the WebDAV working group even 
*know* about that proposed change?

Fine. So please define that WebDAV doesn't put any additional semantics 
on OPTIONS *.

Only some servers support it (in the way you are trying to mandate it). 
And so far, I haven't seen a client using it for anything WebDAV related 
(for the simple reason that it won't work with all servers).
