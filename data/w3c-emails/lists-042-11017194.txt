I guess it depends on the definition of the server. Fact is

- the servlet spec doesn't support that in general,
- it doesn't seem to be supported by Apache modules (OPTIONS * on 
http://test.webdav.org doesn't list any WebDAV methods) and
- it doesn't seem to work with IIS (just tried and I got a 404).

So as far as RFC2518 is concerned, there is demonstratibly *no* 
interoperability for this, and I never have heard of any client 
requiring it. Therefore it doesn't belong into RFC2518bis.

It's impossible for a web application that is deployed on a standard 
servlet engine, unless it's mapped to the root (and the WebDAV WG has 
already stated that it's perfectly legal to have a WebDAV server 
implementation that doesn't control the whole namespace of a particular 
HTTP host).

Yes. I just wish it would be easier to do that for RFC2518bis. 
Up-to-date issues/change lists would really help. The only way to spot 
this change is indeed to diff the TXT versions of the internet drafts. 
Does it really have to be that hard???
