Ok, let's assume HTTP *does* require this (IMHO that on the other hand 
should be clarified on the HTTP mailing list). In which case for 
RFC2518bis, it's our job to actually find out whether there's 
interoperability for this.

I just tried both Apache/mod_dav and our server. None of them supports 
it. On the other hand, I haven't seen any client failing because of 
this. Thus, if any clarification is required, then it's to say that 
clients can not rely on anything WebDAV specific being returned by 
OPTIONS *.

It is with many existing implementations.

Same.

Yes. That's a known defect in DeltaV, therefore the marshalling through 
OPTIONS has been deprecated, and live properties have been added instead 
(see issues 5.5_OPTIONS_BODY and 5.5_USE_PROPERTIES on 
<http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/rfc3253-issues-list.htm>).

Show me one.

Well. Servers not supporting it right now doesn't seem to be any 
*practical* problem. Could you please elaborate?
