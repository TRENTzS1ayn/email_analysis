1b) Would a server that does not list PROPFIND in the Allow: header for 
OPTIONS * although it does support WebDAV resources in some parts of 
it's namespace compliant?

I guess this depends of what support for "OPTIONS *" actually means, and 
this is something the HTTP mailing list can hopefully clarify.

Servers:

- Apache/mod_dav doesn't list PROPFIND in the Allow header
- Nor does Apache/Tomcat (with the default webdav servlet installation)
- Nor does SAP Enterprise Portal Server

Clients:

- none of the clients I'm aware of relies on "OPTIONS *" returning 
anything WebDAV-specific (this includes Microsoft clients, various Adobe 
clients, MacOsX, our own and others).

Re: "OPTIONS /"? What does it use it for? Seems to be nothing essential, 
otherwise it wouldn't work with our server (which it does).
