I vigorously agree with Julian here.  Each significant change (addition,
deletion, modification) to RFC2518bis should be preceded by an
email with that proposed change, and then should be documented in the 
issues
list with a pointer to that email message(and marked as OPEN, until
the change has been accepted by consensus, or at least, if no objections
have been raised in a reasonable period of time).

A new revision of the I-D is a good way to see the proposed change in
context, but just publishing the draft is not an effective way to
announce or achieve consensus on a set of changes.

Cheers,
Geoff
