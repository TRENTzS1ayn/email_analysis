I think Larry has identified the key point here.  We should not be
using OPTIONS to communicate resource-dependent information.  So if
the support for a method depends on what resource it
is being applied to (which it usually does), then we should not be 
marshalling
this information via "OPTIONS *", but rather by applying the query
to the appropriate resource.

Cheers,
Geoff
