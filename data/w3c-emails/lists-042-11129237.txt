[maybe we got the method wrong, of course COPY suffers the same issue! 
the alternative to MOVE is GET/PUT/DELETE, not COPY/DELETE]

Well, MOVE is usually a cheap operation on the server and on the 
network while PUT is expensive on the network. So I would assume 
(without having thought through everything, I have to admit), that a 
code which signals the client why it couldn't perform the operation 
would be quite useful (something like out-of-the-namespace-I-process).
With the Forbidden code we do not know whether the request was rejected 
because of access restrictions or just because it is located on a 
different server, right?

Note that I'm assuming that a server is usually "dumb" and will not try 
to act as a proxy with regards to the other namespace (if it does we do 
have the 502 code to detect errors, if I remember right).

Doesn't make sense?
