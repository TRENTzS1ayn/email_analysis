There are 3 obvious alternatives to move one set of resources
to another location:
- MOVE (cheap, least likely to work)
- COPY/DELETE (more expensive, more likely to work)
- PUT*/DELETE (most expensive, most likely to work)

So a client that cares about efficiency will try these three
methods in the above order, until one succeeds.  So what use
would it be for a server to say "out of the namespace I process"?
The client will try the next method in either case.

So is there anything that a server can do to expedite this
sequence?  The only thing I can think of is to have the
server have a special error code for MOVE that says "don't try to fake
MOVE with COPY or PUT*, because I know those will also fail"
and a special code for COPY that says "don't try to fake copy
with PUT*, because I know that will also fail".

But I think the likelihood that the MOVE or COPY implementation
will know this is small, and the benefit of skipping those
attempts is also small, so the overall benefit is very small.

Cheers,
Geoff
