This hasn't been a problem in the WFS implementation.  The unusual
formatting is rare, and so users can generally search on "contains 
'text/plain'" and get all the results they need.  Sometimes it's 
not worth dealing with edge cases in a spec, beyond noting that 
they exist and noting that servers can easily normalize the value
to reduce the existence of edge cases.

However, I'm not sure how much of an edge case it is.  If it's been
a problem in practice, the 'media-type-match' syntax seems to be an
elegant and effective way to deal with it.
