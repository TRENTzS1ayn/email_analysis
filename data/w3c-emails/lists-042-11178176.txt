I thought the 502 Bad Gateway error was appropriate whenever it's
another server, another namespace, or another domain that can't
be copied to.  It's a fuzzy continuum, after all:

 - One physical machine may be able to copy to another physical
machine if they're in the same security domain and the software 
supports it.  Thus, docs1.example.com and docs2.example.com might 
allow MOVE between them.  If not, however, 502 Bad Gateway is 
appropriate.

 - Two domains might be hosted on the same physical machine.  Thus
if docs.bettysbagels.com and docs.joesjava.com are both hosted by 
the same service provider using the same server software, using 
virtual servers, a MOVE between them might be allowed.  If it's 
not allowed, however, 502 Bad Gateway is appropriate. 

 - Within one domain, two top-level directories might actually 
be mounted from different locations (different file storage servers?), 
and *not* allow move between. E.g. docs.example.com/nfs-mount1 
and docs.example.com/cifs-mount8 might not support MOVE between 
them.  I think this sufficiently meets the definition of "gateway" 
to make 502 Bad Gateway is still appropriate.
