Hi Julian,  many of us just got back from a 4-day weekend due
to American Thanksgiving.  I haven't had time to reread the bind
draft yet as you suggested.

I don't think that adding any text to RFC2518bis will fix the problem in the

bind draft.  It's not clear RFC2518bis will finish soon, or if it does, 
what status it will have, or how bindings will depend on it.  Unless the
bindings draft waits on RFC2518bis to finish, it needs to stand on its
own in this respect.

(As I've already said, I think all the language from GULP *is* in 
RFC2518bis.  I may have missed something and I'm happy to have it pointed
out, but due to the dependency issue, whether or not that's complete or
agreed upon may not be relevant to bindings status)

Lisa
