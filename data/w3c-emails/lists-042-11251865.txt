Are people happy with Lisa's suggested solution?  There has been
no comment to date.  Essentially, she suggests deleting the words
"it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of
the server" from the specification.

I'd like to get a draft issued.  Though I've tried for perfection
on my first try, my experience is it is likely that at least one
more draft will have to be done before full standard, as,
at a minimum, the chances of getting all the changes decreed by
IESG process changes right on the first try seems unlikely to me.
