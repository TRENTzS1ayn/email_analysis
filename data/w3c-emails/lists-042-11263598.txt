Subject: [Moderator Action] WebDAV and Japanese Language


Hi,



We seem to have problem when our customers are accessing our application
from a Windows 2000 SP4 system with Japanese Language Pack.  After the user
is authenticated and is presented with the 1st set of Folders, they are
unable to navigate to the second level of folders.  They get the following
error message: "The documents of this folder are not accessible. The reason
may be that folders are deleted or moved."



The user is accessing the WebDAV functionality using the File -> Open
feature of Internet Explorer (version 5.5 SP2).



Are there any known issues?  Is a fix or workaround available?
