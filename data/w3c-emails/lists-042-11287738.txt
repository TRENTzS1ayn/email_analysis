Well, I think I can agree with this. However we need to ensure that BIND 
and RFC2518bis actually say the same thing. So I'm in favor of adding 
GULP to the BIND spec *if and only if* there's a clearly expressed 
working group consensus on that this indeed is what RFC2518bis should 
say as well. Ideally, in identical words.

Well, GULP is the result of many mailing list members trying to come up 
with the best possible explanation of how locks work in WebDAV 
(completely independantly of the BIND spec, by the way). It's not only 
about what is says, but also how it does that. Therefore, I think this 
should be *the* normative statement, and that it belongs into the base 
spec. Let's just vote on it, I don't think that any further discussion 
about this will reveal any new arguments.
