I don't have a problem with GULP.  What I'm trying to do is make sure it
fits into the WebDAV specification.  Sure, we could bung it in randomly,
any section remotely related to locking.  Instead, however, I tried to

 - keep to the structure of the spec 
 - have the spec be linguistically consistent with GULP
 - have the spec be logically consistent with GULP

I'd still like to hear how this could be better, for example whether any
subtlety was lost in the way GULP was incorporated.

But if you think this is irrelevant and you want to call a vote, Jim can 
determine consensus.  Please indicate where you would like me to put GULP
into RFC2518bis.
