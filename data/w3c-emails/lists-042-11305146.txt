OTOH, we could put it into section 6, and then try to remove any 
language that's not needed anymore. Note that I'm not against keeping 
examples and extended usage discussions, it should be just clear that 
the few paragraphs of GULP are actually all that's required to fully 
specify the locking semantics. Having that in one single place instead 
of spreading it over different sections (Locking intro, LOCK method, If 
header) IMHO makes things a lot easier to understand.

Well, it seems. We have this discussion because you pointed out that 
BIND spec neglects to specify locking behaviour. If RFC2518bis indeed 
already says the same thing as GULP, there shouldn't be an issue 
(because it's supposed to fully explain how locking works when there are 
multiple URIs for the same resource).

I'm happy to make a more detailed proposal, but I'd prefer to make a 
base decision first. Jim?
