I haven't heard any objection to this, and I think it's a good idea,
so I'm going to add it to RFC2518bis as things stand.

and the recent mailing list discussion 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2003JulSep/0123.html>, 
I'd like to propose:

1) Deprecate DAV:displayname: clearly, we don't have interoperability 
(some servers treat it as a dead property with or without a default upon 
resource creation, some servers treat is as live property based on the 
last path segment). Clients can not rely on the property being present 
(mod_dav, SAP) or being writable (IIS, Sharemation?, Slide?).

2) As the RFC2518-stated intent was to provide a *description* of the 
resource (which clearly isn't useful when it's always the same as the 
last path segment after un-escaping), I'd propose to add a *new* dead 
property to RFC2518bis called DAV:description which covers this. All 
existing servers that support dead property (thus all RFC2518-compliant 
servers) will automatically support this property, thus it can safely 
added to RFC2518bis.

Regards, Julian
