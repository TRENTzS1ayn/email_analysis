Well, we've talked about that many times before, but anyway...

BIND does *not* introduce the concept on bindings (multiple URIs mapped 
to the same resource). This concept already exists implicitly in 
RFC2616, RFC2518 and RFC3253. In RFC3253, some operations even 
implicitly create possibly multiple bindings.

So if RFC2518bis doesn't already fully explain how locking and multiple 
URI mappings interact, it's RFC2518bis that is incomplete.

All the BIND spec adds is

- a method to explicitly create new bindings
- new methods in addition to MOVE/DELETE which are more clearly defined 
in how they interact with multiple bindings (so avoiding changing the 
semantics of MOVE/DELETE if a server implementer doesn't want to do that)
- error marshalling extensions
- discovery of the "other" bindings to a resource, detecting whether to 
URIs identify the same resource.

But again, the BIND draft does *not* introduce the concept itself. It's 
been here all the time,
