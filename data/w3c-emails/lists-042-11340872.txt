How so?

RFC2518bis implicitly included the concept that files had previous
versions (that you just couldn't happen to know about or view).
Still, when DeltaV added versions, it was reasonable and right
to add requirements on how servers supporting DeltaV had to MOVE
and COPY resources with versions.

The difference is that before the bindings work, bindings could
exist but weren't standardized.  One major goal of standardizing
a feature ought to be to ensure that it works the same in different
implementations.

So, if the bindings draft leaves it optional to servers how to 
apply LOCK to multiple bindings, then it's my opinion that the 
bindings draft needs to be fixed.  Even if we believe that the
required behavior is implicit in GULP, I'd like to see it spelled
out in the bindings proposal to minimize confusion and implementation
differences.
