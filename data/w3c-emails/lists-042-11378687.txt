Hi,

I have updated the "latest" draft at 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-latest.html> 
to include the editorial changes made by the RFC-Editor.

To potential reviewers: this is absolutely the last opportunity to 
complain about editorial issues.

Note that some of those may be rolled back as they seem to change the 
intended meaning of the text.

Julian
