Sorry that I wasn't clear.  I was suggesting that perhaps putting GULP in 
an appendix would satisfy Lisa's concerns about making sure it fits in the 
spec.

But I'm not sure that even that addresses the concern about 2518bis being 
slow to press and us not wanting to wait for 2518bis before we can 
reference that text. 

Perhaps another option is to create a separate rfc for GULP.   I assume it 
could be published faster that 2518bis and it could be referenced by 
multiple related documents without suggesting that it bears a special 
relationship with binding support.
