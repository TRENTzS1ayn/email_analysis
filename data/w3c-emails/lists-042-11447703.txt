I thought about that as well. How about a separate document called 
"Locking Simplifications to WebDAV" that

- contains GULP
- contains the locking clarifications from RFC2518bis (refresh, 
lock-token header, submission of lock tokens)
- contains the locking simplifications from RFC2518bis (lock-null)
- contains the locking extensions from RFC2518bis as optional features 
(DAV:rootlock)

This would become a Proposed Draft, updating but not obsoleting RFC2518 
and RFC3253.

If we can agree on scope and procedure, I'm willing to help writing it.
