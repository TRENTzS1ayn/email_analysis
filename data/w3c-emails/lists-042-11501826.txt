Just getting around to understanding this thread. I totally agree, the 
quota-assigned-bytes seems unnecessary and confusing.

On another note, I think there needs to be some clarification the way 
quota-available-bytes and quota-used-bytes work.

Example:

Initial State of Repository with a Quota management system:

                                                                  
DAV:quota-available-bytes   DAV:quota-used-bytes
         /A                                                     95MB     
                                     5MG <--- used for somewhere for 
something
         /A/UploadDirectory                      10MB                    
                       0

A new 5MB resource is created at  /A/UploadDirectory/new5MBFile:
                                                                  
DAV:quota-available-bytes   DAV:quota-used-bytes
         /A                                                     90MB     
                                     10MB
         /A/UploadDirectory                      5MB                     
                        5MB

Pretty clear, however, if there is no quota differentiation on 
/A/UploadDirectory, the current draft of the RFC makes 
quota-used-bytes, which is really inherited from its parent, 
incongruent with quota-available-bytes on the same resource. A diagram 
is in order:

Initial State of Repository with a Quota management system:
(quota system on /A only)
                                                                  
DAV:quota-available-bytes   DAV:quota-used-bytes
         /A                                                     95MB     
                                     5MG

A new 5MB resource is created at  /A/UploadDirectory/new5MBFile:
                                                                  
DAV:quota-available-bytes   DAV:quota-used-bytes
         /A                                                     90MB     
                                     10MB
        /A/UploadDirectory                       90MB                    
                      5MB

The sum of quota-available-bytes and quota-used-bytes is 95 on  
/A/UploadDirectory and not 100! Logically, if you get a request for 
quota-available-bytes on a resource /A/UploadDirectory and the quota is 
actually enforced on the parent, that you would essentially walk up the 
tree until you found an appropriate "mount point" based quota 
requirement. If this is true, the quota-used-bytes should do the same 
thing. Meaning, quota-used-bytes on  /A/UploadDirectory would be the 
same as quota-used-bytes /A if /A/UploadDirectory did not contain a 
more specific quota rule.

This is also an efficiency win for implementors. If an implementation 
has to support quota-used-bytes on an arbitrary URL, it is impractical 
to think that quota-used-bytes could be incrementally adjusted and 
would necessarily need to be calculated on-the-fly, which does not 
scale well for most implementations.

How NFSv4 handles this situation?


Also, under the "Notes" section, "What clients should expect" seems to 
have a sentence which is not grammatically correct.
"This allows the space used by /~milele/public/ to be as
     large as the quota on /~milele/ allows (depending on the other
     contents of /~milele/) even if the quota on /~milele/ is changed."

Regards,

Chris.
