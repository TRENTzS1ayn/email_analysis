It does seem to be confusing to people.  Do you have a proposal for an
alternative mechanism (or at least wording) that accomplishes
the same thing?  Specifically, a mechanism set the quota (especially in
face of quota systems like the one you give in the example where
quota constraints are inherited from the parent)?

That's just one example of a quota system.  As the draft points out:

    Note that this is only one example quota system, and that other
    quota systems are possible.

Do you think the text would benefit from having an example given using
a different quota system?  I'm starting to think that would be a good
idea.

The draft does not mandate any particular quota system.  IMHO it would
be a bad idea to do so.
