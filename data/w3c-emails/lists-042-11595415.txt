Finally, the definition of "quota space".

That was the implicit model of the original spec (when quotas were on
directories only).  I think this is a good simplification.

I have several problems with this.  First, I believe it implicitly 
forbids
soft-link type binding models.  Did you mean here only the binding model
spelled out in the current binding draft?  Second, it forbids quota 
models
that some vendors support (and have customers that find useful).
