A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
Author(s): G. Clemm, J. Crawford
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-bind-03.txt
Pages: 32
Date: 2003-12-15

This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating 
multiple bindings to the same resource.  Creating a new binding to a 
resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource.  
Servers are required to insure the integrity of any bindings that they 
allow to be created.

or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-03.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
