There are a couple of ways to go here:
(1) consider a lock token to be submitted if it is submitted with a
    URL that is directly or indirectly locked by that lock token
(2) consider a lock token to be submitted if it appears anywhere in
    the If header, even if it only appears on a URL that is not in
    fact locked by that lock.

Lisa's initial statement sounded like she was advocating the
second approach, but her last statement sounds more like the
first approach.  On the other hand, the last comment ("Otherwise
you'd get a 412 Precondition Failed") is incorrect, since only
one of the state lists need to match.

Either way is OK with me (although I'd probably have gone with
the first approach myself), but I just wanted to verify what
folks had in mind here.

Cheers,
Geoff
