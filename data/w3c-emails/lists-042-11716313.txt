Well, "updates" is the only type of link we *can* use (nothing else 
would create a forward reference in the RFC Index).

Besides, I'd say that it in fact "updates" RFC3253, because it updates 
RFC2518's descriptions for MOVE, COPY, DELETE etc in presence of 
multiple bindings. Thus, it indeed updates both RFC2518 and RFC3253.
