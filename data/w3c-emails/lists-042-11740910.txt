However, looking at 
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-07.txt>, 
section 2.11:

          Updates

             Specifies an earlier document whose contents are modified or
             augmented by the new document.  The new document cannot be
             used alone, it can only be used in conjunction with the
             earlier document.

So maybe we need to leave it as is...

Regards,

Julian
