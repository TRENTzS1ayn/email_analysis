Possibly.

In general, methods should ignore unknown headers. In this particular 
case of course, the Depth header *is* used for LOCK (just only when 
creating new locks).

So the options for LOCK refresh are:

1) server MUST respect Depth header, possibly changing the lock scope
2) server MAY respect Depth header, possibly changing the lock scope
3) server SHOULD ignore Depth header
4) server MUST ignore Depth header

As 4) is what currently everybody seems to implement, I'd propose to 
choose that interpretration and clarify in RFC2518bis.
