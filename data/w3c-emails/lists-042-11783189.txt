In the context of that statement in RFC2223bis, I think
we're best off just saying that the BIND document updates 2518,
and not 3253.  It just isn't the case that the BIND document
"can only be used in conjunction with" 3253, while this is the
case for 2518.  In addition, there really is no pressing need
to get a connection between BIND and 3253.

Cheers,
Geoff
