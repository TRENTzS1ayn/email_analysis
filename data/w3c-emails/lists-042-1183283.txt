Michael,

I think the assumption that there's a difference between "user-oriented
(HTML through HTTP)" and "software-oriented (WebDAV)" output is wrong in the
first place.

GET on a non-mapped URL should *always* return a 404 status (no matter what
the "type" of the user agent is). And it's perfectly legal to return a
response body for a 404.
