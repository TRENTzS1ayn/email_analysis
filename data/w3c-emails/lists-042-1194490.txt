The IE method of doing HEAD then PUT is a timing-dependent solution to
preventing unintended overwrites.  As such, it's about as dependable as
the rhythm method in preventing unintended pregnancies.

The recommended way to prevent overwrite on PUT is to put the header
"If-None-Match: *" on the request.   See for example
http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/.

This may not solve your problem because it sounds like you have control
over the server but not the client.  I'm confused by your statement that
the server is "correct" in this. I would think the server ought to use a
404 Not Found response, with or without a body containing more detail,
in response to a HEAD.  

I know Tomcat can be extended with a servlet to respond with a 404 to a
HEAD to a non-existent file (with or without a body).  Xythos WebFile
Server does this for example.
