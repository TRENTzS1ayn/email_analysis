We did. Basically the issues raised here fell into three categories...:

1) Specific problems in the spec (those have been resolved in draft 05 
that we'd like to last-call).

2) General problems with the reference model introduced by the spec: the 
BIND spec specifies a very specific model; and this is the model it was 
supposed to specify. There are other possible models that behave slighty 
differently. One of them is the redirect reference model (separate 
spec), another is the "direct reference model" (that was mentioned in 
earlier versions of the REDIRECT spec, but as far as I can tell, nobody 
was interested to work on). There hasn't been any new discussion on this 
topic since Geoff's and my answers, so I'll assume it's resolved.

3) Issues with the organization and writing style of the spec. BIND 
adopts the same editorial style as RFC3253; and as there has been only 
one WG member finding problems with that, it seems that there's no 
change necessary. If more people feel differently about that, please 
speak up.

That being said, the draft really should be last-called -- it has been 
in this close-to-be-last-called state for quite some time now.

Regards, Julian
