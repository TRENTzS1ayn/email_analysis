To me the above show some communication issues. It continues:

It seems Julian is talking about locking always being on the resource, 
regardless of what binding was used. This imply it is completely 
irrelevant what binding has happend, what URI is used etc to reach the 
resource. If the resource is locked it is.

Now, Lisa, you seem to either not agree with this view, or that the 
document doesn't specify this clearly enough.

Can you (Lisa) clarify?
