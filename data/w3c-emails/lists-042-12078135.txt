Correct. IMHO this follows clearly from RFC2518 (specifically the 
introduction of locking (section 6) and write locks (section 7))...:

"The ability to lock a resource provides a mechanism for serializing 
access to that resource. Using a lock, an authoring client can provide a 
reasonable guarantee that another principal will not modify a resource 
while it is being edited. In this way, a client can prevent the "lost 
update" problem."

"A write lock MUST prevent a principal without the lock from 
successfully executing a PUT, POST, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE, 
DELETE, or MKCOL on the locked resource. All other current methods, GET 
in particular, function independently of the lock."

BTW: at some point in the previous discussions it was claimed that 
RFC2518 uses the terms "URI" and "resource" interchangeably, and thus 
there was no explicit distinction. I disagree with that point of view. 
If there are places where RFC2518 is sloppy in this regard, we should 
identify those and try to fix them in RFC2518bis.
