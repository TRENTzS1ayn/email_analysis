In this discussion, I asked whether a user can UNLOCK a binding that 
wasn't
the binding where the LOCK was issued (these are both bindings to the 
same
resource).  One of the email answers was that the client software could 
always
use the "lockroot" element in the lock information to discover which 
URI was
locked and thus they could find out which one to unlock.

I find that answer unacceptable for two reasons.  First, 'lockroot' 
isn't standardized -- it's
only a proposed extension to WebDAV/RFC2518, and not all servers 
implementing
bindings must implement this proposed extension.   Second, it doesn't 
answer the
question of how server implementations of bindings MUST behave.
