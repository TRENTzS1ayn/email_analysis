Well, in fact the BIND spec says almost nothing about locks; so I'm not 
sure where you see the ambiguity. BIND doesn't in any way change the 
locking model defined in RFC2518; and that locking model is about 
*resources* being locked. So yes, if a resource is locked through one of 
it's bindings, the lock will be visible (and active) for all other 
bindings as well -- again, that's a basic property of the model; 
additional bindings give you additional access paths to a single 
resource, but you're always manipulating / discovering the resource itself.

If you can point to a section in the BIND spec that suggests otherwise, 
*please* do so.

The spec says in it's introduction that additional bindings just add 
additional access paths to the same resource, and that HTTP methods 
access the resource itself. Thus the access path doesn't matter, and 
UNLOCK must work on each of the bindings to the resource.

I think the introduction section is very clear about all of this:

"A method is addressed to a URI, and the server follows the mapping from 
that URI to a resource, applying the method to that resource."

What else do we need to say here?
