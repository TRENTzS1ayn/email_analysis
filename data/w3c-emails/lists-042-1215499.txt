Lisa,

Well, I usually just assume that Microsoft does it the wrong
way. This is a good, time-saving heuristic :-)

I am not familiar with that one...

Partially true, because I could change the server side.
Doing so would however bring other disadvantages. (Such as
having to maintain an extra version of a third party
component.) IE is over course completely out of my hands.
Also, there is no guarantee that the end user actually uses
IE and not e.g Cadaver.

See my previous response to Julian, which clarifies this
statement.

Tomcat per se handles non-existant files in the usual
maner. The problem is in the error pages, which are a part
of the servlet specification. (S. my email to Julian again.)
