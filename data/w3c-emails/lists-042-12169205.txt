Speaking of which, this seems to follow from RFC2518, section 8.9.2:

"A MOVE with "Depth: infinity" instructs that the collection identified 
by the Request-URI be moved to the URI specified in the Destination 
header, and all resources identified by its internal member URIs are to 
be moved to locations relative to it, recursively through all levels of 
the collection hierarchy."

...so it is defined, but RFC2518's introduction of the locking feature 
really could be more explicit about that...
