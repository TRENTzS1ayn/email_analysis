This could be read like a 'binding' can be locked. But it's the resource
I think we agree hopefully.

I can't see your problem here.
If a lock is on the resource and we tell that it doesn't matter
which binding we use to access the resource IMHO it's obvious that
this also applies to UNLOCK.
So I don't think the prose you want is necessary.
Or e.g. "UNLOCK like LOCK works on the resource." should be enough.
