Speaking personally, my concern here would be that if those 
clarifications were not
present, BIND behavior became non-deterministic.  If 2518bis was done, and
BIND pointed to it to solve that hypothetical problem, all might be 
goodness; if
it will not be done, on the other hand, getting the job done in the spec which
will be completed might be the practical way to go.

Again, my personal two cents,
regards,
Ted
