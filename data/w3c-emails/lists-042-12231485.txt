But, alas, locks need fixing beyond the scope of the bind spec. As one 
example, RFC
2518 is unclear on the interaction between locks and the IF header. 
This is the
biggest area of non-interoperability. Now, the bind spec cannot clarify 
the general
working of the IF header and fixing the IF header needs also to be done 
for
servers which do not want to support the bind feature.
