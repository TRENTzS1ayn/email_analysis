Currently, there is no standard WebDAV content for a 404
body, so you can replace that body without violating
the WebDAV standard.  Probably the safest thing to do is to
only substitute the error page if the 404-body is
empty.

I do see a tension here between what the server would
want to do for a "dumb" client (that just knows how to
render html, and does nothing interesting with status
codes) and what it would do for a "smart" client.  I
personally agree with Julian and Lisa that in these cases,
the needs of the smart client should take precedence, and
the correct error code (404) should be returned.  

Cheers,
Geoff
