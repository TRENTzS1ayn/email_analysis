The phrase Julian (and I as well, in a separate message) disagreed with
was "All the following questions must be answered in the spec, NOT 
just in email".

In particular, our response was: some questions are answered in email,
some questions become issues, and some issues end up causing changes to
the spec.  If every question on the mailing list required an explicit
addition to the spec, the spec would become completely inaccessible due
to its bulk.

Cheers,
Geoff
