Hi Antony,

Thanks for speaking up!  It's folks that aren't part of the
design team whose feedback on this point is most valuable.

I agree that comprehensibility is more important than
axiomatic minimality, but we do try to avoid duplicating
normative information from other specs, to avoid confusion
when those other specs are revised.

Were there specific parts about the BIND spec that you felt
merited/required additional explanation?

Thanks,
Geoff
