We talked about that in January 
(<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2004JanMar/0030.html>).

Primarily, it reduces the complexity of RFC2518bis, and allows us to 
both clarify and enhance locking without getting problems with 
RFC2518bis advancing in the standards ladder.

And yes, what's holding up 2518bis? The last draft was posted almost six 
months ago, to which I replied with a long list of issues. There was 
almost no feedback.
