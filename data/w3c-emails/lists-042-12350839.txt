What's been holding up RFC2518bis is lack of clear consensus -- or a  
reliable way of determining it -- on several issues.  When we're ready,  
we can reintroduce discussion on those issues and see if now there is a  
clear consensus or a way to determine one.

The most high-level issue is whether RFC2518bis is intended to be a  
proposed standard or a draft standard.  I believe this issue is implied  
by the proposal to remove locking from RFC2518 -- a change that big,  
even though it's a feature removal, may require recycling at proposed  
standard.
