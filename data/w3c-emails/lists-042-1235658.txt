I'd like to discuss these questions (hopefully not at length, they 
should be fairly easy to answer) at the Interim WG meeting...But I 
thought I'd throw out the e-mail so people could ponder it first.

I'm working on a project that is providing rich searching capabilities 
to DAV properties. One feature we'd like to provide is keyword searching 
behaviors for properties. Say, for example, you requested <foo:author> 
and the resource had <foo:author>, <foo:author_name>, and <foo:authors> 
the server's response would contain all of these properties.

It appears that clients should expect to get fewer properties than they 
request and I would assume they'd accept more but I'd like to get the 
opinion of the community to ensure that we aren't doing something to 
break the protocol.

Second question, can a server respond to a PROPFIND for a particular 
property with multiple values for that property?

Thirdly, if a property has a rich XML structure as it's value, we'd like 
to return any matching XML tag in that structure.  (So if the 
<foo:authors> tag contained <foo:author>Chris</foo:author> 
<foo:author>David</foo:author> it would return all the <foo:authors> and 
each of the <foo:author> values separately.)

Anyways, see many of you next Monday!
