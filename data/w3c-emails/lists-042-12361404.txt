Lisa,

that proposal has been made *because* of the lack of process; not the 
other way around.

Locking has been optional in RFC2518, so there shouldn't be any problem 
whatsoever having a RFC2518bis-minus-locking going to draft. In fact 
it'll be easier because locking is the area that needs most attention.

That being said, what *is* your position regarding separating locking 
into a separate document?

Regards, Julian
