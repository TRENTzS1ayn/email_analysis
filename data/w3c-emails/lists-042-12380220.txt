I don't think it's a great idea to split out locking, but I don't think 
it's a terrible idea either.  It's not necessary to remove it, so the 
conservative answer would be to leave it.  OTOH if we were to issue a 
"WebDAV 100% required core features" RFC and a "WebDAV locking" RFC at 
the same time, then it's mostly a case of document convenience and 
perceptions.

The situation with locking is not that bad, as Julian pointed out 
particularly because lock-null resources have been removed.  We could 
simplify further if we think there are still complex or 
rarely-implemented parts (if header parsing being the most obvious 
candidate there, or remove shared locks).  But many (most?) clients and 
servers *do* implement locking, and do so successfully.  There's good 
interoperability.  It's useful.  Many clients routinely lock files 
while they're open and being edited.

Given the discussion so far, I fall on the side of keeping RFC 2518 
whole.  It's not an unmanageable size.  It encourages servers to 
implement locking if they can, which helps the clients that find 
locking useful, and is nice for such an important feature of 
distributed authoring.
