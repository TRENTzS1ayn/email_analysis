Well, Lisa,

you can't both say that you don't want to separate lock *and* then say 
that RFC2518bis is so far away that any new WebDAV client spec needs to 
clean up the lock mess on it's own. If you really think that BIND can 
not work in absence of lock clarifications, then you already accept that 
*some* lock-related work needs to be done outside RFC2518bis. And 
obviously, this work needs to be entirely compatible to what RFC2518bis 
is going to say, otherwise it's worthless.

Most of the voices I hear want to keep locking, although in a separate 
spec. Geoff and I have already volunteered to write that spec. The whole 
WG process is based on people doing voluntary work; so if you prefer to 
reject that offer, I'd like to see your plan how to proceed (including 
time estimates).

Some more comments inline...

Our proposal is to have a WebDAV locking protocol at "proposed" as soon 
as possible, then to issue a RFC2518bis (without locking) at "draft", 
and soon to follow with a LOCKING draft at "draft" (when we'll have 
actual implementation experience with the changes such as If header 
evaluation and DAV:lockroot). So we want to *speed* up the process, not 
slow it down.

That's correct. There are use cases for servers that do not need nor 
support locking, but locking is a useful feature, and it should be left 
in the *family* of WebDAV specs, just not necessarily in the base document.

So how about giving as an estimate for

- answers to the issues raised against the latest rfc2518bis (-05) and
- a release of a -06 draft?

Julian
