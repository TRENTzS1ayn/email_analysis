Well, it's certainly a much needed feature for editing in-place. Almost 
all servers
implement it, not the least because MS-Office clients use it.

Although DeltaV has much to offer in this area, there is currently a 
lack of
deltav-aware clients for general editing purposes. So, locking in WebDAV
will keep its usefullness.

As to the difficulty of implementation: the obstacles are there for new
implementors as the specification in RFC 2518 is weak. So most issues
are discovered and fixed during interop(s). There is a general consensus
among implementors how to handle them on the server side. It's
documenting this consensus that's lacking.
