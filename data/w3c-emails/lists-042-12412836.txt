Who needs locking? Apple's Mac OS X WebDAV file system client needs it. 
Whenever a file (a non-collection resource on the WebDAV server) is 
opened with write access, the WebDAV file system obtains a lock. The 
lock is held until the file is closed. If a WebDAV server does not 
support locks (i.e., it is not class 2 compliant), the WebDAV file 
system mounts it read-only.
