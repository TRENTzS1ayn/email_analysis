I am setting up a OS X Server and enabling WebDAV was no problem.

In my WebDAV directory I want to configure about a dozen different realms
with assigned usernames and passwords.

The OS X server manual does not come with any documentation to that matter
and I am unable to find literature.

Any hints?


Thanks,
Boris Bauer
