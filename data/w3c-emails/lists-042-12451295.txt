I guess I'd vote for Julian's option #2:

"Come up with a separate spec that updates RFC2518 and just summarizes
all that we changed or intend to change regarding locking (like
deprecation of lock-null resources, fixes to LOCK and lock refresh, If
header syntax, and lockdiscovery extensions). That would still be a
"draft standard" as RFC2518, but it would make things easier for
RFC2518bis as well, because all these changes would be written down in a
spec that came out prior to the revision, so wouldn't be "new" anymore. "
