No, it doesn't. As long as the error page isn't sent out with a 2xx status.
You can and should send out a message body (explaining the error condition)
upon errors (check RFC2616). However this doesn't mean that the status
itself should be hidden.

In which case it would be a mapped URL (in WebDAV-speak) which identifies a
"redirect resource".

That's plain wrong. I just checked with Apache/moddav (www.apache.org) and
Tomcat 4.x (greenbytes.de:81), and both return both a 404 status *and* a
message body for unmapped URLs.

If it does, it's broken. As far as I can tell, it doesn't.

I might if you can point me more precisely to that discussion.

In general, the response body that was produced upon error never should be
replaced. If there's a mechanism with canned, multi-lingual error pages, it
should only be used if the real server code didn't produce it's own response
body.

For instance, replacing the response body for 403 or 409 responses almost
certainly will break WebDAV/deltaV interoperability.
