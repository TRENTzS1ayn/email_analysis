We're talking about ... 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-acl-latest.html#PROPERTY_inherited-acl-set> 
and Eric's request on the ACL mailing list 
(<http://mailman.webdav.org/pipermail/acl/2004-April/001815.html>).


I agree that servers should be allowed not to protect that property. I'm 
not so sure about the best wording, how about saying...:

To stay consistent with other property descriptions, I'd prefer to 
remove the word "protected" but also to add...:

"Servers MAY implement DAV:inherited-acl-set as protected property."

I'll make that change for now; if people feel we shouldn't make that 
change they need to speak up *now*, as we are currently doing the last 
edits on the *RFC* document which then will be published Really Soon.

Regards, Julian
