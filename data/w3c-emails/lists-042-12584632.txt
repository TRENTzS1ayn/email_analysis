Are you talking about making this change during AUTH 48?

This is not a time at which substantive changes are allowed.

You will note that this draft has been significantly delayed in
publication because of the changes which were included during
the last round, including a need to return the whole document
to the IESG agenda for re-approval and a restart in the
RFC Editor's queue.  Doing this again will raise very serious
questions about the extent to which this working group has
reviewed specs sent to the IESG/RFC Editor.
