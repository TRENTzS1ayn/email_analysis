I reviewed the changes and I don't consider them substantive.  The 
sentence added that the property can be changed is on the borderline 
between "clarification" and "insubstantive change", as it doesn't 
change either client or server behavior.

There is a concern that this WG doesn't have as many active members as 
it needs to do careful review of new specs, but the ACL specification 
is actually quite mature (having been reviewed by quite a few people 
over a period of years) and has been implemented by more than one 
group, with some interoperability testing.
