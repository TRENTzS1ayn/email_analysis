It is not appropriate to make substantive changes to the document at this stage
of processing.  If this is a showstopper issue, you can ask the RFC Editor
to stop processing the document, and get the WG chairs to call for consensus
on the changes.  The draft will then have to go back through at least
IESG processing and possibly IETF last call.

Continuing to tweak the documents after they have completed processing
is hindering this group's ability to get a stable specification.  It is normal
to find things as people implement and deploy, but if you never issue
a final spec the number of people actually working with the documents
will remain low.
