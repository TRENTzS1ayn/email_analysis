Did you consider

If you do this upon PROPFIND/prop, that's illegal.

Upon PROPFIND/prop, clients should expect to get entries for all properties
that were requested (not more, not less), possibly with non-200 status codes
(such as 404 for property not found).

No. A property has exactly one value.

I don't understand what this is good for. It's certainly not-compliant
behaviour.

See you!
