IMHO, it's not a substantive change, and it's also not a showstopper. So 
if there's any doubt, let's not make it.

Agreed. That's why we want to get the spec published (finally). So if 
there's any doubt about a particular change, let's not do it. Note that 
this is the only change that I'm aware that isn't a case of bug fixing 
or updating references.

Eric, would you agree not to do it (after all, you did ask for it), and 
just add it to a future errata document?
