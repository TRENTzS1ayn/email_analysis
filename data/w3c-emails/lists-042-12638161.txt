Just curious why Element "property" instead of "prop" is 
used in the definition of Element principal:
   5.5.1 ACE Principal
   <!ELEMENT principal (href | all | authenticated | unauthenticated 
          | property | self)>

The content of Element "prop" is defined to be ANY with further
clarafication (RFC 2518):
   "The prop XML element is a generic container for
   properties defined on resources.  All elements inside a prop XML
   element MUST define properties related to the resource.  No other
   elements may be used inside of a prop element."

It seems to me that "prop" can be very well suited for Element
principal's definition.  Besides, Element "prop" is also referenced
in the definitions of REPORT's sub-elements.

Will appreciate your inputs!
