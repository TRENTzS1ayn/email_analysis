Correct.

I agree with this statement in that the server has to ensure that the 
principal submitting the lock token indeed has the "right" to do that. 
However I disagree that locks *must* be tied to an authenticated user.

That requirement IMHO simply doesn't make sense. It would mean that a 
WebDAV server can't offer locking on resources with anonymous access. 
Why would we want to *forbid* that?

Emphasis here (read previous paragraph) is not "authenticated" but 
"submitted".

I think this is what is currently being implemented; and there doesn't 
seem to be any reason to forbid unauthenticated usage of locks. If a 
server chooses to do that, why should that be forbidden?

Generally, locking and authentication are separate concepts. Of course 
servers *can* tie lock ownership to particular principals, but there 
doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to require that.

Maybe Geoff (who raised one of the issues) could explain?
