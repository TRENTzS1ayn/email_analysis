I c. I absolutely agree that using somebody else's lock token to get rid 
of the lock (did the other forget to unlock before leaving for the 
weekend?) is a completely different use case then *using* the lock token 
in methods other than UNLOCK (that is, in the "If" header). *That* is 
something we may want to clarify.

That still leaves the use case of a public resource that supports locks. 
I think this is allowed today, and actually is in use. We should not 
forbid that.

So maybe we should close the two issues mentioned, and add a new one 
specifically for this question?

 From my point of view:

- There are no restrictions on who a server allows to UNLOCK using a 
"stolen" lock token. It MAY restrict it to the "owner" of the lock, to 
the owner and principals holding the DAV:unlock privilege, or not 
restrict it at all. In particular, there's no requirement that for each 
lock token there actually *is* an "authenticated owner" (unless you 
count the ACL specs's "DAV:unauthenticated").

- On the other hand, submitting the lock token in an If header (usages 
!= UNLOCK) SHOULD be restricted to whatever the server thinks the 
"owner" of the lock is.

Does this make sense?
