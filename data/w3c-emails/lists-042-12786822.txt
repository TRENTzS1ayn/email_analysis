The last call is "aarrgggh".... well, how about removing "HTTP/1.1" from
the title so this spec isn't confused with a real HTTP/1.1
authentication scheme?

What are these new 235/236 status codes for?  They seem to be entirely
redundant.  Trying to redefine OPTIONS is still not going to work,
neither is the CONNECT-to-port-80 stuff, etc etc as per previous
reviews.
