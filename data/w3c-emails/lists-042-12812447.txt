Julian,

Great approach in my opinion. Locking is by far the worst thing about 
implementing WebDAV. I had no plans at all to implement it since my 
WebDAV back end already supporting all of the locking features I 
needed. But I was forced to implement it because some WebDAV clients 
(e.g. MacOS X) won't allow any writes unless locking is implemented.

Thanks for your work on this.

John DeSoi, Ph.D.
