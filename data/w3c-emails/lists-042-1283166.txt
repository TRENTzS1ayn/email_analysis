If you knew that all of your clients will just display
the literal string "404- Not Found" whenever they receive
a 404 status (and they don't try to display the response
body), then you'd be tempted to compose a nice error message
page, and return 200 to avoid the poor 404 behavior of
your clients.  This is the "dumb client workaround" approach.

Note that I do not advocate this approach, since that makes
your web site perform poorly with smart clients, but I
think we should acknowledge that there are situations where
violating the protocol in this way produces a better user
experience.

To repeat though, this is not something I advocate, and it
violates the protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff

I don't understand this statement.

If  the resource was not found, return HTTP status 404. If you want to send
descriptive text, do so, but do *not* change the status code. That would be
a bug, and I really don't understand what it's good for.
