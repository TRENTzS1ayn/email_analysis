I share Joe's concern with definition of 235/236 success codes.  They 
are unnecessary
and introduce a round-trip, and this makes SASL authentication work 
unlike Digest
(and Basic).  I don't see the justification for the change and the 
extra complexity.
Instead, when authentication succeeds, the response to the authorized 
request should
immediately be the regular success response, whether that's 200 OK with 
the body
of the requested resource, or some other success code, with the 
WWW-Authenticate
success header moved from the 235 (236) code response to the real 
success
response.

Joe, why is CONNECT not going to work?  Can you forward your explanation
for that?  Also, why is redefining OPTIONS not going to work (and how 
exactly
are they redefining OPTIONS?)

Ted, I'll forward the 1st para above to the IESG separately as an 
official last call comment.
