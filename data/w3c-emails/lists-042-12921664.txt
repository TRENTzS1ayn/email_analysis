Thank Heaven. As an observer, this was going in a terrible direction.

In fact, it seems that DAV gets increasingly complex all the time, without
apparent convergence. Furthermore, the server-side implementations outside
Apache appear to be withering away. As such it seems less like a W3C
standard and more like a private protocol for special purposes, owned by
the Apache working group and a few client vendors who implemented it.

Is WebDAV really a standard? I think not.
