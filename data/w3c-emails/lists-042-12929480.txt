I take that as agreement that locking should be moved into a separate 
document, instead of having advanced protocols (such as BIND) having to 
extend/fix RFC2518's definition of locks?

Well, it's a proposed standard, and many many clients and servers are 
using it. It's somehow "beyond hype", but that's not necessarily bad.

Our customers definitively use WebDAV intensively, be it for editing 
using Microsoft Office, for mass import/export, or as transport protocol 
for interconnecting separate servers.

Thanks for the feedback,
