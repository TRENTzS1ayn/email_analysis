Hi,

We recently ([1]) discussed removing the property registry from the 
charter. Looking at all comments, it seems that there is indeed 
consensus to remove it.

I also mentioned that I can create a "common" index file for 
WebDAV-family specs, which will include a summary of all defined 
properties as well. It's now online at

<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/common-index.html>

(scroll down to "P / Properties" to get to a list of properties defined 
in current RFCs and IDs; note that this index only includes documents 
available in RFC2629 format that use a consistent way to include things 
in their respective indices).
