Unfortunately, I think the architecture that "necessitates" adding 
235/236 requires a rethink.  It's very un-HTTP and ill-defined to 
create a security layer in this way.  We could try to have some 
discussions about how to solve this differently - Roy suggested one 
approach, and there are obvious variations.
