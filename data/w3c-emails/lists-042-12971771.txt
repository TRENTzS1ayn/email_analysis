> Hi folks,
> the final release of Slide 2.0 is available for download!
> The Slide WebDAV-server comes bundled with Tomcat 4.x / 5.x and is very 
> easy to install, because a new transactional file-store is used as 
> default store implementation.
> The 2.0 release also contains the updated webdav-client api and a simple 
> webdav commandline client.
> 
> So if you are interested, give it a try...
