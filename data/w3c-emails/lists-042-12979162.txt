> I have a question about WebDAV. We have installed it on about 20 Windows 98 machines. For the most part there are no problems. However, on a handful of computers, everytime you try to open the "web folders," there is a prompt for "Windows Installer" and then Microsoft Office 2000 Professional," which I don't understand because everyone here has Office 2000.
