I'm a little confused.  Which document are you looking at, RFC2518 or 
RFC2518 bis (and if so, which draft?)

RFC2518 doesn't support commas in the If header, which is unfortunate 
because it doesn't allow the sender to split the header up into several 
headers. Normal HTTP composition rules allow the sender to do that, and 
the entire header is reconstructed by adding in commas.
