Hi,

now that the ACL spec is published, we *should* create a new place for 
collecting spec issues (and hopefully their resolutions). For instance, 
this would include the last-minute change that in we end we did not do:

<http://mailman.webdav.org/pipermail/acl/2004-April/001817.html>

For me the simplest way to do this is to create a document 
"draft-reschke-rfc3744bis" (starting with a copy of RFC3744), and add 
issue markers to the spec itself. I can then automatically create an 
issue list document.

If there aren't any objections to that approach, I'll implement that 
sometime next week.

Best regards,

Julian
