Hi,

the issue...:

"Section 7.8 of RFC 2518 indicates that clients may submit a lock 
refresh without a body. However, it implies that clients could submit a 
lock refresh with a body. Server implementations have been disallowing a 
lock refresh with a body. It might make sense to codify this practice, 
and disallow submission of a body on a lock refresh.

Raised by Rickard Falk:

I'd like to confirm that we agree on

- a LOCK creation request MUST have a request body and MUST NOT have a 
Lock-Token request header

- a LOCK refresh request MUST NOT have a request body and MUST have a 
Lock-Token request header


Best regards, Julian
