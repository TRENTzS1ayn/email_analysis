 If a server's implementation decides to treat locks with depth of
infinity as depth of 1, what's the recommended way for a 
server receiving requests of locks with depth of infinity?

1) reject it and responded with detailed information
2) accept it silently
3) or others?

What's the recommended way for the servers to reveal the above
fact programmatically?

Thx,

-Stanley
