Adding to the confusion, I just find out that RFC2518bis-05 says it 
needs to be directly locked as well (well, I guess it *tries* to say 
that, see... 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2004AprJun/0115.html>).

Can we please make a decision *and* make sure that it's tracked on the 
issues list? An issues list that is not only out of sync but even 
contradicts the latest draft really doesn't help much :-)

Best regards, Julian
