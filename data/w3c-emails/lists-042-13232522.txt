Agreed, but it works (if it ain't broke, don't fix it). Why are we 
adding completely new requirements for both servers and clients with the 
inevitable interoperability issues if the present protocol does what 
it's supposed to do?

They could, if we clearly define how. So far we haven't.

Well, that would break Microsoft Office. I don't think people will be 
very interested in a spec revision that doesn't work with it.

IMHO the only thing we should say is that LOCK without a request body 
*with* an If header will refresh all locks on the resource identified by 
the request URI (possibly deprecating the use of the Time-Out request 
header here -- I don't think there's a strong use case for changing the 
timeout after the lock already exists; and as far as I know existing 
servers do not support it anyway).

Best regards, Julian
