We have been conservative about changes in RFC2518bis, generally only 
changing things where interoperability testing shows that there is a 
problem.  In this case, confusion over where to put the lock token in 
refresh requests came up in actual implementations and early 
interoperability testing.  In addition, it was unclear what to do if 
multiple lock tokens appeared in the If header (the Lock-Token header 
allows only one).  IOW, the present protocol didn't quite do what it 
was supposed to do.

It doesn't really fit our shared lock model (such as it is) to refresh 
all locks on the resource.  Some may have been taken out by other 
users.
