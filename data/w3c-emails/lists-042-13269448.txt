One problem is that popular clients and servers only do exclusive 
locks, so current practice is not sufficient to answer the unanswered 
questions in RFC2518.  We could cut shared locks from WebDAV, require 
that only one resource's lock may be updated by a LOCK refresh request, 
and that would codify existing practice.  I believe that works even for 
collection locks since a collection lock may not overlap another 
exclusive lock.  So the new requirements would be something like:

  - The LOCK refresh request MUST address the resource that was locked 
(the root of the lock)
  - The If header on the LOCK refresh request MUST contain one (and only 
one) lock token, the token for the lock that is to be refreshed
  - The server MUST reject the request if the request-URI and token do 
not match
