I keep forgetting that, because it hasn't been done in interop tests, 
to my knowledge.  Here's what we'll need:
  - Interop test reports from a couple independent pairs of

  - Explanation of how servers refresh locks if the client submits 
multiple lock tokens in the If header in a LOCK refresh request
  - Any other clarifications necessary for shared locks...
