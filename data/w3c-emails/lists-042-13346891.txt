Hi,
first of all I want to thank Julian for his great work on the webdav
protocols. His page is *the* resource regarding WebDAV for many
developers working on the apache Slide project.
Now I want to decrease my popularity and ask for forgiveness in advance
by making the following proposal:
I'd like to add transaction support to the locking spec as described in
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wss/wss/_esdk_arch_webdav_transactions.asp

I know that this is thew wrong place for long term transactions as
everyone would prefer a method called TRANSACTION or something similar,
but as IIS and Exchange are using the LOCK method to implement
transactions, I'd like to see it in the locking spec. Maybe it would be
an idea to have some basic locking features (current locking spec) and
advanced locking (transactions)?
My personal goal is to achieve full Exchange/IIS compatibility
regarding  WebDAV in the distant future with the Slide project. We are
currently working on a full JCA implementation working with Slide and
hopefully with IIS/Exchange. As this is open source, everyone could use
this Connector lateron, if transactions are support in the "locking" way.
We have already implemented full exchange compliant notifications, but
this is a different story...

Regards,
Daniel
