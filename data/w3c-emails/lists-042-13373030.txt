I reading about the support for transactions at the URL included above, 
I also saw that MS has introduced 'WebDAV notifications' as well. The 
new methods they have developed to support this are SUBSCRIBE, 
UNSUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and POLL, and describe each as being a 'WebDAV 
method'. Note further that MS has also defined batch versions of COPY, 
MOVE, DELETE, PROPFIND and PROPPATCH: BCOPY, BMOVE, BDELETE, BPROPFIND 
and BPROPPATCH.

I'm of the opinion that these methods aren't and should not be described 
as 'WebDAV methods', for the obvious reason that they have not been 
developed by the IETF WebDAV working group. Unfortunately, I'm not sure 
what can be done about it either.
