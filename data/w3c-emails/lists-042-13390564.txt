Interested: sure.

However, given the fact that the working group seems to have trouble 
focusing on it's milestones (as described in the charter), I'd like to 
ask everybody to *also* help us to get these other tasks finished -- as 
of now this means BIND (then REDIRECT) and RFC2518bis (where I feel that 
we should try to resolve all locking related issues first in case we 
make the decision to extract locking into a separate spec).

Best regards, Julian
