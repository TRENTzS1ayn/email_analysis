Hi,

RFC2518, section 8.10.10 
(<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#rfc.section.8.10.10>) 
currently shows an example where the multistatus response body contains 
a DAV:lockdiscovery property...:

    HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status
    Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
    Content-Length: xxxx

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <D:multistatus xmlns:D="DAV:">
      <D:response>
           <D:href>http://webdav.sb.aol.com/webdav/secret</D:href>
           <D:status>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</D:status>
      </D:response>
      <D:response>
           <D:href>http://webdav.sb.aol.com/webdav/</D:href>
           <D:propstat>
                <D:prop><D:lockdiscovery/></D:prop>
                <D:status>HTTP/1.1 424 Failed Dependency</D:status>
           </D:propstat>
      </D:response>
    </D:multistatus>

The text then goes on...:

"Note also that the lockdiscovery property for the Request-URI has been 
included as required."

This seems to address a requirement from 8.10.1:

"The response MUST contain the value of the lockdiscovery property in a 
prop XML element."

(RFC2518bis-05 contains the same language).

Questions:

1) What's the benefit to get the DAV:lockdiscovery property in case the 
request fails? Shouldn't we just say that it MUST be returned on 
successful method execution and leave it at that?

2) Is anybody actually implementing this? Are there clients relying on 
it? (I don't think so, but I'll check). If nobody is actually doing 
this, we should remove that.

3) *If* we want to keep this, we'll have to think about that example:

      <D:response>
           <D:href>http://webdav.sb.aol.com/webdav/</D:href>
           <D:propstat>
                <D:prop><D:lockdiscovery/></D:prop>
                <D:status>HTTP/1.1 424 Failed Dependency</D:status>
           </D:propstat>
      </D:response>

After all, the "424" status is on the resource itself, not the 
DAV:lockdiscovery property. So it really would need to be....:

      <D:response>
           <D:href>http://webdav.sb.aol.com/webdav/</D:href>
           <D:status>HTTP/1.1 424 Failed Dependency</D:status>
      </D:response>

...and then we'd need a way to put in the DAV:lockdiscovery property in 
a way that doesn't break the DTD for the response element.


Feedback appreciated,

Julian
