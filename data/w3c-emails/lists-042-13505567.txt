Howdy,
Patrik Falstrom has let me and Lisa know that he
cannot dedicate the time to WebDav that he had originally
intended.  After some discussion with Lisa and Patrik, I have
asked Joe Hildebrand to take up the role of co-chair in Patrik's stead.
Please welcome Joe to the post; I'm sure he'll
be introducing himself both on the list and in the upcoming
meeting.
regards,
Ted Hardie
co-Chair, Applications Area
