Jake,

thanks for the feedback. This contributes to the picture -- clients will 
have to expect almost everything between 400 and 499.

At the end of the day, a revised spec should

- define specific RFC3253-like precondition identifiers, so that new 
software can precisely find out what went wrong,

- give server implementors guidelines which 4xx code to choose (in 
particular, we should answer that question whether "lock-token" 
contributes to the set of request headers that can cause a 412 
Precondition Failed),

- give client implementors guidelines how to interpret server responses 
(such as first check for DAV:error response body, then possibly fall 
back to generic HTTP status usage).

I'll try to capture this in 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-webdav-locking-latest.html#method.preconditions.and.postconditions> 
today.

Best regards, Julian
