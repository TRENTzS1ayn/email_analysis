One could argue that if this is what is configured in IE, this is what the
user should get. One the other hand, there seems to be an easy workaround (I
think sending a response body with more than 500 bytes length).

IMHO: no. If the process that originally produced the non-2xx status has
supplied a response body, it *always* seems to be wrong to replace it with
something else.

Now GET and 404 is a very simple case because WebDAV doesn't require a
specific response body (how could it?). We may want to dicuss a specific
mime type that a client could stick into the HTTP Accept header to specify
the response body type.
