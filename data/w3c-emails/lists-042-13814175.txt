I think RFC2223bis is plain wrong here and needs to be fixed. For 
instance, RFC2396 (URI) "updates" previous URL specs that in fact not 
only contained URL syntax, but also specific schemes such as "ftp". 
However, RFC2396 clearly can be used without the documents it's updating.

Hm. As RFC3253 speaks of bindings, and also introduces operations that 
create additional bindings to the same resource, I'd think that it makes 
a lot of sense to have that link...
