Hi,

there was an outstanding issue to replace MKRESOURCE by a less generic 
method that only creates redirects and does not overlap with PROPPATCH.

This was added in the current edits at 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-latest.html#METHOD_MKREDIRECTREF>.

The following issues remain:

- missing ability to update the target without having to delete and 
re-create the redirect resource (proposal: just add UPDATEREDIRECTREF)

- missing ability to create specific redirect types (such as those 
generating a 301 rather than a 302)


Regards, Julian
