OK,

the only open issue that's left (not counting the missing plan how to 
handle locking) seems to be

<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-latest.html#rfc.issue.ED_updates>

It seems that there was consensus to say that BIND does update RFC2518, 
while there's no consensus about the relationship to RFC3253. As this is 
a minor editorial question, I propose to just say "updated 2518" and to 
close the issue.
