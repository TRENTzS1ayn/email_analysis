I don't see why we couldn't require this (redirects created by some other
mechanism don't have to act the same way as redirects created by 
MKREDIRECTREF.

So we could/should say that the value of a redirectref changes only when
it is explicitly updated by a PROPPATCH of the DAV:reftarget property,
and not as a side-effect of some other operation such as MOVE.

Cheers,
Geoff
