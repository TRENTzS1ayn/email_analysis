That's exactly what I *don't* want to say, because in reality there are 
servers that have a concept of redirect reference resources, *although* 
they auto-update their target. This is completely consistent with 
RFC2616, and I don't see why the redirect spec can or should *forbid* 
that. I do agree that this behaviour may be confusing, and that it makes 
sense to discourage it, but we can't change what's already there...
