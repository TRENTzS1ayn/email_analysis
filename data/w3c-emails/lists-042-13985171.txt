Yep.

The thing I'm currently unsure about is how to model the different 
properties of a link (stability, response status). Several approaches 
come to mind:

1) different resource types (redirect-301, redirect-302, ...)

2) one resource type with extension elements, such as

   <redirect-ref><status301/><stable/></redirect-ref>

3) one simple resource type with the remaining information moved into 
separate properties (like it was proposed for the status).
