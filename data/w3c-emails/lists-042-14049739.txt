Hi,

when thinking about actually *implementing* this stuff, I discovered 
another issue here.

Take a server that allows Depth: infinity upon PROPFIND.  In general, 
the only way to implement this efficiently is to *stream* the 
multistatus response.  However this means that the server needs to 
decide about the HTTP status code to return *prior* to actually doing 
the recursion.  Therefore, requiring the server to return a 506 status 
in case there's a bind loop somewhere below the request URI will not work.

An obvious alternative would be to allow the 506 to be returned inside 
the DAV:status element for the resource the server refuses to recurse 
into.  Of course that would mean that the client essentially would get a 
partly incorrect picture of the server state.  However, I don't think 
there's any way to avoid that (except for rejecting all Depth: infinity 
PROPFINDs, like many servers already do).

Julian
