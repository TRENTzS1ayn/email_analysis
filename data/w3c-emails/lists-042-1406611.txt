I have to say that I disagree. It's correct that unknown protocol elements
should be ignored, but the contents of DAV:prop is one of the few places
where there *cannot* be unknown elements. Each child element of DAV:prop
identifies a property, so this has nothing to do with the extensibility
rules defined in the RFC2518 appendices.

Currently section 8.1 says:

"A client may submit a propfind XML element in the body of the request
method describing what information is being requested. It is possible to
request particular property values, all property values, or a list of the
names of the resource's properties. A client may choose not to submit a
request body. An empty PROPFIND request body MUST be treated as a request
for the names and values of all properties.

All servers MUST support returning a response of content type text/xml or
application/xml that contains a multistatus XML element that describes the
results of the attempts to retrieve the various properties."

I agree that this is a bit inprecise and should be clarified (right now,
most of the wording is in the examples which isn't a good thing).

However:

1) If a server returns more properties than requested, I'd really like to
understand why. In the example you posted back then, it certainly seems to
be a bug in the server. Does anybody really have a use case?

2) I'd claim that a conforming client may reject the response because it
does contain properties that weren't requested. So for the sake of
interoperability, servers MUST NOT return properties that weren't requested.
