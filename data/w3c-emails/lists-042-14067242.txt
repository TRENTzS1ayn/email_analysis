I can't imagine problems implementing bindings. I *can* imagine problems 
implenting *multiple* bindings to the same resource. That's fine. The 
BIND spec doesn't require servers to actually support multiple bindings, 
it just defines how these must work (and how they can be 
discovered/authored) *if* they are supported.

I do agree that RFC2518bis *should* remove any inconsistencies with 
BIND, where present. Note that one major problem was the definition for 
DELETE, which (in RFC2518) required to remove all other bindings to the 
resource as well. AFAIK, this has been fixed in RFC2518bis.

So besides the fact that RFC2518bis talks about "internal members" 
rather than bindings, I'm not really sure that anything *needs* to be 
fixed. Geoff?
