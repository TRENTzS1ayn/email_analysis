Hi,

the definition for DAV:href was "updated". Previously it referred to 
RFC2068, now it refers to RFC2616. This is incorrect because RFC2616 is 
about HTTP, while we need to reference RFC2396 (which defines general 
URI syntax).

Note that in WebDAV, the DAV:href element may contain non-HTTP URIs, 
such as opaquelocktoken.

Julian
