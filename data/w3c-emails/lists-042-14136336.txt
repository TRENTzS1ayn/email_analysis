Not generally. But there are other exceptions such as URIs that can 
appear in 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-latest.html#PROPERTY_resource-id> 
or 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-acl-latest.html#PROPERTY_alternate-URI-set>.

Only in certain cirumstances. So any element that re-uses DAV:href needs 
to state that if it isn't prepared to accept any URI (productions 
absoluteURI and relativeURI in RFC2396).
