Yes, according to the spec.

Clients: some. In reality, there are of course servers that do not 
support dead properties, and clients have to cope with that in some way 
(just give up, or try to continue without dead properties). As long as 
the PROPPATCH request is rejected in a proper way (such as "Forbidden" 
or "Not Implemented"), this shouldn't be a big problem in practice.

Of course it's *better* to support dead properties.
