I agree with Julian, and strongly advocate approach #1
(take locking out, keep bind out, make everything more modular, for the 
following reasons):

- WebDAV is already a family of specs (3253, ACL, redirect, ordering),
each of which defines an optional feature-package beyond what is defined
in the base spec.  It would be more consistent to handle locking
(which is an optional feature-package) the same way.

- Having a smaller "base WebDAV spec" I believe will make WebDAV more
accessible to new implementors, since the base spec will be less daunting 
in
size.  You don't have to read/understand the locking extensions to
understand versioning, ACL, redirect, or ordering, but the current 
packaging of locking in with the base protocol makes it look like you do.

- It allows us to make more rapid progress on getting the locking
functionality standardized (i.e. it doesn't have to wait until we've
resolved all the other issues in 2518bis).

Cheers,
Geoff
