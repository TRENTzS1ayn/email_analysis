Here's another idea.  What if we made locking required in the next
version of WebDAV?  Servers that support RFC2518 can always claim 
support for RFC2518 without changes but most servers support locking
anyway and wouldn't find this difficult.  For clients of course it's
no change at all.  Then WebDAV core would have almost no options.
