Just an FYI for anyone interested...

 

I worked through this problem with the help of the jCIFS list.  We
identified a couple potential problem areas, so I updated Davenport with
some suggestions there:

 

I made the following updates to Davenport as per Julian's suggestions (on
the jCIFS list):

- Removed Microsoft proprietary properties.

- Does not return unknown timestamps (0 value)

- Does not return unknown eTags.

- Does not return a content length (where the resource is a Share)

 

These changes allow the web folder to open properly in my XP client.  It was
in fact the getcontentlength property that 'broke' the client.

 

Thanks for your help.

 

Mike

Subject: Strange Problems (Davenport)

 

My apologies, as I am not entirely sure this question belongs here.

 

I am quite new to WebDAV, and have run into a few problems.  I've been
staring at this particular problem for quite some time, and am hoping I can
get a fresh set of eyes to have a look.  Basically, when I attempt to open a
web folder (using Davenport as the DAV server), I get the message 'Internet
Explorer could not open .Would you like to use the default view instead?'.

 

I have tried a slew of changes to the Davenport source code with varying
degrees of success.  In this example, the 'shares' share will not display
properly in a Web Folder view.  If I attempt to view a subdirectory as a Web
Folder however, the subdirectory will display properly in Web Folders view.

 

I am using Windows XP with IE6 (both fully patched) for the DAV client.  See
the listing below for the request/response.
