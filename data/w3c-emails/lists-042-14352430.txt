I would like to announce a WebDAV administration plugin for eclipse. 
It is called WebDAVPilot and runs as a plugin for eclipse 3.0M6. The 
usage is free. Following features are included:

*  WebDAV Navigator View: Tree view of a repository
* Display the standard WebDAV Properties in the eclipse Property View
* Property Editor: Editor for all DAV Properties
* Text Editor: Content editor
* XML Editor
* View for resource ACLs with edit support
* Version history view
* Compare current version with history version (Visual-Diffs)
* Restore version from the history
* Creation und Deletion of repository resources
* Renaming of resources
* Copy/Cut/Paste of resources in the navigator
* Image Viewer

The download link can be found here:
