Minimally, we should indicate that PROPFIND MUST NOT ignore
unknown XML elements.

I personally would prefer us to state that PROPFIND SHOULD
(or even MUST) only return requested properties, unless
someone can come up with a compelling reason for not adding
this constraint.

Cheers,
Geoff

Do we think we need to enhance the spec in any way?  Or is it clear enough
now?
