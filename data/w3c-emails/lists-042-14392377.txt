I'm not sure about what you're looking for. If you use MS Office, you 
can open/modiffy/write back resources on a WebDAV server out of the box. 
If the server happens to support DeltaV and autoversioning, this will 
work automatically as well.

For OpenOffice, there may be a few issues with autoversioning DeltaV 
servers, as (last time I checked), OpenOffice does not lock resources...
