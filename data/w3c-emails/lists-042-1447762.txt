While a WebDAV property's "value" is marshalled as a sequence of well-formed
XML. If a property contains a list of authors, it would be OK to marshall
this as

<foo:authors>
 <foo:author>Chris</foo:author>
 <foo:author>Julian</foo:author>
</foo:authors>

In this way WebDAV handles "multi-valued" properties.
