Hi,

online logs for the meeting just finished are here:

<http://www.xmpp.org/ietf-logs/webdav@ietf.xmpp.org/2004-03-01.html>


There was some confusion about currently open issues with the BIND spec. 
The current issues list is here:

<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-issues.html>

(and contains only one open issue regarding how to marshall bind loop 
error information).

The plan clearly is to resolve this issue, submit a new draft and then 
to last-call the spec. If people still feel that there are other issues 
with the document, *please* raise them *here*.

Regards, Julian
