Hi Jim,

I have the bug reporting URL you gave me a while back, but I don't see 
anyway to check if a bug has already reported (or fixed). So I thought 
I would mention it here in case you might know offhand.

With 10.3.1 I can no longer connect to a WebDAV server if I enter the 
IP numeric address directly (using connect to server from the Finder). 
If I enter a DNS or rendezvous name like mycomputer.local it works 
fine, but if I use the numeric IP address it never connects at all (no 
request in the HTTP log). The error message given is "The operation 
cannot be completed because one or more required items cannot be found. 
(Error code -43).

Thanks,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.
