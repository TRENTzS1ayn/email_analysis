There isn't any.

Here I disagree.

First of all, there are several ways to resolve questions raised:

1) If there is a simple answer based on existing specs and the current 
draft, just answer it here on the mailing list.

2) If the issue is likely to be re-raised (because the answer is not 
obvious), record it (and the answer) on the issues list.

3) If the issue is indeed valid, add it to the issues list and attempt 
to resolve it.

In general, there are areas where the spec *can't* specify how existing 
things work, because they depend on specific implementations. I 
absolutely agree that those situations should be avoided, but sometime 
there's nothing we can do about that.

I'll post answers to the specific issues in a separate mail.

Regards, Julian
