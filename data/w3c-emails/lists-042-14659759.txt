I wouldn't describe this as "standing alone" (since it clearly must
depend on RFC2616, RFC2518, etc.), but I agree that it cannot depend
on material in specs that have not yet been finished/approved.

As Julian indicated, we are not aware of any such dependencies.

The spec needs to describe how the new things it is
defining work, and it needs to describe any modifications to the
behavior of existing things.  But if it is layered above some other
specs (as the binding spec is layered above 2616, 2518, etc), it
should not repeat or reword behavior it is just inheriting unmodified
from those other spec.  Doing so would only introduce confusion
when the spec that does define the behavior of those existing things is 
revised.

If every question that ever arises about a spec on the
mailing list resulted in a paragraph or even just a
sentence being added to the spec, the spec would rapidly
become too bulky and verbose to be useful as a spec.

As Julian indicated, there are a variety of sources of information
that are used to help implementors.  The spec is of course a critical
piece, but the issues list and the mailing list are two other essential
pieces.

So every question gets answered in the mailing list.
Some questions get added to the issues list.
Some issues result in changes to the specification.

Cheers,
