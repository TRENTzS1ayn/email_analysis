The WebDAV WG and general WebDAV community owes a huge thank-you to Jim 
and this seems like an appropriate time to do that publicly. Jim led 
the first WebDAV BOF in San Jose in 1996, and gave a presentation [0] 
summarizing the design and coordination work he'd already begun to 
lead.  Since then he's gone beyond being a simple WG chair, supporting 
and encouraging the DeltaV WG, hosting WebDAV Interop events and 
evangelizing in many ways.  He has made significant technical and 
authoring contributions to WebDAV, particularly to the most difficult 
specs like DeltaV and ACL.  If we're smart we'll keep Jim involved as 
much as possible even if not as WG chair.
