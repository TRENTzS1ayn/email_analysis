We don't necessarily have to restrict implementations when we add 
clarifying text.  For example, we could say that "A VCR is more than 
just a binding to a VHR -- it has different properties and state.  
Likewise, two VCRs pointing to the same VHR don't always behave as two 
bindings to the same underlying VCR resource, again because of 
different properties and state in certain circumstances, such as when 
one VCR is checked out."

Why couldn't the source ETag be preserved in a REBIND, even if the 
destination resource is being overwritten?  At the least, the spec 
should say that the source ETag MAY be preserved, so that clients know 
they have to handle both cases.

The getlastmodified is a little more contentious.  Does it mean that 
the underlying resource body changed?  If so, then the spec should say 
that this property SHOULD NOT (or MUST NOT) change only because of a 
REBIND operation.
