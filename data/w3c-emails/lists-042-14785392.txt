Because RFC2518 allows servers to implement MOVE as COPY/DELETE, and 
BIND can't override that (when it tried, we got complaints from people 
who rely on MOVE working as it does).

However, the locking model we all agreed on (remember? -> 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2004JanMar/0001.html>) 
explicitly says...:

- If a request causes a directly locked resource to no longer be
   mapped to the lock-root of that lock, then the request MUST
   fail unless the lock-token for that lock is submitted in the
   request.  If the request succeeds, then that lock MUST have been
   deleted by that request.

So REBIND behaves exactly as the locking model is predicting it: a 
namespace operation causes the locked resource not being mapped anymore 
to the lock root, and thus the lock is removed.

Changing this would mean that the locking model needs to made more 
complicated (again). In this case, we couldn't talk about namespace 
operations in general, but would need to go back to special cases.

Unless there's a clear benefit from that complication, I vote with "no".

Again, this is incompatible with HTTP semantics for the Last-Modified 
header, please see my other mail 
(<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2004JanMar/0108.html>).

Same.

Live properties aren't affected except for the unfortunate cases where 
they are. Same behaviour as in RFC2518.

If you're talking about 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-acl-latest.html#PROPERTY_inherited-acl-set>: 
no, they aren't.

Lisa, the issue is that namespace operations in HTTP *can* *not* behave 
as in filesystems as far as HTTP headers such as "Last-Modified" or 
"ETag" are concerned -- this is just incompatible with HTTP, so there's 
no way to require it.

We *can* encourage servers to use "robust" ETags (Etags that are unique 
across all resources in the namespace) and thus don't have conflicts 
with ETags that may have been previously used for the same URL. But 
that's a general rule, not particular to BIND whatsoever, so if you 
think it's worth the effort, add it to RFC2518bis.
