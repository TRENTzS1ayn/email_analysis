I agree with Julian's responses.

In addition, a client-side motivation for the "delete on MOVE" behavior of
locks is that it simplifies client-side lock management.  When the
client locks a resource, it just adds the request-URL of the lock
and the returned lock token to its list of URL/lock-token pairs.
It knows that that lock-token will be at that URL for the lifetime of
that lock-token.  If locks were not deleted when the protected URL
was unmapped, it is harder for a client to keep track of its locks.

Cheers,
Geoff
