OK, here's the change:

UNBIND postcondition:

       (DAV:lock-deleted): If the internal member URI of the binding
       specified by the Request-URI and the DAV:segment element in the
       request body was protected by a write-lock at the time of the
       request, that write-lock must have been deleted by the request.

REBIND postcondition:

       (DAV:lock-deleted): If the URL specified in the DAV:href element
       in the request body was protected by a write-lock at the time of
       the request, that write-lock must have been deleted by the
       request.

(note that for UNBIND the actual URI is composed from request-URI and 
DAV:segment in the request body).


 From Geoff's and my point of view, we have now resolved those issues 
raised by Lisa which indeed warranted a document change. As these 
changes are minor, we *could* proceed with draft 04 as base for the 
working group last call, but of course I can also produce a -05 draft 
early next week and submit that (Opinions?).

Regards, Julian
