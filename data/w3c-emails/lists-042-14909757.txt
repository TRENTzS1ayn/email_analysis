It isn't 
(<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-04.html#METHOD_REBIND>):

"The REBIND method removes a binding to a resource from one collection, 
and adds a binding to that resource into another collection. It is 
effectively an atomic form of a MOVE request."

Well, it isn't. If you feel that there should be a method allowing 
namespace manipulation while maintaining locks, you're free to work on 
it (I may even be interested on supporting it, once it's defined).

But this wasn't on the requirements list for BIND, and IMHO nobody has 
asked for it recently, so it doesn't belong into BIND. It's a completely 
separate issue.
