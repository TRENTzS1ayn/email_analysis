Wouldn't this type of functionality - prescribing menu items for saving - be
something each application vendor has to do.  IE.  Doesn't Billy Gates need to
add this feature to his File|Save As menu item in MS Word and ditto for Word
Perfect?    So, I guess another question would be - aren't we really dependent
on major word processor application vendors to implement a webdav solution,
before this seemless stuff will really happen?

I'd suggest just using "save" and "save as" to mean "save local"
and "save local as" and have "checkin" mean "save to the server
(and create a new version if the server supports versioning)".

Cheers,
