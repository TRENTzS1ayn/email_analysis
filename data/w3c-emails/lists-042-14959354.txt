Seems to me there are two scenarios to look at here.  I'm probably covering old
ground for this forum but:
Scenario 1:   Save file starting from client application.    You'd have a
browse button or just type in the http address of the file.   Hit Save and your
done.
Scenario 2: Update file/Download file   invoked from server application.  
You'd again have a browse button to save the file.  In this respect having
WebDav is no different than not having WebDav - same number of steps required.

For Scenario 1: 'Save' and 'Save as' would point to the file on the Web Server,
if that is where the file came from.  And the versioning might be automatic.

I'd suggest just using "save" and "save as" to mean "save local"
and "save local as" and have "checkin" mean "save to the server
(and create a new version if the server supports versioning)".

Cheers,
Geoff
