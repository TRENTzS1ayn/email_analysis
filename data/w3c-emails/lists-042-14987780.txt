I vote for removing it. Clearly there's no energy for working on a 
universal registry, nor do we seem to need it.

Related: I've been working on scripts that compile information about 
method names, header names, property names, pre/postcondition names (and 
so on) from a set of RFC2629-XML-formatted documents. Basically I'm 
using a set of well-defined entries of index entries, and just combine 
them into a common document. This will give us the property index at 
least for all working-group documents (it's not quite ready yet, but if 
people are interested, I can produce an example in the next few days).
