Another charter item which isn't met yet, and with no progress in 5 
years, is the ACL goals document.

http://www.webdav.org/acl/goals/draft-ietf-webdav-acl-reqts-00.txt

Attention went from goals to specification and never returned.  The ACL 
specification may no longer be very much in line with the goals 
document any more (somebody would have to reread the goals document to 
see).  It doesn't really matter because events left the goals document 
behind.  The main reason for the goals document to be standardized 
would have been to enforce some process on getting ACL itself to RFC 
but that's done now anyway.

So, to perform good housekeeping on our charter, does anybody object to 
simply removing this goal from the charter?

Again, feedback and discussion within 2 weeks would be appreciated.  
Thanks!

Lisa
