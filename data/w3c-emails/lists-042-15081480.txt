When a user does a COPY or MOVE from one binding to another binding to 
the same resource, this should be flagged as an error.  Since this has 
to interoperate with existing clients that won't look at the error 
body, the status code would have to stand alone.  409 is already used 
for non-existent parent collections, so that can't be reused.  Possibly 
403 which in 2518 for COPY means "_ The source and destination URIs are 
the same."
