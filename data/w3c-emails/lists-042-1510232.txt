I've set up an online chat room for back-channel discussions, and so
that people who couldn't be here in person can join in. 

 

If you've already got a Jabber client, the conference address is:

webdav@conference.jabber.org

 

How to get and use Jabber:

There *may* be a gateway still open from a few months ago that MSN
Messenger can use:
