Why would that be an error?

If I have two bindings b1 and b2 to the same resource B, MOVE b1 -> b2 
will either fail (for Overwrite: F) or will first remove binding b2, 
then execute the rename. The result will be that there'll be one 
remaining binding (b2).

For the same situation, COPY seems to be no-op. Dead properties and 
content will be "replaced" by their current values (with possible side 
effects on ETag and so on...).

What am I missing?

Regards, Julian
