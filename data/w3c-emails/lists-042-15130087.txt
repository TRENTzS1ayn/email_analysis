...or it could make the decision not to maintain support for something 
that doesn't fit into the BIND model.

What's the use case for that property?

No, it must not have different values based on the access path.

Precisely.

Yes, they should assume it behaves the same on all bindings. The REPORT 
method is defined to return information for the resource referenced by 
the request URI. The request URI really is just the access path and has 
no influence on the result.

Again, I think the concept of properties that vary on access path is 
incompatible with what we are doing here. In the model we're working in, 
  state only exists in WebDAV resources (where bindings belong to the 
state of the containing collection).

So if you have a property that is supposed to vary, it *per definition* 
can't belong to the resource itself, thus it'll be part of the parent 
collection's state (an example would be a "hidden" flag that's attached 
to each of the bindings contained in the collection).

I agree that in many cases the strong model used in BIND doesn't work 
well in all practical use cases (there's a reason why Unix symbolic 
links seem to be more popular then hard links). That's why the Advanced 
Collection activity of this working group has resulted in *several* 
specs. For instance, REDIRECTREF resources 
(<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-latest.html>) 
*are* separate resources that can have their own metadata attached to 
it.  There was yet another planned thingy called "direct reference" (as 
far as I understand similar to redirectrefs minus the redirection step) 
that seems to more closely map to what you feel bindings should be 
doing. Maybe you want to pursue that project?
