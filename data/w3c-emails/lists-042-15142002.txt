I believe servers have already been implemented and deployed where the 
live property can vary depending on access path.  For example, in order 
to continue to maintain backward compatibility for a custom property 
called "parent-path", the server would have to implement bindings in 
such a way that "parent-path" was calculated from the request address.

I should have been more clear in my original text.  What I meant was 
that when a new live property is specified (e.g. in an Internet-Draft / 
RFC), the specification should indicate if the live property may have 
different values on different bindings.  Otherwise, the assumption is 
that the live property must have the same value on all bindings.  
Similarly, when a new report is specified, readers may assume that it 
behaves the same on all bindings, unless the specification says 
otherwise.

I never envisioned a need or utility in having clients apply methods to 
multiple bindings to test this.  I did envision a mechanism to indicate 
that a property may diverge on different bindings, but I propose this 
should be in the specification where the property is defined.  So there 
are no issues for discovery/storage.
