What permissions are required in order to perform a BIND request?  I 
would think  that permissions for UNBIND and REBIND are identical to 
permissions for DELETE and MOVE respectively, but this should be 
stated.

Are there issues with CHECKIN of an activity changing multiple bindings 
to the same resource?  MERGE?  Are there any other methods that can 
make changes to a number of resources at once, and thus might have 
problems addressing several bindings to the same resource?
