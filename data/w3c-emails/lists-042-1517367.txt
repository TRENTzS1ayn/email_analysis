In the WG meeting I mentioned this proposal & promised to send the link:

 

http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/rsync-specification.htm

 

The RSync stuff can also be used to do partial uploads very securely, by
uploading just a chunk of the original file, waiting for a success, then
start to upload XDeltas until it's done.
