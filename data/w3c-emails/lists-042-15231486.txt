I fail to see the issue. It only means that when Microsoft decides to 
support the BIND draft, they'll have to re-think that design decision. 
Just because somebody in the past did a poor system design that is 
inherently incompatible with having multiple URIs for the same resource 
shouldn't prevent *us* from doing things right.

The harm is that it's incompatible with the stated purpose of the spec 
-- specifying additional URIs to the *same* resource. Of course we can't 
prevent anybody from doing that, but it's against the stated purpose of 
the spec, and thus the spec shouldn't do anything which would encourage 
this kind of design.

BTW: the "hidden" flag in NTFS in fact is kept as part of the file 
resource, not of the binding. Thus, IIS in fact does the right thing in 
presenting this as property on the resource (well, they shouldn't have 
uses the DAV: namespace...).

To test that: create a file, create a second binding to that file 
(cygwin ln), show properties in Explorer for first binding, set 
"hidden", refresh window multiple times. See?
