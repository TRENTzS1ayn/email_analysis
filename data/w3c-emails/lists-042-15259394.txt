I agree with Geoff where versioning is concerned, as users familliar 
with versioning will know what that means. However, for applications 
(users?) that aren't version aware I would prefer 'Publish (as)' because 
most users will have a good semantic model for the meaning of 'publish', 
indicating that you are making the resource available for others.
