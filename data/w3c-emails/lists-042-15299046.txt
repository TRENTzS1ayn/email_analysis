Since there are numerous examples of HTTP 1.0 upload (one file at a time) from within a web page, I wondered if it is possible to use HTTP 1.1 WebDAV protocols to upload multiple files at a time from within a web page.  How would authentication be handled in such a case and could that be programmatically supplied since one may already have authenticated oneself to obtain the upload page in the first place?
