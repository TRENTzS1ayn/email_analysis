Although I'm not sure if hidden is a good example, I don't have a problem 
with some hypothetical property returning a different value depending on 
which URL you use to reference it.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised if we 
eventually intentionally define a property that does vary by URL.  But we 
should be clear right now that all properties that are resource based 
(which is basically everything at the time of the writing) should not vary 
by URL and that future properties should not vary by URL without a 
documented reason.
