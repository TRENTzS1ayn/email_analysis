Well, I think that properties SHOULD NOT vary on request URI (nor should 
the content), as this is clearly against the goals of the BIND spec. 
RFC2518 says that PROPFIND returns the resource's properties, and BIND 
speaks about having multiple URIs for the same resource. I think this is 
clear enough...

If you need responses that vary with the request URI, you're IMHO not 
talking to the *same* resource anymore.
