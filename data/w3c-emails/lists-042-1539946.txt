Issue PUT_AND_INTERMEDIATE_COLLECTIONS: this issue was a request to
allow PUT to create intermediate collections. I believe there is no
consensus to do this and we should resolve this wont' fix.

 

Issue INTEROP_DELETE_AND_MULTISTATUS: this issue is a request for DELETE
errors to be 4xx so that HTTP clients don't think 207 is a success.
That's no longer really an issue - few HTTP clients do authoring, and
those that do are at least aware that 207 is a multistatus response and
not a complete success. We should resolve this won't fix.

 

Considering only the meeting attendees today, there's consensus so far.
