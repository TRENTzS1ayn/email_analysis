[Disregard my last message[1] stating this was w3t-formal-assertion-testbed.
I had inadvertently made this a Team vs. Public list.  simon]

Purpose:

ListPurpose: Email sent to this list will be deemed to
contain true statements in some formal
language (embedded in the text with XML).
Semantic Web agents can subscribe to the list
or read the archives to get some grist for
processing.

The expectation is that e-mails sent here will
be fairly small, containing mostly pointers to
large knowledge bases, or be normal text messages
which happen to contain some formal part and
are CC'd to this list
