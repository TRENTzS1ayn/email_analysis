WebDAV can add new status codes.  It cannot redifine the meaning of 2xx
status codes.  Doing so destroys one of the main extensibility
mechanisms of HTTP.

It negatively affects any client that proceeds with later actions
based on the status being successful.  WebDAV hasn't seen it yet
because it is still working on first-generation systems and performance
is not yet a deciding factor between implementations.
