I am a parent volunteer who develops the website for my son's school.  The
district administrator tells me I need to use Webdav protocol to connect to
the Zope server.  My problem is I cannot determine the correct syntax that
DreamWeaver wants for the URL.   Is anyone out there using that and could
help me?  I am using the newest version of DreamWeaver MX.

I have tried this - http://sitename.org/directory name/:port number

Thanks,
