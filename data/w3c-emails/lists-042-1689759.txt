Did anybody point out that there's an interesting way for the client to
ensure that the If header never fails the request, by always providing a
"true" statement?
 
-          One or more tokens can be put in parentheses to form a group
or list
-          Multiple lists can be included and they are ORed together
 
So if the client wants to put a bunch of locktokens in the If header it
can put any number of them in there, all separated by virtual "OR"s:
 
DOSTUFF /resourceurl.html HTTP/1.1
If: (<locktoken1>) (<locktoken2>) (<locktoken3)
 
This request will succeed if the any of the clauses match.
