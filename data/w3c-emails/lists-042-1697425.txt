To be clear, we do poll for consensus in person, but that's a common
IETF practice (sometimes implemented as a hum in large meetings).  We
have always brought in-person discussions and "conclusions" (to avoid
the word "decisions" to the list for finality.  That's why I mentioned
having a straw poll on the list shortly if discussion points that way.
