If widely deployed clients (e.g. MS office) would not choke on this change,
I would support doing as Julian suggests.

Cheers,
Geoff

You are right. For some reason I thought that this was supposed to work
using "save", which was greyed out when a web resource was opened. In fact,
it's "Publish". You learn something new every day.

Well. The main justification is that it has been doing this for almost 4
years now, and

- there wasn't a big outcry, and
- it doesn't seem to negatively affect anybody.

That being said, from a consistency p.o.v. I agree. I'll assume for a moment
that few WebDAV clients indeed *do* evaluate a 207 on DELETE (and other
candidates such as LOCK/COPY...), and those probably would be easy to
upgrade. If this is true, all we'd need to do is

- deprecate status of 207 for failures
- introduce a new 4xx code such as INCOMPLETE OPERATION which would carry
the same multistatus body

Feedback appreciated.
