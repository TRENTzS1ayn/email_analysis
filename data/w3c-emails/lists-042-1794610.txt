OK,

here's my proposal then:


1) define:

425 Incomplete Operation
The 425 (Incomplete Operation) status code means that the method could not
be performed completely because it wasn't executed atomically and the
request could not be applied to all affected child resources.

2) deprecate marshalling of multistatus with 207 on failures or incomplete
operations

3) allow multistatus response body for 424 (failed dependancy) and 425.

Note that 424 could be used when the whole operations was rejected because
of an error on a child resource (such as deep locks that are in conflict
with child lock -- another open issue for error marshalling), while 425
would be returned when the method "partly" succeeded (like a DELETE that
couldn't remove one specifc child, but many others).
