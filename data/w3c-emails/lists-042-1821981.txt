I don't know what the status of the registry is now, but it was supposed
to be IANA.  The holdback was the lack of a registration process 
[meaning
the lack of a volunteer with enough free time to write that boring 
task].
Larry might know the current state.

Why don't you just respond with the status code of the first error,
since otherwise you will need a 5xx as well.

207 is completely lame (and yes I did make a stink of it at the time).
HTTP doesn't specify the contents of the message body -- a 
multi-response
could have just as easily been done as 200/201 with a special media type
specific to webdav.  The client already knows it is performing a webdav
action and intermediaries know it isn't cacheable (because of the 
method),
so a parallel set of status codes isn't necessary.
