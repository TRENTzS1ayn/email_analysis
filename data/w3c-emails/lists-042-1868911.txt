Hi,

during the WG meeting I volunteered to do some tests with the If header
syntax that Geoff, Stefan and myself have been proposing to do conditional
PUTs (where both a lock-token and an entity tag is known, and the request
should succeed if the etag still matches, and the lock-token either matches
or the lock is gone).

A possible syntax for this is:

(<opaquelocktoken:14ba870e-f200-0010-d0b9-e8c4edb33ec7:17289> ["89657"])
(Not<DAV:no-lock> ["89657"])

where:

opaquelocktoken:14ba870e-f200-0010-d0b9-e8c4edb33ec7:17289 is a valid
lock-token,
DAV:no-lock is a known-to-be-invalid lock token and
"89657" is the etag obtained from the previous PUT.


Here are the test results:

1) Moddav in Apache 2.0.44

Found (and reported) two bugs:

a) etags in If header validation do not seem to work [1]
b) lock tokens are only accepted in the specific syntax that moddav
internally uses [2]


2) IIS 5.0

Identified bug similar to [1]. Does anybody know how to report bugs in IIS
with an actual chance that they get fixed? (:-)


3) SAP Enterprise Portal

Tests pass (admittingly after we fixed to bugs in the If header validation).


The tests are written in JScript and require MSXML and the Windows Scripting
Host (zip file attached). Syntax is:

cscript update-test.js URL (username) (passwd)

Joe (Orton), in case you read this: it would be nice if Litmus could add
some are all of these tests.
