I've been looking into this some more. This trick should also work with
tagged lists.  However, since multiple tagged lists are ANDed together
(" If the state of the resource to which the header is applied does not
match any of the specified state lists then the request MUST fail") it
has to be done a little differently.

<no-lock> here represents a lock token that the client made up, which is
intended to Fail.
If: <href1> (<locktoken1> Not <no-lock>) <href2> (<locktoken2> Not
<no-lock>)

This evaluates as 
((href1 matches locktoken1) OR NOT (href1 matches no-lock))
AND  ((href2 matches locktoken2) OR NOT (href2 matches no-lock))

I tested this against Xythos WFS, and clients can use this syntax to
make sure that the request does not fail even if locktoken1 or
locktoken2 are no longer there.  Of course this should always be used
with ETag checks.
