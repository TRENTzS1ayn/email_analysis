Yes, this proposal appears in the thread 
"Submitting tokens without a validity check"
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002OctDec/0284.html
based on a suggestion from Stefan:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002JulSep/0390.html 
The final form of this proposal (with constant
tokens) appears in a message from Julian:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2002OctDec/0286.html

Since at the time, Lisa was the only one who
objected to this proposal, it sounds like we
now all agree that this is the right approach?

Cheers,
Geoff

Lisa,

you are aware that this exactly the proposal that Geoff and myself have been
making for some months now?
