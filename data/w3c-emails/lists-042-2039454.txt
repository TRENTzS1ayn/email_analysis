Yes, I am aware it's the same solution in spirit. However, a slight
tweak makes it a little shorter, or in the the untagged list case, quite
a bit shorter.

Your proposal was (mail from Tue 10/8/2002):
  If: <http://www.foo.bar/resource1>
(<locktoken:a-write-lock-token>)(Not <locktoken:a-write-lock-token>))

That's rather long, and it's unnecessary to put a real lock token in the
negative clause.  The client can at least shrink the header a bit using
  If: <http://www.foo.bar/resource1>
(<locktoken:a-write-lock-token>)(Not <no-lock>)

But if the client can get away with using an untagged list production,
it's even shorter:
  If: (<locktoken:a-write-lock-token>) (Not <no-lock>)

RFC2518: "If multiple No-tag-list productions are used then one only
needs to match the state of the resource for the method to be allowed to
continue."
