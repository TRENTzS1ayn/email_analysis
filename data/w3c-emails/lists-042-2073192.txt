Technically speaking, they *don't* workaround the server state. The client
says "let the request succeed if my locktoken is still valid, or if it's
gone", and this is what happens. This works *by design*. Not that I think
that it's ever a good idea to send this kind of request.

I'd like to hear that directly from him, not as hear-say. In particular, it
would be nice if the group of client programmers that thinks that there *is*
an issue would actually sit down and try how the proposed usage of the
existing If header turns out to work.

Could you please explain the nature of the problem?

That was my impression as well.

On the other hand, we've been working on this issue for almost 6 months
wiith little progress. So my *concrete* proposal about how to proceed is:

1) allow comma separated notation for tagged lists (to workaround proxy
limitations)

2) use GULP as a basis to clearly explain which resources are affected

3) add a set of the tests I wrote to Litmus

4) write a separate document (?) that gives guidelines on "safe" authoring.

Note that if we left out 2), this would be no change for RFC2518 at all, and
all servers compliant to RFC2518 should already behave as desired.
