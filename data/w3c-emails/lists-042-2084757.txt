Section 9.4.1, No-tag-list production:

"If multiple No-tag-list productions are used then one only needs to
match the state of the resource for the method to be allowed to
continue." 

Conclusion: multiple untagged lists only one needs to match --> OR

Section 9.4.2, Tagged-list Production:

"When the If header is applied to a particular resource, the Tagged-
list productions MUST be searched to determine if any of the listed
resources match the operand resource(s) for the current method. If none
of the resource productions match the current resource then the header
MUST be ignored. If one of the resource productions does match the name
of the resource under consideration then the list productions following
the resource production MUST be applied to the resource in the manner
specified in the previous section. "

Conclusion: multiple tagged lists each needs to match --> AND

Note that in the previous quoted paragraphs, the part about ignoring
clauses will be removed if we continue by our previous consensus.

This completely breaks the syntax of the header for clients sending
requests to servers that don't immediately support 2518bis.  Clients
wouldn't actually be able to use commas for years because there is
currently no way to see if a server supports 2518bis.  I'm pointing this
out because if we decide to do this, we have to be clear on
understanding it's not going to be very useful for a long time.
