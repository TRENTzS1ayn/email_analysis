I don't think my logic supports your conclusion.

Adding commas to the If header is *exactly* as disruptive as inventing a
new header.  
 - At first, clients will not support this, knowing that very few
servers support the new syntax or header, and having no easy way to
distinguish
 - Later, some clients may include logic to do both/either once many
servers support the new syntax or header
 - Finally, in a few years, most clients will move to the new paradigm,
*if* it adds value, once all servers are known to support the new syntax
or header.
 - If the change does not add sufficient value, clients will never
switch over.

Given that changing the syntax and adding a header are identical in
interoperability cost, if we rule out one solely because of the cost we
logically rule out the other.
