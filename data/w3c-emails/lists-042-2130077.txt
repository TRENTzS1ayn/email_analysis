Yes.

However, we *already* have the desired behaviour (for the conditional
operation). So this is something that is already supported by RFC2518, and
we should use it. Clients can use it *now*.

The *only* thing that's missing (and it's only a problem when there are
misbehaving proxies in the communication path) is the change to allow comma
separated lists. Whether we do *that* change is a completely separate issue.
