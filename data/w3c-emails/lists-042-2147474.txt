Julian it's great that you've done this research. It helps to get some
real data into our planning!

I'm not sure.  Here's my guess:
 - Decide that preventing lost updates is actually important
 - Decide that strong ETags is the only way to do that effectively 
 - Exhort server implementors to do a better job of Etags and If header
 - Put the tests in Litmus -- which I understand you're already doing --
and announce
 - Hold another interoperability event where we record the results of
this effort

That holds back draft standard until we can hold another interop event,
but if we hold another summer interop as we have the last two years,
draft standard would probably take that long anyway.

Any other ideas?
