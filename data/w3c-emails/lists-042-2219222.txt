I'm learning about this StringPrep standard for XMPP string comparisons,
and obviously it would be useful for WebDAV too, particularly DASL.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3454.txt

To make string comparisons work more reliably, a proposal like DASL can
define a StringPrep "profile", selecting the characters, mappings and
foldings most appropriate to that application.

I'm not clear yet on whether it's possible to just import StringPrep
entire, without creating a profile.
