  There is a bug in Windows2K/Office2K where dragging one folder onto another deletes everything at the destination URL if it already exists, rather than just copying in the contents.

  Do you know if there is a patch to the DAV client in Windows2K/Office2K to get the new HEAD/MKCOL behavior?

Eric

The issues appears to be that with Office XP the WebDAV client uses HEAD to determine if the directory already exists and only issues MKCOL if the target is not found. With 2K it appears to issues MKCOL, and if the target exists it issues DELTE followed by MKCOL..

The question is, is there a patch for Windows 2K / Office 2K that will provide the preferred (Office XP) behavoir, under Windows 2K / Office 2K.

With Office 2K

Test Case

Map a WebFolder to a DAV Server -> create a Folder called testcase on Dav Server.
Create a Folder called Parent on the Desktop
Create a Folder called Child inside Parent.
Create a Folder called Sibling on the Desktop.

Copy Parent from the Desktop to the Testcase folder on the Dav Server -> This should create a folder called parent on the Dav Server.
Open the Parent Folder on the Dav Server -> It should contain a folder callled Child
Copy the Sibling folder from the Desktop to the Parent Folder on the Dav Server. -> The Parent Folder should now contain subfolders Child and Sibling.

Navigate the to the Testcase folder on the Dav Server
Copy the Parent Folder from the Desktop to the Dav Server -> When prompted about overwriting select 'Yes to All' option
Open the Parent Folder on the Dav Server -> Note that it does not contain a folder called Sibling..

If the same actions are taken with Office XP the Parent Folder will contain both child and sibling after the second copy completes. From a Windows perspective this is the expected and desired behavoir...
