Hi 

i have mapped a WebFolder to a DAV Server and now i am creating a new folder to a location where i do not have "write-rights".  In this case, i am sending the xml response corresponding to Forbidden status code inside the multistatus tag. Although a new folder is not created here but it is not throwing any error message. Is there any way out of it?

please help me.

thanx in advance.

Anil
