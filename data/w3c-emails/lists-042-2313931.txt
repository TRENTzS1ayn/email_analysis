I also agree.  I'll make this change and mark the issue as
closed, unless someone objects.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

back in October, Stefan Eissing wrote:

I agree. MOVE should be identical to BIND/DELETE, and therefore consistency
with MOVE response codes seems to make sense.

Proposal:

Add the sentence:

"In case of success, the server SHOULD return 201 (Created) when a new
binding was created and 204 (No Content) when an existing binding was
replaced".
