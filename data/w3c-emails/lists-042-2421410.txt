We have incorporated basic versioning capability into the Cadaver client,
and have submitted the code patches to Joe Orton. He is in the process of
incorporating them into the mainline code base for Cadaver, and this should
be part of the next release.

  Hi

  Can anybody tell me about the WebDAV Versioning clients that are available
today?
  i have incorporated the versioning (rfc 3253) feature in my Webdav server
and now i want to test it through some standard versioning clients
available.

  Thanx

  Anil
