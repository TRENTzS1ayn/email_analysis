Hi,

I would like to know whether with webdav there is any provision
to advertising the shares available on a given server? The idea,
with the, conjunction of a technology such as Rendezvous, would
be to list the servers with 'shares' in local area and then list
the webdav resources being made available by the server.

regards

Andre
