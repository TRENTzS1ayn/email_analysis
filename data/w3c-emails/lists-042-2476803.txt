Hi.

I have adressed some of Lisa's issues, in particular:

- how to interpret the DTD fragments [1]
- reference to RFC3253 pre/postcondition definition [2]

I've also tried to clarify the relation to versioned collection ([3]).

To those who revieved the 05 draft: please check out the current version
(all changes are highlighted) -- I intend to submit this draft as "last
call" version early next week.

Julian
