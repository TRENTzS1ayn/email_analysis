(that *is* a full sentence, isn't it?)

I agree that the condition itself can be expressed in a more stringent
manner. However, I strongly disagree with the second sentence: all
pre/postconditions are MUSTs (by definition), and therefore the statement is
(a) redundant and (b) - for consistency - it would have to be repeated on
each an every condition.
