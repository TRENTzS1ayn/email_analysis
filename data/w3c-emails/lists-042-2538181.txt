Interoperability problems with some clients may arise when adding an
DAV:principal-URL element to the DAV:lockdiscovery property.

In the case of Microsoft Office2000 (e.g. Word), I noticed that it depends
on the *order* of the child elements inside the DAV:activelock element. If
the DAV:principal-URL element doesn't come *last*, as in the attached sample
PROPFIND response, Word doesn't seem to send correctly the Lock-Token:
header. This occurs,for example, when creating a new resource: the PUT
request following the LOCK request (which initially created a lock-null
resource) sends Lock-Token: <>.
