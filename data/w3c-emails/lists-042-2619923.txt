The example in para 2 of section 3.2 incorrectly states:

For example, if collection C1 is mapped to both /CollX and /CollY, and
C1 contains a binding named "x.gif" to a resource R1, then either
[/CollX, x.gif] or [/CollY, y.gif] can appear in the DAV:parent-set of
R1, but not both.

That should be:

... then either [/CollX, x.gif] or [/CollY, x.gif] can appear ...
