Hi Greg,

I am using a CGI as the server for WebDAV. I want to know how should I
configure the virtual directory of my webdav folder so that when the WebDAV
folder is accessed through IE/MS-Office then the CGI gets invoked.
I've tried redirection to URL of the CGI, but that does not work.
Please advise

Regards
