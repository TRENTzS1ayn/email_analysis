IANAL.

Many of the claims in the Microsoft patents are very specific to HTTP,
specific methods, and use of XML. There is clear prior art for ACL (easy to
find drafts in Google that predate the application). DASL is a bit tricky --
the first draft did go our before the application, but only by a week.
Still, we can point to email messages that clearly indicate that people on
the patent application were working on the DASL specification. I'm also not
sure whether revealing the idea of SQL wrapped in XML over HTTP at the
public, open DASL working meetings also constitutes disclosure of the
invention.
