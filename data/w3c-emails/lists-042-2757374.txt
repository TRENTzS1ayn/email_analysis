Of course they are meant to be atomic. In fact, I don't agree that this
needs to be clarified.

RFC3253 says:

'A "postcondition" of a method describes the state of the server that must
be true after that method has been completed.'

Having a *set* of postconditions simply means that the state changes have
been broken down into separate items, it does *not* mean that some of them
are optional.

The ordering spec uses the same structure as RFC3253 here, and RFC3253
doesn't seem to use the term "atomic" anywhere when specifying multiple
postconditions. So if this really is an issue, I think it applies to all
specs using this terminology, not only the ordering spec.
