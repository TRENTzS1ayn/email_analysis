FYI

I know this is a little late (published 3.5 months ago) but I only just
realized the relevance to the WebDAV-server-discovery emails (e.g. the
suggestion of using appletalk I think) on the list a couple weeks ago.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: Domain-based Application Service Location
Using SRV 
                          RRs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery
Service 
                          (DDDS)

This memo defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [3]
Application for domain name based discovery of application services.
Essentially, this uses DNS NAPTR resource records [4] to provide one
more layer of redirection for service lookup than is feasible with
SRV ([2]) records.  It is proposed because real-life use is
demonstrating a need for something slightly more substantial than
SRV, and alternatively SRV usage may become twisted out of its
intended shape.

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
