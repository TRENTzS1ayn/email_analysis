RFC2518 says "The same URI MUST NOT appear more than once in a resource
production in an If header.".

Is there any reason for that? In my experience, it just makes more work
for the server to parse the header. It doesn't make things easier for
the client either -- just another restriction the client must be aware
of.

Should this be removed in 2518bis?
