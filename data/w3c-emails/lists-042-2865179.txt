Clients can detect the presence of etags right now. Clients are free not to
author (PUT/PROPPATCH) resources without etags right now. I really don't see
how this change will help anybody.

- it *will* make IIS and Apache/moddav (and a some others) non-conformant

- it *may* encourage server developers to claim strong etag support,
although their etags aren't really strong -- *this* will cause harm because
it may cause undetected lost updates

We really should restrict the changes to those for which we do have
consensus (and these really are clarifications):

- servers SHOULD support etags on authorable resources

- clients MUST be able to reliably detect etag support for a resource

- also add language that describes why locks may not prevent lost updates
(and therefore why strong etags are so desirable)
