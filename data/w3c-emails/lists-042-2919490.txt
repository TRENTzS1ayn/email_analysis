OK, this is actually very related to an argument in favour of "MUST
support strong ETags".  Unless it is a requirement of servers, clients
simply won't implement it. And if clients (and client libraries) don't
implement it, users and even many developers don't have the choice. 

It's a chicken/egg problem, too.  Server implementors won't take the
pains to implement ETags because they know most existing clients ignore
ETags.  How do we exit from this vicious circle?
