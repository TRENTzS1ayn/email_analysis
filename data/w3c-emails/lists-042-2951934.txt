Again, I agree with Julian.  This doesn't look like chicken/egg problem to
me.   The check doesn't appear to be difficult/expensive for most clients
and it's definitely valuable.

If there is no reason for a client to believe that checking the etag will
create a breakage or incompatibility, clients will implement etag checking.
