Further: There is more than one way to implement locking. My server 
already had a locking mechanism, so I had no desire to implement 
WebDAV locking at all. I just wanted a few features to make it easier 
for users to upload files. But then I got sucked into it because OS X 
refused to allow writes without locking. I found the locking part of 
WebDAV to be the most complex and problematic part to implement. At 
times it made me wish I had taken another approach.
