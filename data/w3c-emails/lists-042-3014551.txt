The issue of whether it's OK to define RFC2518bis such that servers that
were compliant with 2518 have to make changes to become compliant with
2518bis came up again last week. Therefore, I thought I'd repost this
message from last year.

We are already putting requirements in 2518bis such that servers that
were compliant with 2518 must upgrade to be compliant with 2518bis.
That's OK, particularly when the spec becomes more stringent, not less.
Greater stringency should increase the number of features and behaviors
that clients can rely on and use interoperably without so many if-elses.
