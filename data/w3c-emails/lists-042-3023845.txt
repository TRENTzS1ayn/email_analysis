Since this discussion last year, I haven't heard of anybody supporting
"ishidden" and show interop. At a minimum, only one other organization
needs to do so, and then show that both their server and IIS 5.0 work
with Web Folders to hide resources (if Web Folders in fact does this).
I'd take a trace and a screenshot as "proof" and put this into
RFC2518bis.  In the absence of proof, I'm not planning to add more
properties.
