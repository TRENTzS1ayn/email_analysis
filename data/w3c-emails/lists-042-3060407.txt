The versioning protocol ended up not using bindings for much,
so the real problem is that can be expensive to check whether or
not a loop has been created.  So we don't require it.

Cheers,

I'm wondering about the justification for permitting loops.
I looked in the archive, but except for the statement
that loops are required for versioning, I didn't notice
any reasons presented, although I may have missed
that.
