Note that some file-based implementations store the dead properties as part
of the file content and use the file content information to compute the
etag.  So an interoperable client can only make the following assumptions:

- If the resource content changes, the strong etag MUST change.
- If the properties change, the strong etag MAY change.

Cheers,

Okay, I'll take a stab at this one...

I think the answer is whenever the GET response changes.  So for most
resources the answer is almost always (1), not (2) or (3).   If you have a
live
resource that is dependent on other info, the answer might vary.
