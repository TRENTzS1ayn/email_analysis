Geoff,

URLs have properties to.  Think about how DAV:lockdiscovery
works in the face of COPY/MOVE, or DAV:displayname for that
matter.

Regarding this issue, I was not suggesting that the problem
is that the binding protocol changed the behavior of properties,
just that the behavior needs to be fully specified.  Do
you feel that 2518 does fully specify the behavior of
URL properties?
