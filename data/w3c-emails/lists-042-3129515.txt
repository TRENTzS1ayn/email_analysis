2418 correctly states that MOVE (and COPY) also may involve
a DELETE with "Depth: infinity" operation in the case of

My reading of the document is different, so the language
should be cleaned up so that it doesn't sound like it is
prohibiting the semantics spelled out in 2518.  Would it
help if I provided that text?
