I'm not sure I understand what you're refering to, but it is true that
we protect the URL of a lock.   And it's true that the
influence of a lock causes there to be a DAV:lockdiscovery property
shown on the resource, but I'm not sure I'd call that property a "URL
property".  (It's more complex than that.)

DAV:displayname is a property of the resource in every way that
I can think of.

Hold that thought until we resolve what it is you mean by
URL properties...
