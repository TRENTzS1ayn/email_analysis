OK, since the bind protocol only introduces one
new method, with simple behavior in the presence of
locks, I'm happy to add the appropriate precondition
to the BIND definition.  In particular, I propose to
add the following precondition:

(DAV:locked-update-allowed): if the collection identified by the Request-URL
is write-locked, then the appropriate token MUST be specified in an If
request header.

Anyone object to this addition?

Cheers,
Geoff

It probably isn't a good idea to introduce a dependency
such as this, especially since 2518bis doesn't have any
notion of bindings.  I don't believe that the binding
document can move forward.
