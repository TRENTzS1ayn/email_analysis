It supports that.  What you're possibly refering to is the fact that
2518 let's the DELETE on a collection to delete some of the
children and abort before removing the colection itself and without
backing out what it did.   In the Bind Spec, there is no requirement
to unbind those child resources and in many cases you definitely
don't want to do that.   You only have to unbind the collection.
There is no partial DELETE.  You just have to unmap that collection.
Whether that reclaims resources is a different matter.

Yes, you can't break a lock without having the proper lock
token submitted, but you're not allowed to break the lock, but
abort the DELETE.  Nor are you somehow allowed to unmap
the resource but not remove the lock.  (At least not yet. :-))

I actually just read it for the first time in a long time and it's very
clear
that it doesn't speak of freeing up resources.   Except to say that you
"MAY" do it.
