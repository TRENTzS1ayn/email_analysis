I do not understand what you mean by a URL having a
property.  A URL is just a string.  It has no properties,
no state, nothing other than a sequence of characters.
A URL is mapped by a server to a resource, and that 
resource has state.

A lock can "protect" a URL mapping, but that does not
give a URL a WebDAV property.

So at least as far as bindings are concerned, I feel
that 2518 does fully specify the behavior of the
properties defined by 2518.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

URLs have properties to.  Think about how DAV:lockdiscovery
works in the face of COPY/MOVE, or DAV:displayname for that
matter.

Regarding this issue, I was not suggesting that the problem
is that the binding protocol changed the behavior of properties,
just that the behavior needs to be fully specified.  Do
you feel that 2518 does fully specify the behavior of
URL properties?
