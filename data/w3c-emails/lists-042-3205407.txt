Good point!

I assume by "the binding being protected", you mean in the
case where the binding already exists, and the Overwrite:T
header is specifed?  If so, I agree that we need another
precondition to handle this.  How about:

(DAV:locked-overwrite-allowed): If the collection already contains a binding
with the specified path segment, and if that binding is protected by a
write-lock, then the appropriate token MUST be specified in an If request
header.

Cheers,
Geoff

I don't object, but I feel if we do add this, we'll also have to list the
possibility
of the binding being protected by a lock in the subtree.   I think that
isn't covered
by the wording above.    I'm not sure if you want to reword this one or add
another
precondition.
