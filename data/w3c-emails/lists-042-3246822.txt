Good catch. I remember that we discussed that at some point of time, but it
seems it was never added to the issues list.

Our server indeed is able to support the BIND method and live properties
with all their semantics, yet won't do an atomic DELETE on collections. I
agree that *technically* a server that properly handles bindings *could* do
atomic deletes, but in reality, there may be reasons why you don't *want*
to.

Therefore, I'd like the spec not to require a specific behaviou, or, as a
minimum, change the MUST to a SHOULD.
