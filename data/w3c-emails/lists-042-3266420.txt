Brian,

properties are *never* on URLs, they are always on the resource. So if you
have multiple bindings to the same resource, a PROPFIND on each of these
bindings should yield the same results.

So DAV:lockdiscovery and DAV:displayname indeed do *not* depend on the
binding to which the PROPFIND is applied.

:-)

If we agree on that there are no "URL properties", there's nothing that
needs to be defined.
