Saying that it doesn't support atomic deletes doesn't make sense to
me.  The concept doesn't exist.   The binding spec's  DELETE command is
asking that only one thing be done.   If you can't do that one thing you
need
to reject the DELETE request.  But leaving a partial tree there is not an
option because the method didn't ask you to delete those other bindings
and in fact might not want them to be deleted.

I would hope it's possible though and that you wouldn't have to reject the
request. Even in a file system based server, I'd hope that the server could
simply unmap the collection and then in the background do the delete/move
of the whole tree incrementally if that were appropriate.

But if it can't, IMO it needs to reject the request.
