Would you be able to do that -- unmap a collection -- even if one of its
children were locked? The person with the lock would then lose it and
their resource, right?

If on the other hand, you can't unmap a collection until all its
children are unlocked, then you have a serious problem supporting that
atomically on a filesystem. For example, by the time IIS 5.0 checks all
the children of a collection to see if they're locked, one of them might
have just gotten a new lock.
