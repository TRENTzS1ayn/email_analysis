What you are implying is correct.
If a child is locked via a WebDAV lock and the binding to be DELETEd is
protected by the protected URL of that lock, then it can't be unmapped.
If the inode of the child is locked, then I believe it can be unmapped.
If it's locked by a Win32 lock then it probably can't be unmapped in
the file system, so it's probably best to reject the DELETE at the
WebDAV layer.

If we're talking about webdav's locks, it should be handleable inside the
server and it should be manageable.  If we're talking about
 a file system lock, then it might depend on the OS.  I
believe on Linux for example that it doesn't matter if an inode is locked.
The resource can move/delete and the resource remains locked and file
handles
are not broken.  In the
case of Win32, you probably can go through the same process as the
Win32 CMD.EXE MOVE command does.  It does take a few seconds
looking for locks in descendents in large trees... but I assume it also
deals with locks
being created while it's looking.  If that MOVE succeeds, then that binding
should be WebDAV DELETE'able.  If that MOVE is rejected, then you
probably will need to reject the WebDAV bind-enabled DELETE.
