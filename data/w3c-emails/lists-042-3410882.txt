It has been several weeks since we posted the request for objections
to the GULP model, and we have received no objections (either to the
content or the terminology).

So I propose that we add the GULP model (as described in the message
quoted below by Julian) into RFC2518bis, and use that as the basis
for our locking discussions.

Lisa: Could you make this update?  (Julian, Jason, or I would be happy
to help, if you are pressed for time).  This will significantly
improve our ability to make progress with other protocol extensions
that need to define their interactions with locks (i.e. we can stop
discussing what might appear in 2518bis, and instead just refer to what
is said in 2518bis).

Cheers,
Geoff

   I thought we had agreement that GULP is the currently best approach of
   explaining the WebDAV locking model. GULP also covers binds (implicitly!)
   and therefore either should be added to RFC2518bis, or be the basis for a
   rewrite:
