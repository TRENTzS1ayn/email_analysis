RFC2518 extends HTTP, and HTTP allows multiple URLs to be mapped to the same
resource.

Well, yes. The RFCs should describe server behaviour, not their internals.

Correct.

Locks apply both to resources and URLs (as clarified by GULP), and always
did.

Property operations *always* apply to resources, and there really is no
exception to that rule.

The URL can only be a property of a resource if the system explicitly
restricts itself to only single bindings. You can't have both multiple
bindings, and also treat the URL as a property of the resource at the same
time.
