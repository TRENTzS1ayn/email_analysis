An important thing to keep in mind is that we do not
expect all repositories to be capable of supporting the BIND
method (in particular, the creation of multiple bindings to
a collection).  But we do require that a repository that
supports the BIND method also supports atomic DELETE/MOVE.

Just for interests sake, how many examples are there of
repositories that do support multiple bindings to a collection
but cannot support atomic DELETE/MOVE?

Cheers,
Geoff

What you are implying is correct.
If a child is locked via a WebDAV lock and the binding to be DELETEd is
protected by the protected URL of that lock, then it can't be unmapped.
If the inode of the child is locked, then I believe it can be unmapped.
If it's locked by a Win32 lock then it probably can't be unmapped in
the file system, so it's probably best to reject the DELETE at the
WebDAV layer.

If we're talking about webdav's locks, it should be handleable inside the
server and it should be manageable.  If we're talking about
 a file system lock, then it might depend on the OS.  I
believe on Linux for example that it doesn't matter if an inode is locked.
The resource can move/delete and the resource remains locked and file
handles
are not broken.  In the
case of Win32, you probably can go through the same process as the
Win32 CMD.EXE MOVE command does.  It does take a few seconds
looking for locks in descendents in large trees... but I assume it also
deals with locks
being created while it's looking.  If that MOVE succeeds, then that binding
should be WebDAV DELETE'able.  If that MOVE is rejected, then you
probably will need to reject the WebDAV bind-enabled DELETE.
