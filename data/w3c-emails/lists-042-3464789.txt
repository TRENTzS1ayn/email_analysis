Well, just because it's simpler doesn't necessarily make it an acceptable
model (acceptable to everybody, that is).

I don't think we want to say that.

Some servers will want to implement DELETE as simply removing the binding,
others will want to ensure that they can also cleanup all members (and fail
if they can't). I think both models make sense, and that the presence of
support for an explicit BIND call doesn't really indicate that the former
model always applies. It certainly doesn't for the Unix file system (rmdir()
is only allowed for empty directories) and our system.
