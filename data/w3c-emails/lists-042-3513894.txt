I don't think the bindings specification makes clear what you've just
said here. It's probably because you've internalized a data model that's
been discussed on the list, and are making conclusions based on the
model.  This kind of information should be added to the specification,
because even when models are written down, they can easily be
interpreted differently by newcomers.
