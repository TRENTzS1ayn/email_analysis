Could you expand on "more complex than that"?

It is my understanding that there are implementations that
permit (or even mandate) that the DAV:displayname property
vary depending on URL.  For instance, imagine if you have two
different bindings to the same resource, say

    http://example.com/foo.html
    http://example.com/bar.html

and display names which are the respective names of the resource,
"foo.html" and "bar.html".  Are you saying that such implementations
would not be compliant with respect to 2518?

Perhaps "URL properties" isn't the right term, but what is?
In the face of bindings, "URL properties" are those properties
which are (potentially) effected by operations on bindings, where
"resource properties" are not effected by such operations.
