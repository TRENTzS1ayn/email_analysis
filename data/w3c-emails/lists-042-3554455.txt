GULP should not cover bindings.  That's the problem.  It causes a
problem because some RFC2518 servers just don't work that way.  There's
no need to say whether operations apply always to URLs, bindings or
resources in RFC2518, because when you have 1:1 mappings between URLs
and resources it just doesn't matter 95% of the time, and lets
implementations expose their existing repository.

Otherwise, I think there is a lot of useful specification language in
GULP.
