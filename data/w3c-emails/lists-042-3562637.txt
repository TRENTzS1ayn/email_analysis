Yes. Clearly they aren't. RFC2518 never talked about "URL properties".
DAV:displayname is a property of the resource, and therefore it must be
independant of the URL through which the property is accessed.

BTW: I'm not aware of implementations that actually support multiple
bindings and show this behaviour.

My understanding is that "URL properties" simply do not exist.
