Several points that Jason made here were implementation issues
(e.g. Win32 locking, and file system mappings), so those points
are not something that would appear in the spec.

The other statement he made is just locking functionality defined
by RFC2518, not something new introduced by the binding protocol.
As Julian has pointed out, multiple mappings to the same resource
is part of HTTP, and was inherited by WebDAV, not something new
defined by the binding protocol.  So multiple bindings have always
existed in WebDAV.  The binding protocol just gives a client a way
to create them.

Cheers,
Geoff

I don't think the bindings specification makes clear what you've just
said here. It's probably because you've internalized a data model that's
been discussed on the list, and are making conclusions based on the
model.  This kind of information should be added to the specification,
because even when models are written down, they can easily be
interpreted differently by newcomers.
