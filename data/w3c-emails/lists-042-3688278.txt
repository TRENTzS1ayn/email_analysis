Actually, I'd have to remove code.

The issue isn't that the server can't *technically* do this -- it's that the
this semantics isn't compatible with the existing DELETE semantics of our
system. Just removing the collection binding without checking that all
internal members may be deleted as well simply is *not* an option.

So basically we have the choice between

- supporting multiple bindings, but not the BIND method described in the
draft, or
- simply ignore this requirement.

I'd rather have a spec that I can implement without having to break a
specific requirement (in particular if i'm not convinced it adds value to my
use case).
