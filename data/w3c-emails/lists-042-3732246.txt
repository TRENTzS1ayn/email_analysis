It may be compliant to RFC2518, but it may not be compliant to other
non-WebDAV semantics of the server. Previously the server *was* able to
support them, now it can't anymore.

Again: it's not a question of avoiding new code. A server that claims to
understand bindings will need to have all the proper code in place anway.
The question is whether the particular DELETE semantics is *desired*.

Gentleman, we're (or at least some of us :-) aren't building servers just
for fun, or only to implement specific RFCs. They also need to support
private/proprietary semantics as well. WebDAV is just an (or another) open
protocol that allows accessing these systems. Putting specific requirements
into the specs that can't be implemented by these systems just means that
these systems will

- break the specs (leading to interop surprises),
- do not offer the functionality through HTTP methods or
- come up with proprietary protocol extensions.

I think it's highly desirable to avoid this, and IMHO the solution is to
give servers enough freedom so that they can make WebDAV and internal
semantics compatible. Just like RFC2518 did.
