Okay, so I'll stop talking about symbolic links :-)

If there are multiple bindings to a collection and a WebDAV request asks
you do DELETE one of them, will your server end up deleting all the
descenent bindings also... or just the one requested?

Is it not possible to freeze the system while your system checks this?
Perhaps in a way similar to the way the Win32 has to before it allows
a MOVE.  In its case, is seems to find it acceptable to delay while
it's checking this.  It can cause a delay of a few seconds, but apparently
the folks that implemented that found it acceptable.

Or I suppose, "not allow multiple bindings to collections?"

The other day I ran in to this in a non-WebDAV situation.  I tried to move
a huge
directory.  I found it frustrating to find that it was moving the files one
at a time and
ran in to a problem and left me with two partial trees.  (This was across
file systems.)
I would have been similarly, although less problematically, frustrated if
it had been
a delete request.
