GULP is actually pretty short, so I probably wouldn't mind
adding a copy to the binding protocol *if* we get consensus
that GULP correctly defines the WebDAV locking semantics.
What I don't want to have happen is for the binding protocol
to become a draft standard and then have RFC-2518bis decide
that some GULP variant is needed, and have the binding RFC
conflict with 2518bis RFC (with the resulting interoperability
problems inevitably appearing).

So I'll take this opportunity to again ask everyone to either
explicitly support the current GULP proposal, or identify any
problems in semantics or terminology, so we can get this 
language committed to 2518bis ASAP.

Cheers,
Geoff

Given that I think that the binding draft needs to be more
explicit about the behavior of locks, what would be so awful
about including some of GULP?
