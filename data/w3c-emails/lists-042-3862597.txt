Brian,

in the Unix API, you don't move at all -- you link() then unlink(). "mv" is
just a user command that does it's best when the files reside in different
partitions. I think WebDAV MOVE should just fail if the resource cannot
really be moved (preserving all dead & live properties), and fail otherwise.
Just like in the Unix API, the caller *then* can decide to do a COPY/DELETE
instead.
