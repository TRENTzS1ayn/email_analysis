Well, I consider this a bug. It's not supported by the spec.

The Webfolder client indeed displays the displayname instead of the last URI
segment when present (and even uses in in the "href" column instead of the
real URI). This works well when

- the last part of the displayname consistently is identical to the last URI
segment (mod. URI escaping) (IIS)
- DAV:displayname is just a dead property that most of the time isn't set
(moddav)

The easiest fix is not to return a DAV:displayname when there is no specific
one. Apache/moddav shows that this works, and I'm not aware of any Microsoft
client failing in this case.

If we consider this an interop problem, we should deprecate DAV:displayname
(because that's the only way to "fix" the webfolder client) and come up with
a new property with the same semantics.
