I've always thought this was against the spirit of the WebDAV
specification. However, I don't think it can be considered a bug.
RFC2518 doesn't require displayname to have a particular value, or to be
writable, or to be empty.

Yeah, this is what WFS does, I believe we consciously mimicked IIS in
order to work well with Web Folders.

Do you know what happens when it is set to some value other than the
last URI segment?  Does any client get confused when the URI ends in
"index.html" but the displayname shows "Index of files here"?

More interestingly, what happens if there are two resources in a
collection which have the same resourcename -- does this confuse the
client deeply?

That might be cool. Exchange 2000 uses a "subject" property across many
types of resources (emails, appointments, maybe even Office documents)
to serve as a truly user-displayable value or "friendly name".  Its
value is not unique within a collection, so multiple emails in the same
folder can have the subject "RE: response to comment ...".  And it is
writable, not protected, yet it is given a default value selected by the
server when the resource is created, so that a collection doesn't show a
lot of blank friendly names.
