Nope. A symbolic link is a different resource than the resource it's
pointing to. It can exist while it's target is removed. It can be created
although it's target doesn't exist. It doesn't track it's target.
Technically it does have it's own properties and ACLs. This is not what the
BIND spec describes.

Yes and no. Staying with the Unix terminology: hard (true) links and
symbolic links are very different things. The BIND spec basically defines
the HTTP equivalent of hard links. The (unfinished) redirect reference spec
does specify the equivalent of symbolic links. If you want to base your
linking implementation on symbolic links, the bind spec clearly isn't the
right spec for you.

Nobody ever said that the binding spec can be the only protocol extension
that describes links. As I said there *is* a companion spec that is closer
to symbolic links which is the redirect ref spec [1]. We are discussing the
BIND spec right now because

- RFC3253 more or less requires it, and
- somebody (Geoff) volunteered to pick up the abandoned draft and invest the
time to drive it to completion.

I absolutely agree that the BIND spec doesn't address all linking scenarios
(just as hard links don't), and we (SAP/greenbytes) implement the (old)
redirect ref spec as well. We intend to drive the redirect ref spec to
completion as soon as time permits (in particular once we manage to get the
other two advanced collectiom drafts -- BIND and ordering -- out of the
door).
