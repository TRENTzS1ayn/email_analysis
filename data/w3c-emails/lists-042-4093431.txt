Just a couple thoughts that I'm not going to have time to join in a
coherent manner...

My initial opinion when I saw this posting a day ago was that RENAME wasn't
necessary.  I don't recall now why I said that.   It might just have been
that it's less
necessary than DELETE... but the recent case of the deletion before MOVE
overwrite
would change that view.  If I recall any other reason why I thought RENAME
wasn't
necessary, I'll speak up.

I'm okay with UNBIND (and I can explain why later) except...

We have shown that atomic DELETE it should be
implementable and the case of a partially finished MOVE with overwrite
looks
really bad to me.  I'm not sure we should let servers do that.   (I have an
equivocating thought on this that I'll hold in reserve. :-))  So if they
can
implement the apparently atomic DELETE for MOVE, then they should be
able to do it for DELETE itself.

Previously we've discussed both headers and UNBIND.  They were rejected.
I don't recall why though, so we probably should check on that.
