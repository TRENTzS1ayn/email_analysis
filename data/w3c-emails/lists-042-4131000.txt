No, that's not the goal (at least I don't think so).

Correct. The overhead my be ok in a local fs, probably is problematic with a
network filesystem, and won't be acceptable for WebDAV.

Yes and no. I really think that there may be separate use case that require
separate solutions.

A client should be able to request a MOVE operation that will fail if the
server can't support full MOVE semantics (for instance by changing the
DAV:resource-id property). A client would then be able to reconsider,
possibly issuing a COPY/DELETE sequence instead.

Hopefully we can agree that this type of request should be supported. If we
do, we're left with the alternatives of making this the standard behaviour
for the RFC2518 MOVE, or to invent some new marshalling. I'd prefer the
former, but I probably could live with the latter.

A similar problem obviously exists with the DELETE collection atomicity
issue.
