OK, I rephrase it: that would mean that a resource is *allowed* to vary
based on the request URL. I don't think we all agree on that.

OK, this means that we'll have to clarify the "sameness" of property values.
If a property value is a relative URI, it's to be resolved against the
request URL. If they resolve to the same absoluteURI, the property value is
the same.

RFC2518bis issue: the spec normatively refers to RFC2616's term "URI", but
RFC2616 does not formally define it. We need to rephrase this using the BNF
terms URIreference and absoluteURI.

Our (Geoff's any my) understanding is that there *are* no URL properties. A
URL property would be something that varies with the request URL (under the
relaxed "sameness" definition stated above).
