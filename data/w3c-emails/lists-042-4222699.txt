Geoff,

thanks for the update. I think this will allow us to make progress towards
getting the spec finished.

A server may want to implement *parts* of the binding spec without actually
allowing the explicit creation of new bindings. In particular, supporting
DAV:resource-id seems to be a very useful thing even if a server doesn't
plan to support *multiple* bindings.
