I think the "SHOULD" gives the implementor enough leeway in this
case, so it would be better to leave it in its slightly simpler
current form.

Cheers,

Geoff,

in 2.5 you say:

"If the destination collection of a MOVE request supports the REBIND method
(see Section 6), a MOVE of a resource into that collection SHOULD be
implemented as a REBIND request.  In this case, applying a MOVE to a
Request-URI and a Destination URI has the effect of removing a binding to a
resource (at the Request-URI), and creating a new binding to that resource
(at the Destination URI)."
I think it's a bit more complicated than that. For instance, if a WebDAV
server is implemented on top of a Unix file system (using inode numbers to
compute a part of the DAV:resource-id property), a target collection may
indeed support REBIND, but not for all resources that are served by the
server (in case it serves files from different filesystem partitions).

So, how about something like:

"If the destination collection of a MOVE request supports the REBIND method
(...) for a request specifying the MOVE request URL as DAV:href...."
