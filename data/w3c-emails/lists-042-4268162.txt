Brian:

These are the kinds of issues that led us to remove any discussion
of PROPFIND from the bindings draft.  My conclusion is that our best
approach is to leave it up to 2518bis to define generically
how property values behave in the presence of multiple URL mappings
to the same resource (since that is base WebDAV functionality, not
something introduced by the binding spec), and the binding draft
will focus on the semantics it introduces (such as the DAV:resource-id
property, whose behavior in the presence of multiple URL mappings is
defined).

The binding spec can then focus on the semantics that it is introducing,
i.e. client creation of multiple URL mappings, the resource-id property,
and atomic MOVE/DELETE via REBIND/UNBIND.

Cheers,
Geoff

If we allow the entity to vary based on the URL, what exactly can I rely to
be constant? What's the point of having the concept of "same" resource then?

Yes.

Properties right now do not distinguish between resource properties and
entity properties. That's a design bug inherited from the HTTP header
mechanism. I don't think there's an easy way to fix this.
