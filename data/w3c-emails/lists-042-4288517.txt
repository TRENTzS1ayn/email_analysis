Sorry to be a pain, but the reason we say that we are splitting in to
DELETE and UNBIND is
because some people claim that clients prefer the non-atomic DELETE
functionality.    But the
new bindings document says that if the server can implement UNBIND, then
DELETE should
be implemented that way.    This leaves me scratching my head.

1) Do users ever want the old DELETE functionality if they can have UNBIND?

2) If we really believe that they do, why do we suggest that the server do
the UNBIND anyway?

It sounds like we really haven't decided (1).   Let's really decide that
and then spec this to match
what we resolve.
