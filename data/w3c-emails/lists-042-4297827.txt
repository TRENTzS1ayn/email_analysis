I think so. Where it's not really (only) about what the user (client) wants,
but it also depends on what the server is willing to offer. It maybe
technically possible to implement UNBIND (that's very likely if you have a
proper BIND implementation), yet still undesired.

Do we? I think what the spec says is that if a server supports UNBIND on a
collection, DELETE should behave the same. So the choice is on the server's
side. This doesn't give the *client* the ability to decide, though. Do we
need that?
