Julian,

We are in agreement here.

Even if a server is able (or desirable) to support atomic operations
in some cases, there needs to be a way for these servers to communicate
to clients when an atomic operation cannot be performed so that
the client can retry using the non-atomic operation (if so desired).
MOVEs across unix file systems are one example, but (as Jason pointed
out to my off-line), so are cross-repository MOVEs in the case of
cross-repository bindings.  A client has no way to know beforehand
whether a cross-repository MOVE will succeed, but may want to attempt
one before performing a COPY/DELETE instead.
