I still vote for "SHOULD".  In particular, given the problems
partial DELETE and partial MOVE can produce in a multiple binding
context, a server that supports multiple bindings to a resource
SHOULD do those operations atomically unless it
has a very good reason to do otherwise (e.g. the scenario I
posted earlier).

Cheers,
Geoff

I think Brian is right here. SHOULD is really strong in RFC-speak, and if we
really expect servers to show this behaviour, ir probably needs to be
specified as "MAY".
