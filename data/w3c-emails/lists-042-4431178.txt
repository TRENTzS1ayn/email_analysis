Actually, collection MOVE suffers from the same problems as collection
DELETE.  Here are some of them.
 - You can't MOVE a file you don't have permission to write. Therefore,
the server must check write privileges on all descendants.
 - A WebDAV application server may be used to unify a number of back-end
storage servers under the same namespace.  So the server's URL
http://www.example.com/software/ may contain files stored on
//davfiles/software, whereas the server's URL
http://www.example.com/userdocs/ may contain files stored on
//davfiles/userdocs.  A server moving a collection from one of these
top-level-directories to the other would have to do a network
cross-repository move under the covers. This may not be feasible to do
atomically.
