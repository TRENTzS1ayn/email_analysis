I think I disagree. I *can* MOVE a resource without having write permissions
to the resource itself. What I need is the write permission on source and
targer collection (+ some more when overwriting something else).

Sure.

Yes, that's why many people would prefer it to fail (leaving the client the
choice to explicitly COPY/DELETE) rather than doing something the client
din't really want.
