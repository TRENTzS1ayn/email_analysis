I think what Geoff is saying that the BIND spec *can* tighten RFC2518(bis)
requirements. A server has the freedom not to claim BIND spec support, and
then won't be affected (just like some people want to tighten RFC2616
requirements in RFC2518bis... :-)

What is (or was) open to discussion whether servers may want to support

- multiple bindings
- BIND live properties
- BIND MOVE semantics

without supporting UNBIND semantics (or actually without supporting UNBIND
semantics on the *last* binding to a collection). That's what we planned to
do in our server, and I think this behaviour should be allowed.

Making the "new" behaviour explicit in UNBIND/REBIND instead of DELETE/MOVE
allows a server to support clients that are only RFC2518-aware as before,
yet offers newer clients the ability to rely on the tightened semantics (or
reliably get the request failed if the semantics cannot be offered).

Coming back to the new methods:

REBIND/MOVE: I think everybody agrees that it would be a good if new clients
could request a resource MOVE that will leave all dead and live properties
intact. If we can't put that into RFC2518-MOVE, we'll need a new way of
marshall the request. Do we have consensus here?

UNBIND/DELETE: I think there was some confusion here about why people did
not like requiring DELETE to use UNBIND semantics. If a server *does*
support multiple bindings, DELETEing one of many bindings indeed should only
remove that binding, and thus be atomic (does anybody disagree here?). I
only have an issue to require this particular semantics for the *last*
binding to a collection (in which case I'd prefer to use the old RFC2518
DELETE semantics).
