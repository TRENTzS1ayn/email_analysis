Hi,
I don't have time to follow the discussion in detail at the moment
but this post provokes a comment.

Goeff, I don't think your scenario is valid for our discussion.
If no lock had existed then all information would have been deleted.
So for the folks that still are his friends JEFF/* would be "completely" trashed.
Would have this have been a better or worse situation for them ?
IMHO this usecase doesn't say anything about the "badness" of
"best effort deletion".
Either jeff gives jim and henry the rights to delete JEFF/* even if it's shared, or
he doesn't allow it. It's jeffs decision.

Cheers, Edgar
