RFC2518 says about UNLOCK:

"The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in the
Lock-Token request header from the Request-URI, and all other resources
included in the lock. If all resources which have been locked under the
submitted lock token can not be unlocked then the UNLOCK request MUST fail.
"

So I think GULP only repeats what RFC2518 has been saying all the time (BTW:
this is issue UNLOCK_WHAT_URL on the open issues list).

I'd prefer

"when it appears in an If header tagged-list whose tag is the lock-root of
the lock, or if it appears in an untagged list and the request-URL is the
lock-root of the lock".

No. The *shallow* lock on a collection locks it's member URLs. If the lock
on the collection isn't deep, you can modify internal members without the
lock token, as long as you don't change their name (affecting the state of
the collection itself).
