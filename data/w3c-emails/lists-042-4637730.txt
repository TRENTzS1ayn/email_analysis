I second what Jason said -- based on the lack of client support for
"propertybehavior" I'd like to see a couple client implementors say they
would implement a feature which would allow them to choose, on some
servers supporting atomic MOVE/DELETE, whether to force that behavior or
not.  

A light-weight approach is that since some servers will be atomic and
some won't, merely define some string in a header or body in response to
OPTIONS which says "I do atomic delete always" or "I don't always do
atomic delete".  Clients may or may not use that information, but at
least it's really easy for a server to advertise.
