What Geoff describes is very very very bad.  But I hope that even the
folks that can't implement atomic DELETE are not considering making
their incremental delete this broken.   Even if you can't implement
atomic delete, you still can't delete bindings that would still be
accessable after you did it atomically if you could.    If this prohibition
is
not clear from the spec, then the spec needs to be fixed.

I tend to agree, but it sounds like it might be for a different reason
than what I think you're saying below. (omitted)  My reason is mentioned
above.
It basically is that I think (hope) that no server is considering doing
what Geoff mentions and the non-atomic folks are only considering
something more benign if they can't do the DELETE atomicly.  I'm
hoping that the discussion is only "that more benign behavior" vs
"true atomic DELETE".
