   RFC2518 says about UNLOCK:

   "The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in
   the Lock-Token request header from the Request-URI, and all other
   resources included in the lock. If all resources which have been
   locked under the submitted lock token can not be unlocked then the
   UNLOCK request MUST fail.  "

   So I think GULP only repeats what RFC2518 has been saying all the
   time (BTW: this is issue UNLOCK_WHAT_URL on the open issues list).

Yes, this was just echoing what appeared to be in 2518.  I'd probably
go with the tighter restriction (i.e. the client must issue the UNLOCK
against the URL that was specified in the LOCK request), but either
one is fine with me.  Since this issue is already been tracked, I
suggest we handle this issue independently of GULP (the change to GULP
is obvious and trivial, i.e. replace "either directly or indirectly"
with just "directly").

   I'd prefer

   "when it appears in an If header tagged-list whose tag is the lock-root
of
   the lock, or if it appears in an untagged list and the request-URL is the
   lock-root of the lock".

I agree this change should be made, and I prefer Julian's rewording, as
it is more precise.  I'll post a new version of GULP with this change.

   No. The *shallow* lock on a collection locks it's member URLs. If
   the lock on the collection isn't deep, you can modify internal
   members without the lock token, as long as you don't change their
   name (affecting the state of the collection itself).

Julian is correct.  If the lock is deep, then the first phrase of
of this section handles the lock on the content of the member
resource.

Cheers,
