BTW... I just had an interesting thought about MOVE's across file systems.
We've been talking about having to do that as a COPY/DELETE.  And on
occasion
we've said that it truly isn't necessary to actually move the resource
implementations as long as they respond at the right URL's.  For the most
part though, that comment has felt a bit academic to me.

Anyway... the thought I just wanted to point out is that if you have a
resource on one file system with multiple bindings to it, and you MOVE
that resource via one of those bindings "to another file system"...
you might actually want to NOT "copy/delete" it since you still also have
several bindings to it from the original file system.  You might
*need* to keep a cross file system binding and not necessarily
move implementations around during MOVE/BIND and other
namespace operations.  And if you're forced to support cross
file system bindings, then perhaps you never really need to take the
COPY/DELETE approach?

Anyway... it's just a stray thought.  :-)
