I don't understand this statement.

We might have to accept that for the single binding cases and encourage
them
to do better, but if they don't
support cross-file system bindings and they do a move to another file
system
and the source resource also has additional bindings to it from the
original file
system, then the request MUST be rejected.   If it is not, the server can
not claim
to support the bind spec.
