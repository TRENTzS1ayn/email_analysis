That would be fine with me as well.

Just to be clear, this means the binding spec would state:

A server that supports BIND MUST implement MOVE/DELETE with
rebind/unbind semantics.  We will also define a parameter to
MOVE/DELETE that allows a user to explicitly request the
"best effort" style processing (that is OK because the user is
explicitly stating that trashing multiple binding semantics is
what they want).

Cheers,
Geoff

On the other hand, a system that allows a "weak" MOVE if and only if there
aren't any multiple bindings seems very weird to me. So maybe we should
consider make MOVE "strong" by default, and only allow the old COPY/DELETE
semantics upon specific request?
