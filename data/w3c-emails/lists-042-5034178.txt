I don't think we need more than 5 minutes for the
ordering draft.  I believe there are no outstanding
issues, so this is likely to go something like:
 "any new issues?"
 "no?"
 "ok then, the next topic is ..."

The binding protocol will probably need a good 15 minutes
to discuss the latest proposal for resolving the
MOVE/DELETE semantics.  We could go as long as 30 minutes
if other issues are raised, and could be as short as
10 minutes if time is in short supply.

Eric or I would be happy to lead the ACL discussion.
I believe most of the issues are details
that have been resolved on the mailing list, but it
would be good to review them before last call.

Cheers,
Geoff
