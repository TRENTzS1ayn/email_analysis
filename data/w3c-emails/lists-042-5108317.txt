Do you have a proposal how we can refer to the specs, and still allow
subsetting (allowing rejection of internal entities)?

Indeed.

So I must take back what I said: the problem is known but has *not* been
considered yet in the draft.

Jason, Lisa: we badly need to add this to the issues list and fix it in the
next draft.

(the issue being: recursive entity declarations can be used for effective
DOS attacks, and thus WebDAV MUST allow servers to reject these kind of
requests, even though they may be well-formed).
