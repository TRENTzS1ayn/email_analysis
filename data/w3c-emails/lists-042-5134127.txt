If we go with this wording, could we include a reference to the section
that
defines what "lock discovery" is.   I did a quick search of the 2518bis and
I don't think that's clear.  We don't need to redefine it, but a pointer to
the
definition we're refering to would be good.

I'd vote for leaving the old text.

I think Lisa pointed it out, but the spec doesn't talk about URI
protection.  This
section is probably a good place to mention it.   Geoff came up with some
wording that I don't have handy now.  He and I disagreed with whether we
should say that lock protection is for write locks or just locks.
Anyway...

The Effect of Locks on URL Mappings
    The resource located at the request-URI of the LOCK request MUST remain
at that URI until the lock is removed via UNLOCK or until an operation with
the
proper lock-token header alters or destroys that mapping.  This contraint
insures
that the principal that locked the resource will be able to find that
resource at the
same location as long as it holds the lock.

Feel free to offer a better wording.

Interesting.  Has this been discussed and resolved?  (It just seems a bit
odd.)

I actually like it telling me (the reader) this explicitly.

I do agree that it should not be described more than once in 2518.  A
reference to
a single place in the same document is fine with me.

We might as well also say what 303 is just so that folks don't have to
go searching for it.  "302 (Found) and 303 (whatever)..."

I have no preference... unless we have
a reason to want to know what URI mapping
is protected.  If we do, then it should apply
even to depth 0 locks.

FWIW... there is some sort of quotation
marks around "rooted" in that section on that
html page that don't show up
right on my browsers.

I guess this is fine, although I think "this document" might be ambiguous.
Perhaps,
"this spec".

I support what Lisa has added until we show that saying this is a bad idea.

I tend to think 18.6 isn't necessary.  I'm not heavily in to a lot of this
sort of thing
any more, but even to me it seems obvious.

I tend to think the first part of section 19 is no longer necessary.  It's
not quite
accurate and the information isn't really important and it's well known to
anyone
that has had to deal with XML namespaces... which will be everyone reading
this.
