Right.

I think I originally wrote this when I hadn't thought through the
implications of multiple bindings to locks. The idea was to break old,
mis-behaving clients (that do not use the WebDAV XML extensibility rules)
only when we must (i.e., when it was collection lock with depth != 0).

So yes, DAV:lockroot should always be present.
