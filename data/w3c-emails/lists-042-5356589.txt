Hi Brian,

I just re-read the current draft and I think it's a significant step into
the right direction.

However, I think the draft can be made much easier to read and more generic,
without harming the "client experience". Here's my proposal:


1) Properly define the technical term "quota space", and use it when
describing the live properties. The definition should be similar to what
RFC3010 uses, and I think the text from the description for
DAV:quota-used-bytes can be used as a basis:

"   The DAV:quota-used-bytes value is the value in octets representing
   the amount of space used by this file or directory and possibly a
   number of other similar files or directories, where the set of
   osimilaro meets at least the criterion that allocating space to any
   file or directory in the set will count against the quota-limit.  It
   MUST include the total count including usage derived from sub-
   resources if appropriate.  It SHOULD include metadata storage size
   if metadata storage is counted against the quota-limit.   "


2) Then simply define (for *any* resource):

DAV:quota-limit-bytes: number of octets that has been assigned to the
currently authenticated user in the quota-space in which the resource
identified by the request URL resides.

DAV:quota-used-bytes: number of octets that have been allocated towards the
limit above (again in the quota-space in which the resource identified by
the request URL resides).

(keeping the language that gives servers a lot of freedom how to count)

This should give clients all the information they need to display the
"percentage used" thingy.


3) The new draft introduces a new optional property DAV:quota-assigned-bytes
that seems to be used to support implementations where quota spaces can be
nested, so for example /A/B resides in a different quota space than /A. I'd
really like to understand whether this really requires a new property, or
whether the simple model above would suffice for this as well.
