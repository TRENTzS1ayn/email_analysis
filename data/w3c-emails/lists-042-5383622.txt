I couldn't find the term "quota space" in 3010 at all.  What definition
in 3010 are you thinking of?

Personally, I think I'd rather we stick with the definitions
pulled from RFC3010.  They seem pretty clear to me.

Hmm, that was only intended as an example (and is identified as such), 
not
as an implementation requirement.  I'll add another example so that this
isn't confusing.

DAV:quota-assigned-bytes is merely to support implementations that allow
quota to be PROPPATCHed.  I'll try to make that clearer as well.
