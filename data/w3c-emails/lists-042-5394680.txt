Right, RFC3010 doesn't define the term, but it uses the concept. I just
think that it makes sense to give the concept a name:

         The value in bytes which represent the amount of disc space
         used by this file or directory and possibly a number of other
         similar files or directories, where the set of "similar" meets
         at least the criterion that allocating space to any file or
         directory in the set will reduce the "quota_avail_hard" of
         every other file or directory in the set.

         Note that there may be a number of distinct but overlapping
         sets of files or directories for which a quota_used value is
         maintained. E.g. "all files with a given owner", "all files
         with a given group owner". etc.

         The server is at liberty to choose any of those sets but should
         do so in a repeatable way.  The rule may be configured per-
         filesystem or may be "choose the set with the smallest quota".

So basically, a "quota space" is the set of resources that share the same
quota.

For the record, i'm absolutely in favor to stick with the definitions from
RFC3010. Why don't we just steal them verbatim, or just refer to 3010?

IMHO,

         The value in bytes which represents the amount of additional
         disk space that can be allocated to this file or directory
         before the user may reasonably be warned.  It is understood
         that this space may be consumed by allocations to other files
         or directories though there is a rule as to which other files
         or directories.

is very clear (we may have to map some terms though). If we stick with this
language it's also much clearer why the distinction between plain resources
and collections (and other types) really doesn't make sense at all -- I'd
prfer the spec not to say anything about that.

That didn't come through. Now it reads:

   The value of this property will usually be protected, although a
   user with sufficient privileges may be permitted to change the
   value.  The property is useful even if it is protected.  A 403
   Forbidden response is RECOMMENDED for attempts to write a protected
   property.

That sounds as if *usually* the property is read-only.

BTW: why do we need an additional property for that?
