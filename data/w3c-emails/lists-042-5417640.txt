In theory, this makes a lot of sense (UNLOCK should be applied to the URL to
which the original LOCK request was sent).

In practice, old clients that want to break a lock (after finding it using
lock discovery) may get into trouble by that change (if it is a change),
because in RFC2518, there was no cheap way to find the root of a lock.

Note that issue "UNLOCK_WHAT_URL" (on the issues list) says that you can use
any of the URLs protected by the lock.
