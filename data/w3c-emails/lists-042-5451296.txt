If current clients depend on the "can unlock
with the URL of indirectly locked resources",
then I believe we can address Julian's concern with 
an interoperability note that states "for interoperability
with older clients, a server MAY automatically redirect
an UNLOCK on an indirectly locked resource to the
lock root URL of that lock.

Note: We should also include in 2518bis the motivation for
this restriction; namely, that it prevents a client from
mistakenly unlocking an entire tree of resources when all
it wanted to do (and all it thought it was doing) was
unlocking one of the members of that tree of resources.

Cheers,
Geoff

In theory, this makes a lot of sense (UNLOCK should be applied to the URL to
which the original LOCK request was sent).

In practice, old clients that want to break a lock (after finding it using
lock discovery) may get into trouble by that change (if it is a change),
because in RFC2518, there was no cheap way to find the root of a lock.

Note that issue "UNLOCK_WHAT_URL" (on the issues list) says that you can use
any of the URLs protected by the lock.
