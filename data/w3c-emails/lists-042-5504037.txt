I wonder if this equation holds true when "disk space" gets low. Say you
have 10 GB of space on the server, you have 10 users and each user
has a quota of 1GB. You add an 11th user also with 1GB quota (or an
administrator puts a 1GB sized resource).

Now, when the free space on the server goes below 1GB, the above
equation will not tell you how large a file you can PUT. That problem
seems to be avoided in 3010 with "quota_avail_*".
