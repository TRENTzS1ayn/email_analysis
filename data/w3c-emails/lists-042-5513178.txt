I think it's useful if and only if we use it consistently to define the
quota properties (see below).

I think now we're confusing marshalling and implementations.

I agree that it would be confusing when the "available" value keeps changing
due to rounding issues. However, that's an effect of the underlying
implementation, not how the numbers are sent to the client. If a server
really decides to *compute* the total (I really can't imagine why it would),
changing the marshalling format will not change anything.

Why would a server allow a user to change his own quota??? That really seems
to be an adminstrator-only feature.

If this is the case, there's still a major problem with the quota system you
describe.

Before we continue this thread, let's talk about whether the spec should
actually describe server behaviour at all. As far as I remember the
discussion in January, all that client implementors want is the ability to
describe a ratio of used / available, and possibly the ability to discover
the amount of storage a single resource takes. If we only need this, the
spec can be much shorter.

On the other hand, if the spec is going to define what quotas are and how
they behave, it needs to be compatible with more than a single
implementation, and you'll have to define why and how these two different
value may vary. Right now, I  honestly don't understand it.
