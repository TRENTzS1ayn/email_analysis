Just for interests sake, is there any client that acts significantly
differently if it were to receive a 4xx response instead of a 5xx
response?  If not, this question is merely an aesthetic quibble (:-).

But the advantage of an aesthetic quibble is that everyone can join in
without risk of being proven wrong (:-), so my 2 cents say that 4xx is
more consistent with the currently defined 4xx and 5xx messages.  In
particular, 413 (Request Entity Too Large) seems quite close to this
condition, while there is no 5xx condition that is nearly as close.

Cheers,
Geoff

Julian, 
I agree with 1) on 2) are you talking about quotas? If so you are correct
but disk space is still 507, IMHO.
