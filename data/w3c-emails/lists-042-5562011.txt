Yes there is a client that handles those responses quite differently.

The Mac OS X WebDAV file system client translates 507 to ENOSPC (No 
space left on device) which is interpreted by most Macintosh 
applications to mean the device is full; the WebDAV file system 
translates 413 as a generic 4xx response to EINVAL (Invalid argument) 
which is interpreted by most Macintosh applications to mean "something 
wasn't right - who knows what?"

The Mac OS X WebDAV file system client is one of the few clients 
actually using quotas today and has been for over 1-1/2 years now.
