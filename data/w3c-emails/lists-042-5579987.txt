I was just answering the question "is there any client that acts 
significantly differently if it were to receive a 4xx response instead 
of a 5xx response?" The short answer is "yes."

However, the quota properties our client uses today have different 
property names than the properties in draft-ietf-webdav-quota-01.txt, 
so when things are nailed down, I'll have to change our code to use the 
new property names. When I do that, I can change the way status codes 
are handled if needed.
