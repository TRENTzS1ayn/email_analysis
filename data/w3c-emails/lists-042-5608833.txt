Any error can be "resolved" by changing the request to something
else that doesn't fail, so that can't be the criterion used to
distinguish a 4xx from a 5xx.  All that sections 10.4 and 10.5 say
are: 

"The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the
 client seems to have erred."

"Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in
 which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of
 performing the request."

So requests that are malformed are clearly 4xx errors, but
most other error cases are ambiguous, because looking at the
error one way, the client erred in asking the server to do something
it couldn't do (e.g. create a larger file than is permitted), but
looking at them another way, the server erred by not (or by being
incapable of) performing the specified request (e.g. create the large
file).

Cheers,
Geoff

I'd refer back to rfc2616's language in sections 10.4 "Client Error 
4xx" and 10.5 "Server Error 5xx". 4xx is for errors the server thinks 
can be resolved by changes in the client's request, and 5xx is for 
errors the server thinks are caused by something server-side.
