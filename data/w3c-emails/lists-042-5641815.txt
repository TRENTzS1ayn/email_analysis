To help us in our categorization of errors, could you describe
how does a web spider responds differently to a 4xx or a 5xx?

Also, although it is good to know that one way is compliant and the
other is not (:-), it would be helpful to have some criteria to
to actually make that determination.  In particular, how do you
distinguish a client error category (making a bad request) from a
server error category (not satisfying a valid client request).
There are some obvious
cases (a syntactically ill-formed request), but many of the others
could fall in either category (the quota errors, in particular).

Cheers,
Geoff

Yes, web spiders that perform maintenance.

Yes. One way is HTTP compliant; the other is not.
