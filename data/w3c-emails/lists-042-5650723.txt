They have different correction procedures.  If you get a 5xx error,
header fields like retry-after become effective and further errors
are directed to the server administrator.  A 4xx error, OTOH, is
directed to the page owner of the referencing page or mechanism
that generated the request.  A 5xx is never seen as a failure of
the author of a reference.

If the same identical request might succeed were it not for a
limitation on the server handling the request, then it is a 5xx.
Basically, there is nothing wrong with the request.

Not really.  If the request would have succeeded but did not due
to an addition of bytes exceeding quota, then it is a 5xx.
If the request alone is sending a body greater than the quota max
(disregarding other content on the server), then the correct
response is not quota-exceeded but rather 413 (Request Entity Too
Large).

I haven't encountered a case that wasn't obvious.  I have encountered
many cases where extensions have tried to say too many different
things with one status code when two would be clearer.
