Julian,

I was thinking that physical disk limits are just another class of 
"quotas".
That probably isn't clear enough from the spec, and should probably be
stated.

The alternative is to report two numbers, quota-limit and something like
"space-limit", but I think we basically agreed that reporting back one 
number
would be better than multiple numbers (given that the server should know
which of the numbers is the "best" one to represent the space 
constraints
on that server).
