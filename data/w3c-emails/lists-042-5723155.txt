Yes and no. It depends on who is asking. Note that RFC3010 (which I think we
all like :-) distinguishes between both.

Earlier today, Stefan E. showed that lumping disk limits and quota into the
same property can lead to very surprising effects. Do we really want that?

The issue here is that disk limits *behave* differently than quotas. For
instance, a "quota error" usually can be resolved by the user, by deleting
some of his own files, while a "disk full" condition may possibly not (other
user may take up the disk space, so there's no way for the affected user to
recover/continue). Also, recovery from both conditions may be different --
the person you need to contact to get a higher quota might be somebody else
than the person that's able to free up physical disk space (or add new
disks).

Here's another proposal how we *could* inherit RFC3010 properties without
much effort in WebDAV -- just use their welldefined names from RFC3010, and
put them into the IETF namespace reserved for individual RFCs, for instance:

<D:prop xmlns:D="DAV:" xmlns:NFS="urn:ietf:rfc:3010">
  <NFS:space_freel>12345678</NFS:space_free>
  <NFS:space_total>1234567890</NFS:space_total>
  <NFS:quota_used>123456</NFS:quota_used>
  <NFS:quota_avail_hard>1234567</NFS:quota_avail_hard>
</D:prop>

(we'd just have to state how RFC3010 terminology maps to WebDAV resources)
