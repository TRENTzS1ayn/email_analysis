A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV Access Control Protocol
Author(s): G. Clemm et al.
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-acl-10.txt
Pages: 66
Date: 2003-6-30

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, 
properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the 
WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to 
read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to 
allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer 
Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal. A lightweight 
representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a 
wide range of user management repositories. Search operations allow 
discovery and manipulation of principals using human names. 
This document is a product of the Web Distributed Authoring and 
Versioning (WebDAV) working group of the Internet Engineering Task 
Force. Comments on this draft are welcomed, and should be addressed to 
the acl@webdav.org mailing list. Other related documents can be found at

In the body type:

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
