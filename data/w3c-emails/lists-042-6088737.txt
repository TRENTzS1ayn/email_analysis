I'm putting together an agenda for Vienna.  Is anybody going to be there who can lead a discussion on
 - bindings
 - ACL
 - search

The agenda items we can cover so far are: 
 - Interop plans ??? 15 min - when, where, etc.
 - ACL progress
 - RFC2518bis open issues

Anything else I'm missing?  Feedback would be appreciated ASAP as we're supposed to have an agenda already.
Lisa
