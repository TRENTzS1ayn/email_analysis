To:"'w3c-dist-auth@w3.org'"<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

Suppose the following:
- a resource R
- a collection C1 with a binding x to R
- a collection C2 with a binding y to R
- a collection C mapped to URI-1 containing C1 and C2

i.e.:

    C
   / \
  C1 C2
   \ /
    R

Now I issue a COPY on URI-1 with destination URI-2 and depth infinity.

How many copies do I get for R, one or two?

i.e.:

    C'
   / \
 C1' C2'
   \ /
    R'

or

    C'
   / \
 C1' C2'
  |   |
  R'  R"

??

I suspect that 2 copies is correct ... or at least, the server is allowed to
duplicate R at destination.

Thanks,
Peter
