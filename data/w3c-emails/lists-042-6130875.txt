I recommend that we specify that the server SHOULD create a single copy of 
the resource.  To encourage this we can also point out that this can 
improve the performance of the operation because it can prevent the 
recopying/xmitting of identical subtrees.  The server probably has to do 
loop detection anyway to avoid infinite loops, so this shouldn't be 
difficult to do.
