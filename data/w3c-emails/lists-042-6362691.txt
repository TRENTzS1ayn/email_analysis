Hello,
I saw your web page and I had some questions about
Webdav, I was wondering how if I could put it on my
web server and how or is it a protocol that the server
already uses and I just have to enable some extensions
on it. In any case since you seem pretty savvy on web
folders I was trying to do like an ftp site on my IIS
server but it seems that web folders are a lot more
secure and easy to manage, if you have any input let
me know, 

Thanks,

J.R.
