Hi,

I just started reviving the old expired redirect references draft. Based on


<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-02.
html>

(expired June 2000) and the last call issues list

<http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/collection/redirect-issues.html>

I started a new revision which is currently at


<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-lat
est.html>

(basically it includes all open issues in-text, and those issues that were
trivial to resolve have been closed). The current version was also submitted
to the IETF as draft -03.

Regards, Julian
