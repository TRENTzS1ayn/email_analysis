I don't have the spec handy, so I can only comment on the items that 
include
enough comment...

The previous text seems clearer.  I'd not rewrite this.

I have no opinion on prefix preservation.

Sounds fine, but it's just one of several reasons to reject
a request.  If possible, I'd like to declare these as out of
scope as long as we're clear how the server should respond
to problems of this class.  Is it clear how server writers
should respond to problematic situations that we don't
explicitly mention?

I vote for the wording that is in there.  I think we've already reached 
consensus
that changing property values should not be changing etags.

All dead properties must be returned?  I didn't pick that up in our 
discussions.
