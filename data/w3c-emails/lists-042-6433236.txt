I'd vote to leave the text as it is.

Perhaps I misunderstand the existing text, but I also suspect the 
"unless it overwrites..." part is wrong.  If you do a MOVE and it's
actually a different resource in that slot, I think you do need the parent
collection's lock token.  It's only a PUT that doesn't require it.

I don't know if we discussed it or not, but the wording that is there 
seems
fine.  I do lack any compelling test cases to drive this issue in a 
particular
direction though.  I will rhetorically ask what non-WebDAV browsers do 
with ETags and lastmoddate.
