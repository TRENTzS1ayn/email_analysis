Again, please help me understand...:

1) Are you suggesting that to for a scheme to be IETF-registered is not a
requirement? In which case I'll argue that by definition there can't be any
uniquess guarantee otherwise.

2) Are you suggesting that this is obvious? I which case I'll have to point
out that there are well-known server implementations doing just that, so
obviously the spec  hasn't been clear enough about that.

Correct.

It's a procedural question. I think *any* change to RFC2518 (and this is a
change) should appear on the issues list, indicating when and why it was
raised as an issue, and what conclusion was reached. As far as I know, this
hasn't happened.
