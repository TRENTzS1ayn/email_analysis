I suspect a hybrid of your proposal and the old text would be best.

Yup.  Still no opinion.  If people feel these situations are significant, 
then
I don't have a problem with preserving prefixes.

I only ask because I recall discussions about whether they return all
properties and reasons we don't want to require that servers return all
properties, but I don't recall a discussion about how a server decides
what properties to return and definitely nothing about what a client can
assume about what the server has decided.  I could have overlooked
a discussion though.  I just want to give people a heads-up that
this wouild be a good time to speak up if you disagree with this text.
