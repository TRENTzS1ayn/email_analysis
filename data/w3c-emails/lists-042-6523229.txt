It get's worse. Consider

<D:prop xmlns:E="whatever"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"><E:foo><E:bar
xsi:type="xs:boolean">true</E:bar></D:prop>

Not storing the namespace mapping for "xs" will simply break the content,
even if the prefix isn't used for any child element.

That's simply not true. You're argueing from a world view where the server
stores properties and content as separate entities. However, it's perfectly
legal to have a server that

- extracts some properties upon PUT (for instance metadata from a WORD
document) and/or
- changes the content upon PROPPATCH of one of the aforementioned
properties.

I think that we can't and shouldn't make this behaviour illegal.

Yes, but that's a separate discussion.
