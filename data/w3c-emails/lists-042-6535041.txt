Sorry.  I don't have a particular posting that declares consensus.  It was
just what I heard over and over again in postings.  People seemed 
comfortable declaring that changing properties should not change ETags. 
There was no significant opposition to it that I recall.

The issues list lists...

But I seem to recall that it was discussed more often than this.

As you (and Geoff in the referenced page) point out, some products will
become incompatible with 2518bis.   I believe people were aware of this,
but if they were not, you've just pointed it out.  They should speak up...
