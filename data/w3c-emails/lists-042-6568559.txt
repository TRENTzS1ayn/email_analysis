I think we're converging on this...

If clients can rely upon ETags not changing unless the GETable content 
has changed, then there is no reason to depend on DAV:getlastmodified 
for this. Furthermore, if this were the case, the notion of a PTag is 
superfluous as a client could simply check that the ETag hasn't changed 
while the DAV:getlastmodified value had...

Agreed.
