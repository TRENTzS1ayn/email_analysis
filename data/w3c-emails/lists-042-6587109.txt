That's not a given. For instance, "file:///abc" or "dav:foobar" make very
poor lock tokens, although the URI schemes are IETF-registered.

Not true, unless your private intranet indeed isn't (and never will be)
connect to the public internet (in which case I really don't care :-). A
client may talk with two distinct "homegrown" systems at the same time.
RFC2518 requires that it will never ever see the same lock token twice. If
these systems do not use an IETF-registered URI scheme, there's simply no
way to guarantee this.

That's plain and simply wrong. The only way is to use an URI scheme that
*both* is IETF-registered and meets the uniqueness criterium.

See, this kind of proves that the spec needs to be enhanced. You and others
seem to read it as a license to come up with "private" URI schemes, which is
plainly wrong and breaks the uniqueness requirements. Therefore the text
should be clarified.

Absolutely.

Can you provide an example that wouldn't be "half-baked"? My point being,
unless you register the scheme, nobody is guaranteeing uniqueness, so it is
soft of "half-baked" automatically.

Another question: why are people fighting against this requirement? There
are tons of simply ways to produce lock tokens that meet all the criteria,
one of which is the opaquelocktoken scheme. I really don't see what's so
attractive about inventing new schemes to do the same thing.
