I didn't propose that. However, if you look at RFC2616 you will note that it
really doesn't say that the ETag MUST NOT change unless the entity changes.
It only defines the other direction (the etag must change if the entity
changes).

Actually, the case I raised is the one where properties are *extracted* from
the content, *stay* in the content and the content is *updated* when
PROPPATCH is applied.

For instance, (upon PUT) a server might use the HTML Meta tag to extract a
"foo:author" property and expose that as DAV property (making it available
for DAV:basicsearch...). Applying PROPPATCH to this property would affect
the content that you'll get upon a subsequent GET as well.

Now if you tell me that this behaviour is non-compliant we are in deep
disagreement about WebDAV. I understand that many see WebDAV simply as a
drop-in for filesystems or FTP. This is just one use-case, but there are
other scenarios that RFC2616 and RFC2518 explicitly allow.

No, it may affect any number of properties that are protected on that
particular server.

OK, let's make that very clear: ETags SHOULD not change unless the content
changes. *However*, it's completely up to the server *which* methods affect
the content. For instance (in the case mentioned above), a PROPPATCH/set to
foo:author may affect the META/name=author tag in the HTML content that you
GET.

I think that's a separate dicussion. We still don't have any feedback from
the two major WebDAV implementions (moddav and IIS) about whether they plan
to implement this according to RFC2518bis.

Well the alternative obviously is not to change the requirement, and to keep
things as they are right now. I'm not convinced the current situation is so
bad we need to break compatibility with both RFC2518 and lots of existing
servers.

Yes.
