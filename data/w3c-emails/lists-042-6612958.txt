What I  recall from the discussions is that we do not want the ETag or
getlastmodified to change when the content of the resource stays
as it is.

Some people had the notion that ETag/lasmodified needed to change
on PROPPATCH and that is definitely not desired. However iff upon
PROPPATCH the content of a resource also changes, the ETag MUST
change.

So, saying that PROPPATCH MUST not change the ETag is not what
we want.

What the intention of our consensus-reaching discussion was is:

PROPPATCH on a resource SHOULD NOT modifiy the ETag/getlastmodified
live properties unless the content/representation of the resource
changes as well. On content changes ETag/getlastmodified MUST
change as already required by HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616).

This issue is not heavy enough to render existing implementations
non-compliant. One can look at it as a word of advise to server
implementors in order to improve HTTP caching performance.
