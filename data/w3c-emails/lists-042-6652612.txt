Some time ago, I asked what status code should a BIND request return, if the
precondition
DAV:locked-update-allowed is violated. Apparently, there has been consensus
in that is should be:

423 "Locked" with <D:error><D:locked-update-allowed/></error> in the
response-body

What if DAV:locked-overwrite-allowed is violated? It could be:

1) 423 "Locked" with <D:error><D:locked-overwrite-allowed/></error> in the
response-body

2) 409 "Conflict" with <D:error><D:locked-overwrite-allowed/></error> in the
response-body

Isn't 2) more reasonable in this case, because this time it is not the
resource identified by the request URI which is locked?

Thanks,
Peter
