Let's not encourage servers behave differently unless that's really
necessary.  Clients that *do* support bindings, in particular, should be
able to count on servers handling this case in predictable ways.

My counter proposal is that servers who are concerned about this can 
return 506 on the request as a whole, while servers that are not 
concerned about old client behavior in this regard can take advantage 
of 208.
