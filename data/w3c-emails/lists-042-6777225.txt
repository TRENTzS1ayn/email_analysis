I agree that they are independent, but we shouldn't lose sight of the idea that
registration tells you whether a scheme will or will not give you 
uniqueness.  The
double issues for non-registered schemes is that you can get overlap (the same
human-friendly scheme names occur to lots of people) and those using
the scheme may have different ideas about the syntax as things evolve.
Both can really damage interoperability.  I encourage folks to 
register schemes,
and we are now working again on the procedures for non-IETF trees, which
would allow people to do a lightweight registration.
