Since this statement of "what protocol extensions I understand" is
a generically interesting one, including for requests that do not have
an extensible body (e.g. PUT), I suggest we marshall this information
in the form of a header, not as an XML tag in the body of the request.

Other than that, your proposal is fine with me.  This is clearly something
which should eventually find its way into a successor of 2518, but I'm
happy to introduce it in the binding protocol first.

I'd like to see more folks comment on this though, before moving in that
direction.

WRT to the 208 approach vs. the alternative you described, I believe that
the 208 approach is the simplest approach, and I do not think
it is a benefit to try to couple two very different kinds of situations, 
i.e. how
to marshall a recursive structure vs. how to report on an access 
restriction.

Cheers,
Geoff
