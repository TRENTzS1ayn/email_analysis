Yes.

Nope. Please define what you call "improper" use of a URI schema that is not
registered. The scheme name "bar" doesn't "belong* to anybody. Thus all uses
of it in public protocols is "improper".

Because it is not registered, you simply don't have any control over it. The
next day, an IETF RFC may define the "bar:" scheme for something else and
define a grammar for legal "bar:" URIs that's incompatible to your ad-hoc
usage. Clients would have every right to reject the URI because they may
have a URI parser that knows about the new scheme and rejects it.

Both.

Anyway, you seem to suggest a mechanism that I'll call
"uniqueness-by-obscurity".

Again: I understand this as clarification. You simply can't have guaranteed
uniqueness in a URI unless the URI scheme is registered. This is *by
definition* how URIs work.
