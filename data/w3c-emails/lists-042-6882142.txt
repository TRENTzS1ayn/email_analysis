Thanks, Ted. This is where I came from: most people to which I talked about
this assumed that as well. However, during testing I found servers that
simply use ad-hoc schemes. I think this is a very bad practice, and thus

So *how* do you produce a guaranteed-to-be-unique URI without using a
registered scheme? I think this is simply impossible.
