Yes and no. As you say, using headers has the advantage to work with PUT.
However, I'd like to avoid adding headers because of the namespacing
problems. If we go down that road, we really should adopt an extensible
scheme, such as the HTTP Extension Framework (RFC2774).

OK, here'a proposal: add a DAV:response-format element to DAV:propfind.
Members of DAV:response-format indicate that the client is prepared to
process particular response formats that are not strictly compatible tp
RFC2518. In this case, a client would submit

<propfind xmlns="DAV:">
  <response-format><process-208/></response-format>
  <allprop/>
</propfind>

(I'd like to be able to re-use that for other extensions, therefore a
container element seems to be a good idea).
