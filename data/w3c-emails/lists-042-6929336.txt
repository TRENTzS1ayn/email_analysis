Ted,

actually I think it is the *main* issue (well, I did raise the issue after
all :-)

URI syntax is defined by RFC2396. URIs consist of the scheme name and a
scheme-dependant part. Different URI schemes have different characterestics
re: uniquenes, for instance

- file: would be bad,
- http: can be used as long as the owner of the domain ensures that the path
components are built in a unique way,
- opaquelocktoken: or urn:uuid (draft) are *designed* to accomplish this.

The point however is that unless a URI scheme is registered, *anybody* can
come up with URIs in the same scheme, and there's no *reliable* way to avoid
collision of URIs. Of course, using a registered scheme doesn't guarantee
uniqueness either, but at least it provides a chance to blame one of the two
sources of the duplicate URI for not complying to the syntax and semantics
that have been defined for the URI scheme.
