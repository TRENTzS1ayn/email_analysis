Well, we could choose a different name and make it less granular if you
prefer that.

I dislike inventing new headers, but in fact that wouldn't be a new header.
So we would define that clients can claim compatibility to a specific DAV
feature by sending the header. In this particular case, we'd still need to
define what "bind" means when it appears in a "DAV" header, because
currently the draft doesn't.

Let's try to avoid that.

I'd like to state again why I prefer to marshall this in the request body:
we don't need to think about what the header means for methods other than
PROPFIND, and we can use the same extension mechanism to fix another issue
RFC2518/ACL altready has (not being able to marshall information about the
fact that the content of a collection couldn't be listed).
