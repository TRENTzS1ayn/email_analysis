What's the general behavior for changing etag and getlastmodified when a resource is simply renamed via a MOVE, or when it's moved to another directory?  

Do any clients benefit if the ETag is the same after a MOVE?  Would the client get confused if the ETag is the same but the getlastmodified value is different after a MOVE?
