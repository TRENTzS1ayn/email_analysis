It shouldn't. Also, the other combination can occur as well (ETag changes, but getlastmodified doesn't). This is because the ETag must be unique for all representations produced for a particular URL (+ variant-selecting headers), *not* the resource.

Consider:

/a/b with etag "1"
/a/c with etag "1"
MOVE /a/b -> a/c

The resulting ETag for "/a/c" MUST NOT be 1.

If a server needs a way to robustly identify a resource indepedantly of the URL, it should use DAV:resource-id.
