First of all, you are absolutely on the right mailing list. There's also a
special WebDAV interop list, but that one is mainly used to organize and
exchange interop test results.

You didn't mention exactly *what* problems you see. In general, there are
quite a few vendors that advertise WebDAV compliance, but test their servers
only with the Microsoft webfolder client, therefore having lots of problems
with other clients. On the other hand, you may also see client issues.

A few things you can do:

- If you suspect a server compliance issue, as a first step run the Litmus
test suite against it [1].

- If you suspect a Microsoft webfolder client issue, check the list of known
versions and their issues [2].

- If you suspect a MacOSX client issue, report it here. Apple programmers
are (hopefully they still are!) monitoring this list and are very
responsive.

- If you think you have found an Apache/moddav issue, you probably should
report it to the dav-dev mailing list [3].

- Otherwise, just describe your specific problem here and we'll try to help.

Hope this helps,

Julian

> 1) Eliminate or significantly reduce reliance upon FTP so as to obtain:

>     b) higher levels of security (FTP sends PWs in the clear, SFTP is

> 2) Simplify the training of content experts publishing via the web by:
>     a) Training for fewer applications (no instruction in a
> number of FTP apps)
>     b) Train for apps that offer greater expressive freedom (Adobe
> GoLive and Macromedia Dreamweaver instead of MS FrontPage, AOL Press,
