Wouldn't the "getlastmodified" value change during this operation as well?  I'm assuming that at the beginning /a/b and /a/c had different content, which is why the ETag had to changed when the MOVE caused the content /a/c to be overwritten with the content from /a/b.  If that's the case then the result of a GET to /a/c is different after the move, so the 'getlastmodified' must also change.
