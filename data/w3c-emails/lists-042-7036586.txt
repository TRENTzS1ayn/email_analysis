Yes, 3253 leaves the definition of versioning behavior for live properties
up to the standard that defines those live properties.


So we should probably try to define the versioning behavior for 2518 
properties
in 2518bis.  In general, the simplest default versioning behavior for a
property such as DAV:displayname is to treat it the same as a dead 
property,
i.e. it is an immutable copy of the value of that property on the VCR at
CHECKIN time.  Does this work for folks currently doing versioning?
(I couldn't quite tell from Lisa's description whether this is
the Xythos behavior or not).

Cheers,
Geoff
