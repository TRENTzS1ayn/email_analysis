I agree that we want to finish RFC2518bis in a finite amount of time,
but I disagree that versioning behavior of RFC2518 properties should be
defined in a separate draft.  Any new WebDAV draft should fully define
the behavior of any live property it defines, and versioning is 
a standard part of the WebDAV family (after all, it is "WebDAV", not
"WebDA" :-).

Cheers,
Geoff
