Yes, but support for RFC3253 is not required for support of RFC2518.  The
core or base specification is responsible for core functionality.  I think
it encourages implementation of RFC2518 to keep it as simple as it can be,
and keeping description of optional functionality (other than locking)
outside of RFC2518 is one way to continue to keep it simple.

Another reason is that versioning functionality is newer and has seen much
less interoperability testing.  One of the considerations for RFC2518bis is
whether each feature specified meets the interoperability bar for IETF draft
standard publication.  

For drafts like binding and ordering, I agree that new properties should
have their versioning behavior specified as well as their non-versioning
behavior if necessary.  And for drafts after that, new properties may have
to be defined with their binding behavior as well as versioning.
