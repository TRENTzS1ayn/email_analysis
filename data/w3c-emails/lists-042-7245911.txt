I still don't like it, primarily because this is *too* generic. It will
probably cause clients to send this header with each and every request, even
when it doesn't make a difference. It also opens the door to new
interoperability problems -- what if the set of extensions keeps growing and
different extensions create subtile incompatibilities. It may become really
painful to the server to decide based on the request header what to do.

I really really prefer to be *specific*. The problem *only* occurs with bind
loops and PROPFIND/depth infinity. Let us only do what's needed to fix that,
instead of inventing a whole new negotiation mechanism. In this case, just
marshall the flag as part of the request body.

But then it's too late, isn't it?

Independantly of how we send the information: if the client sends a
PROPFIND/depth infinity to a collection that contains bind cycles (thus
requires the new format), just reply with 506.
