Subject: [Moderator Action] Partial Property Data Retrieval???


Hi,

I've read over the specifications and want to know if I'm missing something
or if you considered a capability.  For properties in a schema that have
large amounts of data, does WebDAV specify a means to retrieve only portions
of that data?  For example, if you have a document object that has only a
text property containing all the document data, you may only want the first
100K of a 10 megabyte document.  For email the POP and IMAP protocols allow
subsets of the message data to be retrieved ( POP TOP command for
instance ).  Have you thought of allowing retrieval of only a subset of
property data, and if you have could you point me to the reference that
shows how?

Thanks,
