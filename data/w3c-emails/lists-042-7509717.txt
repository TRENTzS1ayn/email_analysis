There is only one open issue in the binding draft:
<http://www.webdav.org/bind/bind-issues-list.htm> 5.1_LOOP_STATUS.

If somebody believes that something in the draft still requires
significant explanation (or changes), they need to identify it
so we can add it to the bind-issues-list.  If not, the status 
for the binding protocol should be updated to state "only one
issue remaining to be resolved for last call".

Cheers,
Geoff
