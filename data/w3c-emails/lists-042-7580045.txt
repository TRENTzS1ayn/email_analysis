Actually, it's not really required at all. A server should provide a
DAV:getlastmodified property for any resource for which it actually would
also provide the last-modified header upon GET. So a collection may have
GETtable content (in which case DAV:getlastmodified should be present), and
then also a server may not even have the last-modified date for a plain
resource (for instance if it's clockless).

I agree although I have to point out that properties *also* are part of the
state of a collection, and the current consensus seems to be that the
last-modified date should not change when the content doesn't. So this is
non-obvious.

Yes.

No, it's good to ask these kinds of questions.
