Yes.

Correct.

Yes.

I think most user agents will cache using the Last-Modified *header* when no
ETag is present. I however doubt that there are lots of WebDAV-aware clients
that actually use DAV:getlastmodified to cache (they'd still need to GET the
content, in which case they SHOULD use the "Last-Modified" header returned
by GET).

In general, all we can say reliably is that the Last-Modified date should
change when the GETtable content changes. Now the real issue here is: is the
timestamp allowed to change even though the content didn't. We ruled that
out for property changes (which I think is wrong), but seem to propose it
for other non-content changes here.
