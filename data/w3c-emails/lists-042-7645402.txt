I suggest we keep the semantics very simple, and say that 
DAV:getlastmodified
is changed only by adding a binding, removing a binding, or changing a 
binding
to new resource.  Putting an existing resource under version control does
none of these things, so it should not result in an update to 
DAV:getlastmodified.

Note that in general the "version-controlled state" of a collection will 
be
different from the "state" of a collection, i.e. adding and removing a 
binding
to a non-version-controlled resource does not change the 
version-controlled
state of a collection, but does change the state of the collection.

Cheers,
Geoff
