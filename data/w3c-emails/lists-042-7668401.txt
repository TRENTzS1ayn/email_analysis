To clarify: the behaviour of GET and the HTTP Last-Modified header *is*
defined by RFC2616. A collection may or may not have gettable
representations (as any other resource), but if it does, the Last-Modified
header must obey RFC2616's rules (that is, if it's present it must change
when the GETtable content changes). The behaviour for DAV:getlastmodified
follows automatically.

Yes. In particular, if we see a use case for a last modified timestamp that
is not directly tied to content changes, we need to define a new one. This
may be optional (as all the other timestamps we have), so it shouldn't be a
problem getting it into RFC2518bis.

Maybe a topic for the interop event?
