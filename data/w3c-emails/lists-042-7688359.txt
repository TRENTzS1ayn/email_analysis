I believe that we have concluded that DAV:getlastmodified depends on
what the server returns on a GET on a collection, and therefore is not
something we can define (since what the server returns on a GET on a
collection is not defined).  So what we are really talking about in
this thread is a new property (which without much thought, I've named
DAV:bindings-last-modified).

This raises the key question: what will the client be using this new
property for.  I suggest it be used to keep the structure of a client
tree display synchronized with the names and resources on the server,
in which case the client doesn't care whether the version-controlled
state changes, as long as the named tree of resources is still valid.

Cheers,
Geoff
