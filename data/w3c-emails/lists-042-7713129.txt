Actually, since many servers do implement GET on a collection, how about 
saying "DAV:getlastmodified should be defined for collections if the 
server supports GET on collections and the value of the property would 
be the last time some operation changed what would be the result of a 
GET operation (and would be the value that would be compared against if 
a Last-Modified header was sent on said GET request)"?

Sorry, my brain is not thinking in protocol-spec-speak right now, but I 
think you get the idea.

Your other property for bindings would be useful as well, and I would 
guess that many implementations would make them equivalent (as a GET on 
a collection would return an HTML rendering of the bindings from that 
collection.)
