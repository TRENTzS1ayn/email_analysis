This sounds like the right general idea.

I'm starting to think that RFC2518 needs a new section, a non-normative
note or warning on the dangers of relying on the value of 
'getlastmodified'.  As far as I can tell:
 - some servers allow this to be modified by clients
 - on a MOVE, some servers set the destination getlastmodified to
   the source's previous value, others set it to the timestamp of the
   operation itself
 - on a COPY, same thing, but probably not on all the same servers
   that do the MOVE that way
 - some servers allow underlying file system operations to replace
   files with new files with *older* getlastmodified values
 - some servers modify getlastmodifed when props change
 - the behavior on directories is probably completely random

Thus, clients can't rely on the value of getlastmodified (or
the Last-Modified header) at all and should use ETags instead.
If the server doesn't support ETags the client is screwed.  
In that case, possibly the only reasonable thing is to throw
away your cached version anytime the last modified value changes
an iota, even if it changes to be *earlier* than your cached 
version.
