A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources
Author(s): J. Slein, et. al.
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-04.txt
Pages: 66
Date: 2003-9-10

This is one of a pair of specifications that extend the WebDAV 
Distributed Authoring Protocol to enable clients to create new access
paths to existing resources.  The two protocol extensions have very
different characteristics that make them useful for different sorts
of applications.

The present specification defines redirect reference resources.  A
redirect reference resource is a resource whose default response is
an HTTP/1.1 302 (Found) status code, redirecting the client to a
different resource, the target resource.  A redirect reference makes
it possible to access the target resource indirectly, through any URI
mapped to the redirect reference resource.  There are no integrity
guarantees associated with redirect reference resources.

The related specification [B], defines bindings, and the BIND method
for creating them.  Creating a new binding to a resource indirectly
creates one or more new URIs mapped to that resource, which can then
be used to access it.  Servers are required to insure the integrity
of any bindings that they allow to be created.

In the body type:

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
