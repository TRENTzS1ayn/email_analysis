Hi.

One note regarding the draft progress: I'm still resolving editorial issues
raised during the "last call" in 2000. This draft hasn't got the
dependencies on the BIND spec anymore. The next steps will be

- to clarify that redirect refs do not have (authorable) content, and
- to replace MKRESOURCE by a more specific method.

Regards,

Julian

> The related specification [B], defines bindings, and the BIND method
> for creating them.  Creating a new binding to a resource indirectly
> creates one or more new URIs mapped to that resource, which can then
> be used to access it.  Servers are required to insure the integrity
> of any bindings that they allow to be created.

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
