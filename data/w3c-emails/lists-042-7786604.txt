Hi all,

some questions about lockdiscovery and ACL's

Suppose, you have a server with WebDAV ( including lock) and it support's
ACL. What is the behavior for lockdiscovery, can I see all lock token or am
I only allowed to see the tokens where I am the owner of the lock ? As far
as I understand, lockdiscovery reports all locks. Is this a security leak ?

Best Regards
   Horst
