I'd also point out that the lockdiscovery property MUST contain
all the lock tokens, regardless of access control settings.  This
is not considered a security leak, because authorization is also
needed to use a lock token.  So this is the server logic to apply
whenever the client provides a lock token: 

Is this the same authorization context that took out the lock? 
  Yes {
Allow the operation normally, provided the operation is 
allowed, and provided the lock token is correct and all
required lock tokens are provided, etc.
  } No {
Is this an UNLOCK operation, with an authorization that
includes permission to delete others' locks?
Yes {
perform UNLOCK
} No {
Fail request
}
  }
