That is not correct.  RFC-2518 explicitly states in
section 13.8 (where the DAV:lockdiscovery property is defined):

"The server is free to withhold any or all of this information
if the requesting principal does not have sufficient access rights
to see the requested data."

In particular, if the client does not have sufficient access
rights to UNLOCK the resource, a server could very reasonably
choose to hide the lock-token information.

In addition, a server for which locks have a reasonably
short maximum expiration may chose to never expose the lock tokens
(i.e. nobody has sufficient access rights to see the lock tokens).

Cheers,
Geoff
