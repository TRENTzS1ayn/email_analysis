Unfortunately, withholding the locktoken from the client that requested that
lock
would break UNLOCK for some clients that don't store their own lock tokens.
Those clients might show error messages & cause support calls.
Thus, as a matter of interoperability, a server would at least have to 
be careful in providing incomplete information in lockdiscovery.
 
This area is murkier than I had thought.  Should there be a clarification in
RFC2518bis? It would obviously be easier to write interoperable clients 
if all servers had to behave the same in this area.  Is there a de facto 
minimum standard here that we can clarify in the next rev?

That is not correct.  RFC-2518 explicitly states in 
section 13.8 (where the DAV:lockdiscovery property is defined): 

"The server is free to withhold any or all of this information 
if the requesting principal does not have sufficient access rights 
to see the requested data." 

In particular, if the client does not have sufficient access 
rights to UNLOCK the resource, a server could very reasonably 
choose to hide the lock-token information. 

In addition, a server for which locks have a reasonably 
short maximum expiration may chose to never expose the lock tokens 
(i.e. nobody has sufficient access rights to see the lock tokens). 

Cheers,
