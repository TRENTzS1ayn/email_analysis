Hi Frank,

There have been cases where running Litmus exposed an error that caused a
server to crash, and stop running. If Litmus is run against a collection
which does not contain production data, then there should be minimal danger
of data loss (the only risk would be Litmus exposing a bug that corrupted
the database).

So, I'd recommend running the test early some morning, when system use is
minimal.

The other approach would be to install WebCT on a test machine, and then run
Litmus against it.

Litmus is unlikely to uncover a problem such as this, since this is more of
an interoperability problem, than a compliance problem. Litmus tests for
compliance.

Hope this helps.
