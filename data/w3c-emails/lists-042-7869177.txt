I'm writing to ask about the "source" property which supposedly can be used to identify the URIs of multiple source documents. I've read a lot of the discussion in the list archive but I was still left slightly confused as to the status of this property. I'm sorry if I appear to be bringing up an old controversy and rehashing it ... I've only recently joined the list so I can find out about it.

From what I read, the "source" property was a great idea but no-one ever implemented it, supposedly because it was too complicated and/or there was no perceived need. Eventually it was formally deprecated. Is this correct? I've also read of the "translate" header, which I gather is a Microsoft-specific extension? I also gather that this only supports a one-to-one mapping between a document and its source, i.e. a document has one and only one source?

My case is that I have a server which generates pages from multiple sources and keeps track of those sources in such a way that it could fairly easily support dav:source. I'd like editors to be able to edit the page and select which of the source documents to edit. But are there existing clients that will actually do that? Or are there other web-dav mechanisms that might support my use-case?

Currently I'm working on a system where, by adding a parameter to the URI of a page, the editor can access a page containing links to the source documents. Then they can select the source that interests them. I've also considered implementing this feature as an Annotea service, but I'd prefer to use just webdav if I thought there'd be client-side implementations that would use it.

Cheers
