I don't think the format needs to be changed, but it certainly
would need to be more clearly described.  I am continually
amazed at how such an otherwise sensible group of authors could have
chosen a node named DAV:tgt to hold the URI of the source,
and a node named DAV:src to hold the URI of what is usually the
resource itself.  Didn't they at list flinch or grimace at
the sentences:

"The destination of the source link identifies the ... source
 of the link???s source."

and

"The source of the link is typically the URI of the resource
 on which the link is defined."

One could make a good argument that this poor naming choice alone
merits deprecating the feature :-).

But back to your actual question, if there are multiple outputs
of the processing step (i.e. it produces not only the resource
identified by the request-URI, but several other resources),
then it is useful to have the DAV:src nodes to indicate what 
those other output resources are.

Cheers,
Geoff
