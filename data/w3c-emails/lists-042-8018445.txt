Indeed.

I wasn't aware about the optionality of the lock token. Another interesting
client test case :-)

  A compliant client should be prepared for the absence of a lock token,
  since the DTD for DAV:activelock explicitly marks it as being optional.

  But that of course doesn't answer Julian's actual question, which is
  whether existing clients are correctly implemented (:-).

  Cheers,
  Geoff
