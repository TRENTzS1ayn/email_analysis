I see.

That makes sense, but definitively should be explained. As far as I remember, this is the very first time since I'm reading this list (2,5 years) that somebody was actually able to explain why this element is there.

So how do we proceed? Should we try to get it into RFC2518bis (which would require demonstrated interoperability), or should we try to come up with a separate document? Who is prepared to implement the property within the next few months?

  I don't think the format needs to be changed, but it certainly 
  would need to be more clearly described.  I am continually 
  amazed at how such an otherwise sensible group of authors could have 
  chosen a node named DAV:tgt to hold the URI of the source, 
  and a node named DAV:src to hold the URI of what is usually the 
  resource itself.  Didn't they at list flinch or grimace at 
  the sentences: 

  "The destination of the source link identifies the ... source 
   of the link???s source." 

  and 

  "The source of the link is typically the URI of the resource 
   on which the link is defined." 

  One could make a good argument that this poor naming choice alone 
  merits deprecating the feature :-). 

  But back to your actual question, if there are multiple outputs 
  of the processing step (i.e. it produces not only the resource 
  identified by the request-URI, but several other resources), 
  then it is useful to have the DAV:src nodes to indicate what 
  those other output resources are. 

  Cheers, 
  Geoff
