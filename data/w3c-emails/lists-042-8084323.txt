First time poster, so please excuse me.  I have implemented WebDAV and
mod_dav on our Apache 2.0 server.  I have opened up several directories, and
DAV has worked flawlessly.  The problem is when I try to open up the
directory for our WebLogic portal.  There appears to be numerous redirects
and virtual directories and it is playing havoc with DAV.  When I try to
connect, I get a message stating that "The resource requested has moved to
http://www.abc.com/foo/foo/foo.jsp.  Please try connecting to the new
location.  I have tried several ways and paths, but to no avail.
Suggestions are GREATLY appreciated, and the gods of technology will reward
your kindness.  Thanks... :-)

J. D. Scott
