Yes, this is important, and I'll add a bit more detail for client
considerations:

1. The client MUST remember the lock token and/or put some 
   self-identifying information in the owner field of the lock
   That's because if I'm running two WebDAV clients, possibly
   either on the same computer or two different computers but 
   both logged in as me, those two clients need to use only their
   own locks.  It would mess things up if my synchronization client
   used the lock token taken out by my authoring client and 
   overwrote all my new changes.  It's not enough to be the user
   that owns the lock, the client must also be the same client (or
   coordinating with the same client) that took out the lock.

2. If the server doesn't provide the lock token in the lock discovery
   property value, how are client supposed to know *which* locks
   are currently on the resource?   The lock token is currently the
   only way to identify a lock.  This information can help the client
   figure out what's going on -- e.g. to be confident that the lock
   that the client requested an hour ago is still valid.
