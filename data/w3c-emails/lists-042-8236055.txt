I'd prefer to keep them and continue to use them the same way as currently
done in RFC2518, RFC3253 and the various drafts closing completion.

All that's needed is the following general clarification:

"This document uses XML DTD fragments as a purely notational convention.
WebDAV request and response bodies can not be validated due to the specific
extensibility rules defined in section 23 of [RFC2518] and due to the fact
that all XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace
name "DAV:". In particular:

- element names use the "DAV:" namespace,
- element ordering is irrelevant,
- extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child elements)
may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise,
- extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for this
element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise."

(see
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-10.htm
l#rfc.section.1>).

This reduces changes to existing and currently last-called documents to a
minimum, clarifies (hopefully all) issue and keeps the readability of DTDs.

If this is the main issue, clarifying that an "ANY" content model indicates
that the element is *not* extensible (contrary to the default case) may
suffice (note that this would apply to the content of the DAV:prop element
in PROPFIND marshalling).
