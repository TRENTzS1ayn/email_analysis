The IESG has approved following document:

- 'WebDAV Ordered Collections Protocol '
   <draft-ietf-webdav-ordering-protocol-10.txt> as a Proposed Standard

This document is the product of the WWW Distributed Authoring and 
Versioning Working Group. 

The IESG contact persons are Ted Hardie and Ned Freed.

Technical Summary

    The document extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
    to support server-side ordering of collection members, for use
    when a client's use of the search protocol's ordering option would
    not be appropriate or sufficient. It defines protocol elements that
    permit clients to specify the position of each member of a collection
    in an ordering. One common use case that has been discussed is
    maintaining markers like page numbers.



Working Group Summary

The working group held a four week last call on the document and
comments received were generally positive. There was one set of
comments received during IETF last call, and the authors revised
the documents to handle the issues. The working group acknowledged
that problem it faced represented choices among several sets of
engineering trade offs, and it believes it has come to consensus on
those trade-offs.

Note that the document specifies methods of handling client-specified
but server-maintained orderings. The presumption of this work is
that a human will generally use a webdav client to create and maintain
these orderings. The working group aims to allow further extensions
to describe automatic, server-maintained orderings, but this document
does not specify those mechanisms.
