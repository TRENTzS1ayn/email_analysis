Yeah! Congratulations to Julian Reschke for his diligent work bringing this
document to completion. Big thanks as well to Judy Slein, who initiated this
protocol and performed a sigificant amount of design work.

At this point the protocol goes to the RFC Editor, and will be issued as an
Proposed Standard RFC sometime in the next few months. This is the first
rung on the IETF's standards track.

>     when a client's use of the search protocol's ordering option would
>     not be appropriate or sufficient. It defines protocol elements that
>     permit clients to specify the position of each member of a collection
>     in an ordering. One common use case that has been discussed is
>     maintaining markers like page numbers.
