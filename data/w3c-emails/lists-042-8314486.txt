Jim,

funny coincidence - I was just in the process of raising the issue myself.

Let's start with a look at the open issues:

<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-webdav-search-issues.html>

I think they mostly fall into two categories:

1) marshalling (these issues can probably be resolved quickly if we just get
enough people looking at them, trying to find a simple solution)

2) typing/sorting

During the Interim WG meeting in January, we discussed 2):

<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2003JanMar/0075.html>

In particular, I remember that we agreed that in order to get typing in DASL
right, we need it first implemented in the basic WebDAV property model. So
we should decide whether

a) we leave datatyping out of DASL, fix the remaining issues or

b) try to define basic datatyping in properties first, and then let DASL
build on it.

(In both cases I'd suggest to submit the draft as experimental).

I feel that b) is the way to go, because there doesn't seem to be a portable
way to have queries on non-string values unless we have a way to identify
them.

Our (that is greenbytes/SAP, not the WG :-) current proposal for datatype
marshalling in PROPFIND/PROPPATCH is here:


<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-webdav-property-datatypes-05
.html>

We dicussed this draft in January as well, and I think we need to decide on
the following issues to proceed:

- should this be a working group activity (my recollection: yes)

- do we need a separate requirements document (I'd say: no, let's just state
them in the Introduction)

- where should the discussion happen (DASL mailing list or WebDAV mailing
list)?

- should the draft concentrate just on data typing, or should it also try to
handle additional metadata just like it does now (hidden flag, protected
flag, displayname information)

I personally think that the core part of the draft is mature enough (it's
first version is over two years old, and since then, the core feature set
has been absolutely stable). So if we leave the advanced stuff out, we could
possibly get if finished very soon.

Julian
