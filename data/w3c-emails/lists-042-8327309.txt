Julian,

I didn't realize there were any known issues.  Unless I'm mistaken,
the only "fix" that didn't get into -03 was a suggestion by you
to add an additional definition, and I was waiting from text from
you for that.

Also note that there were no changes made that were not discussed
on the list.
