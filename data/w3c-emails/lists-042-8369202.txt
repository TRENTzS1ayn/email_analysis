A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Quota and Size Properties for DAV Collections
Author(s): B. Korver, L. Dusseault, C. Warner
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-quota-02.txt
Pages: 9
Date: 2003-9-30

WebDAV servers are frequently deployed with collection quota (size) 
limitations.  This Internet-Draft discusses the two properties and 
minor behaviors needed for clients to interoperate with quota 
implementations on WebDAV repositories.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-quota-02.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
