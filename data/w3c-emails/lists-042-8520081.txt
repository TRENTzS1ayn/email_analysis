A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning Working Group of the IETF.

Title: WebDAV Redirect Reference Resources
Author(s): J. Slein
Filename: draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-05.txt
Pages: 61
Date: 2003-10-1

This specification defines redirect reference resources.  A redirect
reference resource is a resource whose default response is an HTTP/
1.1 302 (Found) status code, redirecting the client to a different
resource, the target resource.  A redirect reference makes it
possible to access the target resource indirectly, through any URI
mapped to the redirect reference resource.  There are no integrity
guarantees associated with redirect reference resources.
Distribution of this document is unlimited. Please send comments to
the Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) working group at
w3c-dist-auth@w3.org [1], which may be joined by sending a message
with subject 'subscribe' to w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org [2].

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-05.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
