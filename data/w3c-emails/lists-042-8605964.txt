Yes. However, where these holes affect the predictability of search results,
we need to close them.

As a matter of fact, I've seen little progress with any of the WebDAV specs
in the last months. Progress occurs when people decide to spend time to
improve the draft. The SEARCH spec has been (albeit slowly) progressing,
mainly because of feedback from Software AG (Tamino) and the Catacomb
developers. If we can get all interested parties (probably that would
include Xythos and Oracle) to concentrate on the remaining issues, then we
can probably get the spec out within a few weeks.

Yes. However I don't think that anybody is doing that. Almost all open
issues aren't about nice-to-have additions but about problems with the
existing functionality (for instance, the missing ability to relaibly query
on non-string typed properties, such as DAV:getcontentlength).

That would be good.

However, without data typing the grammer simply is incomplete. Could you
please explain how you're going to query for resources where
DAV:getcontentlength is between 1000 and 5000 without somehow introducing a
distinction between strings and numbers. And what about queries on dates? If
the spec doesn't answer how queries can be made against the basic RFC2518
live properties, there's no point in submitting it. This is currently
covered in section 5.10. The remaining questions are summarized here:
