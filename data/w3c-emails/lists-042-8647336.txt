This last call period ends tomorrow.  There have been a few questions:

what are the permissions on a bound resource
--> This question appears to be answered - inherited permissions are
not transitive
whether a principal resource is a HTTP resource 
--> answered: yes
how the server maps from login to principal resource 
--> answered: implementation dependent
suggestion to add write-collection
--> no support voiced in response

I don't think any of these prevent the document from going forward after
last call finishes so if there is disagreement please raise it on the
acl list.
