Lisa,

what you are talking about is the consistency *definition*. Of course it's possible to have WebDAV-compliant resources in non-consistent namespaces.

What we'll have to look fot is where the term is *used*. If it isn't, the definition can go. However, I think we need it to define the behaviour of namespace operations such as MOVE?
