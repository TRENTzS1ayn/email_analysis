I can be *made* normative. That's what I'm trying to do.

> An appendix can't be normative.  The DTD fragments in subsections

Yes it can. Quoting from RFC223bis (07):

      4.7e Appendixes

         Many RFC documents have appendices, some of which may be very
         extensive.  Common practice is to position Appendixes at the
         very end of a document, after the references.  However, a
         significant set of RFCs have large and dense Appendix sections
         for technical details, which are actually an integral part of
         the document.  In this case, it can be difficult to locate the
         references.  We therefore recommend that, in general,
         references follow the Appendixes in an RFC.

I agree that informative parts are usually in the appendix, but that doesn't
mean that any appendix is automatically non-normative.

That's what we should fix.

That sounds like a good idea.

We could, but I'm not sure why we would want to do that. The DTD fragments
define allowable *syntax*. The allowable content model for PROP *is* ANY.

Yes. IMHO the basis should be a formal description that is normative, and in
those cases where we feel that people may not "get it", add additional
English language.
