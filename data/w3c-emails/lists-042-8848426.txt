A quick scan of 2518 revealed that the "consistent namespace"  
definition is
used with COPY/MOVE/DELETE to define restrictions on the outcome of the
operation. E.g. that the copied/moved/deleted resource created a  
consistent
namespace, especially in case of collections.

I think that definition and the restrictions on COPY/MOVE/DELETE are  
necessary
and, in particular, do allow single WebDAV resources on a server  
without an
embedding, WebDAV-enabled collection.

Regards, Stefan
