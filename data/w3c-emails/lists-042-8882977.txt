Got any suggestions?  I'll try to come up with something here.

I'll do that, then.

Sure, but you could also say the allowable content model for 
'response' element is ANY.  I will attempt to make this clearer
with English alongside the regular DTD although I still think 
the spec could be clearer without something else formal or 
semi-formal that worked better for us than DTDs.
