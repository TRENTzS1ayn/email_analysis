For (1), I could go either way on this, but if we did give a client
a way to say this, I suggest that it be in the form of a request DAV
header, and that we introduce a symbol that means "the redirect-ref
standard", e.g. something like:
  DAV: 1, 2, redirect

Note that I am bundling this into the general "I understand the
redirect spec" token, since I'd rather not introduce a new token for
each detailed bit of functionality.

For (2), Julian's suggestion is fine, but shouldn't the Location 
node be optional (i.e. "Location?").

Cheers,
Geoff
