My first choice is to get this in the base spec, since I think it is
a bug that the server can register what options it supports, but a
client cannot.

I could live with Julian's approach, but I'd rather not, since I think
this is a general problem that merits a clean extensible solution
(as opposed to a one-off hack :-).

Cheers,
Geoff
