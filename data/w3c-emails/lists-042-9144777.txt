Thanks, Julian.

I looked at 2518bis-04 and section 4.4 does not speak to the presence or absence of material in XML document headers.  It says that the given DTD (in 24.1 and also throughout the document) is informational and is not meant to be usable for validation of DAV XML 1.0 documents.  [We have already discussed that ANY, as used in the DTD, doesn't accomplish the intended purpose.]

Section 4.4 does not speak to rules for the appearance of <!DOCTYPE ...> or anything else in the XML Prolog and Document Type Declaration [REC-XML section 2.8, 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-prolog-dtd>] for DAV XML documents.

I also checked bis-04 sections 8.1.1, 15, 18.5, 18.6, 19, 24, 24.1, and 24.2 and there does not seem to be anything to resolve this question.  There are mildly contradictory statements in 8.1.1 and 18.6, though. I didn't look elsewhere.

I continue to recommend that the presence of a <!DOCTYPE ...> declaration be forbidden in the XML Prolog of DAV XML in HTTP request bodies and response bodies.  This will also take care of 18.6, since the only way external entities may be declared is in the DTD.

I think RFC2518bis is saying that (see
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-rfc2518bis-04.txt>,
section 4.4).
