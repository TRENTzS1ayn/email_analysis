Dennis:

Thanks for spending time on these topics!  It is always useful to 
re-explore
these kinds of issues, since it is likely other folks have similar 
questions
and concerns, and since there are usually at least some points that we 
have
missed (e.g. the question about the suitability of ANY to describe the
desired syntactic behavior of DAV:prop).

Looking forward to hearing again from you in your next break from classes.

Cheers,
Geoff
