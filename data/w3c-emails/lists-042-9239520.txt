Here's a proposal for the issues list:


Issue DAV_REQUEST_HEADER

RFC 2518 provides a mechanism (the "DAV" response header) for a server to
indicate to a client that it supports a specific WebDAV option (e.g. "1",
"2", "version-control", etc.), but there is no complementary mechanism for a
client to indicate to a server that it understands a specific WebDAV option.
This becomes an issue when a WebDAV extension (or revision) needs to change
response formats in a way that possibly break existing clients. Detecting
client features based on a single, well-defined request header will work
better than (for instance) relying on custom headers (specified by each
extension) or "User-Agent".

Suggested resolution: allow the use of the "DAV" header as a request header,
with the same set of values that are defined for the "DAV"
response header.
