Sure.

I think we need to be precise here. As far as I understand, the XML
recommendation does only define one very specific form of validation, and it
is based on the document/message declaring it's document type.

Exactly this kind of validation is completely useless in XML based
protocols: it's completely irrelevant whether a document conforms to a DTD
that the *sender* provides. It would be only interesting to validate against
the DTD expected by the *recipient*. Doing the latter of course is
completely up to the recipient -- however it must be aware of the fact that
the DTD (fragments) in RFC2518 and related specs only describe part of the
constraints, and that a recipient MUST accept way more message variations as
the DTDs (per XML rec) allow.

If the schema or the reference to the schema is provided by the sender of
the message, I think the same concerns apply. If the schema is hardwired
into the recipient, none apply.

On the other hand, I don't see any big advantage in using XML Schema as
replacement in WebDAV specs. It only solves one particular problem (DTDs
ignorance of namespaces), but is a lot harder to read. If we really decide
not to use DTD syntax anymore, we should consider a schema language that can
*really* express the DAV extensibility rules, and that's easy to read by the
(human) readers of the spec. As far as I understand, Relax NG (compact
syntax) would qualify.

You may also want to check out RFC3470 ("Guidelines for the Use of
Extensible Markup Language (XML) within IETF Protocols", section 4.7.
