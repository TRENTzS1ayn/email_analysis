Dennis,

I appreciate the time you're spending thinking about this subject. The
question that started this thread was what to do with the DTD notation that
is used in current WebDAV specs and that disappeared in RFC2518bis. My
position is that we should keep it and make sure that the spec clearly says
what it means for developers.

Other comments inline...

Yes. They haven't been forbidden before, and they don't seem to cause harm.

Nope. The spec should clearly state that messages must be processed in
non-validating mode. In this case, it's really irrelevant whether a DOCTYPE
is present (except for the well-known recursive entity substition problem).

I don't argue with automatic "checking" (avoiding "validation" because it
implies DTD to many readers) of messages based on a formal description being
useful. However, we were discussing the role of DTD fragments in the spec
*as they are*. My take is that it's best to

- first get a consensus about what they are supposed to mean - I've been
repeating my proposal many times now (before *this* discussion started), and
I'd really like to see whether we finally agree on that

- then find out whether we can keep that syntax - I think it's worthwhole
keeping it for the simple reason that it's present on published specs

If we keep the syntax *and* agree about what it means, it will be simple to
specify a process by which an arbitrary WebDAV message can be transformed
into a format that *can* be validated.
