True.  But, new DAV extension elements should be explicitly listed in
the "choice" component.  So, any bogus element in DAV: namespace
can be caught.

I thought we want to be loose on what can be allowed at element
level.  Within each element, don't we want all attributes to be
explicitly spelt out?  Why do we need arbitrary attributes to be
allowed on any specific DAV: element?

If elements belong to the following category:
   <xs:any namespace="##other" processContents="lax"/>,
then any arbitrary attributes can be allowed in them.
