How does that help? If a recipient validates a message based on a
RFC2518bis-based XML Schema, and draft-ietf-webdav-redirect-ref protocol
extends a particular element, these messages will not be valid according to
the Schema *without* modifying the schema. The point of extensibility is
that old components continue to work with extended messages *without*
modification.

Because that's allowed now.
