Stanley--

  I raised this issue with Henry about 18 months back regarding the need for
a flavor of <xs:any> that basically says "match anything not otherwise
declared in the content model".  (Henry indicated that this requirement had
come up in other contexts and was under consideration.)  The WebDAV WG
decided at that point to stick with the existing DTD-based mechanism rather
than try to "upgrade" our formalism to XML Schema, until a future version of
XML Schema allowed such a declaration.

  While some schema processors like XML Spy allow something like:
<root>
  <element name="dav:a"/>
  <element name="dav:b"/>
  <any processContents="skip"/>
</root>

as the namespace attribute of the <any> is not required, they also then stop
validating "a" and "b".  This seems to be, strictly speaking, to be illegal,
as the Unique Particle Attribution requirement is being violated.
