Right.

Actually, that's not obvious. RFC2518 so far hasn't used attributes at all
(except for some wording about xml:lang's role). But I'd assume that yes,
extensibility applies to attributes as well.

Right.

Side note: it would be interesting to explore a mechanism for mandatory
extensions (I think RFC2774 can help here).

Yes. However, "understanding" is a bit vague. For instance, PROPFIND uses:

<!ELEMENT propfind (allprop | propname | prop) >

So for instance servers SHOULD reject requests such as

<propfind xmlns="DAV:"><prop>...</prop><prop>...</prop></propfind>

I wouldn't call it "just informational", but it doesn't affect the validaty
of a message body.
