OK,

yes, you can define a Schema that knows about all presently defined DAV
elements. If you combine that with lax validation for non-DAV elements, and
also take care of all other issues (such as ordering), you may be able to
use that for validation. However, this validation immediately breaks once a
new DAV protocol element is added. Thus, you can't use that Schema to
validate messages in a production system that is meant to accept messages
with not-yet defined extensions.

Well, the validation process MUST accept all messages that are legal
according to the spec. If it doesn't, what's the point in using it (unless
just for debugging/education reasons)?

The WG says it's not allowed, but many companies do it. That's a fact we
can't change in practice.

I'm not sure I follow. The way WebDAV is extensible IMHO doesn't cause any
actual problems. Please be more specific. And before promoting SOAP in a
HTTP-based WG, please make sure that you've read all related
HTTP-with-extensions-vs-SOAP propaganda :-)
