  The issue is not that "anyone can invent an element", but that new DAV
specs will come out, and would break older clients not updated with the new
schema.  The issue is that XML Schema would constrain the DAV WG's ability
to extend the specification.

[snip]

If you're telling me that anyone can invent an element and DAV-validly
introduce it as if under the DAV namespace, I will quietly pick up my
marbles and go figure out how to use SOAP (with attachments) and the Web
Services stack on HTTP to do Document Authoring and Versioning on the web.
(Such an expression of some level of DAV functionality is probably valuable
anyway.)

Dennis,

I think you're still missing a basic fact about WebDAV's extensibility: it
is not centralized, nor linear. There is no common registry. Everybody can
add extension elements anytime. Even if somebody would update that Schema
anytime a new RFC (or Internet Draft) comes out out, there will be a lot of
legal WebDAV messages that won't validate against that schema.
