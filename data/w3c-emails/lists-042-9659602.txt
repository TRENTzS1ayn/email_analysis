There are two possible use cases for a schema language to describe DAV XML
syntax.  Case 1 is as a tool like BNF to formally describe the protocol.  A
second is in the case where people would actually do validation at runtime.
I don't think that most WebDAV implementations today actually run DTD
validation.  For use case 1, XML Schema is fine since there is no backwards
compatibility issue.  If you want to require use case 2, then people would
have to include a validation engine in their WebDAV implementations.  If
WebDAV WG chose RELAX NG for use case 2, then all WebDAV vendors would have
to acquire or develop RELAX implementations, which to me, is pushing RELAX
on people.  If all we care about is case 1, we could always write our
standards using XML Schema, but just note that the schemas are for a formal
description rather than for use in implementations.

As far as your name-calling, goes, yes, Relax is almost a real ISO standard
like X.400 and other such successes from the ISO.  They're much better than
those poorly specified ones coming from IETF and W3C like SMTP and HTTP.  I
don't know why we have to descend into bashing of particular vendors or
standards organizations to have this discussion.  W3C is the organization
that currently owns most of the related standards we deal with in WebDAV,
such as XML and HTTP, so yes, I believe its standards are more relevant than
ISO ones when a conflict occurs (also note the mail address of this list).
Schema was designed by a large committee to meet the needs of a wide variety
of organizations and applications (e.g. structure definition, not just
validation), as opposed to RELAX, which was designed by one guy.  That's why
Schema has more market acceptance and RELAX is more elegant.  In general,
the IETF and the WebDAV WG has tried to keep discussions rooted in
practicality--what's actually out there in the bulk of the users.  As far as
what major vendors are doing, since you mentioned my employer, I would point
out that your employer is also a proponent of XML Schema (quoted from
http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xml-schema-testimonial.html):

SAP is pleased to see that XML Schema has become a W3C Recommendation. XML
Schema is a key integration technology for supporting tightly coupled
business processes through loosely coupled components within and outside of
the company boundary and an essential standard for building and leveraging
shared knowledge about collaborative services and processes. SAP is
committed to embracing XML Schema throughout the mySAP.com e-business
platform by providing XML-based services and leveraging XML Schema to
support business integration within mySAP Technology.
