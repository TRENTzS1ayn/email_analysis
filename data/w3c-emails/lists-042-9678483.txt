I agree that use case 1 is the one we talk about (at least it's the one that
triggered this discussion). I happen to disagree that XML Schema is a good
choice, because *for this particular use case*, it adds only little to what
we already can do with DTDs, however it has the disadvantage of not having a
compact syntax I'm prepared to put into a spec.

(Side note: unless we use Trang to convert the XML Schema to RelaxNG Compact
Notation)

The DTD fragments we have right now at least offer good readability. I'm not
prepared to throw them away just because DTDs aren't en vogue anymore.

Use case 2 is of no interest to me.

We could, but what would be the advantage compared to DTDs? We would still
have to enumerate all the exceptions caused by WebDAV's extensibility rules.
As far as I understand, we'd only get rid of one single exception (being
namespace-awareness).

In fact, WebDAV and HTTP are IETF specs. It's just this mailing list that
happens to be hosted by the W3C.

As for which organization is relevant -- this was not supposed to be an
argument *against* W3C or IETF. In fact, in that case I'd have to ask myself
why I'm putting all this work into IETF specification development.

I just wanted to clarify that RelaxNG isn't just an unimportant niche
product: one of it's creators is Jim Clark (editor of XSLT 1.0 rec) and it's
published by Oasis (members including Oracle, SAP and Microsoft, for that
matter). So as far as I'm concerned it has the same credibility as any
competing W3C spec.

Now I do understand that people who have heavily invested into XML Schema
want to see it used. However, that's really not a convincing element if
there are alternatives which seem to be better suited from a technical point
of view.

BTW here are some more alternatives:

- specify an XSLT transformation that will transform any legal WebDAV
message to a format that *can* be DTD validated, or

- specify constraints by a serious of XPath assertions (a la Schematron),
such as

count(d:allprop|d:prop|d:propname)=1

...and so on.

Two, as a matter of fact.

So does this make XML Schema better per se?

So if all we need is a notation for RFCs, what's more relevant? Elegance or
market acceptance?
