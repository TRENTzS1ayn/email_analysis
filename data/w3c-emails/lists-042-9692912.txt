That's correct.

You can't use an XML Schema definition as a pass-fail filter that rejects elements/attributes that might be from an extension and are not comprehended in the schema definition.  Since you also can't reject ad hoc non-DAV elements and attributes either, one must be careful how the schema definition is written and how/whether schema assessment is applied to material that is received.

In my world, that's not a problem. That's just how it is.  It is a limitation on the applicability of XML Schema to DAV XML documents in request and response bodies.

The problem is that there is no good way to say:
"ignore any element/attribute you don't understand"
in XML Schema.
