So does this mean we should simply remove the DTD-style definition of 
the 'prop' element (as well as 'owner' and 'resourcetype') from the
spec?  I believe the natural-language specification should be 
sufficient to define these anyway.

The 'owner' element could maybe be defined as MIXED but 'prop' and
'resourcetype' cannot be mixed.
