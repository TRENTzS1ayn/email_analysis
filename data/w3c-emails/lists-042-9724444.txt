What's the use case for this functionality.  How would a user
creating a link decide whether this was a permanent or a temporary
redirect link?  Is anybody actually planning to implement a 
client that would care which one it was creating?  

If there aren't implementation plans, use case, etc, then the
KISS principle suggests that we pick one. Since redirect resources
are in fact permanent until deleted (the temporariness is 
completely unknown), I see no reason why they 
wouldn't all be the same kind of redirect resource.

Before we chose one HTTP response or another, it would be good 
to know whether HTTP clients behave differently. I have no data
on this.
