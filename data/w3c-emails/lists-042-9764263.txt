This proposal clearly has a lot of support.  I too favour a single
client-feature-advertisement header. However, I'd like to caution the group
that we won't be able to demonstrate the interoperability of this header,
and thus we take the risk that this won't be considered a suitable feature
to take to the next standards phase (draft standard).  
 
I see no problem with defining the exact same header in the redirect spec
(or another), with a note that other extensions are encouraged to use the
same header.  Since this community is very good about reusing this kind of
solution, I'm not worried that its location will be a problem.  It's much
like the DeltaV preconditions/postconditions framework which has already
been reused by ACL and others without needing to modify 2518.
 
If there's still consensus to add to 2518bis specifically, let me know
(individually is fine) and I'll add it to the document.
 
Lisa

I agree, let's add this to 2518bis - the proposed mechnism is simple and
easy for developers to understand.

I support this addition to RFC2518bis. 

I believe it is a key mechanism needed for servers to properly support 
the various current (and future) WebDAV extensions.
