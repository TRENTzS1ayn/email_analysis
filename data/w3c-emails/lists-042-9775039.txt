I would like to see it added specifically to 2518bis.

I believe that there will be plenty of time between now and when
2518bis goes to the IESG for a sufficient number of clients and
servers to add in the DAV request header (and if there is one
feature that is unlikely to introduce an interoperability problem,
this is probably it :-).

Cheers,
Geoff
