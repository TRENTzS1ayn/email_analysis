Could you be more specific? I don't see a duplicate property name there.

Well, that's how WebDAV works. If you need multi-valued properties (such as
when mapping DC to WebDAV properties), you need to come up with a
WebDAV-compatible way to do it. See for instance:

No, it's absolutely not new. See above.

In fact, our server already supports extraction of DC-encoded metadata from
HTML content and mapping to WebDAV properties. If there are more people
interested on a common format, please email me.

At the end of the day, that's just an aspect of marshalling in WebDAV. As
properties can have arbitrary XML content, there's no problem mapping these
multi-valued properties to WebDAV. The only things that's missing is a
common format. So far, the interest in agreeing on one seems to be little.
