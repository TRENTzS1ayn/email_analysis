This proposal clearly has a lot of support.  I too favour a single
client-feature-advertisement header. However, I'd like to caution the
group that we won't be able to demonstrate the interoperability of this
header, and thus we take the risk that this won't be considered a
suitable feature to take to the next standards phase (draft standard).  

 

I see no problem with defining the exact same header in the redirect
spec (or another), with a note that other extensions are encouraged to
use the same header.  Since this community is very good about reusing
this kind of solution, I'm not worried that its location will be a
problem.  It's much like the DeltaV preconditions/postconditions
framework which has already been reused by ACL and others without
needing to modify 2518.

 

If there's still consensus to add to 2518bis specifically, let me know
(individually is fine) and I'll add it to the document.

I agree, let's add this to 2518bis - the proposed mechnism is
simple and easy for developers to understand.

I support this addition to RFC2518bis. 

I believe it is a key mechanism needed for servers to properly
support 
the various current (and future) WebDAV extensions.
