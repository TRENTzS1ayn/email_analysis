I agree, the best approach would be to specify the basic DAV request 
header mechanism in 2518bis. The other WebDAV specs can then define 
additional values, thereby indicating other client capabilities. The 
logic behind the DAV request header seems straightforward enough to 
allow for interoperable implementations before 2518 moves to the draft 
standard phase.

Elias
