Stanley,

I think it is *unlikely* that you'll get a 207 on a non-collection. However,
I wouldn't rely on that, and no, there's no way to enforce a specific server
behaviour.

Subject: non-collecton and multistatus response?


From reading the RFC2518, it's not clear to me that
if I'm using a delete method to remove a non-collection
resource, is it possible that server still returns a multitasks
response?

Is there a method that if my resource is a non-collection type,
I'll be guaranteed that a multitasks response will never be
returned?


Thx,

-Stanley
