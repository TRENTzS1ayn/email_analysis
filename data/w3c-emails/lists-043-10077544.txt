  follows:
  
  If part(s) of a submission by Lucent is(are) included in a standard and 
  Lucent has patents and/or pending application(s) that are essential to 
  implementation of such included part(s) in said standard, Lucent is
  prepared to grant - on the basis of receiprocity (grantback) - a license
on
