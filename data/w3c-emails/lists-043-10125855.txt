Below is the current agenda for the XMLDSIG meeting in Oslo.  Anyone who would
like to make a brief presentation in connection with the Requirements Document,
the Signature Syntax Document, Implementation experience with XML Digital
signatures, or other relevant topics should send mail to myself and Joseph
Reagle <reagle@w3.org>.



XML DSIG Draft Agenda, Olso

         Issues that arise in the first session will be triaged according to
three categories:
         those for which their appears to be a consensus (consensus will be
announced to
         the mailing list for confirmation), those which are sufficiently
complex and
         controversial that they need to be referred to the mailing list for
further discussion,
         and those which are sufficiently simple that there is a good chance
that a subgroup
         of those concerned can discuss it and report back with a suggested
resolution at the
         second session. In order to gather input from those who can only attend
 the first
         session, we will talk about how we will manage conference calls and the
 date and
         place of the September face to face meeting near the end of both
sessions.
