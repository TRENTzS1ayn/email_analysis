Do the following patents really apply to the XML-DSig working group?

> My  organization owns issued US Patents 5,544,255, 5,647,017 and
5,858,955,

Patent      Issued       Title
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
US5544255  08/06/1996   "Method and system for the capture, storage,
                         transport and authentication of handwritten
signatures"
US5647017   07/08/1997  "Method and system for the verification
                         of handwritten signatures"
US5858955   01/12/1999  "Cleaning compositions containing amine
                         oxide and formic acid"

I suspect there may be a mistake in this patent disclosure.

Subject: PenOp: IPR disclosure

I  wish  to  provide complete disclosure.   To the best of my knowledge, my
organization  owns  many intellectual property claims regarding the signing
of electronic data, including XML documents.  These many and complex claims
are  embodied  in issued patents and pending applications spread around the
world.   They  generally cover the electronic presentation and recording of
symbols  of  informed  consent,  the  secure  capture  of identification or
signature-type  data  (biometric, infometric and otherwise), the binding of
such  identification or signature data to electronic documents, the binding
of other related data (such as audit trail and records of informed consent)
to documents and the verification of the data bound to the documents.

My  organization owns issued US Patents 5,544,255, 5,647,017 and 5,858,955,
issued Australian Patent 688,589 and issued New Zealand Patent 292439.
