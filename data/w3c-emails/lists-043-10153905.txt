Subject: Call for Participation: XML Signature Working Group (XML-DSig)

Dear Advisory Committee Representative,

The Director has approved a new briefing package for the XML Signature
Activity and announced the creation of a new working group, the XML
Signature Working Group. This Working Group is a joint activity of the
W3C and IETF -- where it is designated as "(xmldsig)".

As stated in the charter, the mission of the group is to specify the
necessary procedures and syntax for generating and checking the
validity of XML signatures. 

During the review, questions were raised about the scope of the
activity, such as trust management and security. As chartered, the focus
of this working group will be XML signatures that provide content
integrity and associated key authenticity and non-repudiability. A
requirement on the WG is to ensure that additional semantics (trust and
security) must be able to layer on top of that framework. Larger questions 
of trust and security will likely be addressed by an independent workshop 
in the fall.

Additionally, this WG has the option of rechartering or proposing a
new activity once it has completed its deliverable of a signature
syntax. Editorial and clarity questions were raised which will be
reflected in a revised version of the charter and located at:
http://www.w3.org/Signature/charter-19990624.html.

Please note the following IPR disclosures were made during the review
of this activity and were posted on the patent-issues@w3.org list. These
disclosures will be publicly disclosed on one or more of the following:
the IETF site, the W3C site, the XML Signature specification.

      PenOp, Chris Smithies <Chris_Smithies@penop.com>
      Lucent, Igor Faynberg <faynberg@lucent.com>

The Signature Working Group is co-chaired by Don Eastlake of IBM and
Joseph Reagle of W3C. Joseph is also the W3C Staff Contact. You may
nominate individuals for this Working Group through the form at the
bottom of this message.

The following two documents were reviewed by the relevant parties.
