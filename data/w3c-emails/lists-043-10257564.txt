Sorry, I thought we had until the end of the week. I can offer to hold the
meeting here at Microsoft if the wg  prefers Seattle at that time. Yes, the
sun has been known to shine here in August : - )  Either location is OK with
me btw.

Having not heard from anyone else, I am going with the Univ. of Calif.
at Irvine locations.  Further logistic information will be posted as
soon as it is available.

Thanks,
Donald
