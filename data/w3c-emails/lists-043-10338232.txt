I was wondering if it did not make sense to combine those two parts into
something like

>         <sig-alg AlgorithmName>
>            <Alg-Info/>
>            <KeyingInfo/>
>         <sig-alg/>
Reason: Keyinginfo will most likely be highly dependent on Alg-Info.
Especially when considering symmetric variants, I'd highly appreciate the
possibility to not keep their specifications together with the asymmetric
ones and grouping them would a) enable us to sepearte algorithm-specific
specifications into separate documents if we decide to do so and b) allow
for modular, plugable provider-like implementations using kind of a
standard-API a'la the JCE provider stuff. Obviously we could do so without
modification, but I'd like that better. Comments?

> Manifest is an opaque Blob
Yes, I agree, but I also would like to have some kind of document discussing
reasonable behaviour when constructing/validating/manipulating manifests
etc. Outside the core spec obviously.
