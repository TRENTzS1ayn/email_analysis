There has been very little comment either way on this at the meeting or on the
list.  The problem is that W3C rules require 6 weeks notice of meetings which I
believe applies to time and location.  Assuming this is true, I think we have to
go with the UC Irvine location unless  we want to postpone the meeting....

Has the decision been made, or should I express my preference for Seattle?

Sorry, I thought we had until the end of the week. I can offer to hold
the
meeting here at Microsoft if the wg  prefers Seattle at that time. Yes,
the
sun has been known to shine here in August : - )  Either location is OK
with
me btw.

Having not heard from anyone else, I am going with the Univ. of Calif.
at Irvine locations.  Further logistic information will be posted as
soon as it is available.

Thanks,
Donald
