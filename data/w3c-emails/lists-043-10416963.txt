Not quite true. I can use any public-key signature algorithm and refer to
the public key either by a KeyID (whose actual meaning could be left to the
relying party) or the ISN of a certificate. Identification of the keying
material is independent of the algorithm being used (in most circumstances).
How we refer to the keying material is most likely dependent on the 'key and
trust' management infrastructure in place.
