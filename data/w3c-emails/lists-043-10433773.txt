Ahh... now I partly understand the root of the inconsistencies I've seen.

I'd rather not invent a term, and people find "web *" to imply it is a
network accessible resource ...

This is a worthwhile reread. However, as an XML application that is XML link
savy, I'd have to say we mean locator, I've stuck that in.. However, based
on the FTF meeting, I've added the following because people are fairly
frightened of the ambiguities presently.

!The WG may specify security requirements that constrain the operation of 
!these dependencies to ensure consistent and secure signature generation 
!and operation. [Oslo}

Good idea.

At the FTF, people were of the mind they wanted to avoid OIDs per-se and I
agree, but I -- at least -- am a bit fuzzy as to the point of casting an OID
as a URN which is a URI. Perhaps necessary, but not quite sure what it
solved.
