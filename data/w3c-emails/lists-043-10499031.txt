Folks,

I've completed my action item from Oslo [1] regarding contributor,
copyright, and attribution policies. Please have a look at it and pay
special attention to the section on copyright:

Copyright

   The products of the Working Group are vested jointly in the W3C &
   The Internet Society and is designated with the following notice:
   
     Copyright  ? 1999 The Internet Society & W3C (MIT,
     INRIA, Keio), All Rights Reserved. W3C liability,
     trademark, document use and software licensing rules
     apply.
     
   Working group members who are not willing to contribute under these
   terms must refrain from doing so and notify the Chairs as to the
   reason why.
