If you refer to the proposal I did to Richard Himes, it consists of
packaging the encoded content of the resource and the detached signature in
a single XML document. The encoded content is encapsulated in an XML element
that displays the encoding scheme as well as the 'Web locator' associated
with the resource, whose content is being encapsulated. This proposal
assumed that the application would decode and 'cache' the packaged resources
(or at least emulate such behaviors) before verification of the Resource
elements contained in the signature Manifest. Notice that this proposal has
been made in the context of a specific application and did not try to
address the problem in general.

I would argue that an XML-Signature is a well-formed XML element. Although
the XMLDSIG DTD defines syntax for a 'Signed Document' (an XML document in
that case), in most circumstances other XML applications will leverage the
definition of the Signature element without importing the document
definition.

Actually, the applications that will leverage the XMLDSIG specification will
import the Signature element definition from the XMLDSIG DTD. Therefore, the
Signature element by itself is part of the document definition.
