There will be a working group conference call Thursday, 22July, at 4pm.  Call in
number is 1-888-469-1066, PIN #27740, international number 1-212-547-0478.  I am
listed as the leader but am on a flight from Denver to Newark scheduled to
arrive at 3:58pm.  So I may be late or miss the call if my flight is delayed.
Joseph will be the leader in my absence.  Primary discussion topics are to be
editor/author assignments and confirmation that this is overall a good time/day
for the call.

Thanks,
Donald
