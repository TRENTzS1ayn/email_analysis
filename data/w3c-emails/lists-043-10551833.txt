You realized you've just nominated yourself as scribe at the next FTF you
attend, yes?! <smile> As already stated I rather like the notes, first they
clearly state resulting action items, and they give a sense of the issue,
who participated in that discussion, and what the general direction/closure
of the issue was. I see the goal of the minutes as a record of consideration
if/when those issues come back up again. Regardless, it is often nice to
provide a succinct paragraph level summary of what happened. I prepared such
a summary [1] from the Workshop notes which are quite large. [2] But this
can be a lot of work, and as Donald says we have to do the best with what
resources we have.

Regardless, can you point me to a good example of IETF style notes?
