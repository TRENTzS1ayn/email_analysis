So the XML Package includes the encoding algorithm and source locator, as
well as the encoded form, which encapsulated the PDF file. Now what does the
actual signature manifest locator point to: the package or the source? If
the source then it might not know to look in the package; if the package, it
should sign the package. Part of the issue here is to what degree does the
URI speak of the location and/or encoding?
 
-------
_XML Package (ID=package)
        : encoding algorithim
        : resource locator
        ____
        _Encoding form
                _______
                _PDF File (ID=source)

I think my preferred solution would be a statement about a statement: (I
sign (I am the package/encoded form of (I am a contractual statement))) ... ?

Well, this will become much clearer once I have a data model in hand. (The
encoded form is merely the value of the property "encoded as" of the actual
resource, the signature is a property of the reified form of that
statement... Obviously I need to think it through further.)
