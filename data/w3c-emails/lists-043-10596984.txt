Chris:

This is a subtle but very important point: having multiple signature
elements within a SigBlock has nothing to do with the number of signers.
Each signer can sign the same document independently or indicate that he is
also signing in the other signatures with a single signature in the
SigBlock. This is a much cleaner way to get the evidence you're looking for
and is easy to do with an XML signature.

The value of allowing multiple Signature elements in a SigBlock (sig_block,
signatureBlock, whatever...) is that in the future, multiple signing
technologies may well be used in the course of the same transaction, with
the same intent, by the same person, governing the same content. It may
also be that different signature standards are required by different
recipients of the document. It would clearly be efficient and useful from a
procedural and evidentiary point of view for these signatures to be
combined together into a single entity.
