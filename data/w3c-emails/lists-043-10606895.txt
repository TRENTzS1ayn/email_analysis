Huh? I don't know what an "XML file" is, but I know what the
defintion of an XML document is. It's
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#dt-xml-doc
and it has nothing to do with presentation engines.

It does? According to whom?

I don't follow you at all.

Where? "Web resource" in no way implies a browser or presentation
engine. When I do
% wget ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/xt.zip
I am accessing a Web resource at that URI, and there's no
browser/presentation engine involved.

Clearly? I don't see this clearly at all.

Absolutely.

I don't think that's an improvement.

Is there some precedent for "Media Content"?
The term "content" is used in HTTP 1.1 and the MIME specs.
"digital" doesn't really add much, I suppose.

I don't follow this at all.

you mean as it's used in the draft?

I got the impression from the design principle "The meaning of
the signature is very simple: ..." that the term "XML signature"
referred to exactly that "output of the signing alg itself"
and not anything else.

Hmm... I'm starting to get an impression of what this means,
but it's still not clear to me.

Huh? I don't see how use of packaging requires QA of presentation
engines.

ah... good.

I don't think you want to require that stuff be addressable.
I expect to be able to sign content from stdin, for example.

But if you're going to to as far as "addressable object"
you might as well say "Web resource." It means the same thing,
unles you've got some other addressing mechanism (besides URIs)
in mind.
