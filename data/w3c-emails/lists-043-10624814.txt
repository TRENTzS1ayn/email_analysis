Huh? A digital signature applies to exactly one sequence of bytes,
no? That's a pretty basic premise of the technology, no?

Yes, you can have a Web resource that is "the current edition
of the USA Today" but there's no one digital signature that
works for such a resource over time. A particular digital signature
applies to the content of that resource as of this morning,
or as of yesterday morning, but not both.

While there are some URIs that refer to exactly one sequence
of bytes (all cid: URIs, and some ftp: and http: URIs,
like RFCs and W3C tech reports) in the general case, a URI refers to
an object whose state varies over time, and might have different
representations at any given time.

I don't see any other way of looking at it, and I don't
understand "kills the data semantics..."

Why don't you want to be able to sign documents that don't have
addresses? i.e. a document on stdin, or the following document:

<doc>Four score and seven years ago today</doc>

I thought you did want to sign such content, hence
"portions of protocol messages" in the Introduction.

Another example of content that doesn't have an address:
the current contents of http://www.w3.org/. In a month
from now, the content of http://www.w3.org/ will (most likely)
change, and there isn't any URI that refers to the content
as of today (hm... actually, there is, but it's in our
internal CVS web space that we don't make generally available).

For W3C tech reports, we explicitly assign an address for
"the content as published on YYYY-MM-DD" and another address
for "the current contents as of the latest (public) revision".
But it's hardly the case that every time-chaning resource has
explictly assigned addresses that refer to each of its versions.

As I say above, I don't think that's what you want/mean.

In some particular cases, no: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt
refers to a resource which is precisely one sequence of bytes.

But in general, yes: a web resource that tells you what time it
is in Geneva is different from the string "4pm".

... which just goes to show that "the content of a Web resource"
is a definite description error, like saying "the arm of the man."
Which arm?

[that's all for this message... perhaps more in other messages.]
