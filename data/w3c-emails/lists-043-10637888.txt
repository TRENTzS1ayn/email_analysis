But the term "XML-namespaces application" isn't defined anywhere.
I don't think there is/will be terms "XLInk application"
nor "XPointer application" either. So I don't see how
you think the former is less ambiguous; it referes to undefined terms.

What's ambiguous about saying that the XML Signature spec
may depend on the XLink/XPointer/namespaces specs? i.e. folks
who plan to implement the XML Signature spec are advised to
get familiar with those specs as well. Change
"may" to "shall" if you like.
