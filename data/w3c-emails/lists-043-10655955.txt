Ok, I like this distinction. (Though I still wonder what makes a resource a
resource, the fact that it has a URI -- question is re-asked below)

Because, (I believe) we are in actuality signing the manifest, which
includes hashes of the resources. If you can't stick it in the manifest, how
do you sign it?

This is terminology that Don introduced and I don't completely understand; I
did speak to Don about it last week and understood it in as far as defining
an application of signatures, but not on how one actually does this. I
assume even a stream or protocol flow of XML stuff will be addressable in
some way, if only through local fragment idenitifiers. Don, can you speak to
this? Is there already an example in IOTP?

To play devil's advocate: the content at http://www.w3.org/ certainly does
have an address, it's "http://www.w3.org/." However, a month from now that
content no longer exists, and different content is re-using it's address. I
feel like we might be approaching the topic of "uniqueness" as well, which
we've been meaning to chat about.

Regardless, I like your distinction. For our purposes, are these the
definitions?

resource - digital content, all resources are addressable
content - bytes delivered upon accessing a resource. not all content is
addressible.
uri - one way of addressing a resource given the specified production rules.

locator is difficult and relates to my question of when you use a fragment
identifier "#" or even the "|" which application is responsible for defining
and handing the set of bytes to the signed-XML processor?

Ok,  I'll buy this.

I don't buy this. To the question of "which arm" the answer is the arm with
the following fingerprint (hash).
