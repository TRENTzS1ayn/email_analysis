Folks,

I've completed my action item from Oslo [1] regarding the production of a
candidate WG consensus draft [2]. Please send comments within the week as I
would like to post this as a public "close to consensus" draft by end of
month. (It need not be the last one, but I need to move on to the data model
ASAP.) I guess we would then push it out at last call, though I'm not sure
if one does last calls on requirements documents ...

W3C Status of this Document

   This is a WG XML Signature Requirements consensus candidate draft.
   This version is based on the first public WD which was formed from
   the Charter [Charter], XML-signature Workshop [WS],
   and Brown's IETF draft [Brown]. This version is restructured and
   includes many changes based on W3C review [AC], mailing list
   [List(C1,C2)] and the July '99 WG discussion [Oslo].
   
   This document attempts to capture the Working Group's consensus though
   it contains points which are still in dispute or not well
   specified. Issues which are still being actively discussed during the
   publication of this document are of class="discuss" and rendered in
   red by style sheet compliant applications.
