Yes, but we don't want a digital signature system that has to search around
for something matching a given hash until it finds the content that the
signature 'must have' been referring to.

If a signature is created that includes a hash of something indicated by the
URI, and someone later changes the content at the URI, then the signature is
broken.  When the content addressed by a URI is known to be volatile, the
only reasonable option is to take a copy of the content and put it into the
document.

Taking a copy could be viewed as an application level task.  However, I
think it would be easier for those who must write a signature manifest if
they could give a URI, but mark it as volatile (e.g. using an attribute).
Then, the algorithm that creates the signature would know to do the
following: 1) obtain the content, 2) store it in a local element within the
document, and 3) change the URI in the manifest to point to the local
element before creating the hash of the manifest.
