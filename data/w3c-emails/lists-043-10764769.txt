  Agenda and Open Issues
  
    Requirements
    
     * Please send comments.
       
    Time of Conference Calls
    
     * Continue with present time: Thursdays at 4 ET. Reagle will work to
       find an earlier time if possible that is more convenient for
       Europeans. The time is likely to be inconvenient for Hiroshi in
       Japan regardless. Presently, Lipp is the only European involved,
       Reagle is willing to conference him in from his home.
       
    Editor/Authorship
    
     * While it is useful to have proposals handy as they provide a nice
       instriument of consideration it is easier to build a document and
       WG concensus by starting with a small document/outline and growing
       the issues, consensus, and accepted proposals from it. Also, it
       means -- even with a crufty document with holes -- that everything
       has some status with respect to WG consensus, so it is easier to
       get external comment/feedback.
       
    Outline of Core Syntax Document
    
     * Reagle/Brown(990804): will work to produce an outline of the core
       spec
          + Just the core part that we can plug things into. Define
            companion specifications if necessary.
          + Requirements document should be included by reference.
       
    Core Syntax Proposal
    
     * Solo/Brown/Fox (990804): will work to have a rough document of
       alternative syntax.
       
    Scenarios Document
    
     * It would be nice to have a document that describes the scenarious
       we are addressing. parralell, cascade, message parts, documents,
       PDU (protocol data units)
     * Boyer (990804): volunteers as editor, create draft scenario.
          + Boyer: scenario that demonstrates weakenesses in manifest
            mechanism.
          + Boyer: Look to Brown: for scenarios such as how to construct
            a receipt
          + Eastlake: IOTP scenario.
          + Lamachia/MS: protocol scenario
       
    Data Model
    
     * Reagle(990804): create rough data model
          + Reagle: convene a call if necessary.
          + Brown: scan in data model diagram and send to Reagle.
          + Hiroshi and Chen: willing to work on data model.
       
  Carry-Over and New Action Items
  
     * [12]Open: Don Eastlake (990723): to fix date and place for face to
       face meeting .
     * Open: WGMembers (990804): review canonicalization document when
       posted
     * Open: Reagle: Find an ealier time if possible for teleconf.
     * Open: Reagle/Brown(990804): will work to produce an outline of the
       core spec
     * Open: Solo/Brown/Fox (990804): will work to have a rough document
