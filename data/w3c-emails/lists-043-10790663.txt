Hi Scott,

You may want to review your patent applications against what is currently
being done in XFDL.  UWI would also be happy to have a look at them.  We
have been selling systems that digitally sign XML documents since at least
January 1998, and we have dated technical specifications dated back to 4Q97
and perhaps even 3Q97 (I'd have to check our archives).  Hence if such a
patent were awarded, then UWI would most likely be in a position to dispute
the patent using UFDL and XFDL as "Prior Art".

Perhaps you could be more specific about what is claimed...

Subject: Disclosure of IPR that "might" be relevant



We have intellectual property rights which may be related to the signing of
HTML and XML documents. These are embodied in two patent applications filed
in the current year and possibly other future patents.

It is our intention to license any aspects of these patents relevant to the
work of the digital signature group to W3C members and members of the XML
digital signature group under fair, nominal and non-discriminatory terms.

We will disclose the filed patents after we have finished amending the
claims.
We expect that any future patents derived from technology developed or
currently planned will either not affect the XML signature group effort, or
have only a complimentary effect.
