I don't think you insulted anyone and it turns out there actually is a vague
standard for IETF minutes, at least for those submitted for the proceedings,
which is at

     <http://www.ietf.org/instructions/minutes.html>

Thanks,
Donald

I'm sorry if I insulted anybody or anything. If you think the minutes
should convey information to people who aren't there, then I'd think
paragraphs would be helpful. But if they're just there as a tickler for
participants, then I suppose you're right; I felt reminded too. Both CAT
and PKIX do minutes that often make sense to me even when I'm not there.
Here's the pointer for PKIX
<http://www.imc.org/ietf-pkix/mail-archive/msg04948.html>. Clearly I've
just been lucky if Don indicates that's not the norm for IETF. Yes, I see
that I need to put up or shut up on this area, next time I'm in a Face To
Face for this WG.

Again, I apoligize if I insulted people.
