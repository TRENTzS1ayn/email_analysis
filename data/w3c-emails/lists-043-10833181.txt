I don't know what you mean by the general problem, Richard.  Would the "general"
solution be intractable or would it be a significant diversion?  Or would it be
cleaner?  I was wondering if it would be reasonable to use an internal link, and
describe the situation in the manifest (i.e. the hash is on the unencoded
content of the thing pointed to by the locator) rather than using a common
origin/href value.

Thanks,
Rich
