Todd,

These are good examples of the general problem I was trying to address, that is,
if you have an existing signature and the signed document (perhaps legacy data),
would it be possible to embed both in an XML document (with internal reference),
within the documented framework of the DSig spec?  I don't think it is possible
without using local extensions, which will lead to incompatible implementation
by those of us facing this problem.  The recent discussions about the problems
with external references only magnify my concerns.  We have legacy signed PDF
documents now (signed by the court).

I don't know anything about the format of the signatures you refer to, and I
don't know if they have any manifest data.  If they do, I can see that it could
be difficult to map the manifest data in a general sense.  I gather from
Richard's previous comments that there are security problems with a signature
that has no manifest, so this may be an issue.  I believe the same problem would
be encountered with e-mail signatures, and I suspect that packaging these and
pre-signed PDF (etc.) in XML for search engines sounds like a reasonable thing
to do.

I would be interested in more discussion as to the general difficulty, if any,
of wrapping existing signatures (along with algorithm descriptions, certificate
references, etc.) and also embedding the base64-encoded source document.

Thanks,
Rich
