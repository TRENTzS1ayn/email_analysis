A little humour:

As if to underscore the problems that arise with signing a manifest full of
XLinks to the resources we really want to validate...

The URL in the XML DSig Requirements document used to indicate the XML
specification itself is the 'old' one and doesn't work anymore.  So, if the
URL were left as-is, and we digitally signed the XML-DSIG requirements, then
the signature would not be completely verifiable since the information we
really care about is what the XML spec says, not where it used to be.  And
we couldn't change the URL in such documents to point to the new location
without breaking the signature.

The URL should be changed to :  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210
