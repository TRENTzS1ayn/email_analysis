Hi Todd,

I haven't really seen a case where the time/date is not a visible part of a
transaction itself.  Abstracting away from forms, it still seems that if any
XML document, protocol message, etc. needs a time/date stamp, then it should
be included in the XML design of that document, protocol message, etc.
Applying Joseph's increasingly wise words, it doesn't seem necessary to put
another time/date stamp in the signature itself.

It should be further noted that when a signer adds a time/date stamp, be it
in the application XML, the XML for the signature, or the binary signature
blob itself, the time/date is still being set by the signer and cannot be
trusted by the verifier. One can set up a reliable, secure time service, but
under the assumption that the signer is ill-intentioned, the verifier must
still compare the time/date signed by the signer against the time/date that
the XML document is received, performing some sort of application-specific
reality check.

Still, people tend to like time/date stamping, and the Brown draft provides
for this in the Attributes element.

Does this satisfy what you had in mind?

Thanks,

John, while we are sorting our patent issues out, are you folks interested
in adding a timestamping token spec to the XML arena. My feeling is that we
need one pretty bad and our BERT structure might be a good candidate since
it's in the public domain so top speak under a GNU licenses.

We should start a dialog on this I think.
