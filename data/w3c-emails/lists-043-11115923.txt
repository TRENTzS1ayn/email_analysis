Just a quick comment on generalized time, etc.  (I don't recall if I'm
repeating a prior note).  This is really a canonicalization issue (hence
the tie from DER). One of the goals of those rules was that a time value
(an "instant" in time) have exactly one representation when you
calculate the signature.  This should be true even if I "decode" the
representation into a local form (e.g. Unix time) and then reencode. 
Thus, the rule that all time values are represented as Z for sig
calculation (as well as handling other equivalences).  One of the
questions I have for the XML C14n effort is whether they are similarly
addressing C14n of semantic values (data->XML) as well as XML->XML.
