Thanks Todd, but the work I am speaking of consists of good references (like
I did in [1]), and writing technically precise definitions. I wouldn't even
mind seeing them expressed in an informal predicate logic [2] -- as
reflected in the latest RD [4] -- or BNF [3] as approriate. 

Perhaps someone will volunteer to work with you since I'm sure with a legal
background, you'd be precise with the words. <smile>

     (Yanked from a conversation from TimBL, RalphS, and DanC yesterday)

   A more formal definition of a signed resource is that the following
   evaluates as true "definition(inputs):constraints" where R is a
   resource., I is a resource identifier (URI), and C is content
   (sequence-of-octects).

   signed-resource(I, C, key, sig): there was some request R such that
   GET(R) = C and address(R) = I and sign-doc(C, key, sig)

   sign-doc(C, key, sig): sig is the value of a strong one-way
   function over content and key that yields C integrity/validity and K
   non-repudiability
