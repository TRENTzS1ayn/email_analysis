John: 

I believe that Dave Solo and I both posted on this with strong feelings
against criticality flags. My comment was that WEBDAV has already thought
this through (ck out RFC
2518) and have chosen to have clients ignore elements they do not
understand. I also share Dave's  "sub-optimal" experience with criticality
flags in PKIX. Frankly, I thought we agreed to drop them at MIT and I don't
recall any revival in Oslo.
