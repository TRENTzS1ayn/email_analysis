Good, that is as I remembered too.

My question is specific to the Brown draft
http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-signature-990618.html

which has always had a criticality attribute on the 'attribute' element and
that has not disappeared.  It is in the text and HTML versions.

Is the criticality flag in this case at odds with the experiences that you
and David Solo have had?

Thanks,

John:

I believe that Dave Solo and I both posted on this with strong feelings
against criticality flags. My comment was that WEBDAV has already thought
this through (ck out RFC
2518) and have chosen to have clients ignore elements they do not
understand. I also share Dave's  "sub-optimal" experience with criticality
flags in PKIX. Frankly, I thought we agreed to drop them at MIT and I don't
recall any revival in Oslo.
