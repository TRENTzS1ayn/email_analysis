Unfortunately, I cannot answer this question. The current solution is
obviously outside the scope of XMLDSIG specification and very much
application-specific, though this "XML packaging" practice could be
sometimes standardized (very similar in functionality to S/MIME).

I am afraid that this approach might be a bit too much specific. In fact, I
start to doubt about the actual benefit of hashing the unencoded content. In
final, you sign the canonical representation of the Manifest and not the
hash. Therefore, in order to sustain a claim, you will have to
establish/demonstrate/prove the construction of the signature WRT to the
original document, the signer key/credential, and the cryptograpic
algorithms. Adding one step in the demonstration is not necessarily the/a
problem (thoughts...)
