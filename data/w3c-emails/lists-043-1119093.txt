I wish to introduce myself to you first. I am Tutu Kabila, the second son of the former president of Democratic Republic of Congo, who was 
murdered by one of his body guards.
I got your contact from the internet out of my desperate search for a reputable person who can assist me in handling a transaction which 
requires absolute secrecy and confidentially. I want you to be aware that I have not discussed this issue with another person and if you are 
not interested please do not disclose this to any other person. I need your assistance in relocating and managing a fund, the sum of 
US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars). This money was deposited with a cargo handling 
company by my father and awaiting instruction for the fund to be moved to its destination before my father was killed. After my father's death 
my half brother Joseph who was the defense minister was appointed the President, he immediately sized our father's assets, he blocked the 
account and confiscated his property( I mean my father's) being the first son he was backed by our tradition which gives the first son the 
privilege of taking everything on the death of our father. Myself, my mother and my younger brother had to leave Democratic Republic of 
Congo for South Africa were we now live without anything and with out any source of livelihood.
Now this is what I want you to do for me.
1. I want you to be presented to the Cargo company as the owner/beneficiary of the fund.
2. To assist me in investing the money in profitable ventures in your country or any other suitable country were you feel is okay.
3. To help relocate my family to your country.
4. To assist me manage the money in a profitable manner.  For Your assistance I shall compensate  you with 10% of the total sum.
The movement of the South Africa to the destination of the fund were it will be cleared and deposited in an account in your name will not be 
a problem because my father gave me the certificate of deposit before he was killed.
The money is deposited in two big truck boxes and will be cargo as soon as you give me your consent.
Kindly give me your telephone number, and Fax number, make sure you include your country code and city code, please.
The money will be moved as a diplomatic cargo without any problem or risk. Please make this issue as confidential as possible.
Thanks.
Tutu Kabila.
