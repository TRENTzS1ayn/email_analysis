No, but it is totally reasonable to expect that if I can carry a particular
type of object that I can do more than treat it like its an object

Then my feeling is that this may be the mindset that dooms  XML DigSig
technology to be "yet another 'we have to support it' PKI exercises".

Actually this is exactly what I expect, and so does the industry I would
venture to guess. 300 different PKI technologies that don't interoperate is
more than absurd, its blatently incompetent... Its abusive of the
marketplace and really does the advancement of the trust that PKI provides
no service that I can see.

Like I have been saying. If you want to use XML for more than document
forms, like as a transaction transport or modeling language, then some
things could maybe be differently... if not, then rock on.
