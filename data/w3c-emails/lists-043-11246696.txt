Canonical XML: W3C Working Draft 29-July-1999

Status of this document

   This is a W3C Working Draft for review by W3C members and other
   interested parties. This draft represents the consensus of the W3C XML
   Syntax Working Group, which expects to make no further substantive
   changes. However, review by the W3C and the broader community may
   reveal new issues and lead to substantive changes. It is inappropriate
   to use W3C Working Drafts as reference material or to cite them as
   other than work in progress.
   
   Comments on this WD should be sent to:
   [15]w3c-xml-c14n-comments@w3.org.
   
Abstract

   This document describes a subset of the information contained in an
   XML document and a syntax for expressing that subset. This syntax,
   called Canonical XML, is designed to encode the "logical structure" of
   XML documents; two XML documents whose Canonical-XML form is identical
   will be considered equivalent for the purposes of many applications.
