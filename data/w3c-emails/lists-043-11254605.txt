Had you been at the meeting, hopefully I would've convinced you this is a
trust application decision  <smile>, and is not related to whether
(valid:signed-resource == true)

signed-resource(I, C, key, sig): there was some request R such that 
        GET(R) = C and address(R) = I and sign-doc(C, key, sig)
sign-doc(C, key, sig): sig is the value of a strong one-way function over 
        content and key that yields C integrity/validity and K
non-repudiability

Again, I would like to redefine "validate" specifically to signature
validation, not trust evaluation/inference. I think you were speaking of the
ability to make application statements such that one can make a useful
inference:

trusted-statement(signed-resource(I, C, key, sig)): where
(signed-resource(I, C, key, sig) and (C consists of assertions {S1, S2, S3})
and infer(S1,S2,S3).

(As I continue on in my bungled notation! Any logic weenies out there?)
