John,

You are correct, I should have clearly indicated that I am an employee of
JetForm Corporation, which makes workflow, electronic forms, and output
management software.  UWI is a competitor in the electronic forms market.

I use this account since unfortunately I can't easily access my JetForm
account outside of the office.

To try and cut through everything, I'll return to my original point:  I
think "security hole" is an inaccurate term.  The problem can be dealt with
at another layer.  The workgroup needs to decide, should it be?
