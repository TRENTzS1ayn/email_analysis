This issue demonstrates one of the main problems with 'canonicalization'.
For canonicalization to be possible the transformation must be semantically
neutral.

Transformations which lose information are not semantically neutral. 
Therefore transforming dates to GMT is not semantically neutral.

I'm not particularly bothered by the canonicalization spec so long
as I am not forced to use it.
