Yes, but knowing the totality of the use models tells you how deep the water
potentially is, and right now we don't know this.

What do you mean by "Punting"

And this is ecactly why in the PKI world the "use model" (Applicability
Statements) are so powerful. becuase if we don't set the scope of the
usefull envelope of our technologies, the implementors may (read as "will")
try to do stuff that is inherently broke and we wind up looking like fools
then for not telling them they couldn't do "XY and Z" without "A" too.
