I think the key point here is the semantics of the field (which,
absolutely, c14n must preserve).  My interpretation is that the time
type's semantics is to identify an instant in time (time zone is merely
a notational option) and even if TZ is present, the semantics doesn't
imply that's where the signer was.  

I think you and Tom (et al.) are indicating that there is a place for a
different attribute which describes other properties of the signature. 
I think defining such an attribute is fine, although outside of the core
syntax.
