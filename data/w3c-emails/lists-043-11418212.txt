Phill,

This doesn't make any sense to me.  If you're presented with a GMT time,
you can always determine the corresponding time in whatever locale you
care about (and even configure your SW to do it for you if you're
lucky).  Thus you know the GMT offset for London, NY, or even onboard
you yacht.  If you're saying that you find the fact that the computer on
which I originated the signature happened to be configured for a
timezone 5 hrs off GMT as important (or even if you knew it was
somewhere in a time zone 5 hrs off GMT - although anywhere in either
hemisphere), I think you're stretching.  Your examples all seem to be
about knowing where it took place more specifically than (more or less)
in which 15 degrees of longitude.
