David,

I accept your main point about the GMT time (or UTC time or
whatever, Todd will probably have an issue) being key.

The concept of 'local time' is not a very usefull one in
a world wide computer network - We agree here.

There is an argument for being able to support local time
information however since it is in some cases necessary to correlate
data which is only available in local time.

Consider the case in which it is the daytrading wizard which
is initiating the trades for me. Critical information that wizard
might require is the knowledge that the trade took place at 3pm
New York time, an hour before the market closed so that the position
could be covered before the end of the day.

Unfortunately the '15 degrees of latitude' bit is only part
of the story. There is also the problem of daylight savings which
is a considerably larger headache since there is no agreed upon date
and in the US DST does not even apply in some parts. The cost of
reconstituting that information is substantial - a trusted source
of daylight savings info is now needed.

The situation in the UK is particularly complex since nobody
knows what timezone the country will be in in five years time and the
dates on which summer time takes effect could be harmonized with the
rest of Europe anytime.


Regardless, the local time information is secondary and
applications are free to treat the local time info (if present) as
they chose.

Phill
