Will make them useless if you send them over a network which does
not preserve these characteristics.

If you insist that the network makes no transformations there is
no problem.

I don't know of any network which transforms local time into GMT
in the body of a message 'by accident'.

We should only look to support data corruption which is intrinsic
to existing networks where the corruption introduced is readily
characterized.


I don't consider the manifest format issue to be one of c18n. It
is a straight syntax issue. If the manifest is transmitted over 
an 8 bit clean channel (MIME attachment or HTTP) there should be
no need to perform canonicalization at the other end.
