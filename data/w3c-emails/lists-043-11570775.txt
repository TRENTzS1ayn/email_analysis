The candidate version of the RD that I plan to post as the next
public-working-draft/ietf-draft is now available. [3] It also includes a
contributor section. In keeping with the XML Signature WG Contributor
Policies [1] I have included a subset of those WG members who opted into the
Participants list [2] AND opted in to inclusion of this document's
contributor section through request or obvious participation on the issues.
I do this as a short-cut/favor, it is ultimately the WG members
responsibility to inform me that they think they meet the criteria defined
in [1]. If I made a mistake and included you and you do not want to be
listed, please let me know. I had hoped to advance this prior to my leaving
for a week (this Friday), but I now I expect I will advance this document as
soon  I return.

   W3C Status of this Document
    
   This is a WG [17]XML Signature Requirements consensus candidate draft.
   Upon final confirmation by the WG, this document will be published as
   a working-draft/ietf-draft. This forthcoming publication will be
   similar to a last-call in that it is asking for substantive community
   wide review, particularly with respect to the dependencies identified
   in this document. It is different from a last call in that it is not
   intended to be advanced to a W3C Proposed Recommendation. Once
   dependencies and commitments have been confirmed with the identified
   WGs, this document may be advanced as an IETF Informational RFC. Aside
   from these caveats, this WG deliverable is largely on schedule with
   respect to the timeline in the [18]WG Charter:
   
     Aug 99 Requirements document to Last Call for NOTE / Informational
     RFC
     
   This document attempts to capture the Working Group's consensus though
   it contains points which are still in dispute or not well
   specified. Issues which are still being actively discussed during the
   publication of this document are of class="discuss" and rendered as
   color:navy by style sheet compliant applications. Editorial comments
   about a discussion point are of class="comment" and rendered in a box
   with a light background.
