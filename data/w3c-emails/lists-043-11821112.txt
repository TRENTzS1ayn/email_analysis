Agreed DH is a difficult issue. But can we just ignore it? DH has some
interesting properties...

Recall that I do not refer to the value of the key nor the value of a
certificate or certificate chain - I just argue about an unambiguous signer
identifier from the perspective of the relying party(ies).

I do not understand your point wrt "baked-in". Where? Supposedly in the
signer device. This will not help the relying party identify the signer (at
least to retrieve a copy of the key).

I used an attribute certificate as an example. Recall that I have been among
the firsts to insist on authentication schemes. And I certainly agree that
in such circumstances we care less about a certificate. But there are others
that need them (attached or not to the message).
