Sorry but I cannot attend the WG meeting because we have a lab review
meeting on the week of 8/30.  I was waiting for any schedule change to the
last minute but it looks like the review meeting will take place as
planned.
I will follow the outcome of the meeting and update our DSIG implementation
accordingly.

Hiroshi
