Manifests that don't use URIs? If so, what would be the example?

What other models are we speaking of?

<John> For example, having the signature directly sign the data by
enveloping the data inside of the manifest. </John>

Now reads, "An XML-signature must be a well-balanced XML region (as defined
by XML-Fragment) that begins and ends with a signature element. [Charter]"

<John>Fragments are still in working draft.  Who knows, a fragment may
change at some point in the future to include non-continuous regions</John>

(At 4.2. Package might start next year, and Boyer doesn't think the fragment
work is sufficient, so I'm flagging these as particularly salient
dependencies.

<John> I think that fragments are almost sufficient except they can't
specify non-continuous regions.  If they could, then the construction of a
fragment would completely satisfy all of my concerns since they already
capture the ancestor element information like tags, attributes and element
depth.

Deep in one of Richard's prior posts, it is suggested that the exclusion
technique (which is what I really want) could be done as c14n parameters.
I'd like this only if it were mandatory to implement so that all XML DSig
compliant applications could understand the signatures I have to create
every day. Another possibility is that someone mentioned to me that the
recent overhaul of XPointer includes the ability to specify non-continuous
regions of the XML resource.  If this could be combined with fragments, then
it would also be sufficient to solve the problems I raised previously about
ancestor information and element order being captured in the signature.
