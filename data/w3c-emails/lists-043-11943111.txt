Agreed to some extent. Negotiation tends to imply some form of handshake
(multiple exchanges) during establishement of the key. However, I think that
"agreement" or "exchange" would be more accurate. The method that is used to
establish the key is not necessarily based upon mathematics.

Why not simply "An XML-signature must be a well-formed XML element"
