Two notes on action items. John has sent me the latest scenarios draft,
which I've posted at [1]. (Thanks John!) I've been having a good
conversation with Ralph Swick on the data model, at first seemingly very
complex, and now getting simpler with some elegance/coolness resulting. But
I still don't have anything I can share with the group yet. Maybe by
tomorrow I'll have a GIF of  DLGs, maybe even some schema definition
language, but perhaps not. Took me much longer to catch up on trivia,
adminstrivia, and manegeria <smile> after being away for a week. Sorry!
