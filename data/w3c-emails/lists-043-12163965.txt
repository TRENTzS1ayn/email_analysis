The following is my visio version and edited DLG representation [1] of a
single instance/example of a data model. ([2] has some explanatory
comments.) It isn't redundant, but could easily be used to show multiple
signature over a single manifest or package, etc. It also looks really
complex on first glance, but it addresses innumerable rat holes quite well I
think. Also, remember a useful way to read these things are:

"Subject (has/is) Predicate Object" or
"Resource is related to Value via Property"

like:
Singature is Over Manifest. or
External is related to hashvalue via computes

Hopefully I'll post the resulting syntax of this example tomorrow which
should make it much more concrete for those that didn't argue in front on a
white board for 3 hours! <grin>

For background on the nature of the assertions/relationship of HTTP GET:
"external" and "show(M,C,I)" see [3]. For background (which might be
confusing at this point, because of the nomenclature that has evolved) on
the numerous assertions involved in a package, see [4].
