Since it has already been agreed by the group that C14N
is OPTIONAL it cannot be part of a mandatory to implement
section.

I already have XML signature applications being specified.
I want to align them with the spec as soon as possible. I
do not want to be forced to wait for the outcome of the
C14N discussions to terminate before I can do this.

I have no technical requirement for C14N and plenty of
reasons to avoid it, not least the fact that like 
compression, C14N is a likely target of patents filed
with corrupt intent.


I know some people in the group believe that they must
have C14N but they have already agreed that they will not
force this requirement on others.

If the overhead of XML signatures exceeds that of CMS it
has lost all value for me.
