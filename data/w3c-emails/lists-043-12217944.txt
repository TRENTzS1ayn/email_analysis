Hi Phillip,

Although putting an exclusion list in the canonicalizer element is an
interesting idea, it is certainly not the only place to put it.  I sent a
write-up to Joseph with several alternatives, which he said would soon be
added as a comment to requirement 3.1.3.

Most compelling is the idea of adding an exclude element to the resource
element.  So, in addition to a Locator, you would have a list of sub
locators (XPointers, identifiers, ?) that would specify the parts of the
document to drop out of the construction of the message to be hashed.

If c14n is optional, then I'd definitely like to keep c14n separate from the
need to indicate exclusions because I think the latter is mandatory if
signing partial XML is a requirement (which it currently is).  Please see
[1] and [2] for why.

[2]http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/1999JulSep/0193.html

Also, I'd like to reiterate that the implementation of an exclusion list is
quite a simple programming task.  It would take less work to build one than
it would to construct a convincing case that this would seriously impact an
implementation timeline.  Even if one wasn't originally planning to procure
and use an XML parser, there exist ones which are free, easy to work with,
and very small (Clark's parser is an example).

Finally, as to whether or not the thing we are talking about is a c14n
algorithm, I agree that it is not, so c14n is not really the best place to
put it anyway.  The canonical form of an object is a particular logically
equivalent representative, whereas when we try to define which subelements
to exclude, we are really talking about a way of specifying a different
object (the element without certain descendants).  This is why I like the
exclude list better in the resource (or somehow wrapped up in the syntax of
a Locator itself).  Still, Brown suggested the possibility of putting it
somewhere, anywhere, and that was a good enough start for me.

Since it has already been agreed by the group that C14N
is OPTIONAL it cannot be part of a mandatory to implement
section.

I already have XML signature applications being specified.
I want to align them with the spec as soon as possible. I
do not want to be forced to wait for the outcome of the
C14N discussions to terminate before I can do this.

I have no technical requirement for C14N and plenty of
reasons to avoid it, not least the fact that like
compression, C14N is a likely target of patents filed
with corrupt intent.


I know some people in the group believe that they must
have C14N but they have already agreed that they will not
force this requirement on others.

If the overhead of XML signatures exceeds that of CMS it
has lost all value for me.

Phill
