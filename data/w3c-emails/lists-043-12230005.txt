I agree. (Though the agreement over c14n being optional is over actual
content referrenced in a package or manifest, not over the processing of the
package or manifest itself, right? David and Richard's proposals seem to
require c14n of those objects. David, Richard?)

Agree. I don't think we need to cram everything into c14n. There's a whole
slew of transformations people will want to do, we need to make sure that
our required to implement features are implemented by one of the
required-to-implement mechanisms (be it an exclude tag or whatever.)

I think that is a worthwhile bound to come in under.
