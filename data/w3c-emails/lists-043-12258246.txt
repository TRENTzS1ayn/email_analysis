This is not a typical specification Last Call, but a requirements document
Last Call. Where the specification Last Call requires commitment for review,
this Last Call solicits/prompts those commitments. Since this WG is not
formally part of any CG, procedurally it is unclear which CG I should
coordinate with in order to procure review commitments; substantively, the
XML-CG is an obvious choice. Over the next few weeks I will be attempting to
procure commitments for review from members of the following groups
identified in the Requirements Document.

    1. The XML Signature specification should meet the requirements of
       the following applications:
         1. Internet Open Trading Protocol v1.0 [IOTP]
         2. Financial Services Mark Up Language v2.0 [Charter]
         3. At least one forms application [XFA, XFDL]
    2. To ensure that all requirements within this document are
       adequately addressed, the XML Signature specification must be
       reviewed by a designated member of the following communities:
         1. XML Syntax Working Group: canonicalization dependencies.
            [Charter]
         2. XML Linking Working Group: signature referants. [Charter]
         3. XML Schema Working Group: signature schema design. [Charter]
         4. Metadata Coordination Group: data model design. [Charter]
         5. W3C Internationalization Interest Group:  [AC Review]
         6. XML Package Working Group: signed content in/over packages.
         7. XML Fragement Working Group: signing portions of XML content.
       


XML-Signature Requirements 
W3C Working Draft 1999-August-20

Last Call Ends 1 October 1999

W3C Status of this Document

   This is a Last Call XML Signature Requirements public Working
   Draft. This report is not expected to be advanced to Recommendation.
   Instead, this Last Call designation is (1) a representation of WG
   consensus, (2) an invitation for comments that will affect the future
   course of the technical specification, and (3) an opportunity to
   identify and obtain commitments regarding WG dependencies. This
   document will be referred to at least the W3C XML Plenary Interest
   Group and W3C Chairs Working Group. Last Call period ends when
   dependencies between WGs have been acknowledged and the Signature
   Chairs have procured commitments of review. This is expected to take
   six weeks from the date of publication.
   
   This document attempts to capture the Working Group's consensus though
   it contains points which are still uncertain or not well
   specified. Issues which are still being actively discussed during the
   publication of this document are of class="discuss" and rendered in
   navy by style sheet compliant applications.
   
   Please send comments to the editor <reagle@w3.org> and cc: the
   list <w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>. Publication as a Working Draft
   does not imply endorsement by the W3C membership. This is a draft
   document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents
   at any time. It is inappropriate to cite W3C Drafts as other than
   "work in progress". A list of current W3C working drafts can be found

   the XML Digital Signature specification. It includes requirements as
   they relate to the signature syntax, data model, format, cryptographic
   processing, and external requirements and coordination.
