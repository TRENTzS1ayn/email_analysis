Rich,

I do not think that we should address this problem at the xmldsig level and
would rather let the upper layer defines an adequate naming-scheme. This is
the position adopted by IOTP.

However, this implies that all the elements being combined have been
originated by a same application (true in most circumstances). When the
elements are from diverse origins, I tend to feel that the application
consists of an 'interchange' (xMail :-) and, in such circumstances, would
promote encoding and packaging.

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
