DISCUSSION

  Canonicalization

  The report of the W3C Syntax working group was discussed.  People had
  a number of questions about it.  Richard Brown questioned dropping the
  doctype and dropping white space inside attribute values.  Milton
  Anderson had questions about the canonicalization and significance
  status of new lines at the end of element tags.  There seemed to be
  some confusion in reference to examples in the canonicalization draft.
  Hiroshi Maruyama has already sent in some comments.  Richard Brown and
  others should post their comments to the XMLDSIG list by the 10th of
  August and Donald Eastlake will submit them in a batch as provided in
  the draft.
