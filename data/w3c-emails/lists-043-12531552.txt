Yes, this solution addresses the case where the elements are from diverse
origins, for example, a summarization of legal events from different historical
documents.  If the application has enough information at the time of the
signature, it can eliminate ambiguity.  If it doesn't have the information,
there will be a conflict.  So the question becomes whether or not requiring all
signed elements to have a unique permanent ID is too restrictive.  There are
hacks, but they will be implemented as inconsistent or proprietary solutions
unless it is addressed in the standard.

Thanks,
Rich
