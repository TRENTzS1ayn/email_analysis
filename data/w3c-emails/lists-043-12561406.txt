I think it may be important to be clear about your non-contiguous
portions.  Specifically, will they be restricted to what the XML
Fragment spec calls well-balanced regions, or do they need to be
able to be un-well-balanced?  If the latter, that will probably
raise a lot more issues and require a lot more coordination, say,
with the XML Infoset and DOM and Fragments and XPointer and such 
(since most XML processes work on a tree or node model of XML element 
structure which wouldn't allow un-well-balanced regions).
