Just to add: I do NOT have a problem understanding canonicalization required
by different character-sets, different line-breaks, and things like that.
Obviously necessary as we are talking about text-based documents. I was just
wondering if anything beyond that was really an requirement (like pulling in
external stuff).

Looking at DOMHASH, this doesn't adress any of these basic canonicalization
issues (just mentioning it). Am I missing something here?
