My pragmatic opinion on this (aside from all the interesting discussion): If
we have any mandatory to implement c14n at this stage, I don't think it
should do anything beyond character composition/encoding/CR-LF processing.
Additionally, we should specify (or adopt) it ASAP and ensure its been
widely implemented/tested/used before normatively referencing/including it.
Syntax c14n, DOM-HASH, or whatever can evolve and be standardized as
appropriate by another WG, or by this one once we've completed the core
signature by December.
