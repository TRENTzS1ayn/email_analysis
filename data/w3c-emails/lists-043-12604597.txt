So my problem here is in the normal case, once the document is signed, there
should be no transformations. The purpose of digital signatures is to lock
the document in a known static state. The argument that the transformed
document is semantically the same requires applications to agree on the
semantics of the signature itself. The working group has continued to push
off the semantics of the signature to the application. If this is the case,
only the application can choose appropriate c14n algorithms -- and then can
only interoperate with other applications that agree with its definition of
the semantics of the signature.

But interoperability implies that applications agree on the semantics of the
signature as well.
