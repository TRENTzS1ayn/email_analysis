"The meaning of a signature is simple:  The XML-signature syntax associates
the content of resources listed in a manifest with a key via a strong
one-way transformation. " We of course may wish to generalize this to
"associates content" -- regardless of a manifest. The semantics of the stuff
we sign is tricky, we'll have to address some of this for a c14n, manifest,
package, and reference -- and this is where we are things get tricky; so we
want to intrude into this domain minimally. We want to punt on application
semantics all-together.

Right, so we are (as lightly as possible) touching on the semantics of
{c14n, manifest, package, and reference} so as to provide a minimal set of
interoperable trust assertion/evaluation functionality. c14n is actually
different than the other 3 in that I do believe it could be done completely
at the application level. If we bungle the definitions of manifest, package,
and reference it makes it difficult for other people to extend what we've
done in terms of data-model/assertions.
