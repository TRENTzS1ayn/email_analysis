John Boyer has been the advocate for this requirement, so perhaps he can
speak more authoritatively. My understanding is that one needs ways of
signing portions of XML. I suspect Xlink/Ptrs could be abused in that I
could have a series of locators referencing elements with given IDs and
change the relative order of those resources within the document and the
signature would still pass -- their relative order wasn't captured by
listing the Xlinks as signature references. Excluding portions of a complete
XML document from the signature, or selecting those portions and maintaining
the context and their relative positions seem to be the two feasible options.

Regardless, I expect well-balanced regions [1] are sufficient for the
applications I know of. To that end, the content production [2:43] rule
might even cover most of what people would want to do.
