Just saw this, thought it might be relevant:

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


        Title           : Capability Card: An Attribute Certificate in
XML

   This document describes basic ideas and data components of
   'Capability Card,' which is a kind of attribute certificates designed
   from the standpoint of a secure communication framework on the
   Internet. Similar to the SPKI certificates, a capability card can be
   used to grant a person particular access privileges to resources like
   WWW pages, IRC channels, and message boxes.  In addition, it can
   carry a variety of descriptive information about the issuer, the
   resources, and the privileges specified in it.  A capability card is
   written in XML, which is becoming a standard format rapidly for the
   internet data exchange. Consequently, users can handle various
   information in capability cards visually with an XML viewer.  This is
   a fairly desirable feature for the existing internet services.
 
   In this document, following the motivation and the basic concepts,
   the elements of XML DTD of capability cards are described.
