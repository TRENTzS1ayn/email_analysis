John, thanks for your comments. To others: this is how we improve the notes
and come to closure on the list on some fuzzy issues and give others who
weren't there a sense of what happened. So get your comments in by the 10th.

It states that in one point, perhaps you are referring to something earlier?
(People should feel free to annotate the notes so I know excactly which text
they are referring to.)

Consensus. The reference from SignedInfo will just be a URI. This can then
  point to a manifest or package which can use Xlink/Xptr/Xpath as
appropriate.     This means you don't have to worry about Xptr in the core
signature syntax.

I added "without fragID" to be clear. However, I think we need it to be a
URI or fragmentID (to a packaged chunk of XML in the same document.) Right?

I honestly don't recall. I'll note that in the notes as reference as we
tweak names of our elements as we move forward.

Why do we need an "extract" element anway? If we are using XPtr, it would
just be part of the manifest reference, no?

Since the core syntax only uses a URI, any other references would be part of
the manifest/package and should be defined there, right?

Its orthogonal to the point directly above though its highlighted because
its a good point we need to investigate. I hope people are willing to give
me the benefit of the doubt and assume incompetence instead of malice in
meeting minutes that haven't yet been reviewed by anyone. <smile>

Again, I'm not sure what text you are referring to, but it does say:

Norman: can we do this in a simpler way, with a dsig:exclude attribute?
Which requirements does Xptr meet that can not be met through an easier
method? Group: The insertion of dsig:exclude is problematic when you have
multiple signatures, how does which signature know which dsig:exclude
belongs to it.

I added 

        Boyer also asserts this adds security problems in that it requires
modifications 
        to the signed document. (see Boyer 1990902 for more.)
