The issue of accessing relatively arbitrary spans of an XML instance was
brought up at the F2F (by Peter Norman I think) and we were not sure how it
might be done.  Anyway, I've noticed that "range axis" in the XPointer
Working Draft ("http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr") seems like it could provide
the capability.

I should emphasize that I do not see being able to access a range as
necessarily desirable for version 1.0 of the XML digital signature; I'm just
pointing out that the capability is being considered within XPointer.
