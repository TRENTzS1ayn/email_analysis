I don't think this is our problem.  If you are receiving a complete
XML document over some channel where a variety of encodings can be
used, you need the "<?" at the beginning to figure it out.  If you
have or receive a part of an XML document then you had better already
know the encoding.  A partial document where you don't know the
encoding doesn't work the way XML is defined.  This is not our
problem.  It's part of XML.

On the ID question, is this actually relavent for anything other than
fragments?

If there are standard auxiliary documents affecting meaning that are
pointed to out of an XML document, the best thing would be a
canonicalization algorithm that incorporated the auxiliary document
into the main document so it could all be treated as a single entity.

As others have pointed out, a dictionary attack pertains primarily to
confidentiality which we are not doing.  But the effort to add an
optional <nonce> with ANY content seems pretty trivial.

I continue to believe that a canoncialization based on DOM should be
the default.  Anyone that does processing of any significance on XML
will do something very much like parsing it into a DOM tree.  It's
fine if some people want null or minimal canonicalization but they are
not really dealing with XML, just with binary character data that
happens to be XML.  If you want to do extraction from character data,
I would think you should be using an awk script or something, not
XPointer.

I don't think I'm pushing "exclude tags", just the idea of elements
that can, for applications that need this, be sprinkled into XML to
act as markers for use in Xpoint/Xpath/whatever extraction.

There are people who want to do really lightweight stuff for simple
protocols.  It doesn't seem reasonable that they should be burdened
with a requirement to implement XPointer.

I understand that it allows separate update/evolution but I'm not sure
the complexity of an additional namespace is worth it.
