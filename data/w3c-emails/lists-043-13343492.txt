Donald and WG,

I've made the changes I think are relevant. They are reflected in the
following document in red underline. I request we review these tweaks on the
list and confirm its advancement at the next conference call.

http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/WD-xmldsig-requirements-990916.html

Also, 3.4 now reads "The signature design and specification text must not
permit implementers to erroringly build weak implementations susceptible to
common security weaknesses (such as as downgrade or algorithm substitution
attacks)." Anyone have a good reference to a security design principles
document? I think I remember seeing one in IETF...

2.1 ... The XML syntax used to represent a signature (over any content) is
described as an XML-signature.

Ok.

Ok.

opt to

XLink [Xlink] within its own signature syntax. For any resource
identification beyond simple URIs (without fragment IDs) or fragmentIDs,
applications must use XLink locators to reference signed resources

I tried rewriting the manifest sections, and felt it too awkard, so now it
says:

2.2 ... (In this document we use the term manifest to mean a collection of
references to the objects being signed. The specifications may use the terms
manifest, package or other terms differently from this document while still
meeting this requirement.) 

 >2.4 Suggest replacing "A key" with "An important".

Good.

 the XML-Fragment or XPointer specifications to yield this functionality, or
a requested change to those specifications if the functionality is not
available. See List(Boyer(1,2)) for further discussion of this issue.
