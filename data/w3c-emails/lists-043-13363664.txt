Its all a balancing act. My philosophy is to always (or as soon as possible)
have a spec that can be implemented but with lots of simple options,
defaults and stubs in there. Sort of like ship early and often.

Again, my default is to not justify removal, but justify inclusion.

I'd agree with that, so it does implicitly get filtered through InfoSet/DOM.
Doing a string based perl XPtr locator would not work (or you have to
specify the c14n with it as well.)
