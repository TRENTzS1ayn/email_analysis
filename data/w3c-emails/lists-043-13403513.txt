John,

Thanks for this explanation.  Now that I understand what you mean by
closure, I think that this is all something very close to the document
versus protocol viewpoint clash.  I'm fine with our resulting standard
being able to do what you want as described below, or similar things.
There remains the questions of whether XPointer / XPath or subset is
adequate / inadequate and mandatory / recommended / optional but I'd
like to nail down what facilities will meet requirements before
deciding on mandatoryness.  I'm not so sure anymore about XPath
etc. and will post a separate note on why I have doubts.

Equallty important is the fact that many applications don't give a
damn about document closure.  IOTP, for example, never cares about it
and always signs only selected sub-parts of the XML documents it
exchanges ("document"s in the XML definition sense, not in the sense
that a normal human being is every likely to try to read one).  As a
result, it is trivial for a bad guy who can mess with transmssions to
stick stuff into various unsigned parts of IOTP messages.  But there
has never been any complaint on the TRADE WG mailing list that this is
a problem.  Even if you assumed it was and you added a signature over
the entire document other than the signature, you would still need
signatures over parts of the document because in many cases parts of
the document are forwarded and the signature on those parts need to be
verified.

Given that there is a requirement for such "non-closure signatures" it
hardly matters to any of the points you were making if the part signed
is designated by a particular attribute in a signed element, by
particular begin/end attributes that braket or begin and end a signed
element sequence, or if we define options marker elements that can be
used to bracket a signed element sequence.  I see no reason not to
permit all of these.

Thanks,
Donald
