   This document has been prepared during the [7]Last Call of the [8]XML
   Signature Requirements Document. This coordination is expected to be
   guided bythe [9]XML Activity Process for Requirements and Issue
   Tracking.
   
   The following text describes the Signature WG Chairs' views on
   dependencies or requests for review that must be satisfied prior to
   the XML Signature specifications being advanced beyond Last Call. We
   are soliciting a commitment to resolve a dependency (by having it
   addressed it in a spec or RD) and/or a commitment to review the XML
   Signature specification(s) -- a specific question is sometimes
   included as well. The W3C staff contact for the WG is idenitified
   though he need not necessarily be the designated reviewer.
