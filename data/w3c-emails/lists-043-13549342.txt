Since this was addressed to me (I assume in my capacity as proposed 
co-chair of the forthcoming XML Packaging WG), I feel compelled to 
respond, but it is unclear what I should say.

You are soliciting a commitment, but you don't suggest a timeframe for
response.  Specifically, I don't know how to make any commitment in
the name of a WG that doesn't yet exist and doesn't expect to exist
for perhaps many months.  Is is acceptable that you wait for any
response to your request for commitment until the WG exists, or do 
you have a different suggestion?

Also, after a quick read of your message and the referenced requirements
document, I don't (personally--but of course I can't speak for whoever
turns out to be a future member of the forthcoming XML Packaging WG)
understand most of what you've written.  Maybe this indicates that I
shouldn't be co-chair of the XML Packaging WG!  But whenever it becomes
time to consider the dependencies you list, someone will have to explain
to me what they mean.  But I guess there is no need to do that now if
the plan is to wait for the WG to exist before going any further.
