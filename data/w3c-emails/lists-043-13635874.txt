Tim,

I agree with your analysis. I think we are essentially arguing the
same case but with slight differences in terminology. What is signed
is by definition the document.

In order to verify the signature the document the client has to
assemble the exact bit sequence that was signed. The client has no
business trusting any document other than the document that the verified
bit sequence represents.

One XML document may well be transported encapsulated in another
but unless the enclosing document is signed the data it contains cannot
be trusted.
