Hi Joseph,

You are right in that naming in W3C TRs varies considerably.  However, I
think there has been a slow, inconsistent, general move in the direction of
lowercase, compete words.  I did not mean to imply that there was a specific
style guideline for this though I would certainly support one that did.

I don't consider HTML or even XHTML to be indicators of current naming
styles because HTML dates back several years.  When HTML and a few dozen
tags were the only game in town, sure we could get by with <P> for paragraph
and <LI> for list item.  Now with the great variety of DTDs/schemas made
possible by XML, I'm a big fan of making element and attribute names as
clear and quickly readable as possible.

Regards, Ed
