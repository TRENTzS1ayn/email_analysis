Greg,

In an odd sort of way, there is presently no "current spec." However, we are
moving as quickly as possible to document the open issues in the body of [1]
(which is a product of WG consensus) and publish it as an ietf-draft and W3C
Technical Report. The draft you are referring to [2] has references to a few
things (such as XHash) that I don't think have been publically specified.
The "Brown Draft" [2] was a private draft/proposal and was unfortunately
named using the WG name instead of the authors' name. (Though Don should be
able to speak more authoritatively to the pacing of the syntax specification
[3]).

The Syntax C14N as specified in [4] has been implemented [5].
