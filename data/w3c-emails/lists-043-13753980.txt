Greg,
See "XML Security Suite" available from IBM's alphaWorks
(http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/).  It contains a reference implementation (with
complete source code) along with a list of digest values of James Clark's test
cases.

Subject:  XHASH / DOMHASH




I've seen several references to an XHASH spec, but can't find it.  Any
pointers would be appreciated.

In the meantime, I'm looking at DOMHASH.  The DOMHASH spec defers to DOM for
normalization, but I can't find any specific recomendations in the DOM spec.
The closest I've found is section 1.1.6 (Case sensitivity in the DOM) where
we find:

     > As such, the DOM assumes that any normalizations will
     > take place in the processor, before the DOM structures
     > are built.

I've seen reference to a W3C WG on XML Canonicalization, and expect that all
questions will eventually be answered there, but what are people doing in
the meantime?  Are there any test cases that I could use to test a DOMHASH
implementation for conformance to the current spec?

Thanks,

-Greg
