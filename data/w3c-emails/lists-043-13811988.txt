Andreas:

Other people on this list hold the very same opinion.  Indeed, as an
American lawyer, I believe there are very good legal reasons why *not*
signing the stylesheet might just get and XML document thrown out of court
if/when it were introduced into evidence.  Such a result would, of course,
make the technology much less valuable.

Thank you for your input.  I think having someone with a new and fresh
perspective helps to shed light on the simplicity and logic of the notion.
I wish others would see it so clearly.

Todd
