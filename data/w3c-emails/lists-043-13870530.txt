true if all you want is the generic XML DOM, in which case you don't
really need to "define a DOM for your language" - you get this for free

not true if you want a language-specific DOM, in which case the
XML attributes become identifiers in whatever programming language
you want to use for the DOM

you may want to dispute the need for the latter, but the SYMM WG
felt that this would be needed, especially since it makes
manipulating attribute values simpler in Ecmascript (java seems
to be less of a problem)
