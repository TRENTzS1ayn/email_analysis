... otherwise how do you know the context for the XML data?

You know the context because interpretation of the XML data is being done by
software from a presumably reliable source to do the interpretation that is
built according to a specification that describes the semantics of data 

... I now feel that we're getting very close to the topic of "trusted"
applications  and I'm not sure we want to go there ...

UWI.com has an XML implementation that signs the "presentation" (eg. the
XSL)
as well as the XML.  In their view, it is critically important to sign
both, otherwise
how do you know the context for the XML data?
