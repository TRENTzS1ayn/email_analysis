I agree ... but in IOTP the XML data can include an offer that says, for
example, "purchase a widget for $10". This offer can be expressed in XML
(with a style sheet if required), HTML or plain text. However the buyer
needs to be "presented" with the offer to decide whether or not to accept
it. The offer can also be signed for the usual reasons such as:
- tamper resistance
- to authenticate the creator

So really there's a mixture of wire protocol and human intepretation ...

Where XML is being used in the context of a wire protocol, and there is no
XSL style sheet used in the interpretation of the messages by the protocol
engine, it shouldn't be necessary to include any XSL in the signature.

In general, you need to look at the context in which signed data is being
interpreted and be sure that all of the elements critical to the
interpretation can be trusted (were signed or obtained securely from some
trusted source).

UWI.com has an XML implementation that signs the "presentation" (eg. the
XSL)
as well as the XML.  In their view, it is critically important to sign
both, otherwise
how do you know the context for the XML data?
