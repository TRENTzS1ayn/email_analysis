For server-to-server applications it is also true that the document
closure issue can be addressed by the application's business rules.
The business rules can define that a valid document must contain
specific elements, and that the validity of the document is not affected
by any other elements outside of those which are signed and required
to be present at the workflow processing node under consideration.

Furthermore, I'm opposed to imbuing signatures with a generic "meaning"
stronger than --
Verify (message, publicKey) = True|False.
i.e. the signature verification algorithm was provided with the
indicated message bit string and the public key, and
either the signature algorithm ran properly to completion and produced
a True value, or it produced a False value or didn't complete.

Any other discussion of "meaning" should be left to the applications
that use signatures.

Perhaps we need a separate, simpler XML signature mechanism for
server-to-server applications?
