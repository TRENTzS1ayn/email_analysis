Following that line of reasoning would have us include a signed copy of the
whole operating environment including the operating system and all running
processes.  A reasonable boundary for the things that should be signed by a
party are the things that the party has control over (the XML and XSL) under
normal circumstances (i.e., when you are not being "hacked" by the party).

But to present legally binding evidence at a future date you may need to
present the signed XML, the presentation (signed XSL) and perhaps even
the application that displayed it (a signed copy of Netscape??? or perhaps
the UWI.com forms browser?)
