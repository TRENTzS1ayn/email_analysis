Proof in court depends on all kind of factors, many of which never appear in any
computer readable form.   As long as we provide ways for people to sign digital
objects, they can include under the signatre, directly or indirectly, anything
they want including anything they think might be helpful for later proofs.  If
someone wants to write a draft in the XMLDSIG group on the topic of what you
might want to sign in conjuction with a document for such legal purposes, they
are welcome to do so, but I don't see this as having a lot to do with our task
of defining XML digital signature syntax and processing.  Nor do I see these
questions as having much to do with IOTP where most signatures having nothing to
do with human sensible documents but rather with highly stylized protocol
messages.

But to present legally binding evidence at a future date you may need to
present the signed XML, the presentation (signed XSL) and perhaps even
the application that displayed it (a signed copy of Netscape??? or perhaps
the UWI.com forms browser?)
