Notwithstanding whether there is some as yet undiscerned pattern to the use
of attributes versus content, both cases appear to have the property of
being smaller, suggesting that at least one motivation was smaller message
size.

Subject: DataModel Types and Values in Solo's Draft


Some thoughts on the things I didn't work on much in Solo's draft.

__

 I was starting work on a manifest/package document and wanted to plug in
and
 use syntax (particularly the references) from the Solo draft but I continue
 to find the lack of a data model behind it to be very frustrating. Why are
 somethings types and others values, and some values content? Was this
 purposeful? (I don't recall) One can ask this from the point of view
 syntactic consistency or from a datamodel point of view.

 (1) For instance:
   <dsig:signaturevalue value="dd2323dd"/>
 signaturevalue is a node/resource that is somehow (anonymously) related to
 signature with a property "value" and value "dd2323dd".

 But why not:
   <dsig:signaturevalue>dd2323dd</dsig:signaturevalue>
 Signature value is a property of signature with value "dd2323dd". Makes
much
 more sense.

(2) Elsewhere:
  <dsig:keyinfodata type="keyname"> 3 </dsig:keyinfodata>
 keyinfodata is a resource that is somehow (anonymously) related to keyinfo.
 keyinfodata has a property of "type" with a value "keyname". KeyInfoData is
 also related to some literal "3" but I'm not sure how.

 But why not:
   <dsig:keyinfo>
      <dsig:keyattributes>
        <dsig:keyname>3</dsig:keyname>
        <dsig:keyvalue>4</dsig:keyvalue>
        <dsig:keyretrievalmethod>urn:DH</dsig:keyretrievalmethod>
      </dsig:keyattributes>
   </dsig:keyinfo>
 keyinfo is a property that relates signature to keyattributes.
keyattributes
 has numerous properties (keyname, keyvalue) all with different values.
