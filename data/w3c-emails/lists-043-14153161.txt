... and even perhaps a digitally signed copy of the PC and operating system
on which it was run ?

Seriously though, if it comes to a court case I believe it's all a question
of being able to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts are
true which is a subjective opinion. I therefore thing that you probably
don't need signed copies of:
- the PC
- the operating system
- the browser and, I would content
- the style sheet ...

... as long as the style sheet was widely and publically available from
several sources and it was generally accepted as being a reasonable
presentation of the information in the XML document.

... but then I'm not a lawyer.

But to present legally binding evidence at a future date you may need to
present the signed XML, the presentation (signed XSL) and perhaps even
the application that displayed it (a signed copy of Netscape??? or perhaps
the UWI.com forms browser?)
