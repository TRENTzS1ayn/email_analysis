It is a bit verbose but here is what I came up with


OLD:

2.An XML document of a certain type must still be recognizable as its original
type when signed. For
              example, an XML form, when signed, should still be recognizable as
a XML form to its application
              after it has been signed. [WS-summary]


NEW:

2. It must be easy to specify XML documents that contain signatures.  For XML
signatures, it must be easy to specify the material that is signed such that
they can be inserted within a document and cover all or part of the document
outside of the inserted signature.  The intent is that, for example, an XML form
can be specified such that it is still recognizable as its original type after a
signature over all or most of the form (other than the signature iteself) is
inserted within the form. [WS-summary]
