Hi Richard,

Since this one seems to matter a lot to me, how about something like this:

2. It must be easy to specify XML documents that contain signatures.  For
XML signatures, it must be easy to specify the material that is signed such
that signatures can be inserted within a document and cover all or part of
the document outside of the inserted signature.  The intent is that the root
element tag remain invariant under the operation of signature creation.
