Joseph,

Please find RD comments below.

#2.3: Why sublist 2.3.1-2.3.2?

#2.3: "...via a strong one-way transformation."
note: A signature or authentication algorithm is not necessarily a one-way
function. It is a cryptographic algorithm whose strength primarily resides
in the secrecy of a key.

#2.2.2: The formal description is quite confusing. among other things, R is
defined as a resource and then used for a request. Also, what is the K
parameter listed at the end of the definition.

#2.6: "Applications are expected to normalize application specific semantics
prior to handing data to a XML-signature application."
note: Why? It shall be sufficient to specify the canonicalizer to be used by
the signature engine...

#2.6/2.7: You refer to XML-signature application. Is that correct? Don't you
think that we are referring to any XML application that makes use of the XML
Signature Specification?

#3.2.2: see current discussion on the list...
