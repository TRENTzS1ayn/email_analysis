ok.

ok.

I feel they qualify what it means to be simple.

The secrecy of the key is moot if the transformation is easily reversable.
It doesn't say a one-way function (but transformation) and we avoided "via a
cryptographic transformation" to avoid precluding signature methods that
weren't cryptographic. (I'm not advocating them, but I don't see why the
specification MUST preclude them.)  But later in the formal definition, I do
use "one way function" which I've fixed. I'm happy to change this if others
things I should though (to cryptographic transformation).

Agreed! Now reads:

Comment: A more formal definition of a signed resource is below. The
notation is "definition(inputs):constraints" where definition evaluates as
true for the given inputs and specified constraints.

signed-resource(URI-of-resource, content, key, signature): (there was some
protocol message at a specific time such that "GET(URI-of-resource) =
content") AND (sign-doc(content, key, sig))

sign-doc(content, key, signature): signature is the value of a strong
one-way transformation over content and key that yields content
integrity/validity and/or key non-repudiability

" ... or specify the necessary transformations for this process within the
signature."

Yes, one could argue that XML-signature applications are a type of XML
application. But we do need to specify requirements over that type of
application, whereas we can't specify those requirements over all XML
applications. (I don't follow...?)
