1. (Don, your wording sounds like a requirement over documents.)
2. (Richard, your wording of "any place in a document", I'm not sure how
that fits in with respect to violating someone else's document's content
model. If they define their schema such that no externally qualified
namespaces are permitted, well then, you can't imbed a signature I don't
think.  Also, whole or partiality is captured in 3.1.3)

The new wording is:

2. When XML signatures are placed within a document they must preserve the
invariance of the document's root element tag and the descendancy tree of
the root element except for the addition of signature element(s) in places
permitted by the document's content model. For example, an XML form, when
signed, should still be recognizable as a XML form to its application after
it has been signed. [WS-summary]
