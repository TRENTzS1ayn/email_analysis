How about 
"It shall be possible to embed an XML Signature element at any location
within an XML document permitted by the DTD (if one exists) and to specify
the scope of the signature independently of such location."

Possible additions - "signing applications are discouraged from changing
the root of a document or reorganizing the descendancy tree" "signing
applications are encouraged to sign the DTD where this is reasonable"
"signing applications are strongly discouraged from changing the DTD" 

I don't feel so strongly about the first, since it seems to \me the DTD can
always forbid most pernicious document reorganizations. We could forbid
changes to the DTD, but I hate to forbid something that might be useful in
some unanticipated circumstances.
