>4.3.3 Transformations

Are transformations to be applied in the order specified?

Am I correct in reading this as "the spec will eventually define a default
c14n algorithm, which will be either null or identity"?

I assume this same default will apply to SignedInfo when its c14nAlg is
omitted? If so, language should be added to sec 4.0 or 4.1.
