Yes.  The current consensus is that at the top level, the ObjectReferences in 
SignedInfo, core processing includes validating the digest.  One motivation, 
among others, was that a core signature operation whose behavior does not 
include verifying that the item referenced is the item signed would be 
deficient at best.  

In building an application, you can have the ObjectReference point to a 
Manifest (or other document of your definition, such as a TTP request/response) 
which contains references to other objects.  In this case, the core behavior 
would validate the digest on the Manifest, but not the referenced objects.
