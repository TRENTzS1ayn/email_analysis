I noticed that HMAC-SHA1 is a REQUIRED algorithm in the core-991001 spec,
but I don't see where MAC algorithms come up in the core syntax.

If this is carried over from earlier drafts that described an HMAC-SHA1
"signature" algorithm, then I would vote for removing it.  The HMAC-SHA1
signature algorithm could be described in a separate document if there is
interest in it.  My reluctance to endorse it as a signature algorithm in the
core spec is that it doesn't offer non-repudiation (the signature verifier
can trivially forge the signature), and this is a subtle point that might be
misunderstood by relying parties.
