Thanks for the comments! Just wanted to reply to this one quickly before I
head home. If you are referring to comments that are rendered in red and
begin with ";" yes. If you mean things that begin "Editorial Comment:" not
necessarily. I believe a draft specification should be clear and terse, but
also give an indication of those issues which are still not resolved or
immature. An affect of specification maturity is the elimination of those
comments; until then I think they are necessary to focus attention/comment
from reviewers and ensure that (warn) reviewers/implementors do not read a
specification as if the whole thing is evenly baked.
