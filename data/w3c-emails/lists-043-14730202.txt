When/where was this requirement added?  None of my drafts have such a
statement.  Perhaps you mean copyright?  I think the IESG is very
close to requiring the ISOC copyright on all standards track drafts
but, as far as I know, they have not actually done so yet...

People wanted Signature spelled out and a few other things but I'm not
sure about alg.  Given that it is immediately followed by an
"Alogrithm" attribute, it seem awefully redundant to spell it out.

Do you mean "... in the element immediately surrounding the
Signature."?

I'd be interested in others input on this point.  MD5 was
traditionally the hash algorithm used in IETF protocols until SHA1
came along.  Are there examples of IETF protocols with SHA1 but
without MD5?

I think there should be a note saying we expect these things to come
along but not table entries for them.
