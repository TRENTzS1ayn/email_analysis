Well, other people think it very important to distinguish the security
model provided by, for example, public key versus keyed hash.  One
difference in these models is normally called non-repudiation and in
technical documents such as this, that refers to the fact that you
either need the private key or need to have broken the cryptography to
forge a signture.   Having small glossary at the end of the document
and defining the term is fine.  But if you want it replaced, I think
you should provide a single word substitute that people could agreee
on as a replacement.

Saying '"non-repudiation" is actually a marketing term!' doesn't
persuade me since marketers use and screw up essentially every word in
the language.
