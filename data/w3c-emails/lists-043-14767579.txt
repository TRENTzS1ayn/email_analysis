Based on further thought, I believe this was a reference to the
standard boilerplate that says the draft conforms to RFC 2026.  I was
confused because, while patents are certainly an important area of RFC
2026, the boilerplate you include at the start of a draft does not
mention the word patent and I've never heard it referred to before as
a "patent statement".

Participants in this working group are reminded that 'Working group
members must disclose intellectual properties "that are reasonably and
personally known" to be relevant to this WG in accordance with IETF
and W3C procedure; including notice and disclosure of such information
to the WG, and the IETF Executive Director.' (from the IETF XMLDSIG
charter).
