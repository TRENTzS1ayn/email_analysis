My worry is less about Alg than c14n.

No, I mean the immeadiate surrounding Signature

<Signature>
  <SigInfo/>
  <SignatureValue/>
  <Object/>
<Signature/>

The location in the SigInfo references the object in the Signature block.

Why do we even make that statement?  We should just update the RFC when and
if they come out.  I see no benifits in saying it will be coming, there are
a large number of things that I see as coming that are not listed.  How does
the fact they they are coming change this specification?
