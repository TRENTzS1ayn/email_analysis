I though the responses on expanding xNNy in the body of the draft
text was somewhat mixed and I'm not sure there were many comments
on expanding it in the formal XML...

Interesting.  I had assumed you wanted something more like

<SimpleProtocol>
<SignedStuff/>
<Possible unsigned stuff/>
<Signature>
<SigInfo/>
<SignatureValue/>
</Signature>
<Possible more unsigned stuff/>
</SimplePrototocol>

While I don't think there should be idle chatter about the future, it
is a matter of judgement how much motivational material there should
be.  Expecially if we drop MD5, saying we expect an AESH to come along
provides a concrete motivation for hash algorithm variability in the
protocol instead of just saying its always SHA1.  I know algorithm
independence is good in itself but some people would be more persuaded
by the anticipated emergence of new/better hashes in the forseeable
future.
