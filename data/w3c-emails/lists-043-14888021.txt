Richard,

In your syntax proposal [1] you describe a version of HMAC that differs
somewhat from RFC 2104 [2].  As I didn't understand the motivation for the
difference, when I filled in the HMAC algorithm section (7.3.1) in the
current draft [3] I just pointed to RFC 2104.

Could you could explain the motivation for the variant?

Thanks,

PS  I notice that the HMAC version from [1] is the version in IOTP.
