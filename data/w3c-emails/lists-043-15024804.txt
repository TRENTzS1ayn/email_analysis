One of the things we talked about Thursday was whether for embedded objects (an 
objectReference pointing to something carried in an object element) the digest 
was calculated over the <object> start and end tags.  There was discussion as 
to processing simplicity, binding of the ID value, ability to switch between 
embedded/detached, etc. and I agreed to report back.

What I'd like to propose is that the default behavior is to digest the entire 
object including start and end tags.  Since we have the exclusion mechanism 
(once its nailed down), if the application wants to ignore those tags (for 
example if the identification mechanism allows switching between embedded and 
detached), then it should specify an exclusion transformation which results in 
digesting only the content inside the object element.

If there are no objections, this is what I'll go with.
