I don't feel strongly about this, but...

I like the <Digest Algorithm="...">[digest value]</Digest> change, except
that I'd also like consistency with other elements (Canonicalization but
SignatureAlg?).  Also, how would we do algorithm parameters?  Look at the
HMAC example in the current draft [1].  The content of the SignatureAlg
element is the parameter.  We'd want a consistent mechanism for parameters
if a digest algorithm came along that required parameters.  I don't want to
mix the parameters with the value.

I like this for DigestAlg because the proposed combined Digest element
contains the digest value.  For the CanonicalizationAlg and particularly the
SignatureAlg elements I'd be less keen on the change.  I don't like the idea
of having an element called Signature that doesn't contain a signature.
Therefore I currently lean towards keeping all of them the same.

I think both changes are great ideas...
