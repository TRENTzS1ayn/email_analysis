Just to clarify, by "XSLT libraries" I really meant XSLT
processing software not a directory of XSLT stylesheets.
I guess there is double entendre in my wording
that needs to be removed.

Nevertheless, it may also very well be
that an application wants to specify the transformation <XSLT>
as one of the <Object>s being signed.  I don't think the
current syntax supports that construct yet.  In fact, this may
be an issue with a number of the <Transformation>
sub-elements.

Regarding dynamic access to libraries (whether they be
software or data), we have to allow for clients operating
in offline mode.  So as much as I like XSLT, I think we
have to keep the phrase about XSLT processing resources
not being readily available.

Just a thought on Ed's comment that "resources such as XSLT libraries may
not be readily available nor needed by XML Signature implmentations".

There's work going on in the area of registries and repositories (see
http://www.xml.org) that should enable on-line dynamic access to XSLT or
other resources. This should mean that the appropriate transformation
information should be available dynamically.

It should also mean that if an application chooses, the stylesheet could be
indpendently included as an "ObjectReference" to support checking that the
correct transformation was actually applied.

Thoughts?

David

Subject: First cut at what should say about requiring XSLT


With reference to yesterday's teleconference,
here's my cut at what the Transformation Algorithms section (7.6) should say
about requiring XSLT.

*************
It is recognized that in environments where there are significant
restraints, resources such as XSLT libraries
may not be readily available nor needed by XML Signature implmentations.

However, it is also true that XML Signatures will often be processed in
environments where access to
both XML-parsing and XSLT libraries are available.  Because XSLT is expected
to be commonly used
for deriving the data that is to be signed, implementations are STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED  to
support the <XSLT> transformation element where practical.  Note that
mplementations which do
support XSLT transformations are only REQUIRED to support the functionality
REQUIRED by the XSLT
Recommendation though they may support optional features as well.
