I don't have much disagreement with anything you say.  I've also heard
support for the idea the "non-repudiation" can be considered a
contractual item.  So, for some purposes, it can be obtained even with
shared secret key technology for a class of disputes by a party
contractually agreeing that they can not dispute the signature.

In any case, I think it is easiest for use to continue to use the term
and include a definition if we think it necessary for clarity.

Thanks,
Donald
