I think this is intended primarily for light weight protocol
applications.  Typically no Location would mean some part of the
current document while just a fragment means some particular element
of the current document.  In other words, no Location can be an
abbreviation for some XPath type filter that is fixed for that
application and type of message, such as signing the entire
message/document less the signature, while a fragment can only refer
to one element and is all of that element, so to speak.

If the Location is specified by id, you can move the stuff around
anywhere in the current document and still find it.  If the Location
is some clever application specific scheme, <foobar:great-stuff>,
maybe it can locate the data anywhere in that application's universe
via some directory system or something, whether it is in the current
document or not.
