Given this section is called "transformations" for good reason, I'm
concerned about the reliance upon "subset of data". How about something like:

The Transformations mechanism permits the signer to transform a source
document into a derived document. Two obvious purposes for this feature is
to canonicalize a document, or perform filtering and extraction such that
the application derives and signs only a subset of the source content.
Consequently, those portions of the source document that are not reflected
in the derived document can be arbitrarily modified and the signature will
still validate.

I think I prefer the following <smile>

Applications are recommended to ensure signers understand the actual
resulting content that is being signed after transformations are applied.
Users should not be tricked into signing a native content that is
transformed into something that the user would not have signed otherwise.
This recommendation applied to transformations specified in the signature
block, as well as transformations found within the document itself.
