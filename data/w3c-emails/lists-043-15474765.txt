I think I agree with this. In the HTML context that which comes after a URI
is merely a "view" on the whole document, and thinking that way in our
context can be dangerous; I like transformations. But I also understand
Don's point that we still need to refer to objects elsewhere in the
document. However, I think this can be satisfied by saying the location must
be a URI-clean or IDREF [1].

This seems like an abitrary restriction though, and if someone puts and XPtr
in their URI and also specify a XSLT, we need to define what happens, or say
that the signature engine will throw an error.
