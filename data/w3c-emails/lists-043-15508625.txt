Jim,

For security reasons, both (2) and (3) are bad ideas. It's not safe to
have substitutable digests that aren't protected.

To understand why this is a problem, consider the following
scenario. Imagine that DSA may be used with both SHA-1 and RIPEMD-160,
as you suggest. Now imagine that an attacker breaks RIPEMD-160 in such
a way that he can generate messages with arbitrary digests.

Now, imagine that you don't like RIPEMD-160 and sign all your messages
with SHA-1. Nevertheless, the attacker can generate a forged message
from you (signed with RIPEMD-160/DSA).

He takes a message M that you've signed (using SHA-1/DSA).  He
generates a new message M' such that RIPEMD-160(M')=SHA-1(M).

He can then reuse your signature on M as a signature on M' by
retagging it as a signature using RIPEMD-160/DSA.

Having the name of the digest be part of the data digested does NOT
protect against this attack. It merely becomes part of the message M'
that the attacker must generate.

This attack is why PKCS-1 signatures include the algorithm OID as part
of the data signed. It's not safe to remove them.  It is also why DSA
must only be used with one type of digest in any given
application. [0] In this case, SHA-1 is the obvious choice.

[0] Actually, this isn't strictly true. It must be used
with any given digest for a given keysize. It should be
safe to use a different digest if Q was set to (say)
256 bits.
