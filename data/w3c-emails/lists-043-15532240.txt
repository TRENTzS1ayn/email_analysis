Correct. We're discussing the situation where the digest algorithm has
been completely compromised, so the attacker can efficiently make
messages with arbitrary digests.

The formatting constraints you describe aren't really that difficult
to achieve. Consider any message of more than 160 words. Simply by
doubling (or not) any of the inter-word spaces, you can achieve 2^160
different variations of reasonable looking messages. With high
probability, one of these messages will match any given digest.

The only problem here is doing it efficiently. That's where the
assumption that the digest has been compromised comes in.

Consider the case where one of the digest algorithms is CRC to see
that this is possible with a sufficiently weak digest.

My reading of the CMS spec is that this is forbidden. 

   The DSA signature algorithm is defined in FIPS Pub 186 [DSS].  DSA is
   always used with the SHA-1 message digest algorithm.  The algorithm
   identifier for DSA is:

      id-dsa-with-sha1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { iso(1) member-body(2)
          us(840) x9-57 (10040) x9cm(4) 3 }

I admit that it's not 100% clear. However, it seems to me that
saying that DSA is always used with SHA-1 implies that it's not
legal to define DSA-with-FOO.

> The Signature algorithm is part of the data being hashed.
I'm aware of that. As I said in my previous message, that's
insufficient. This is why PKCS-1 puts it in the actual
signature, where it cannot be tampered with even if the
digest is completely compromised. Unfortunately, this is
not possible with DSA, which is why DSA must be used with
SHA-1 only.
