I think I agree with this. In the HTML context that which comes after a URI
is merely a "view" on the whole document, and thinking that way in our
context can be dangerous; I like transformations. But I also understand
Don's point that we still need to refer to objects elsewhere in the
document. However, I think this can be satisfied by saying the location must
be a URI-clean or IDREF [1].

<John>
I suppose the point I am making (which Don also made in a recent email) is
that semantically there is no semantic difference between putting the ID
fragment in a transformation versus putting it after the URI.  If you want
to refer to something in the same document, you could represent this using

<Location></Location>
<Transformations>
<Transformation Algorith="urn:dsig:xpointer">SomeID</Transformation>
</Transformations>

or with

<Type>text/xml</Type>
<Location>#SomeID</Location>

The latter is shorter, but it mucks up the data model.  The former is longer
but cleaner in so many ways.

This seems like an abitrary restriction though, and if someone puts and XPtr
in their URI and also specify a XSLT, we need to define what happens, or say
that the signature engine will throw an error.
