Hi Joseph,

John, the typical way of referring to "this document" is
        <a href="">this document</a>
This is why fragment IDs are interprated the way they are when no URI
precedes them. [1]

I believe people are speaking of what happens when you don't provide the
location element itself, then assume it is implicit to the context.

This must also be distinguished from what happens when you have a location
element but no attribute, did the DTD define a default attribute value?

<John>
Right, and this is what was sort of giving me headaches.  I guess I don't
mind if we make this rule saying that no Location means something different
from an empty Location, but this seemed a bit weird at the time.

In order to keep some grasp on all this optionality, I'd prefer we have
don't specify lots of optionality in the natural language nor that we rely
upon XML/DTD attribute definition defaults.

4.2. Same-document References

   A URI reference that does not contain a URI is a reference to the
   current document.  In other words, an empty URI reference within a
   document is interpreted as a reference to the start of that document,
   and a reference containing only a fragment identifier is a reference
   to the identified fragment of that document.  Traversal of such a
   reference should not result in an additional retrieval action.
   However, if the URI reference occurs in a context that is always
   intended to result in a new request, as in the case of HTML's FORM
   element, then an empty URI reference represents the base URI of the
   current document and should be replaced by that URI when transformed
   into a request.
