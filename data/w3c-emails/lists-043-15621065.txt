Microsoft Adds SOAP To Link Windows Apps

Microsoft's bumpy road to Web-enabling its Windows platform has
taken a new turn: An XML-based specification for distributed
applications.

Last month, the software giant began to promote the spec, known as
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), as a way to handle remote
procedure calls (RPC) across the Internet.

SOAP will replace Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model
(DCOM) architecture, and will be cooked into the heart of Windows
Distributed interNet Architecture (Windows DNA) 2000.

"DCOM is pretty much dead" for Internet applications, although it
is still viable on corporate intranets, said David Smith, vice
president and research director of Internet strategies at GartnerGroup.

Smith said SOAP represented Microsoft "finally getting its Web
strategy right," after false starts like ActiveX. Moreover, he said
SOAP is key to Microsoft's long-term vision of promoting a services
architecture for applications. And because it uses XML, it also
helps Microsoft take the high ground with a legitimately standards-based
alternative to Java.
