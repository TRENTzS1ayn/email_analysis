Donald,

Thanks for the clarification and the answer to the question. However
... terminology has always been a problem and most of the
misunderstanding is created by different people using the same term
for a different meaning. :-(

The definition I gave is not mine but copied and pasted from an ISO
document, i.e. an internationally agreed standard. So under this
circumstances, it is pretty important *not* to use that term, if you
think it would have a different meaning. So, please, so not use that
term.

Regards,

Denis
