FYI...

For our definition of DSA, we are currently referencing FIPS 186-1 (see
http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf).  In section 5, titled "DSA
SIGNATURE GENERATION" it defines a DSA signature thus:

    r = (g^k mod p) mod q
    s = (k^-1(SHA-1(M) + xr)) mod q

In other words, DSA is defined to use SHA-1.  Perhaps the same algorithm
could be used with other message digests (I do not know whether it is
cryptographically safe to do so), but technically speaking it would not be
DSA.  Since we're writing a standard we need to speak precisely.

I disagree. I read the statement of "DSA is always used with SHA"
as prohibiting this. Perhaps we could get Russ to weigh in on what
he intended.

I think this issue is orthogonal to the main point of my argument.
I'm not prepared to express an opinion on the cryptographic merits
of using other digests with DSA -- in the absence of the substitution
attack.

That's correct. However, as I've been saying, with RSA this does
not permit you to forge signatures for signers who never have
used the compromised algorithm.

I am saying precisely that ECDSA and DSA are not generic algorithms.

In any given protocol environment, it must be determined by
standardization which digest is to be used with DSA. That is to say,
that it would probably be fine to say that in (say) XML-DSIG, DSA must
always be used with RIPEMD-160. What is not acceptable is to ever
have any ambiguity about which digest is used.

I don't agree that this is catastrophic however. I don't consider
digest algorithm substitutability that important a property.

No, this doesn't help. The attacker is in complete control of the
message.
Remember, he's not using the original signer's message at all. He's
only using the original signer's _signature_.

All he has to have is some piece of mutable content in the message
that he wants the victim (the verifier) to accept. Whitespace was
an obvious example. Another obvious example is that many messages
contain arbitrary message-id strings. Since these are opaque,
it's trivial to use them to produce message variations. It should
be obvious that no canonicalization algorithm can eliminate all
such opportunities without also destroying data, except in very
limited problem domains. 

Jim, I'm having trouble understanding what point you're trying to
make. My reasoning is as follows:

1. DSA is vulnerable to the substitution attack I described.
2. RSA is not, at least as long as you use PKCS-1 padding.
3. (1) is a problem.
4. In order to fix (1), DSA must be mandated to work with
SHA-1 and RSA must be used with PKCS-1.

Which, if any of these statements do you disagree with?
Let's try to focus on them.
