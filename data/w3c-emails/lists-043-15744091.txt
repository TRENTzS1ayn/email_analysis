The FIPS cites ANSI X9.31, which is a subset of the ISO 9796-2
version of RSA.  Padding and hash algorithm ID are in the signature
block, but it's different from PKCS #1.  I believe there will be an
18 month grace period to convert from PKCS #1 to X9.31.  It
is also likely X9.31 will be reopened to add support for Bellare
and Rogaway's PSS scheme, which is a probabilistic scheme
that seems not to be vulnerable to the recent attacks by Naccache
et al on various fixed-format versions of RSA (9796-1 and so forth;
see Crypto 99 proceedings for details).

Regards,
Rich
