G. Algorithm Granularity
1.   Suites as one algorithm
        i.e., compound Algorithm names, like RSA-SHA1, can occur
2.   Orthogonal specification
        i.e., simple Algorithm names but Algorithms occur as
        Parameters to other Algorithms

NOTE: As long as we permit user defined algorithms, there is no
way to stop someone from using G.1 and as long as we allow
parameters, there is not way to stop someone from using G.2
although you can make G.2 a bit less convenient, depending on
your parameter syntax.  So the question is really just for the
algorithms we specify in the WG documents.

There are arguments on both sides.  This is a religious issue.
I have my own opinions but we will go with the WG consensus.
