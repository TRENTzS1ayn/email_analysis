Note, if the XML is anything other than UTF-8 or UTF-16, the encoding should
be present:

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-guessing

        Because each XML entity not in UTF-8 or UTF-16 format must begin
with an 
        XML encoding declaration, in which the first characters must be
'<?xml', any 
        conforming processor can detect, after two to four octets of input,
which of the 
        following cases apply.
