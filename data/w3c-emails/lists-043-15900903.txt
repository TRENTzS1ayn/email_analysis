Greg,

Its on hold pending pending a stable c14n algorithm to point to.  The candidate 
algorithms proposed to mandate (DOM-CANON, minimal, W3C) are all moving targets 
so it would be premature to pick one (and potentially delay closure on the 
spec).  I think it makes sense to revisit this once there's more progress in 
the c14n arena.  Personally, I also would prefer a mandatory to implement 
default to a fixed algorithm, just in case.

Dave
