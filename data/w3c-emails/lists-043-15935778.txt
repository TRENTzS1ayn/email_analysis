I've been banging my head against our syntax (with few good results) ... but
here are some simple questions that perhaps will prompt some others'
thoughts, I'll follow with another convention proposal. 


Simple Questions

  Elements
  
   Do people prefer Element Names as:
    1. <DigestAlgorithm>...</DigestAlgorithm>
       <DigestValue>...</DigestValue>
    2. <Digest>
          <Algorithm>
          <Value>
       </Digest>
       
   If people prefer #2, we can change SignatureValue to SignatureResult
   since it is a special case.
   
  Defaults
  
   There are three ways to express semantics, via explicit representation
   in the XML syntax, a default declaration in the DTD, or via the
   natural language in the specification. Do people prefer:
    1. Semantics should be communicated via explicit syntax whenever
       possible possible.
    2. Syntax should be as brief as possible.
       
   Properties:
     * Do we call things algorithm, name, or type?
