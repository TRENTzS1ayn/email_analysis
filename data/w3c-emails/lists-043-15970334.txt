At least at the moment, we still have two c14n algorithms, one for signedInfo 
and one for objects.  I agree with your statement as it applies to objects; but 
I'm not sure about it for SignedInfo.   In SignedInfo, the c14n alg is 
mandatory, so you'd need a NULL alg ID if you wanted to sign the data as 
transmitted.   I'd suggest leaving the alg ID there until we resolve the 
question about fixing the SignedInfo c14n alg.
