Sorry to be a bit late on this but I was working on getting a good
agenda of issues...  I plan to limit discussion on each are to try and
cover as much as we can during the call.  Comments on all issues may
be posted to the mailing list which is the ultimate source of
consensus.

Conference Call starts at noon eastern US time (EDT) 21 October.

The call in numbers are 1-888-398-7616 and 1-212-547-0372.
The password for all calls is 79949.

Agenda:
     Signature Syntax & Processing draft questions:
Status
Syntax of algorithms - < 10 minutes
  Parameter/Value elements?
  Handling signature result. 
Null Canonicalization - < 5 minutes
  Drop it?
Syntax for items eligible to be attributes - < 10 minutes
  IE, how do you decide if something is to be an element
      or an attribute?
Transformations - < 10 minutes
  One Tranform element or multiple
    Generic/Canonicalize/XSLT/etc. elements?
Type/charset - < 10 minutes
  unnecessary? option input? passed along?
KeyInfo - <10 minutes
  Who will do draft of next level of detail?
  Should recipient identification information not
      necessary to key agreement be provided for?
Object/Manifest/Package/Attributes. - < 10 minutes
  Are the later three always inside an Object?
  Should we define Attributes?
   If so should we define a signing time attribute?
Other open issues
  vocabulary: non-repudiation

Thanks,
Donald
