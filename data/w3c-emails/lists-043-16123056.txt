Hi Jim,

Seems like a good argument for a shorter namespace URI, like
"http://w3.org/sig-v1".  And I don't think different prefixes and
xmlns declarations are reasonable for the identical namespace.  But
this is just a matter of degree.

I have no problem with re-ordering fields to maximize data that would
be static for many applications at the front.  But it seems to me that
is already is, with canonicalization algorithm and signature algorithm
first.  Wouldn't Object Reference be more likely to change?

There are two of your remarks I don't understand.  One is about
contribution to the hash output.  Surely any good hash function should
have the characteristic that changing any bit of the input changes
about half the bits of the output.  It makes no different if it is the
first or last or a middle bit you change...every byte of input has an
equal effect on the output so it does not matter where a relatively
static area of data is. The second is that I don't see what the
reordering has to do with one pass processing.  If we want one pass
processing I would think it would be via a special element (I guess
I'm not supposed to the Processing Instruction) so I don't see how
SignedInfo element order would effect it.

Thanks,
Donald
