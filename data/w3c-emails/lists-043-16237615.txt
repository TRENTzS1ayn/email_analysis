Certainly when a name space occurs once or a few times, it's not worth
worrying about a few characters.  But the latest w3c-c14n draft I have
seen repeats the namespace for every attribute at an element even if
they all have the same namespace.  Thus, for a element with 20
attributes all in the same namespace, we get 20 different syntesized
prefixes and 20 copies of the namespace when one prefix and namespace
would do.

I guess if you are going to actually retrieve something from a
namespace URI for a W3C namespace, and you are using a typcial URL
then having the authority portion of the URL be "www.w3.org" is
reasonable.  But if it's just an identifier with nothing stored at it,
I don't see that the "www." adds anything.  It seems more logial for
the authority to be the W3C rather than the W3C's web site.  In any
case, it is not clear that the W3C should be the authority for a joint
IETF/W3C standard.

Right.

If your message digest function is worth much, the addition of lots of
redundant stuff should have no effect on the strength of the
signature.  Alll that matters is how much entropy is present.
Addition of a nonce might be good (although whether the nonce is at
the start or end or both of the data has only a minor effect).  But
the unnecessary repetition of namespaces as proposed in the current
w3c-c14n draft is merely inefficient, not security reducing.
