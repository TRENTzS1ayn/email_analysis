I spent some length of last week in the office of Sharon Adler,
co-chair of the XSL WG, discussing this.  It's certainly her opinion
that trying to use XPath or XPointer as currently defined as a filter
is meaningless.  XPointer is just intended to give you a pointer into
an XML document.  It doesn't yield XML.  XPath just gives you an
unordered node set.  It doesn't yield XML.  XSLT, on the other hand,
can give you XML, although even conformant XSLT processors are not
required to be able to output XML.  XSLT has provisions via the
"output" element for specifying the additional parameters you would
need to know to generate XML.  Of course, there is nothing stopping us
from defining dsigXPointer and/or dsigXPath which do yield XML.

Thanks,
Donald
