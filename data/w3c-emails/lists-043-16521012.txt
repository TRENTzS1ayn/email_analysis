Jim Clark has canonicalization code.  I know there is canonicalization
code in IBM that will work with any DOM and I believe that code will
be made open source.  I think there will be multiple interoperable
open implementations of XML canonicalization.

Nothing so complex is needed.  For example, it is entirely conformant
with the XML standards for any XML application to output, for
readability or other reasons, an attribute value with leading or
trailing white space, such Id=" foobar ". It is required for any XML
application that is conformant with the standards to read that as
Id="foobar".  Thus, unless appropriate steps are taken, the simple act
of printing XML by a conformant XML application and the reading of
that XML by a second XML standards conformant application can break
signatures.
