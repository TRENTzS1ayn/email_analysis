Well, Sharon Adler didn't look at the core syntax draft.  I'm
wondering if we should call it simply "XPath" if it yields a different
type from XPath...

While they don't say that and provide functions for retrieving data
from a node, they don't provide a function to produce XML.

I suspect they are also trying not to constrain implementations.

If there is a consensus that the additional material in 5.6.3 and
5.6.4 is adequate (perhaps equivalent to some specific XSLT
template(s) and specific XSLT output element), then I guess there
isn't an issue.  However, Sharon Adler's reaction may be typical of
the reaction of some others in the XML standards area.
