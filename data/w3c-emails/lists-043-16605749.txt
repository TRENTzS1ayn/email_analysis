Even Steve Kent can probably be made to agree that nobody knows of 
a system in which X.509 certificates are parsed into components and 
signatures stored separately and then rebuilt.

Most of the real world certificate applications in the world
generate DER encoding but accept BER encoding. In fact the number
of faulty DER encodings is such that if applications were to
depend on DER encodings they would break.

I fail to discern any meaning in the above paragraph.

For the generator the only constraint imposed by the proposed syntax
constraint is that it would have to sign and deliver canonical form.

'print time'? 'proprietary'? I fail to see any connection to the
proposal.

When someone starts a post "I have been re-thinking this issue", that
implies to me that they want to re-open it. 

However since you then proceeded to make exactly the same argument
that you did the first time round it was not exactly 're-thinking'. 

If the issue is indeed 'contentious' then it looks a little odd if
the Working group chair starts staking out such a committed 
interpretation of it. I take it then that we are agreed that there
is not a consensus?

Don, don't try to patronize me. I was using XML before it had a name.
