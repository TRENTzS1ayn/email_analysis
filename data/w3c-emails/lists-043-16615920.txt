Thanks Don,
I have been looking at James Clark's canonicalization code (which is in C).
Regarding IBM's XML Canonicalization code, could you
1.  Find out which programming language it is in (I'm hoping for Java)
2.  Confirm whether or not it will be made public on
AlphaWorks (www.alphaworks.ibm.com).  I don't need the source
to be public, just the API and library (or JAR).  Of course, having
the source too would be great.
3.  If it will be made public, about when will that be.

Ed
