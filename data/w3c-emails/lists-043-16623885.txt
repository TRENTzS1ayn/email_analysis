What people are objecting to is the unnecessary canonicalization
code you are requiring the verifier of the signature to write.
Not all verifiers will include a DOM parser. A large number
of verifiers will not even have access to the schema.

I can understand that signing implementations will not need to do
XML parsing because they just have to write XML, not read it.
However, it seems to me a verifier would want at least a basic
XML parser to properly process an XML Signature.
Phillip, could you elaborate a little more how
you see an XML-parser-less verifier extracting the information it needs
from an XML signature in order to verify that signature?
eg. Would it use pattern matching rather than full-blown
XML parsing?

Thanks, Ed
