I had a meeting with TimBL and others yesterday to get clarity on a couple
of W3C policies and requirements over specifications, one of which was
namespace policy. This tends to be a rather heated/religious issue, but at
least I have something that I and others reference -- or even take issue
with. <smile> You'll note one of the characteristics of this policy in the
W3C context is the W3C's commitment to maintaining our URIs, which I think
is a good thing.

Regardless, the namespace policy requires
"http://www.w3.org/1999/$something" and I expect I can get approval for a
namespace shorter than the one I originally proposed along the lines of 

        http://www.w3.org/1999/10/sig

or even

        http://www.w3.org/1999/sig

if we don't expect to issue different versions that need to co-exist and
have normative changes in their meaning within the space of a year. One
could even mix a version number in there, but I'm hesitant to propose that.

This discussion also has some ramifications on the URNs that we are
presently using, which I will address in the next message.

 As a result of some internal discussions, TimBL has written down
 some of the policy that has been emerging in his mind. You are
 hereby notified of the policy in:
 
 URIs for W3C namespaces

 Feel free to cite it in public forums, and feel free to discuss,
 e.g. the philosophical aspects of URIs and persistence in the
 uri@w3.org forum, which is archived at:
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/
 
 (hmm... the RDF IG is possibly another relevant forum, due
 to the digital library and other metadata issues.)
