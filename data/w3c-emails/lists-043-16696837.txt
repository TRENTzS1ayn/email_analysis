The IETF process only prohibits normative references to non normative
IETF RFCs. It does not prohibit reference to normative W3C standards.

The URN group was denied normative reference standing for good reasons
unlikely to be resolved to the satisfaction of the IESG this millenia
(14 months).


Names arrive at their meaning through usage. The problem with the URN
working group was that they pretty much ensured that their proposal would
never achieve any usage. Lack of hierarchy never did much good for
gopher URLs as I recall. I remain mystified at by the advantages of
making the URN syntax incompatible with the URL syntax.

If names are used for a purpose then they have meaning and it is
inaccurate to describe them as 'bogus'.

I note that Microsoft is already coding strings such as
URN:schema-microsoft-com: into IE5.0.


Whatever naming scheme anyone comes up with, there will be nothing
to stop someone assigning an incompatible semantics to a name. The
persistence of names is not a technical issue, it is a political
and governmental issue.

[Chances are that somewhere in the universe another planet has
chosen or will chose an 8bit character set. Given this estimate
the probability that our URN encoding will turn out to be unique,
I doubt that the improbability is of cryptological proportions.]


It seems to me that the IESG is pretty much inviting W3C to take
the URN registration policy off their hands. If the URN legacy is too
wedged we could always define a new class of URI, call it a URS
(Uniform Resource Semiote), provide a means for any party to issue their
own URS's using the IANA issued DNS infrastructure as registration
keys.

Then W3C can issue the needed character strings. If W3C can't manage
such a process there is a pretty good chance nobody else will either.
