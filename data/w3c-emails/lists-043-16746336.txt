As a joint IETF/W3C working group, you can do so by just subscribing
to the mailing list.  Send mail to w3c-ietf-xmldsig-request@w3.org
with "subscribe" in the subject line.  The working group decision
process is the IETF mailing list consensus process.  You can also
ask Joseph Reagle to list you on the participants web page.

In our current vocabulary, I think you mean an Object the includes the
actual data being signed.

The way to get the effect of what you have above under the current
draft is to have the SignedInfo ObjectReference point to an Object
containing a Manifest and put this second level pointer inside the
Manifest.  In either case, the core behaviour will check the signature
on the "Reference" or Manifest but it would be up to the application
whether it checks the digest in the Manifest or uses any Location
provided in the "Reference".

Alternatively, you really can't check the signature without getting
your hands on the data somehow.  If you put some sort of URL in the
SignedInfo ObjectReference Location, like
http://example.ixos.de/cgi/document-finder?special-document-serial-number
then presumably the core signature verfier would do a call-out to
fetch the data from this URL and your cgi could get the data from
where ever it is.  If there is no way to reliably get the real data
you are trying to secure, there is not way to secure it.
