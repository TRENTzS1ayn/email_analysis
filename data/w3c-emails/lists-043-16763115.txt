To:"IETF/W3C XML-DSig WG"<w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>

The following is a "harvest" of terms taken from this group's documents and
list traffic.  Each of the terms has been used somewhere.   I have rough
definitions for about 80% of the terms.  I tried to pick out terms that had
been used a lot and/or where there had been some confusion or debate over
what a term meant.

I would appreciate any guidance from the list on:

1. Who is the intended audience?  If the audience is this group or even
regulars in the W3C and IETF, then some of the terms may be elementary and a
lot could be easily deleted.  If the audience is wider (for instance, I am
thinking specifically of the Legal XML group with which I am working), then
many of the terms may be new and unobvious.

2. What would you like to see added or deleted?  (Or simply a general
statement that the list is way too long, too long, or OK.)

3. If you know of any stable (or even competing) definitions for these terms
that could be borrowed and cited, I would appreciate pointers to such
resources.
