A Very Good day to you

I am Mrs Mariam Abacha. I got your contact from a
close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your
country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest
for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or
company. 

He however gave me the assurance that you can
be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude.
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in
1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present
civilian administration, I have been subjected to
physical and psychological torture by the security
agents in the country. 

As a widow that is so  traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody
within the country. 

You must have heard over the media
reports and the internet on the recovery of various
huge sums of money deposited by my husband in
different security firms abroad, some companies
willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our
money confidently lodged there or many outright
blackmail. 

In fact the total sum discovered by the
Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million
dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor
for life. I will give you more information as to this
regard as soon as you reply. 

I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security
network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot
afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided
to contact you and I hope you will not betray my
confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$72
million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name
is withheld for now until we open communication.
 
I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into
your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is
known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal
directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I
am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon
as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again if only you wish, but if it is
possible, just help me in diverting this funds into
your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this
fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this
transaction.

And should you accept my terms, kindly
send me an email signifying your interest to my email
box as this is only safe for me now so that we can
commence communication immediately. And upon receipt
of your message of interest, I shall give you a more
detailed picture of things. 

In case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security as I am
giving you this information in total trust and
confidence.NO RISK IS INVOLVED AS IAM STILL IN CONTROL
OF MY HUSBANDS AFFAIRS. I will greatly appreciate if
you accept my proposal in good faith. Please expedite
action. 

Prefer all further correspondence be sent via
(mary77abacha@go.com)
 sincerely yours 

Hajia Mariam Abacha.
