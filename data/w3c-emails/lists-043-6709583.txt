Hello,

After visiting your website this morning, I thought you might like to know about a secure way you can receive completed loan applications online - directly to your email address.  If not, please excuse my mailing as I will not contact you again.  This product has become an invaluable tool for many of our customers, ranging from mortgage companies to auto-dealers... simply put: it's an quick, easy, and secure way for anyone who would like to receive the results from any type of online form directly to their email. 

I'm sure you can imagine the potential of being able to accept loan applications over the Internet.  Most of our clients say that almost 80% of every loan application they process origionates from the web.  If you decide to proceed by November 1st, you will qualify for our introductory pricing, which includes the complete package (1. A custom designed loan application [$149.95] and 2. Monthly hosting on our secure servers [$99.95/month]).  Or if you prefer, you can elect a per-application surcharge rather than paying the $149.95 up front.  We can work out a deal for any budget.  What's the catch?  There isn't one!  We are a down to earth, professional company devoted to providing quality ecommerce products and services to our customers!

If you'd like to discuss this further, or would like more details, feel free to reply to this email, as I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.  Also, I apologize if this email has reached you in error, and I won't be mailing you again unless you should request more information. 

Thanks again for your time,

Chris
