Note that the XML people have identified a significant amount of overlap
between C14N (Canonicalization) and the Infoset working group. If people are
interested in the C14N issues, I suggest they look at the most recent
Infoset Draft. [1] I hope the Syntax WG will have a first public WD prior to
the IETF meeting -- but I'm not convinced we will.

 4. Canonicalization
 
 NOTE: James Tauber *does* have time to put into this, but wants a
       co-editor
 ACTION: Chairs to recruit co-editor
 
 Issue: possible overlap with Infoset
 CONSENSUS: There is a real co-ordination issue here
 CONSENSUS: Portions of XML documents considered "Required" should be
            identical to that included in the canonical form.
 ACTION: T.Bray to send message to Megginson, cc the CG, noting this.
 CONSENSUS: In section 3, use infoset terminology & be consistent
 ACTION: T.Bray, to XML-i-fy the spec
 CONSENSUS: Express the material in section 4 in algorithms
