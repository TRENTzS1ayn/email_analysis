Ok. It's nice in that the schema definition language (SDL/DTD) is implicitly
included in the hash. However, this feature is now required on every single
signature. One could argue that there may be some applications that don't
care about the SDL that much (not worth the cost, or off-line), and if they
did, they should include it in the manifest.

I don't believe it meets #2 does it? If the URI transformation is part of
the C14N, then on re-processing the C14Nizer will not be able to find the
resource and produce the same hash.
