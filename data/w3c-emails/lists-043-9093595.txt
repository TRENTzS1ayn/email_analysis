That's how I first read it and thought, "that doesn't abide by the 'fixed
point property.' " But I thought, why bother? So I reread the following
"expanded"

to read fetch the resource for security; which still didn't abide by the
fixed point property.

A hash of a hash will still be a different hash regardless if the first was
generated from the URI string or it's resource.

So:
1. Why bother with a hash of the URI string? Why not use the URI?
2. Is it worth losing "fixed point" because of it?
