URI's are not valid XML, in general. They can have multiple internal colons that
have nothing to do with the XML meaning of colon, etc.

I believe it does have the fix point property.  The URI still is present in the
output.  It is just that the prefix string is replaced by its hash.  If you
re-cannonicalize, you hash the same URI and get the same prefix.  Ditto for the
default namespace.

That's how I first read it and thought, "that doesn't abide by the 'fixed
point property.' " But I thought, why bother? So I reread the following
"expanded"

to read fetch the resource for security; which still didn't abide by the
fixed point property.

A hash of a hash will still be a different hash regardless if the first was
generated from the URI string or it's resource.

So:
1. Why bother with a hash of the URI string? Why not use the URI?
2. Is it worth losing "fixed point" because of it?
