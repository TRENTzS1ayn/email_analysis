Hi Todd,

I agree with the need for this.  In the so-called Brown-IETF draft, please
see section 5.8, which discusses a package element that can be used to
include arbitrary data using either no encoding (except CDATA and/or
escaping) as well as base64.  Section 5.4 shows how a package can be fitted
into a dsig:Document, which can also contain one or more dsig:Signature
elements.

Furthermore, the ability of the manifest to indicate elements within the XML
root element or its subelements (including the dsig:Document element) means
that an application can choose to base-64 encode any arbitrary blob of data
and have it signed.

>>        [Brown]
>>     5. The specification will not specify methods of serialization or
>>        canonicalization. XML content is normalized by specifying and
>>        appropriate content C14N algorithm [[34]DOMHASH, [35]C14N];
>>        applications are expected to normalize application specific
