Hi Joseph,

The reason I asked this was that if 3.a.2 is in fact referring to resources
locators in the manifest, then isn't requirement 3.a.2 redundant
(specifically a subset of requirement 3.a.3)?

Thanks,

        Could you please say more about what you mean there? Are you
referring to the resource locators in the manifest, or something more broad?

    <<<<

    The manifest: you reference the things you are pointing at using the URI
convention. I guess it's a restatement of sorts of Tim's URI Axiom 0a. [1]
We could say something even stronger about the method, like we will use
xlink or whatever. Also, in terms of the principles, I probably will add
something about we prefer decentralized systems over centralized registries.
(Other people are free to oppose it and suggest a counter proposal.)


    [1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html
    Axiom 0a: Universality 2
    Any resource of significance should be given a URI. This means that no
information which has any significance and persistence should be made
available in a way that one cannot refer to it with a URI.
