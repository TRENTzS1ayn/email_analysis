We should also note the DRI payments group too and Todd Vincent's XML Court

> > 1. Introduction
> >
> >    The XML 1.0 Recommendation [[33]XML] describes the syntax of a class
> >    of data objects called XML documents. The mission of this working
> >    group is to develop an XML compliant syntax used for representing
> >    signatures on Web resources and portions of protocol messages
> >    (anything referencable by a URI) and procedures for computing and
> >    verifying such signatures. Such signatures will be able to provide
> >    data integrity, authentication, and/or non-repudiatability
> >
> > 2. Design Principles and Scope
> >
> >     1. The specification for XML-DSig shall describe how to digitally
> >        sign an XML document. [Charter]
> >     2. The meaning of the signature is very simple:  The XML signature
> >        syntax associates the cryptographic signature value with Web
> >        resources using XML markup. The meaning of the signature may be
> >        extensible by a set of semantics specified separately. [Charter]
> >     3. An XML-Signature can apply to parts of XML documents. [Charter]
> >        The solution shall enable authentication of part or totality of
an
> >        XML document.   [Brown]
> >     4. More than one signature may exist over any resource. [Charter]
The
> >        solution shall provide for extended signature functionality such
> >        as co-signature, endorsement, plurality of recipients, etc.
> >        [Brown]
> >     5. The specification will not specify methods of serialization or
> >        canonicalization. XML content is normalized by specifying and
> >        appropriate content C14N algorithm [[34]DOMHASH, [35]C14N];
> >        applications are expected to normalize application specific
> >        semantics prior to handing data to a XML-DSig application.
> >        [Charter]
> >
> > 3. Requirements
> >
> > Signature Data Model and Syntax
> >
> >     1. XML-Signature will use the RDF data model [RDF] but need not use
> >        the RDF serialization syntax. [Charter]
> >     2. XML-Signature referants are URIs.  [Reagle]
> >     3. Whenever possible, any resource or algorithm identifier is a URI.
> >        [Reagle]
> >     4. The solution shall enable authentication of internal and external
> >        resources by use of the Manifest. [Brown]
> >
> > Format
> >
> >     1. An XML-Signature is XML. [Charter]
> >     2. The solution shall provide a mechanism that eases the production
> >        of composite documents that consist of the combination by
addition
> >        or deletion of authenticated blocks of information, while
> >        preserving verifiability of the origin and authenticity of these
> >        blocks of information. [Brown]
> >
> > Cryptography
> >
> >     1. The solution shall provide indifferently for digital signature
and
> >        message authentication codes, considering symmetric and
asymmetric
> >        authentication schemes as well as dynamic negotiation of keying
> >        material. [Brown]
> >
> > Processing
> >
> >     1. In the event of redundant attributes within the XML Signature
> >        syntax and relevant cryptographic blobs, XML Signature
> >        applications prefer the XML Signature semantics. [Reagle]
