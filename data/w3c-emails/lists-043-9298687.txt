My intent was not to point out related activities, but to point out other
specific requirements documents as examples of good/interesting RDs: the
scope, how they do it, etc. It now reads:

However, recalling identified activities is a good idea, and I added a
section, taken from the charter with Todd's proposal of XML-Legal as the TBD:

Coordination

1. The XML Signature specification should meet the requirements of the
following applications:
Internet Open Trading Protocol v2.0 [Charter]
2. Legal XML [List]
3. Financial Services Mark Up Language v2.0 [Charter]

The XML Signature specification must be reviewed by the following
communities:

1. XML Syntax WG  [Charter]
2. XML Linking WG  [Charter]
3. XML Schema WG  [Charter]
4. Metadata CG  [Charter]
