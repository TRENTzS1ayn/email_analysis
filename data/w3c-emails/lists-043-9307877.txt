Right. It does derive from the fact that one is referring to a resource by
way of a URI (as does sigs of sigs, multiple sigs, etc.) but I am now much
clearer. I also added Richard Hime's ealier requirement about being able to
sign the original document encoding. [1]

It means that we should have some representation of our data model, be it a
directed label graph, set of 3-tuples, RDF syntax, or what-not. I'm not
advocating the RDFsyntax, just a data model, such that one will be able to
do cool queries across things like signatures on signatures.

XML-Signature(s) is the normative name, I've tweaked that document to
reflect that.
