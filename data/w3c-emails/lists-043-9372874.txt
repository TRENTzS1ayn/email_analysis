I would like to know the reasoning for prohibiting 
criticality flags.

The semantics "if you do not understand X then you
do not understand this signature" appears to me to be
essential.

For example X might be 'check that this document has
not subsequently been revoked and superceeded using 
a (specified) OCSP type mechanism'.

This type of semantics is essential if signed documents
are to be used to represent signed negotiable documents
such as a letter of credit of a bill of lading.
