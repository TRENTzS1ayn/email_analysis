And what when a single document must be signed more than once?

Most E-Commerce protocols will involve signatories and 
counter-signatories up the wazoo. 


Also from the implementation standpoint, attibutes directly
attached to signatures are easier to deal with. The signing
hardware (if used) is unlikely to see (or want to see) the 
entire document. Even so a signing token may well want to 
insert disclaimers such as 'not valid for more than $10,000'.
