Phill,

My objection to the criticality flag is both philosophical and
practical.  On the philosophical front, if the information is part of
the document, such as terms and conditions of a contract, it should be
part of the signed thing rather than an external attribute (see my reply
to Barb).  Also, beyond the basic mathematics, I will continue to argue
that the decision to "accept" a signed thing is based on the rules of
the relying party, not the signer (although quite possibly dictated by
external agreement); hence the assertion of criticality by the signer is
misplaced.

On the practical front, the experience with criticality in X.509 has
been a nightmare.  Problems range from interoperability (I can't include
an extension/attribute with a critical flag unless I'm sure all RP
software will handle it); ambiguous semantics (does the meaning of the
attribute change based on criticality); migration/deployment problems;
whether all attribute/extension processing is done at the same time;
etc.

This was, as I recall, part of the rationale for removing criticality
from the CMS attribute fields.
