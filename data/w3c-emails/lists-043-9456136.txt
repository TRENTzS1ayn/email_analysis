It should a matter of the XML body to explicit the intention. The body of
the document represents the assertion. The signature attests its
authenticity.

If substitution of intent is possible then the assertion is malformed. One
should not use a signature attribute to explicit an assertion. The assertion
should be unambiguous in the first place.

Notice, however, that an assertion is not intrinsically explicit (at least
from an XML standpoint). What renders an assertion really explicit are the
definitions, rules, and regulations adopted by the business/application
framework that defined the syntax of the assertion in the first place.
Binding (i.e. namespaces) is primordial in giving an unambiguous meaning to
a piece of XML.
