I've recently been asked to participate in this signed XML effort, so please excuse me if I'm not up on all the history.  

Most of my questions have been addressed very nicely, but a few remain.  You may have already considered these, but I've gotta ask.

  1. If person A signs a portion of a document and it is 
     altered and signed by B, will you be able to later 
     know what A signed?  

  2. Are there plans to incorporate timestamps stronger 
     than a simple ASCII date/time?  (3rd party notaries)
     
  3. Does this activity plan to address the encryption of 
     selected XML content?  Should it?  Or should there
     be an explicit statement that confidentiality is not 
     being addressed?
