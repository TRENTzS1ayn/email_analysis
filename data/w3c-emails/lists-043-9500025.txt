The notary should produce and authenticate an affidavit document that refers
unambiguously to the document being notarized and explicit his assertion "I
Notary Public nnnn assert that the content of the document referred by xxx
was known in date of yyyy" or "I Notary Public nnn assert that the content
of the document referred by xx has been proven genuine in regard to records
rrrr presented to me by yyyy in date of zzzz" or ...

Signature endorsement carries no intrinsic meaning besides attesting of a
signature chronology. Attributes can give a meaning to an endorsement but
this could be done more efficiently by making use of specific assertions
(turned into XML document or element).

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
