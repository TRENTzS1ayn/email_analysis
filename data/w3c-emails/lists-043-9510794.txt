Joseph et al,

Continuing my earlier post...

  4. Are there plans to support signatures lesser than "digital"?  

     Some jurisdictions give legal standing to, and differentiate
     between, digital signatures and electronic signatures.  A 
     digital signature is typically cryptographically strong while 
     an electronic signature may be nothing more than a digitized 
     graphic of a handwritten signature.  No interesting 
     cryptography may be involved and the burden of proof may be 
     on the relying party, but electronic signatures have legal
     standing.  Will there be a way to programmatically recognize
     electronic signatures?  

Larry
