I agree the thread has digressed a little, but I think the question (and
Richard has done a good job of describing this) is whether there is a
need to associate some additional information with the signature (vs.
the content).  I would expect it to be an XML structure (I wasn't
alluding to any special use of attribute other than as a generic
property or type/value pair).  I'm not sure I'm clear on what you meant
by the last sentence on trust relationships.

Agreed, its just a cautionary reminder when we get to actually defining
the syntax.

As in a separate note, my goal is to not introduce unintended
crytographic incompatibility as a result of finding the right algorithm
spec.  I'm not as concerned about the syntax for indicating "what he
said"

This relates back to possible implementation architectures.  In some
cases, where the signature processing function is distinct from the
content processing, it can be helpful to provide clues on what to do
with the content.  Its probably not strictly necessary.

Another cautionary note.  In designing signature solutions in the past,
lots of time has been spent getting agreement (and then writing clear
language) on how to calculate the hash input to the signature.  If the
signature is calculated over a variety of elements, how you do hash of
hashes, what tags are or are not included, etc., require more
specificity than was in earlier drafts.  

In addition, we may need to deal with the canonicalization question
separately for the manifest (or whatever its called) vs. the documents
to which the manifest points.  In particular, it may be useful to pick a
single c14n solution for calculating the hash over the manifest.

Modulo the attribute discussion, I agree.
