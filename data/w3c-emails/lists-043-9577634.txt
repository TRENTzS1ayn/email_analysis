Dave,

I think that we need to support detached signatures as the default. Wrapped
is fine, but the discussion has been trending dangerously close to
recreating CMS in XML. Attributes have a long history as semantic carriers
in that world, so I would like to see us set the design goal of using XML to
make qualified statements about XML blobs. My vote: Attributes = just say
NO. 

I also didn't see any discussion (flames?) on my comment about criticality
flags. I believe that WEBDAV has already made that call (ignore) for XML, so
I think criticality flags should be another NO in our design. 

Finally, I think we're also spending way too much time on semantics where
the short-term focus should be just getting the syntax right.

Barb,

Why do you think that wrapped vs. detached signatures impacts the need
(or lack thereof) of associating attributes with the signature (vs. the
content)? It seems to me that the argument should be the same.  For what
its worth, I think we need to handle both.
