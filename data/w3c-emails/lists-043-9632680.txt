If their alteration causes a change in the byte value of the canonical XML,
they will invalidate A's signature. There are two options, they retain A's
content/signature and modify/sign a variant copy, and pass both on. Or they
keep A's copy, and represent the diffs using something like XSL. For
instance, if you created a document and signed it, and I wanted to tweak it
or annotate it, perhaps I could do this using a chunk of XSL or XML/XPtr
annotations which I can then sign. I'm hoping some of the application
developers in the group would have more thoughts on this.

We specify no requirements on any of this presently, though I'm open to
suggestions.

My opinion is that sophisticated time stamps are trust-decision semantics
that should be layered atop the signature validity work. I'll try to reflect
this in the RD.

Good thing to state regardless, not sure how everyone feels. Presently, we
are not addressing confidentiality though Brown asserts it is easily
achievable with the elements in his proposal.
