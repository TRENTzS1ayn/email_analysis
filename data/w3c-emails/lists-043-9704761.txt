Yes. It is necessary if we want the context independence of canonical
forms.

Yes, your interpretation is right.  Alghough it may be a little more
efficient if we use the default namespace for the one that is used most
frequently in the element (in terms of total of element name and attribute
names), giving the default to the element name seems to me streightforward
and reasonable.

The rank <x> should be unambiguously determined by, for example, the
acending order of the UTF-8 encoded namespace (ordering based on attribute
names does not work because of possible ties).

Does it mean that every element shall explicitly declare its namespace as
well as the namespaces of its attributes (if different)?

I suppose that, in such circumstances, an element will be always bound to
the default namespace declared on the element and, therefore, will never
contain a namespace prefix. In addition, the element will define the
namespaces ns<x> for each of its attribute that is bound to a namespace
other than the element's namespace. Probably, the rank x for each namespace
prefix will be allocated on a first reference basis after ordering of the
attributes.

Am I correct?

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
