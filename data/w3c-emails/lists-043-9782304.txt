> When you sign something you may or may not care about white space (extra spaces, CR/LF, etc.).  For example, you might not care about white space if it is a paragraphs of simple text and your assertion is that those words are yours.  Line breaks are unimportant giving the renderer choices.  So, signing words and their breaks is all that is necessary.
