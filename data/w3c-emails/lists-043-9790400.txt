Joseph et al,

To programmatically process a "digital" signature, I'd need to have the signature and information that would allow me to verify it (cert, CA, algorithm, public key, etc.).  Cool.  But if I programmatically encounter an "electronic" signature, I at least need to know that fact.  ...that it is a signature and not something else.  

Verification may be difficult, the burden of proof rests with the relying party, and all that, but I would need to know that the blob I'm dealing with is indeed a signature.  The type of electronic signature could start another interesting discussion, but for now I'd settle for the fact that it is an electronic signature of some type.

Do you think the wording in sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3B sufficiently captures that notion?  I'm not sure.

tx,

Larry
