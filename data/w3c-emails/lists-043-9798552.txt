But if I programmatically encounter an "electronic" signature, I at least need to know that fact.  ...that it is a signature and not something else.

The type of electronic signature could start another interesting discussion, but for now I'd settle for the fact that it is an electronic signature of some type.

And given that an electronic signature is still a signature, it should enjoy all the rights and benefits of other signatures.  ...albeit it is not cryptographically strong and verification is difficult.
