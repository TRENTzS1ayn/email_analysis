Joseph,
I reviewed your post on the Syntax WG
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-syntax-wg/1999Jun/0075.html).

 I think you got my point wrong.
The current WD does provide context independence of canonical forms.
This is an important property if we want to allow signing a part (a
subelement)
of an XML document.
The current WD seems to allow canonicalization of a whole document only.
Am I wrong?

Hiroshi

Thank you Hiroshi. I will report this back to the Syntax WG.
