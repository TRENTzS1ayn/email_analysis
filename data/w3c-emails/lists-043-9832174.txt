Aargh, sorry! I read your post as an application of Clark's method instead
of a hybrid. I didn't note that you capitalized "EACH" in the text below.

The Syntax WG is not likely going to be able to reflect this prior to its
first public WD. Once it is published (so the whole xmldsig group can see
it) I recommend sending a new comment to the specification's-comment address
(and any other comments) for discussion. (Or if people want to continue it
here/now: fine.) Since I'm obviously not very good at porting subtly's from
private communications between two working groups, I'd recommend discussion
on this topic happen on both lists, or if the Syntax WG Chairs oppose, at
least keep the dsig list in the cc.

I don't think so. Though it would help if I knew what change to the Tag
Processing Algorithm of section 6.1 were required.
