Hi all,

Not to beat it to death, but I just thought an electronic signature should have a proper place in an XML file.  ...as a "signature" as opposed to "just another piece of data".  Then a program could handle this type of signature properly because it has an accepted identity as a signature.  

Perhaps the flag that sez what algorithm to use would indicate "not verifiable" as opposed to "RSA" or "DSS".  (and likely the data type will need some attention too.)

It seems I overstated my point about "all rights and benefits".  I meant something more like "all rights and benefits of an electronic signature."  I apologize.

That said, I trust you to come up with the right answer.  Because I'm new to XML and the W3C, I will defer to your judgment.

Thanks for listening,

Larry

PS:  And yes, I agree at some point we ought to define terms.
