Hi Don,

It works now for me too.  Perhaps it was too busy at the time.  I phoned
their customer support to look into it.  In the end though, if this happens
to anyone again, it appears that an operator will eventually pick up and
transfer a person directly if necessary.

I just punched in 79949 and it worked fine for me.  If you get an operator,
I'm listed as the contact for the call.  They should be able to find it
under my name or under the call in number and time even if you have the
wrong passcode...

Sorry,
Donald

Hrmm, not that I am aware of. Did you try getting a telecon operator?
