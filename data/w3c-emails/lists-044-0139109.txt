Hi Jim, thaks for paying careful attention to the notes!

I proposed it (a HREF) as way of trying to to come up with some conventions
for syntax usage [1]. Also, it is a more typical way of using links,
particularly in the XLink context. Don proposed that we then move all URIs
into attributes [2]. There wasn't much disagreemnt to this convention on the
list or calls. Today's call was to confirm what we wanted to do with it:

[Agenda]
  Leave an attribute but change name to HREF?
  Make an element with an HREF attribute?
  Make an element with URI content?

So my note-takers comment of "leave as is" was biased in that it was from
the perspective of my proposal, but you are right, from the perspective of
anyone else, this is a change. I've tweaked the notes to show this. (And of
course, if you oppose the change now is certainly a good time to say so.)
