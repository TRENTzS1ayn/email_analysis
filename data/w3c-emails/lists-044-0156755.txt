What do you mean "There it was still:"

As I recall, it was an element (which I liked), it got changed to an
attribute (which I didn't like), I recommended that it stay an element and
put the URL as an HREF for the Location element, I heard nothing, and it is
still an attribute according to the Oct 22 draft on our website.

Are you looking at a newer draft and if so, can I have one?

Thanks,
