I can understand this concern and if I sympathized with it, I would
recommend we not permit "" instead of trying to redefine something defined
by the URI spec. (Even not permitting it is a sort of abuse.) However, this
problem is not unique to us, a URI is an identifier for a resource,
sometimes the content of a URI changes. (Your issue applies regardless if
its a "Same-document reference" [2] or URI reference). The URI Location=""
is still a completely non-ambigous URI: "Axiom2: It doesn't matter to whom
or where you specify that URI, it will have the same meaning."

[1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html
[2] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt (section 4.2)

If you use Location="" followed by some transforms that John has described
that only "selects" those things you care about, people add other
signatures, your Location="" still will mean the same thing. Again, this is
the same if the location points to a fully specified URI reference.

We've stated that the ommission of <Location HREF=""> means it is known by
the application context. I assume we would to capture this same semantic if
we end up with it as an attribute of ObjectReference.

<ObjectReference Location="5">
...
<Object ID="5">

I count 18 characters needed for this reference using this syntax (where
location is an attribute, not its own element.)

I'm very hesitant of this approach, sound like we are trying to build our
own URI or XLink or some such thing.
