Woops, yes you are correct, it actually appears as 
    <ObjectReference Location="http://www.ietf.org"> 
in [1].

The reasons for the change still hold from my earlier email (trying to be
syntactically consistent), it just got reflected in the draft earlier.
However, one could ask shouldn't DigestMethod also be an attribute, and I
can't find a compelling reason why it shouldn't be... Unfortunately, I'm a
little lost as to where we are on some of these threads, but I (personally)
think of the semantics as follows. (I always ask myself what assertions are
being made.)

The (object) pointed to by ObjectReference has a location of
http://www.ietf.org
The (object) pointed to by ObjectReference has a DigestValue (object)
        DigestValue (object) has an algorithm of urn:nist-gov:sha1
        DigestValue (object) has an encoding of Base64
        DigestValue (object) has a literal value of a23bcd43

(See [2] for my take on what our current data model is.)

This could directly translate to the following syntax -- among others,
depending on your conventions.

    <ObjectReference Location="http://www.ietf.org"> 
      <DigestValue Algorithm="urn:nist-gov:sha1" 
                Encoding="urn:ietf-org:base64">a23bcd43</DigestValue> 
    </ObjectReference>
