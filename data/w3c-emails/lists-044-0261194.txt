A question ...
 
What would be the best way to handle the situation where someone wanted to
sign **exactly the same** data, but using different certificates and/or
signature algorithms? It seems to me that the "Objects" and the
"ObjectReferences" would be identical and in the current specification would
have to be duplicated.
 
Thoughts

You are precisely correct -- the second person must duplicate the signedinfo
block and create their own signature.  If the second person wanted to also
sign in the first signature (a very common case) they would add a new
ObjectReference to their own signature block.
