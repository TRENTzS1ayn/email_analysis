Regardless of how mobile the data is, the verifying application has to
be able to get its hands on it to verify its siganture.  If the
verifying application just magically knows, that's fine and you can
omit Location altogether.  But if the verifying application needs some
hint/name/whatever to find that data, you put that in Location.  There
are lots of ways you can encode this into a URI.  Of course,
signatures that use a URI for Location are not very interoperable, but
that's fine if that is what some application requires.  If someone is
writing an XML DSIG library, I don't think its reasonable to expect
them to include the ability to actually do gopher: or http: or any
other scheme (with the possible exception of the "data:" scheme) so
URIs will require a call out back to the application making the whole
thing application and possibly network connectivity dependent anyway.

Indirecting the Location through a Manifest identified by an IDREF
means that the core signature doesn't encounter whatever sort of
Location you put in the Manifest but it's still the case that either
the application just knew where the data was, in which case you don't
need any Location at all, or it needs a hint, in which case the hint
can actually just about as well be in SignedInfo as in a Manifest.

<Enter Humor Mode> I have any idea how to solve that.  Have type
dependent Transforms and allow run time type detection (a la fragment)
and pass the Content-Type along the Transforms pipeline... <Exit Humor
Mode>

What we are headed for if you keep going this way is that basicly for
this type of signature, the core behaviour of verifying the digest(s)
in SignedInfo is wrong.  Of course, there are other XML digitial
signatures, particularly simple protocol messages, where verifying the
digest(s) is exactly the right thing.  If the digest isn't checked,
then it is real easy to point to a Manifest whose contents is totally
shufflable as to Location and Transforms.  As it is now, you can get
that effect by having SignedInfo point to a Manifest which points to a
Manifest.  The second level manifest will be totaly changeable with
any checking or enforcement completel application dependent.

You want to sign DigestMethod and DigestValue.

Seems easiest for right now and doesn't complicate things for the
simple protocol case.
