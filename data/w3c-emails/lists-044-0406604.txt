Result was elimination of Encoding attribute in DigestValue and
SignatureValue, statement to be added to spec that encoding is base64
for all digest and signature algorithms defined in the spec and up to
the algorithm writing for other digest and signature algorithms.

That was because Fragment IDs require dispatching on the MIME type as
determined at run time, something a few people thought was valuable
but most thought was unnecessarily complex.  It also tends to lead to
a facility for the Transform pipeline too pass this type along.

Actually, on the second item, the call the previous week wanted the
spec to prohibit such recipient identificaiton information from being
in KeyInfo and say it should be elsewhere if needed.

Wouldn't this be

<Object
Type="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/signature-core/signatureproperties">
    <Properties>
        <Property Target="ID of Signature"
                  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/signature-core/time">
            <Date>...</Date>
            <Time>...</Time>
            ...
        </Property>
    </Properties>
</Object>

or the like?

Actually what happened was that Dave suggested that we needed to
re-introduce the explicit Null canonicalization due to the controversy
over canonicalization of SignedInfo.  I suggested that it wasn't
necessary becasue we could change CanonicalzaitonMethod back to having
a "?" after it and declare its absence to mean null canonicalization.
This makes it more parallel with Transforms.  There was general
agreement with this among those on the call.
