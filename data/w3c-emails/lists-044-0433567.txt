I would prefer seeing that a full buffer was generated -- 512-bits or
64bytes of material.  This is based on the inner workings of SHA1 (it
operates internally on 512 bits of material at a time).  This number is
based on the memories of discussions that were held during the creation of
RFC 2631 where we put padding in during the hash computation from the
Diffie-Hellman key agree to the Key-Encryption-Key result.
