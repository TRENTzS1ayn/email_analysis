Hi Mark,

Yes I see how that could be ambiguous.

In the previous email, you said you agree with Sharon Adler, who Don quoted
as saying that using XPath/XPointer for digital signature was meaningless.
That was what I disagreed with in saying that of course we have always
expected a barename xpointer to yield text that we could send to a digest.

For some time, many have asked 'Can't we just have
Location="someURL#someFragment" to indicate what must be signed?' The
implication is that people just want to identify an element by ID and sign
the text of the indicated element.  This is identical to my expectation of a
barename XPointer.  Getting the full text of the element is, to me,
equivalent to doing a pointer dereference.

Honestly, I don't think the XPath/XPointer people saw it as needing to be
specified.  They were only trying to identify a set of nodes appearing in
the parse tree.  If someone wants to subsequently write those out, that is
such a well-known operation that there was no need spelling out for us that
we could write it out.  Nor was there a need for them to restrict people
from using the nodes in a different order than they appear in the original
document.  This allows XSLT to decide that a different order is appropriate
(as defined by the transform), but that doesn't mean the rest of us should
be locked into an 'unordered' land.

As to whether our spec uses natural language or an XSLT to say "apply the
XPath and generate the result in document order" is, to me, a trivial point.
However, to say it in XSLT requires that XSLT can generate results which are
not well-formed XML since the result of an XPath or XPointer can be a region
of a document that has no root element.  Actually, my own preference is that
the tags of all ancestors of a document region be included in any message so
you can recover the namespaces and the charset encodings, but I understand
that others have a different preference, so we need to account for that.

Hi John,

I'm unclear as to what you are disagreeing with.  I talked about three
options:

1)  Just define an XSLT transform [my preference]

2)  Define an XPath transform, but define it such that you can trivially
convert it to an XSLT transform [not as good as 1), but I could be
convinced]

3)  Define an XPath transform in some other fashion [I really don't like
this option]

To clarify 2), I mean that you can pull the XPath out of the XPath transform
and plug it into a fixed boilerplate XSLT transform and achieve the same
effect.  Said boilerplate to be given in the spec.

Now, the difference between 2) and 3) may well be just a matter of how we
word the specification.  That's ok.

Now to motivate option 1).

The argument for having a transform that is "just" XPath is that it will be
much simpler to implement XPath than to implement XSLT.  But I don't expect
anybody to be implementing XPath or XSLT just for digital signatures.  I
expect in the (vast?) majority of cases people will be using a third-party
XSL library, even just for XPath, since (I get the impression) XSL is in
large part the motivation for XPath.  Most implementations of XPointer will
be part of an XSL implementation.

I admit that much of the preceding paragraph is merely my personal
impressions; I would like to hear what other people think.  I think that
many of the people who object to extra "weight" in the spec won't be using
XPath or XSLT, and so for this issue the "weight" argument carries less,
umm, weight.

The argument against having an XPath transform has been well represented.
XPath doesn't yield an octet-stream.  Now, we could define a conversion
mechanism but I fear we'll be unnecessarily opening a big can of worms.
Even if we are able to accurately and unambiguously define such a beast,
implementing the algorithm becomes a "small" part of implementing XML
digital signatures.  I fear that even if we get the algorithm right, people
who implement digital signatures won't.  I know, you insist that it is
simple and straightforward, but I remain uneasy.  With XSLT people can just
grab an implementation.

So, I am arguing for 1), but I would be much more easily convinced for an
XPath transform if we could do 2) instead of 3).  Implementors that have
XSLT available can just trivially make the XPath transform into an XSLT
transform instead of implementing another algorithm.

Hi Mark,

The reason I don't agree is because it is at odds with the vociferously
defended point about needing XPointer to do precisely what is suggested
in
5.6.3 and 5.6.4. In order to perform the simple ID fragment concept,
the
result of a Location plus a barename XPointer needs to be a text message
that can be sent to a digest algorithm.

In general, the advantage to XPath and XPointer transformations is that
they
allow a certain amount of sophistication without needing to incorporate
full
blown XSLT. XPath is quite sufficient for filtering a document to
precisely
omit unwanted pieces without needing to change what is kept. For
example,
XPath is the smallest sufficient standard that could completely cover
the
needs of XFDL, yet even XPath is more than needed in a number of ways.

Thus, XPath, XPointer, and XSLT were "RECOMMENDED".

I agree with Sharon.  I am very uncomfortable with the idea of defining
our
own XPath-to-octet-stream algorithm.  I would much rather we just use
straight XSLT.

If we are going to specify our own XPath-to-octet-stream algorithm, I
would
be least uncomfortable if we defined it in terms of XSLT.  In other
words,
our algorithm is the one the produces the same results as plugging the
specified XPath into a given, constant chunk of XSLT.  It's been a long
while since I looked at XSLT but I'm assuming this is feasible.  Besides
adding clarity, this allows people who have XSLT available to trivially
perform the XPath-to-octet-stream algorithm.

But as I said, I'd prefer we just use XSLT directly.

PS  I also agree with Don in that I think many other people will have
Sharon's reaction.  I think the intuitiveness of the XSLT approach is a
significant advantage.

Well, Sharon Adler didn't look at the core syntax draft.  I'm
wondering if we should call it simply "XPath" if it yields a different
type from XPath...

While they don't say that and provide functions for retrieving data
from a node, they don't provide a function to produce XML.

I suspect they are also trying not to constrain implementations.

If there is a consensus that the additional material in 5.6.3 and
5.6.4 is adequate (perhaps equivalent to some specific XSLT
template(s) and specific XSLT output element), then I guess there
isn't an issue.  However, Sharon Adler's reaction may be typical of
the reaction of some others in the XML standards area.
