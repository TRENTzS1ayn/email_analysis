     Is there agreement that  the equivalent of PKCS-7 or CMS authenticated
attributes go into SignatureProperties?  I do think that the equivalents of
CMS authenticated attributes are very valuable in signing applications.  In
particular, in something like a notary service, the most natural form for
an "attestation" by a witness is a CMS authenticated attribute.  An example
of what I mean would be something like the following:
A)   An American notary (no extra legal powers) checks the photographic ID
of the customer who wants a signature notarized.
B)   Today, the notary adds the details of the ID to a large bound book
which is kept under lock and key.
C)   In CMS or PKCS-7, the natural thing to do would be to add an
authenticated attribute for "checked driver's license" or "checked
passport" to the base of the notary's signature, with a value containing,
among other things, "common name", "issuing jurisdiction", "serial number",
and "validity period".  Losing this capability in XML signing would not,
IMHO, be a good thing.

     The notary's signature would be applied to the base document, to the
customer's signature, to the signing time, and to the attestations
together.
