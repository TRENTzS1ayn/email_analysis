As you may be aware, code to do XML digital signature in accordance
with the Richard Brown draft is available for downloading from the IBM
AlphaWorks site.

There is also IBM code to do XML canonicalization corresponding to a
recent version of the W3C Working Draft on the topic.  I believe this
code is likely to be released soon and the digital signature code
likely to be updated to correspond to the core of the working group
draft and released in the not to distant future.

Thanks,
Donald
