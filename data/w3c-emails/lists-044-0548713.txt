A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the XML Digital Signatures Working Group of the IETF.

Title: XML-Signature Core Syntax and Processing
Author(s): D. Eastlake, J. Reagle,  D. Solo
Filename: draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-01.txt
Pages: 27
Date: 28-Oct-99

This document specifies the syntax and processing rules for the
encoding of digital signatures using XML. Such signatures can provide
integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication
services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that
includes the signature or locatable elsewhere.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-01.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in

or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-01.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
