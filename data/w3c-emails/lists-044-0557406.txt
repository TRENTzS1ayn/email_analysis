Yes, and I added the comment is the reason that we've done this in object
(where people can include whatever semantics they want) is that the element
Properties is a particular type of object (that we defined) for semantics
about the signature itself. We might be able to do something snazzy with
schema such that Properties is a type of object, or we might define it such
that there is only one property in an object, if you want multiple
properties, you should have multiple objects.
