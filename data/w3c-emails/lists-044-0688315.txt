Re 19991022

<!ELEMENT Signature (SignedInfo, SignatureValue, KeyInfo?, Object*)>
<!ATTLIST    SignedInfo 
                   Id     ID       #IMPLIED> 

Should be 
<!ATTLIST Signature ...

 Also, at the end of para 3.3.3, one of the manifest types is SignedInfo, but we
don't have type Signature.  Seems to me:

signature of <SignedInfo> = co-signature (perhaps better handled with a
<Manifest>)
signature of <Signature> = counter signature

Thanks,
Rich
