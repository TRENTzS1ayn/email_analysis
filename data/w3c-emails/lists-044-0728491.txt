Aren't we causing the problem that is "not ours to solve" by freezing these
values that will likely change?  I suspect that moving stuff out of the digest
calculation isn't too much of a headache, but I admit that it would change the
structure.  We could also exclude (/include) these values using attributes or
another transform.  Another possibility is to specify these values (location and
transforms) at the same level we specify other attributes (e.g. date-time
signed) and optionally include them as objects.

I think this would be appropriate in some contexts where we need the detailed
audit trail of location changes, and it would be a nice option.  It may be a bad
example, but (an example I just e-mailed, sorry for the dup) suppose I manage a
site with signed RDF statements about the documents on my site and I "dumbly"
used URLs to refer to them.  Gigacorp buys my company and changes the domain to
www.gigacorp.com.  I'd prefer to just correct the references than to add
thousands of RDF statements correcting each reference.  Also, in my court filing
example where I am moving a document (base 64 PDF) from a delivery envelope to a
native PDF, I don't want the clutter (the standard needs to be less intrusive
IMO.)

Thanks,
