We didn't freeze them, they are frozen by definition: if someone uses a URL,
that is an assertion that 

        A: the content dereferenced at URL and transformed yields the 
        following DigestValue.

How do you make an assertion sans location semantics, such that:

        B: some object when found and transformed yields the 
        following DigestValue  ?

I think this is a valid question. We have a requirement to identify objects
via URIs. The URI need not be a URL. (In fact, I think the DigestValue is a
good URI). We could relax that requirement and remove "Location" from the
signature and only provide it as a resolution hint; or we permit a level of
indirection pre/post signature creation. Pre: ObjectReference uses some
mechanism such as a directory, URN, manifest etc. that provides resolution.
Post: you allow a "redirect" or "cache" statement to be associated with the
signature that states "the URI found in ObjectReference resolves to X"

If the fact that those statements were found at www.gigacorp.com was not
part of the semantics you wanted to be bound by (and I agree with Phillip
that some people do want to assert this) I'd recommend using an IDREF as the
URI of the resource that is digested, and the IDREF points to an object in
the signature which includes "hints" for finding and resolving content.
