Is it possible to have a attribute declaration be of one or more types? (In
an outdated section) the spec forbids:

        Constraint on Schemas: Attribute Locally Unique 
        The same full name must not appear more than once in any 
        archetypeSpec's attribute declaration set. 


http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#section-Types,-Elements-and-Attributes-*

but is there some other way to achieve:

        <attribute name='Location' type='uri' type='idref'>
