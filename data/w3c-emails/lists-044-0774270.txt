Peter,

I don't think we should assume that there is one or a few signers of a set of
documents under a URL domain, nor that the signers are readily available for
re-signing.  Also, URLs change frequently on the web.  I suspect that once we
have proliferation of XML signatures, the problem will be at least as common.

Thanks,
Rich
