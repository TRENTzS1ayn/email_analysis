I believe that we seem to get into a "authenticated" versus
"nonauthenticated attributes" kind of discussion. Some in this WG wanted to
avoid having that feature (and I never got to understand why, besides that
it came from lessons learned elsewhere). Being able to chose where to put
things is a way to solve that even if we don't call it that way, but does
this make a difference?
