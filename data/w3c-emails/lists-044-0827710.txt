Thanks, Joseph.  Are you going to propose one of these indirection options?  For
example, could we formalize this idea by including an optional <Resolve> tag? 
If we need this capability, I hope the spec has sufficient guidelines so that
the implementations will be consistent.

Thanks,
Rich

Richard, thanks for your emails on this topic, I think it is driving us to
clarify a number of issues here. Thoughts follow ...

I discuss how to do it in [1] though I don't provide a syntactical proposal
(also see [2]). When I wrote [1] back in July, I even considered dropping
locations from the manifest (I'm glad this conversation finally took off!) 

However, with respect to our present design I like the requirement that you
have a URI NOT a URL. If you must, just include a random number! Now I'm not
"going charter" on you <smile> but I will say that the fact the requirements
document says that manifests includes URIs and that there is no requirement
that we provide for location invariant signatures (though Solo introduced
this as a design principle in his draft) informs my present views on what we
do. I'm of a mixed mind about dropping it, but since you can sort of achieve
that with some random number as a URN, I believe you can do what you want to
do using URIs and/or other XML (cache) applications but I presently do not
feel delivering a solution to that problem is on our critical path. (I
suspect that a lot of thought needs to be given to the protocol semantics
involved, for instance, when validating SignedInfo, if the signature
application enounters a 301 [3], is that considered non-valid?!)

Here is a "pre" indirection:

<Signature xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/signature-core"> 
  <SignedInfo> 
    <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/.../xml-c14n"/> 
    <SignatureMethod Algorithm="dsig:dsaWithSHA-1"/> 
    <ObjectReference Location="98"> 
      <DigestMethod Algorithm="urn:nist-gov:sha1"/> 
      <DigestValue encoding="urn:ietf-org:base64">a23bcd43</DigestValue> 
    </ObjectReference> 
  </SignedInfo> 
  <SignatureValue encoding="urn:ietf-org:base64">dd2323dd</SignatureValue> 
  <Object Id="98">
        <Resolve URN="urn:ietf:rfc959" server="http://urns.org">
          <Hint URL="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt"/>
          <Hint
URL="http://info.broker.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc959.txt"/>
        </Resolve>
   </Object>
</Signature> 

Here is a post indirection:

<Signature xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/10/signature-core"> 
  <SignedInfo> 
    <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/.../xml-c14n"/> 
    <SignatureMethod Algorithm="dsig:dsaWithSHA-1"/> 
    <ObjectReference Location="http://mysite.com"> 
      <DigestMethod Algorithm="urn:nist-gov:sha1"/> 
      <DigestValue encoding="urn:ietf-org:base64">a23bcd43</DigestValue> 
    </ObjectReference> 
  </SignedInfo> 
</Signature>

<trustedcache xmlns="urn:operating-system">
  <Identity>
        <ObjectReference Location="http://mysite.com">
                <Tranform>Y</Transform>
        </ObjectReference>
        <ObjectReference Location="file:/cache/aB3452xd">
                <Tranform>X</Transform>
                <Tranform>Y</Transform>
        </ObjectReference>
  </Identity>
</trustedcache>

Don't use a URL if you don't want to. At the FTF we've agreed to change
"Location" to "Target" at least, and maybe even distinguish and use "URI" or
"IDREF" as appropriate so as to stop confusing people as to whether it is a
URL or URI.
