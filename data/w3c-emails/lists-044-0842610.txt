Hi:

Based on the ensuing discussions at the 46th IETF meeting I
tried to reflect on this problem. 

There are at least two schools of thought.

1. Since the signature includes the objectreference, changing
   the URL for the reference should render the signature invalid.
   In an example quoted, the signature may probably
   be applicable based on the contents of the URL (for
   example some terms of agreement).

2. URLs can and will change and the way to override signature
   becoming invalid is to escape the objectreference from
   being included in the signature.
   
Why not effectively sign for the document and the contents
of the object reference, not the object reference itself?
This should address some of the issues of 1 & 2. i.e. 
changing the URL is fine as long as the contents don't
change ...

Does this seem reasonable?

Thanks!

Rags

Peter,

I don't think we should assume that there is one or a few signers of a 
set of
documents under a URL domain, nor that the signers are readily available 
for
re-signing.  Also, URLs change frequently on the web.  I suspect that 
once we
have proliferation of XML signatures, the problem will be at least as 
common.

Thanks,
Rich
