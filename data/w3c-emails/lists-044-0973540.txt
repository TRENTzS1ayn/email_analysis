That xml.com reference cites things that DTDs don't allow you to do, that I
(at least) would like to do. That includes validating XML namespaces and
using  mixed/open content models. We (xmldsig) will certainly be mixing
schemas (embedded signatures and the like).

Over time people will begin to use schemas. I'm not telling you have to do
anything. I am saying TimBL is encouraging WGs to use schemas and to press
on each other specifications.

xmldsig.

Of course not, people are advancing schemas such that you can have valid XML
applications that use XML facilities (like namespaces.)

Todd, frankly I think you've gone off the handle. DTDs were advanced by the
typesetting community (not theoretical SGML wonks) to ensure people did not
submit documents that were broken and result in dumped jobs. XML simplifies
a lot of the SGML (80% functionality/ 20% complexity) and adds a few new
features like namespaces. It turns out that in order to support some of
those XML features your DTDs become extremely complex and still not very
expressive. That is why folks are working on XML Schemas.

Of course, all I've asked is that people have a look at what we've done, and
we can discuss it.

If you use schemas the idea is -- of course -- to get away from DTDs. I'd
like to post a draft of what the spec likes when using schemas, if the WG
doesn't like it, we can use DTD declarations.
