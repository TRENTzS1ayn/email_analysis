So what you're saying, which is what I understood from before, is that if we
sort based on the character domain, then the result should be the same
regardless of encoding.

Martin, do you agree?

I was referring to ordering on characters, not bytes.  It should be obvious
that bytewise sorting on a two-byte and a variable-byte encoding will be
different.
