The XML Schema WG thanks the XML Sig WG for the opportuity to review this
WD.

The Schema WG believes that there are no major issues with the dsig last
call WD [1].  However, the draft schema specification(s) has undergone
considerable change since the 1999-12-17 draft [3] on which the schema
fragments in Section 4 "Core Signature Syntax" are based.  The Schema WG
therefore requests that the XML Sig WG rewrite all schema(s) used in
defining dsig in terms of the schema specification current when schemas
reaches CR.

Additionally, there are several cases in which more judicious use could be
made of Schema Datatypes.  For instance, Section 4.2 "The SignatureValue
Element" contains the actual signature octet sequence, base64 encoded--it is
declared as a string, it should be a binary with the encoding facet equal to
base64;  Section 4.5 "The Object Element" has a MimeType attribute, declared
as a string that could be declared as a subtype of string, with a pattern
facet that matched all legal mime type variations.

The Schema WG also suggests that the XML Sig WG consider using a mechanism
similar to that proposed in [4] for assigning schema datatypes to
element/attribute declarations in the dsig DTD.

Lastly, the dsig WD should make clear whether the schema and DTD included in
Section 9 are normative or informative.

Paul V. Biron, on behalf of the XML Schema WG
