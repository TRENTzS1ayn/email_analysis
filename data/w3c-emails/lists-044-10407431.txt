> The Schema WG believes that there are no major issues with the dsig last
> call WD [1].  However, the draft schema specification(s) has undergone
> considerable change since the 1999-12-17 draft [3] on which the schema
> fragments in Section 4 "Core Signature Syntax" are based.  The Schema WG
> therefore requests that the XML Sig WG rewrite all schema(s) used in
> defining dsig in terms of the schema specification current when schemas
> reaches CR.
> 
> Additionally, there are several cases in which more judicious use could be
> made of Schema Datatypes.  For instance, Section 4.2 "The SignatureValue
> Element" contains the actual signature octet sequence, base64 encoded--it
> is declared as a string, it should be a binary with the encoding facet
> equal to base64;  Section 4.5 "The Object Element" has a MimeType
> attribute, declared as a string that could be declared as a subtype of
> string, with a pattern facet that matched all legal mime type variations.
> 
> The Schema WG also suggests that the XML Sig WG consider using a mechanism
> similar to that proposed in [4] for assigning schema datatypes to
> element/attribute declarations in the dsig DTD.
> 
> Lastly, the dsig WD should make clear whether the schema and DTD included
> in Section 9 are normative or informative.
