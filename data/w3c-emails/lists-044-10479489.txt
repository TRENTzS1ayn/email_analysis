Thanks John, looking good (I look forward to others' comments), brief
comments following:

I think we should move  this identifier to our own namspace since we
specify something above and beyond.

We don't mention exception handling elsewhere in the spec (which is more
protocol orientated), we should probably add some explanatory text about
this (perhaps including a definition for 'unverifiable'.)

Do we need to recommend that Canonical XML transform be used before
the Xpath? (Or do we assume the processors use Canonical XML (or some
other  method (e.g., DOM)) consistently to accomplish this?)
