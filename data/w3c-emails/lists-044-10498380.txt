The result of applying the list of transforms are the characters which
the digest generation should be performed on. Therefore at least the
DigestValue of the Reference currently worked on is not known at this time.
So you have to omit this DigestValue element.

I agree that there is no need to omit all the Reference's DigestValue field
as the example suggests. But maybe this gets clearer as the underlying
XML instance is added to the example.

I agree, eliminating KeyInfo in the example is confusing. There is no urgent
reason for that. The signer should be able to decide that.
