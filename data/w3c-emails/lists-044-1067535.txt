As explainted below, I believe it really does add a lot of complexity
and complexity is the enemy of security.

The SignedInfo step also secures the SignatureMethod and
CaononicalziationMethod (or lack thereof) as well as easily
accomodating multiple secured items, including KeyInfo if desired.
Once you acknowledge any need to sign even one bit of information
beyond the message indicated by ObjectReference, you are not just
signing that message.

Who claimed it was?  I thought the change was suggested because the
value of Location might not be a location in the URL sense.

As I see it, it does matter.  In particular, if a Transform of
SignedInfo is allowed, a cracker can insert such a Transform and
change the DigestValue and the data being secured so that the new
DigestValue is correct, using the strong DigestMethod, for the data
the cracker wants.  Then all they have to do is be sure that the
Transform not only drops itself and the new DigestValue but inserts
the old DigestValue, thus guaranteeing that the genuine old
SignatureValue still checks.  The KeyInfo is unchanged as are the
strong SignatureMethod and DigestMethod so even strict vetting of all
that by the verifier is no help.  It's all done with a smoke and
mirrors Transforms.  Thus, if this is allowed, you have no security
without a very complex check of the Transforms of SignedInfo.  I have
no confidence that there are not many other, even more subtle ways an
inserted Transforms could fake out a verifier.  (The next thing that
occurs to me is that the cracker could modify the data and then add or
modify the ObjectReference Transform to restore the data to its
original state before digesting and add a SignedInfo level Transforms
which removes itself and removes or changes back the ObjectReference
level Trasnforms. Then all of KeyInfo, SignatureMethod,
SignatureValue, DigestMethod, and DigestValue are untouched and the
signature verifies but the cracker can make arbitrary changes in the
data.)  Sure, the complexity involved in vetting the SignedInfo
Transforms is probably less than that required for a good general
theorem prover, but I'm not sure how much less.

The more I think about it the more I am personally convinced that the
consensus at the WG meeting against a Transforms of SignedInfo was
correct and rational.

I'll agree that it is not inherently insecure but I think it adds
unacceptable complexity as described above.

I look at it this way, the verifier has to get its hands on the actual
data to verify the DigestValue.  If this data is local to the XML that
contains the Signature, then there would not normally be any problem.
You use an IDREF.  If the data is not local, then already you are
outside the core signature library and dependent on application
behaviour.  If the data is not local, you are either de-referncing a
URL or using some URN/hint to find the stuff.  It's really implausible
to me to think that the core signature library can even do ftp: or
http: let alone gopher: or madeupscheme:.

As long as the value of Location is not an IDREF, its entirely up to
the surrounding application what data it feeds to the signature core
either as part of the initial parameters to the signature core or as a
result of a call out from the signature core when it encounters the
non-IDREF (depends how the libaray is organized (might want to do call
outs to avoid de-referncing later URLs if an earlier digest
fails...)).  Either way, the application can feed whatever it wants
(and has to if Location is absent) to the signature core regadless of
whether or not it has any relationship to Location.

Given this, I don't quite see what the big deal is with fixing (ie,
signing) Location.  And it kind of seems that (1) the possibility of
omitting Location, (2) the fact that the application can interpret
non-IDREF Locations however they want in getting the data, (3) the
availability of multi-level Manifests, and (4) the availability of
location independent URIs, will, all together, satisfy many of these
requirements.

If more is needed, I'd prefer to see it be possible for Location and
Transforms to appear optionally either inside or outside SignedInfo,
with an ID/IDREF link when they are outside, than to see an "omit="
attribute or the like.  Because I think it will be simpler than always
having to use a custom canonicalization that is sensitive to this
"omit='true'" attribute...
