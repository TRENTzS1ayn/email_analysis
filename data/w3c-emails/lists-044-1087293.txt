I agree (mostly) with Don - working towards having both a DTD and Schema based 
specification in the document is desirable.  In addition, having also struggled 
with the expressive limitations of the DTD syntax, a schema based spec seems 
like the right long term target.  However, since the schema syntax is still 
evolving, I think the normative version still has to be the DTD (for now).
