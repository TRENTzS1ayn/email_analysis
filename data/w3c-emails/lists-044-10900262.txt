Strings are series of characters, not of bytes.  The encoding is not relevant.

I'm still not understanding why the digest can't be based on a canonical
serialization of whatever result comes from the XPath expression.  Every
XML implementation must support UTF-8, so it's not any kind of overhead to
require it here.  There are issues beyond encoding, like attribute
ordering, that have to be mandated in serialization, so the win of having
the serialize() function seems negligible.
