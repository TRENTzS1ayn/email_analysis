Sorry Peter, but that's not an accurate paraphrase.  It is quite important
to be able to exclude certain elements, but that one requires a great deal
of precision in identifying what must be excluded to ensure that you are
excluding what you meant to exclude.

Exclusion by id excludes an element based on the value of a single
attribute, and this is not enough in most cases to accurately identify the
information to be excluded, and to restrict one's exclusion to only that
information.

Said in a generic way like you did just now, this is plain wrong.

You said - Simplified - it is bad to exclude X because it is not included.

Then - don't exclude it.

And if you need to control X - like you do in your application - put it into
your application logic and don't lay the burden on a generic signature
system.
