<Peter>
  A question here: Why can't we simply exclude the entire Signature element?
  That's what Gregor and I have been discussing today. I would strongly
prefer
  that! I'd like to know if anything spoke against it.....

I will try to phrase more accurately than Peter ;-):

If an enveloped signature is to be constructed, then there obviously the
following problem occurs: One has to take care that (at least) tholse parts
of the Signature element are omitted which are not available at the time of
computing the reference's digest, which are the SignatureValue and the
DigestValue of the reference currently worked on.

The main point of my discussion with Peter yesterday was: What important
case
could be out there in the world that one cannot simply omit the Signature
element as a whole in such a case of an enveloped signature?

If there exist important data entities inside the Signature element that
should also be signed, why not simply add another references directly to
that items?

Neither Peter nor I are argueing against the XPath transform in general, but
I
feel that the spec should be kept as simple as possible if we don't buy
severe restrictions with such simplicity. And in my opinion omitting the
whole
Signature element does not lead to any restrictions.
