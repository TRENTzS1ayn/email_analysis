Hi Tom,

The proposal is only to exclude Signature elements that are ancestor to the
DigestValue element whose content is being calculated.  This does not impact
one's ability to sign someone else's signature.

However, I'm sure this has been asked and answered negatively in the past.

     Is the proposal here that all elements within a <Signature> should be
excluded unless they are the objects of a Reference?  If so, how would a
subsequent signer include the KeyInfo or SignatureValue from an enveloped
signature unless the original signer had attached an ID to them?
