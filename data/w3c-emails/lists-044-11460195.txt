Hello Joseph,

I agree with the conclusion you draw below:

>Consequently, while we RECOMMEND all documents operated upon and generated
>by signature applications be in [NFC] (otherwise intermediate processors
>might unintentionally break the signature) encoding normalizations SHOULD
>NOT be done as part of a signature transform.

Regards,    Martni.
