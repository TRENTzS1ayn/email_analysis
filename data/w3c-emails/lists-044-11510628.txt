Hello John,

Many thanks for having a look at this. Please note that
we had quite some discussions with James Clark on this
(W3C member only) in the thread around
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-wg/1999Sep/0262.html.

Given the pushback we have received at that point on a
xml:lang-specific solution to the problem, and the fact
that as you say in most cases where XPath or XSLT is used
in the context of signatures, it's not that much of a problem,
I would suggest to add a note about the problem (see e.g.
the note just before
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#section-Creating-Processing-Instructions)

Regards,  Martin.
