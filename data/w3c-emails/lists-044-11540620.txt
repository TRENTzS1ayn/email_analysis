Yes indeed. The content created to represent the signature
should be normalized from the start anyway, like any other
content that is newly created.

In very rare cases, maybe yes.

I wouldn't mind here, with the precaution that a signature not
in an Unicode encoding in most cases doesn't need any actual
normalization.

I agree. XML is not limited to UTF-8 and UTF-16. You may want
to include a signature in an existing document, and that
document may for some reason e.g. be in Shift-JIS.

Yes, here is where the problems mentioned in http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/
come into play. In short: Watch out for certain characters (usually extremely
few) where not all implementations convert to Unicode the same way
(independent of character normalization).

Yes, unless the input is already in an Unicode-based encoding
(UTF-8, UTF-16,...).
