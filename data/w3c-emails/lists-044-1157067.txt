I am still wondering if this is a typical case. How often do you find a
signature somewhere on the floor where you then need to get the data you
want to verify? Most of the time you will get the signature with the data
anyway. Somtimes you will have the data and look for a signature. And then,
any name is sufficient, need not be a location in the first place.
