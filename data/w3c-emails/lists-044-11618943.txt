     I don't see any place to put Attribute Certificates into X509Data (or
anywhere else in KeyInfo).  That is the natural way to put in an
authenticated role, I think.

IMHO, the answer depends upon the higher level security model.  Who
assigns the role?  Who assigns trust in the signer?  What are the
consequences of a forged role?  Who is libel for the consequences?

The way I understand your proposal, you'd assign the role as a KeyInfo
element.

     Question for the list: Does the spec allow application defined
     attributes in KeyInfo.  I don't think so.  Am I missing
     something?

Anyway, why attach something to the certificate element which
presumably has nothing to do with the certificate.  It might be better
to create a wholly separate signed SignerRole element outside the
signature block, with the signer's role, name, address, etc.

OTOH, if it does have something to do with the certificate (the role
is being attested to by the certificate issuer), then it has to be in
the certificate or in some other way signed by the issuer.  Otherwise,
the signer can forge the role.
