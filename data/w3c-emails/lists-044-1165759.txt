Someone at the meeting proposed that a document comparing PKCS#7 to XMLDSig
might help new folks understand the topic better. I thought about that, and
found that this might not be a bad idea. It would also help us here get up
to your full speed again faster and propose that we would start writing a
draft in that direction. Any suggestions, comments and other input is
appreciated!
