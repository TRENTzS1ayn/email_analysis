(I've been out of the office much for the past couple weeks & am working
through a backlog of mail...)

Yup, you're correct.  To the best of my knowledge RFC 2253 is the only
standard way to string-encode a DN, so that's what we should use for
X509IssuerName.  It's not what I'd consider optimal for an XML environment,
but I'd rather use what exists already than define something new. (Since the
DN is itself a structured object, seems to me the right thing would be a
direct mapping to a structured XML element...)
