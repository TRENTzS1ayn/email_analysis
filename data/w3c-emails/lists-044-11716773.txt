Abstract

   This document specifies XML digital signature processing rules and
   syntax. XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication,
   and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether
   located within the XML that includes the signature or elsewhere.

Status of this document

   This specification of the IETF/W3C [26]XML Signature Working Group
   follows the XML Signature Last Call and attempts to address all
   [27]last call comments sent to the list and those issues discussed at
   the [28]April meeting. Additionally, this specification follows the
   request that the W3C Director and IESG consider this specification for
   advancement on to the standards tracks of each institution; those
   concerns included minor process/status issues as well as the
   requirement that the Canonical XML specification precede the Signature
   specification to Candidate REC (including resolving the last couple
   internationalization issues). Additionally, prior to the next draft we
   hope to:
    1. Ensure that our use of [29]schema namespaces and qualifications
       provides a single schema that can be used for [30]enveloped
       signatures (signature within content being signed), [31]enveloping
       signatures (content is within signature being signed) and
       [32]detached signatures (over data external to the signature
       document).
    2. Further test our employment of Schema, URIs, IDs, and XPath.
    3. Confirm that a compliant Signature application ensures an XML
       instance is [33]valid XML for the schema (and DTD) that we have
       specified.
