It was my intent, and I certainly consider it legitimate, to include
multiple EE certificates with the same subject public key within X509Data,
along with any CA certificates that chain (directly or indirectly) off those
EE certificates.  The signer does not necessarily have any information about
the signature verifier's trust policies, so if multiple certificates have
been issued for the same subject public key of the signer, any (or all) of
the issued EE certs might be relevant to the verifier.  (This also holds
true for CA certs, of course.)  In fact, it's easy to envision policies
where a verifier would accept a signature key only if it came with two or
more independent, validating cert chains.

It was the intent of the wording to 4.4.4 to include all certificates
related to the single key, including multiple EE certs.  This obviously
accords with the language in 4.4.  

I do not see where you got the impression that "section 4.4.3 suggest that
Retrievalmethod be used *in preference to*" including an entire cert chain.
RetrievalMethod is simply a method for including an indirect pointer to
key-related information, and it provides a convenient mechanism for sharing
the same key-related information across multiple signatures.  The example
brought up in Victoria was of multiple signatures on a document that shared
the CA portions of one or more cert chains; instead of including the CA
certs once per signature they could be included once in the document and
referenced (via RetrievalMethod) in the KeyInfo elements of other
signatures.  Either method may be preferable, depending on the particular
scenario.

I think you read a little too much into my comments; I never explicitly
claimed SKI as a "valid global identifier", although it would certainly be a
valid one had PKIX specified exactly one appropriate method for calculating
SKI.  ("Appropriate" to me means SKI is the output of a cryptographic hash
function applied to the public key material, algorithm ID and algorithm
parameters.)  Nevertheless, SKI really is more useful than I&SN for
discovering multiple certificates related to a single key, and I do expect
most PKIX implementations over time to generate "appropriate" SKIs.  (The
PGP community has been doing this for years, and the Keyserver network
supports KeyID-based searches.  It's really quite convenient.)
