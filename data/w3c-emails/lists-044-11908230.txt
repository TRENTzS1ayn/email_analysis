     My proposal was that certificates be permitted in KeyInfo only if they
were certificates for the signing key or members of a chain FOR that
certificate.  A chain for a CA certificate extends upwards from that CA
certificate, but not downwards - it's not the same thing  as a chain
containing that CA certificate.    Thus if a CA is permitted to sign an XML
document the set of certificates for that document may not contain any EE
certificates.  Do we need to add that if a CA signed the document, KeyInfo
may not contain any certificates issued by that CA?

I am not sure I understand your comments.

I wanted to ask is how you can identify Public Key Certificate(PKC) to
verify the data signed by the corresponding private key.  It is hard
to identify PKC because KeyInfo element can include multiple
certificate.  For example, in PKCS#7, PKC, which is corresponding to
the private key which uses to be actually signed can be identified by
IssuerAndSerialNumber in SignerInfo.

We assume KeyInfo element includes the following certificate chain

    ROOT CA PKC
       |
     CA 1 PKC
       |
     CA 2 PKC
       |
     EE PKC

but the certificate which corresponds to the private key which to be
actually signed
is CA1PKC (though this is unrealistic case.)

[Tom Gindin] This is a very unrealistic case.  If the KeyInfo element
includes that certificate chain the document MUST have been signed by EE
PKC.

In this case, it is hard to find it.
Should We have some restrictions about this such as unrelevant
certificates MUST NOT be contained in KeyInfo?
What do you think?
