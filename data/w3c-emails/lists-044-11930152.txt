This sounds overly complex to me.

If someone tries sending four million certificates, because he happens to
have that many in his local cache, I assume netiquette folks will pounce on
him immediately.

If someone sends the certificates a DSig verifier needs, plus two others that
are completely irrelevant to the DSig verification process, then there has
been a small waste of bandwidth, but the verification code better not be so
fragile that it gets confused by the extraneous information.
