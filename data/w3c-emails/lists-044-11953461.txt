I'm sure John will be able to answer more authoratively, but an easy answer
and question:

Yes.

   An element E has namespace nodes that represent its namespace
   declarations, any namespace declarations made by its ancestor that
   have not been overridden in E's declaration, the default namespace if
   it is non-empty, and the declaration of the prefix xml. 
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-c14n-20000710

This is done such that you can move a signature and ensure its namespace
context is taken with it.

I don't quite follow...

What do you mean known in advance?
