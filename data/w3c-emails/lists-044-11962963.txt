When signing a portion of an XML document (and Element and its
children), it is necessary to have the entire document in order
to determine the namespace declarations of the parents of the
Element.

An XML Signature represents only a portion of a document.
Once the Signature element and its children are created,
it will be inserted somewhere in an XML document.
Therefore, it may not be known in advance what the parent
Element of the Signature element will be.

My question is, when canonicalizing the Signature element
to compute the SignatureValue, is it necessary to include
the namespace declarations of the parents of the Signature
element.  If so, it is necessary to know where in the enclosing
XML document that the newly generated signature will be inserted.
