     Don't look now, but the KeyValue is described as mandatory to
implement.  I don't think that that means that if a signer puts in an
X509Data they also will put in a KeyValue, nor even that they're supposed
to.

Ok, I did not see that the KeyValue was mandatory if a KeyInfo
was present.  In this case, it is unambiguous as to what the
authentication key is.
