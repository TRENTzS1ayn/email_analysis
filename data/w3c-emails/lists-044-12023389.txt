Don, on the following point, could you provide some clarity?

Does the text [1], "Thus, to interoperate between different XML
implementations, the following syntax constraints MUST be observed" mean
ONLY when a DTD/schema is not present, or any XML content being signed can
never have attribute values? (I assume not).

And with respect to the text, "2. all entity references (except "amp", "lt",
"gt", "apos", "quot", and other character entities not representable in the
encoding chosen) be expanded" How would you respond to Martin's comment? I
think the point was to say these things don't vary as they are defined by
the doctype and convention, so that's why we don't mind if people use them
in their non-expanded form: &amp; = &#38;
