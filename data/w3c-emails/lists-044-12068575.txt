Thanks, Tom!

That is the correct interpretation. KeyValue is the mandatory default
for interoperability. Any conformant verifier implementation must
support it.

     Don't look now, but the KeyValue is described as mandatory to
implement.  I don't think that that means that if a signer puts in an
X509Data they also will put in a KeyValue, nor even that they're
supposed
to.

Ok, I did not see that the KeyValue was mandatory if a KeyInfo
was present.  In this case, it is unambiguous as to what the
authentication key is.
