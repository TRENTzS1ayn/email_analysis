I favor transforms being outside SignedInfo (see below).

But if the transforms are outside SignedInfo, the exhaustive search is
unnecessary.  I think this is too much to expect for cross-vendor solutions to
give us a consistent answer.  Also, if we have a lot of objects, the number of
combinations grows rapidly.

If we have a transform which says "if and only if the document is base64
encoded, decode it", I believe we should have a standard way of identifying the
state of the document as base64-encoded (outside SignedInfo).  Otherwise, I
believe transforms belong outside SignedInfo, and the transform should be just
"base64-decode".

This problem has been hinted at, but I really don't understand it.  We could
just as easily have a false location to a bad document which spoofs the
signature.  If there are signed transforms, all we have to do is run the reverse
of the transforms on the spoof document.  If you can create such a document with
the transforms you mention, we should just as easily be able to create this
document with signed transforms (run the spoof transforms, run the reverse
signed transforms, then point to the new document.)

If creating a meaningful spoof document (with or without transforms) that
doesn't break the signature is relatively easy, then digital signatures seem
worthless.
