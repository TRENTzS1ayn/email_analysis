Here are just a few minor comments for your Last Call Canonical XML 
[1] "work in progress."

Is "Canonical" a proper noun? It is lowercase in "canonical form" and 
uppercase in "Canonical XML." I would make it lowercase globally, 
except when referring to the title of this spec.

"REQUIRED" and "MUST" seem to be used in the RFC 2119 sense. You 
might say so, and add http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt to 
References.

Below, a clause and paragraph number are followed by a quote and then 
a suggestion. Comments are in brackets [].

2. par. 7
[Define QName here, rather than wait until the last par. of clause 4.]

2. par. 8
URI
[You might add a [URI] link, and add 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt to References.]

2. par. 10, list item 4
XPath recommendation

Clause 3, "Document Order for Canonical XML," needs to be numbered "3".

4. par. 4, list item 3

5. last par.

"...However, the statement in Namespaces in XML that "the
     prefix functions only as a placeholder for a namespace
     name" is incorrect."
[Is it a known errata item? A negative comment inside a specification 
about another spec. seems somehow out of place without what you term 
"resolution." Sorry I didn't find it in a quick search of 
xml-names-editor, or in 
http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-names-19990114-errata. Maybe in place of 
"is incorrect" say "needs clarification" or "needs modification"?]
