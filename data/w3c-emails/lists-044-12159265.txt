I'd like to suggest some mechanics.  The WG meeting is Thursday
afternoon.  About the only time at the IETF meeting before that which
does not conflict with sessions is Tuesday evening opposite the Social.

I'll post a list of test cases which can be refined based on comment.
Those participating can generate documents including signatures for
these cases and exchange them (or send them to me for distribution to
participants) via email or sneaker net no later than the Sunday
evening reception.

People are welcome to exchange information before then but Tuesday
evening the participants get together to compare notes on verification
efforts thus far, perhaps do a small bit of real time adjustment to
implementations, and plan whether any further attempt to get together
should be made before the Thursday afternoon WG meeting.

Thanks,
Donald
