How do you mean broken? Kevin has pointed out one problem and alluded to
others, if you guys point them out, I'll be happy to fix them in the next
version. It's just that tweaking something in the spec, then in the actual
file, then validating the schema/DTD and then examples, find bug, reiterate,
can get hairy sometimes. <smile>

I'm doing syntactical (not cryptographic) validation using [1].

I think for the purposes of Interop, it would make sense to create an
application DTD with Signature+application declarations by which we can test
enveloped and enveloping Signatures. Do you already have one?

People should feel free to send examples/DTDs to the list right now (and
attachments are decoded with their own URL which is convenient) as a start,
and then we can put a more formal document together (or if someone wants to
contribute that now, that's welcome too!)
