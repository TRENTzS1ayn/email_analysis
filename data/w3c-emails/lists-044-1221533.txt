Joseph:

In attempting to formulate some definitions, I have found some terms that
appear either to be used interchangeably either to mean the same thing or
are being used to mean different things the nuances of which I don't
understand.

Examples in the draft follow:

2.1 The Signature Element

resource
object(s)
data
data object(s)
signed data

2.2 The SignedInfo Element

thing(s) (used extensively)
data
objects
secured data

2.3 The ObjectReference Element

thing(s) (used extensively)
XML thing

2.4 The Manifest and Package Elements

items
object references
objects

3.3 The SignedInfo Element

object(s) (extensive use)

3.3.3.1 The Transforms Element

resource
data

Etc. . . .
