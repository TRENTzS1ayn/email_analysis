 Some minor inconsistencies:
 
 4.4.3 RetrievalMethod
 
 Schema has Encoding attribute on both RetrievalMethod and Type
 elements but DTD has Encoding attribute just on Type element.
 DTD correct?
 
 Then in the DTD on file, there is no Type element defined.
 
 The Schema has mandatory content for the Type element. This
 seems wrong because it can't then be implemented interoperably
 without further specification.
 
 4.3.3.1 Transform
 
 In the schema, the "XPath" element is case-incorrect "Xpath".
