Rich has suggested naming a transform. This prompts my comment.

I have had some audit experience in banking as well as information security. I
approach the issue by asking: "How will I describe to the business, auditor, and
information security specialists exactly what is being signed?"

I view transforms as a type of "macro" with full computational powers. Thus the
business (signer) is signing an algorithm to act on data. If any transform can be
placed in signed data, how will the business signer or relying party be able to
determine exactly what the effects of the transform are to the satisfaction of their
auditors?  I think this will be difficult to explain at best.

At the DC IETF WG meeting, several example transforms were suggested. I could see
the business need for many of the examples.  I was just uncomfortable with having
arbitrarily constructed transforms.

Admittedly, "base64 encoding" is an algorithm (transform) operating on the data, but
the algorithm/concept has been fully vetted and reviewed by many parties in the
standards and security community. I have been able to explain "base64 encode/decode"
to auditors and business with success relying on the existing extensive review
literature.

 Following the example of  "base64", I believe that transforms must be "named," well
known algorithms with review by standards bodies. If this is the case, I can see
explaining to auditors and business that the transforms need to be part of the
signedinfo, and they are fixed, well defined, named, and vetted transforms.
