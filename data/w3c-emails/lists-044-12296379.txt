I meant something like "Signatures which do not follow the three
syntax constrains below will generally fail to interoperate if any XML
implementation that ever tries to verify them does not have the
required DTD/schmea(s) present."  Note that it is not just the dsig
DTD/schema but for anything within the SignedInfo and other stuff in
the same document referenced by any References.  In generaly, it seems
like mandating these syntax contraints would be a good idea.

You have to be able to use most of the enumerated entities to properly
express things without tripping up the XML parsing and they are
pre-defined by the XML 1.0 specificaztion.  &amp; = &
"Expansion" is an odd term in this case as they change into one
character so they get shorter.

I guess that's right, ie, characters not representable should be
changed into a numeric character reference.  But I can't see how it
matters whether it is decimal or hex.  Any conformant XML 1.0 reader
will translate the numeric character references into the appropriate
character.  Things which depend on the surface input character string
and assume no XML processing are completely screwed as far as
interoperability anyway.
