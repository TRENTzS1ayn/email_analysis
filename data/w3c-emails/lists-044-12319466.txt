Thats the one, aside from Merlins comments.

Essential.
I am in the process of embedding the DTD into another for signing - with
that experience I'll put together another example (embedded/embedding) and
post it.

One comment I do have, is that XML-based applications requiring DTD
validation find it convenient to embed the entire DTD in a DOCTYPE element
in the XML directly - (rather than a reference) so that only the .xml file
need be passed around.
A restriction on doing this is that you can't have variable declarations a
la
<!ENTITY % Object.ANY...>
in the DTD.

For such an application, I have to take the DSIG DTD, search-replace all the
variables, then embed it in the app DTD before embedding that in the xml.

Do people think this is an acceptable process for that situation? I guess it
has to be.

Thanks,
OWen
