Joseph,

  Per the language on the site:

To the best of my knowledge, iLumin has patent applications pending
regarding the signing of XML and other digital documents.

  Thanks for your direction on this.

Toby

Hi Toby,

Basically, we encourage companies to make the appropriate disclosures to
prevent design bias and submarine patents. Please see [1], specifically
[2,3]. If ILumin has any patents relevant to the W3C/IETF XML Signature
work, please disclose it in compliance with the referenced policies.
