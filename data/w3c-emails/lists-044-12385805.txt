Similar to <http://www.w3.org/Signature/2000/05/30-interop.html>, the
idea is to have signatures fitting verious profiles generated by the
participants and verified by other participants.  The participants
would generally generate their own keys and include. Emphasis would be
on the mandatory algorithms including HMAC.

Thanks,
Donald
