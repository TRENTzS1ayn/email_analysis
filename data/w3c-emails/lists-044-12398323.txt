Noted, the last sentence is changed to:

/+The MANDATORY to implement canonicalization algorithm (applied if this
element is omitted) is Canonical XML [XML-C14N].+/ Alternatives, such as the
minimal canonicalization algorithm (the CRLF and charset normalization
specified in section 6.5.1: Minimal Canonicalization), may be explicitly
specified but are NOT REQUIRED....
