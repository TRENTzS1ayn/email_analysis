You need to remove "(applied if this element is omitted)" because the
element MUST be present.  So I think it should now read:

CanonicalizationMethod is a required element that specifies the
canonicalization algorithm applied to the SignedInfo element prior to
performing signature calculations. This element uses the general structure
for algorithms described in section 6.1: Algorithm Identifiers and
Implementation Requirements. The MANDATORY to implement canonicalization
algorithm
is Canonical XML [XML-C14N].

Alternatives, ...

Noted, the last sentence is changed to:

/+The MANDATORY to implement canonicalization algorithm (applied if this
element is omitted) is Canonical XML [XML-C14N].+/ Alternatives, such as the
minimal canonicalization algorithm (the CRLF and charset normalization
specified in section 6.5.1: Minimal Canonicalization), may be explicitly
specified but are NOT REQUIRED....
