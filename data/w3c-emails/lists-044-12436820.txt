In similar vein, CanonicalizationMethod is treated as optional in a few
other places:

(1) In section 2.0, the overall structure is outlined:

             <Signature> 
               <SignedInfo>
                 (CanonicalizationMethod)?
                 (SignatureMethod)
                 <Reference (URI=)? >
                   (Transforms)?
                   (DigestMethod)
                   (DigestValue)
                 (</Reference>)+
               </SignedInfo>
               (SignatureValue) 
              (KeyInfo)?
              (Object)*
             </Signature>

(2) In section 2.1, one annotation says:

            [s03] The CanonicalizationMethod is the algorithm that is used to 
            canonicalize the SignedInfo element before it is digested as part 
            of the signature operation. In the absence of a
            CanonicalizationMethod element, no canonicalization is done.

(3) The first step in section 3.1.2 says:

                1. Create SignedInfo element with SignatureMethod, 
                   CanonicalizationMethod if required, and Reference(s).
