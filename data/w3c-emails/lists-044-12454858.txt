[Thread moves back to question of whether a valid XML Signature is
well-formed, well-formed+constrained, DTD Valid, or Schema Valid]

Ok... (So this isn't required for conformance, just warning?)

I expect you don't mean "Signatures which do not ..." because I'd expect a
Signature application would have some sense of the  Signature DTD/schema;
you mean content being signed? This also returns us to the question as to
whether we expect Signature verifying applications to check for XML DTD or
schema validity.

DTD is out for enveloped/envloping signatures.

I argue a conformant Signature application needs to valdiate the Signature
element against the Signature schema. Fortunately, we aren't using that many
features, we could get away with some text akin to (tweaked Connolly

    a conforming digital signature element is an element [information 
    item] that is _schema-valid_ with respect to the schema element 
    declarations found within each element's respective description and
    definition.

I tried to rewrite the text of this section and the one below but was unable
to do so? Could you take a stab such that Martin's comments are addressed?
