If we are going to require schema enforcement, then I guess this can
just be a warning.

? I'm not sure I understand your paragraph abaove.  The syntax
constraints are to avoid changes during input due to the DTD/schema.
Signatures break for changes in either the signature or in the data
signed which, if it is XML anywhere in the same document as the
Signature element, will have gone through XML 1.0 input processing.

Considerations are the same for a "detached" signature where the
signed data is in the same XML document as the signature.

Certainly we want to minimize requirements as to method and
concentrate on requirements as to result.

OK.

To follow the IETF tradition, we would require signature generation to
conform to the schema and signature validation to be more forgiving.
However, I don't really see much need for such flexibility at validators.
I think we have provided enough flexibility in the elements and extensions
explicitly provided.  Given a desire to use automated tools to enforce
syntax checks, I think that requiring conformant validators to enforce the
schema is fine.
