Hi,

I have (hopefully) attached a gzipped tarchive containing
a sample signature based on WD-xmldsig-core-20000711. A
Readme.txt contains forty words of detail.

The document is a single enveloped signature which itself
is enveloping a manifest and signature properties. It
employs base 64, XPath, XSL and C14N transforms. It uses
DSA, and includes just the DSA public key value.

Included are all required resources along with the
intermediate output of all phases of C14N and XSL
processing.

The XSL transform is encoded as an xsl:stylesheet element
embedded directly within the Transform element. For
compatibility, I have also included a separate version
using a stringified XSLT element.

Validation of some references requires an XML parser which
can resolve IDs.

I apologize for attaching a binary, if that is against
etiquette, but the associated resources are sufficient
that attaching all as text would be disturbing.

Any comments are welcome.
