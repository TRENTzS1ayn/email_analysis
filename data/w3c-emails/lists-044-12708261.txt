Exactly.

Also relevant to this discussion are some notes I observed
about interoperating among different XSL processors:

. You must specify that output indentation is disabled.
  Different XSL tools indent differently.

. If your output format is XML, you may want to C14N it
  afterwards. This should almost be mandatory; interop
  is otherwise almost guaranteed to fail.

. If your output format is non-XML, then it seems
  impossible to guarantee interop. There is no exact
  definition for the format of, e.g., autogenerated
  META tags; nor is an ordering imposed on attributes;
  nor can HTML, for example, be canonicalized.

This last point is possible the most problematic. If I read
the XSL spec right, different XSL processors may produce
different results from the same input.
