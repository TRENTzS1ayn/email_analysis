Great, thanks.  I assume you don't mind if I post the binary and an
exploded version on xmldsig.pothole.com.

I don't see any problem with a binary this small (<15K) being posted
to the mailing list but for big binaries, it would be best to make
them available via ftp or the web and post a notice...

Thanks,
Donald
