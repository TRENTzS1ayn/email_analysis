Hi Ed,

It was certainly the intent of the XSL Transform section to indicate that a
whole stylesheet be provided.  The language used was 'whose content MUST
conform to the XSL Transforms [XSLT] language syntax'.  It does not say that
the content of the parameter must conform to *any portion of* that syntax.
Therefore, I fully support whatever measures you think are necessary for the
schema to reflect our desire that an entire stylesheet be provided.

Ed responds:
If we can enforce, to a reasonable degree, that XSLT <Transform>s indeed
have
a <stylesheet> root element, then I think the derived benefits of
interoperability more than outweigh the cost of two or three more lines in
the schema.  (It would certainly be nice is XSLT did provide a schema and
I hope they do in their next Recommendation version.)

As an aside, the use of ANY has the implied default of
processContents='strict'. This may be approriate in specific instances (like
XSLT) however I think it's a bit too strict for everything in general. So I
propose we move towards <any ...  processContents='lax' ...> in things like
Transorms, Object, PGPData, SPKIData, etc.

That is true: "Any well-formed XML from any namespace (default)"

If we wanted to do what you are speaking of we'd use a declaration below (I
think). However, XSLT [1] didn't provide a schema anyway and consequently
there might be some other tricks we could do, but seems too complicated for
the derived benefit...
