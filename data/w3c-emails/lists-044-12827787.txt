I'm not sure how to. I was thinking we could define our own XSLT root and
pretend its of the XSLT namespace, or even create our own schema stub with
the root node defined and everything else open (so we don't have to recreate
a whole schema). But, I'd be happier with some prose in that section stating
a recommendation over the content. So if you want to propose some prose or
clever schema tricks, please do so. <smile>

The XSLT spec is littered with comments saying they plan to next time around.
