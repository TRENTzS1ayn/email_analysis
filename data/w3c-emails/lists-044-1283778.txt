I strongly believe don't think finding an object has anything todo with
digital signatures. I am still waiting for somebody giving a real life
example where you have the signature, and the signature only, and go off
searching for the corresponding data. The other way, having the data and
looking for a signature, might be more appropriate, but in that case any
unique id is fine (so I really liked Josephs suggestion to use the hash).


> Is a floating location any better?
One still can use any form of location as a hint or so in any place you
want. But it is not required for solving the signature "problem".
