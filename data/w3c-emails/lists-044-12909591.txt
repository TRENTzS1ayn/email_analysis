The signature example kindly provided by Merlin Huges is up on the
http://xmldsig.pothole.com web site.  I'd be happy to post others.

In theory the best cases to try interoperation with should be those
that use only mandatory features, in particular, combinations of 
HMAC or DSS, canonicalization, KeyValue type KeyInfo, SHA1, and
enveloping, enveloped, or detached signatures (with detached in
the same document).  But people will probably also be doing some
RSA and certificate type KeyInfo.

Thanks,
Donald
