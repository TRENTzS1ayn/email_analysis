[Barb/Brian: I'm deferring GK13-16,20 to you.]

I believe that might be because more than one key might be required for
trust, but not for Signature validation, so I'd agree with you. Barbara?

[Barb] Multiple declarations refer to the same key - which we state.
"Keys" should be changed to "key." 

 >?[GK14]How can more than exacly one key be used?

Barbara?  [Barb]  This is an error. It should be a single key. 

 >?[GK15]Here the value for exactly one key can be
 >determined!

Yes, the schema and prose are in conflict.  [Barb]  agree. 

 >?[GK16]Right: minOccurs='0'  [Barb] agree


 >?[GK20]Only a single certificate possible here?  [Barb]  Yes. One per
clause.
