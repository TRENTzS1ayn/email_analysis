Hi Gregor,

The idea behind not specifying an encoding attribute was to avoid a
potential interoperability nightmare with people specifying arbitrary
encodings.  There is no need for it.  However, base64 may not be the
optimal encoding in user-defined cases, particularly if the data is
already in text or xml format.  Therefore the current text.
