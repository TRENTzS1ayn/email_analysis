Hi Paul,

OK, so a given XML application's document that does not use xml:base has
also has the problem that it does not know whether or not the content came
from an external parsed entity.  Point taken.

However, this should not be used as a reason not to fix xml:base.  The
problem I'm raising *IS* with XML Base.  The fact that it also happens
without XML Base does not mean  that the problem isn't with XML Base.

Moreover, the 'Included if validating' terminology does in fact reference by
hypertext link the definition of 'included', so my use of that section's
phrasing is indeed appropriate, and it again brings up the question:

Should we be introducing an attribute beginning with xml: that seems to
violate section 4.4.2 of the XML 1.0 spec?

My point above is that the issue you have isn't with XML Base,
because all XML Base does is give you another way to set the
base URI, but you already have the problem of different base
URIs in different external entities even if XML Base is not
considered.

No, it is not.  XML Base as a spec merely provides the way for
a resource of MIME type */xml to specify the base URI within
the document content (see RFC 2396 section 5.1.1).  It does NOT
say how to determine what is a relative URI and which relative
URIs should be resolved.  It isn't even normative about how to
resolve a relative URI given one and the base URI--it merely
restates what RFC 2396 says normatively about this.  It is the
job of any spec using XML Base to describe how to determine what
it means to that application for something to be a relative URI
within the application content.  C14N is one such application.

If the application is built on the Infoset, then the infoset carries
correct base URI info on each element.

In addition, suppose there are no xml:base attributes at all.  Then
how does your application know which external entity's URI to use
as the base URI to resolve the relative URI?  If you can solve this
issue, you can probably handle xml:base, and if you can't solve this
issue, then you've already got a problem that has nothing to do with
XML Base.

Actually, this is not a rationale for what xml:base should do, it is
quoted in support of the position that relative URIs in external
entities--having nothing to do with XML Base--should be resolved
relative to the base URI of the external entity in which they appear.

You are using different terminology than RFC 2396 which talks of
"Establishing a Base URI" (section 5.1) and then gives a four
level way to determine the base URI.  XML Base is precisely the
first level way (5.1.1. Base URI within Document Content) out of
those four ways to determine the base URI, whereas the URI of the
external entity (see RFC 2396 5.1.3. Base URI from the Retrieval URI)
is the third level way.  (Note that the term "entity" in Section 5.1.2
Base URI from the Encapsulating Entity of RFC 2396 is used in the
MIME encapsulation sense, not the XML external parsed entity sense.)

I'm not trying to be a Philadelphia lawyer here--no question that the
XML 1.0 spec is not clear on this issue.  The problem is that 4.2.2
"Included" (if you look at the preceding table) is really only used
for internal entities; the table entry for external entities links
to 4.2.3 "Included If Validating" which doesn't have any wording that
is really helpful for our debate.

And that is true for internal entities.

But that is the tail wagging the dog.  Applications should be built
on the Infoset (or equivalent model), and the infoset should provide
the necessary base URI info for whatever needs the application may
have.  And this is necessary even in the absence of XML Base.
