Hi Jonathan,

OK, that makes some sense.  What you're saying is that we should have c14n
extend the Xpath data model by adding an xml:base to the top level element
of external entities.

This must be done by modifying the XML processor that generates the
node-set.  I wonder how easy this is for implementers.

I agree with you that trying to read between the lines on XML 1.0 is a waste
of time, but I disagree with the implication that this is what I'm doing.
There are quite specific lines that tell an XML processor developer that
they need not distinguish between content derived within the document versus
content derived externally.

So, TAMURA Kent, Kevin Regan and others: could you please let us know if you
can do this?  If so, then I'd like to do what you suggest Jonathan, then
place a note about the residual problem with base URI for top-level PIs.

Thanks,
John Boyer
