You will have a choice to make.  Either you deviate from the XPath data
model by adding an attribute that XPath doesn't provide (some Xpath queries
might produce different results), or you deviate from the XPath data model
by extending the data model with a base URI property like XSLT and the
infoset do, and add the xml:base attribute only when serializing.  I like
the latter approach better, it's similar to namespace declarations and the
consistency with other specs might make it easier to support on processors
that are XSLT- or infoset-based.

OK, sorry, I thought that you and Paul were about to disappear in a very
deep rat hole.  In any case, this is a Core WG issue, the Linking group is
mostly trying to follow their interpretation.

Is a note sufficient or does it just postpone the issue?
