Jim,

I had read this differently (and as I said I didn't like the result of the
way I read it). But reading it as you do (which I think is probably the
right way on hindsight) I'd agree that the current syntax is sufficient. In
the next version of the specification we should be clearer that it is not
necessary that the URL be dereferenced from the network for the resource to
validate only that some content when transformed (and perhaps that content
was pulled from a cache) yields the digest value.
