Sorry, but I wasn't aware of the text in XML that John has brought up.
While I don't think it's always easy to second-guess what spec writers
had in mind, and I therefore agree that such second-guessing should
be limited as much as possible, I don't think at all that the section
about inclusion in 4.4.2 needs interpretation. It quite clearly says
that including an (external) entity means doing a textual replacement.
To read it otherwise would be very surprising, at least to me.

XML therefore sets up a historical presumption that there is no
difference for an XML processor between an external entity and
an XML document where this entity is inserted.
It seems therefore that the question is not whether XBase follows
XSLT or not, the question is how to make sure that XBase follows
XML, and how we can make sure that other specs do the same.

You mean that there could be a relative URI in the PI?
Interesting case. But I think a PI has to be treated in
the same way as free text. Then either the base of the
external entity also applies to free text, which would
be in disagreement with XSLT, and in which case we have a
much more serious problem, or the base of the external
entity doesn't apply for both cases.
