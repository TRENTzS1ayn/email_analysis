I am leary of MUSTs in this area.  In many protocol applications some
subset of fields in a document may be signed and the non-signed fields
will be those which change in transit (ie, a hop count) or have other
sufficient cross-checks applied or are to be chekced and signed by
some later participant in a multi-party transaction or who knows what.
If an external style sheet is referenced there is no reason to include
or sign it if it is determinable by the protocol and all receivers
have a copy which is authentic by definition. Etc.

No document will ever save you from an incompetant or foolish
implementor and attempts to craft such a document are doomed to
failure.  We need to adequately point out areas of potential problems
and leave it at that.
