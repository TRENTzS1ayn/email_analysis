I agree with Donald.

With regard to section 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, while it may be
reasonable to briefly point out ways that inexperienced
implementors could create ineffective XML Signatures,
there are applications where the use of significantly
altering transforms  is useful and we don't want to stop
those who know what they are doing from doing it.

When discussing XSLT, it is important to remember there
are two semantically different reasons for using it:
1.  To define how an XML document should appear to a viewer.
2.  To transform an XML document into the data to be signed
(eg. as an alternative to XPath where XPath is insufficient).

For some apps, the same XSLT transformations may accomplish 
both cases 1 and 2.  For others, different transformations may be
needed for each case.  And for other apps, only one of case 1 or 2
may be relevant.

I have no doubt that experience with real-world XML Signatures
will help us understand what constitutes best practice.  While
we can list some basic "watch it"s in the spec, we MUST NOT
be too restrictive ;-}.  I would even go as far as taking out all the 
RFC2119 key words in section 8.1.3.

I am leary of MUSTs in this area.  In many protocol applications some
subset of fields in a document may be signed and the non-signed fields
will be those which change in transit (ie, a hop count) or have other
sufficient cross-checks applied or are to be chekced and signed by
some later participant in a multi-party transaction or who knows what.
If an external style sheet is referenced there is no reason to include
or sign it if it is determinable by the protocol and all receivers
have a copy which is authentic by definition. Etc.

No document will ever save you from an incompetant or foolish
implementor and attempts to craft such a document are doomed to
failure.  We need to adequately point out areas of potential problems
and leave it at that.
