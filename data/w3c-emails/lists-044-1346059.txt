I think this is sort of what I had in mind when I suggested the definition of 
(at least some of) the transforms should be "make it x" vs. "do x".  Thus the 
statement is I signed a canonicalized, decoded instance of this object.  If 
you've got one, digest it, if not, you need to perform the corresponding 
transforms.  This would be in contrast to the interpretation of "you must 
obtain a version and apply each specified transform".
