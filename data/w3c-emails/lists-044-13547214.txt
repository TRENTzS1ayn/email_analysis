Hi Don, I think the WG's direction at this point in time is pretty much set,
however it is possible that the specification isn't doing a good a job as it
could be of communicating that direction to others -- who haven't been
arguing about this and related issues for the past year!

As odd as it may sound, we consider this an applications issue for a couple
of reasons. It's hard (i.e. not likely to get done in a reasonable amount of
time), we are serving a range of applications (low level protocols to forms
processing), there's little agreement on how to do it, and the meaning of a
document format is determined by its own specification and use.
Consequently, we set out to define a simple signature syntax that provides
for 'signature validity': associating a key with octets so as to provide
data integrity, authenticity, and key non-repudiation (in asymmetric key
systems). [1] Within the Signature specification we aren't normatively
specifying how a key relates to a person or institution, nor what those
octets mean. (The only octets we concern ourselves with are those that make
up the Signature element type itself.)

This is correct. Applications will have to make a number of decisions about
the cryptographic algorithms _used_ (e.g., selection and key strengths,
etc.), transforms (e.g., XPath, XSLT, etc.), and even meaning of the
Signature in their context. On the meaning note, consider that the checkbook
application had to define (and enforce) what it means by 'authorized by':

<checkbook>
  <check Id="check101">
    <account>xyz</account>
    <amount currency="USD">50</amount>
    <authorized by="#Signature101"/>
  </check>
  <Signature Id="Signature101" xmlns="http://www.w3...">
    ...
    <Reference URI="#check101"/>
    ...
  </Signature>
</checkbook>

I don't think the question is the degree to which we think this is
important, but to be clear about our definitions and conformance
requirements. We are focusing our use of those key terms on those things
that affect interoperability with respect to the generation of the
SignatureValue.

Regardless, if the WG is not willing to pursue the path of using MUST with
respect to security recommendations regarding signatures that humans
interact with, I think it would be a good idea to perhaps include a sentence
right up front (maybe in the introduction) stating our intent: that this
specification provides an component that is necessary but not sufficient nor
complete component of using XML to communicate legally binding semantics
between users, with a reference to section 8: Security Considerations.

I think these properties are important and belong in signature legislation
and/or application policies when they define the context of their
application.

This is a good point though the text was intended to deal with cryptographic
processing.  With respect to XML issues, we acknowledge that it's tricky
ground (XML itself is green as evidenced by all the canonicalization
discussion), but it's a problem folks felt like tackling given the balance
we struck in requirement 2.3 . Given that our mutual goal is to be clear
about the intent and use of the specification, if we can't reach that
through saying MUST in section 8, perhaps a sentence or two up front can?

Consequently, what do people think of a paragraph along the lines as the one
added [2] below:

1.0 Introduction
...

/+This specification defines a method of associating a key with referenced
data (octets); it does not normatively specify how keys are associated with
persons or institutions, nor the meaning of the data being referenced and
signed. Consequently, while this specification is an important component of
secure XML applications, it itself is not sufficient to address all
application security/trust concerns, particularly with respect to using
signed XML (or other data formats!) as a basis of human-to-human
communication and agreement. Such an application must specify additional
key, algorithm, processing and rendering requirements. For further
information, please see Section 8: Security Considerations. +/
