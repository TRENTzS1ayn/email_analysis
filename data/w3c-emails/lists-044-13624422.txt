Thanks, Ed, for posting this. 

I have been working with Joseph Reagle to prepare a W3C Briefing
Package/Proposal for a W3C working group on XML Encryption, and there's
a lot of interest. So, we are planning an informal meeting to discuss
requirements, syntax, and this strawman proposal immediately after
Crypto 2000, UCSB Campus, Anacapa Hall Formal Lounge, Thursday, 8/24,
1:30 PM. If you're interested in working on XML encryption, please join
us!

I've cross-posted this message because the XML Encryption proposal
includes
a look at how it could work with XML Signatures for data that is both
signed
and
encrypted.
