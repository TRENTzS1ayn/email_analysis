Hi,

TWIMC, attached is a set of example signatures in a gzipped tarchive:

  signature-enveloped-dsa.xml
  signature-enveloping-dsa.xml
  signature-enveloping-hmac-sha1.xml
  signature-enveloping-hmac-sha1-40.xml
  signature-enveloping-rsa.xml
  signature-external-b64-dsa.xml
  signature-external-dsa.xml

I think these cover a good few of the core signature options in
a minimal manner.

The external references require http support. The B64 example
requires a file which doesn't yet exist on the Web, but may soon.

Some folks have already interoped with versions of some of these
so I think they're okay.

Merlin
