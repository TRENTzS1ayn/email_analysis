Is this really a problem?  I thought that attributes without namespace
prefixes were automatically considered within the context of the
element where they occur.  In effect, the namespace qualified name of
the element is the default "namespace" for attributes of that element.

Take the first exampe in section 5.2 of the Namespaces document which
you point to.  It has an <a> element using the default namespace of
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40.  This element has an href attribute.
How are you supposed to understand what that attribute means unless
you consider it to, in some sense, be in the "namespace" of the
element where it occurs?  I.E., that it is part of the "Per Element
Partition" defined in section A.2 of the Namespaces document.

In your example below, just saying "Id" is, in effect, saying
"XMLSignature:Signature:Id" except that syntax is prohibited...

Presumably this is the reason for the odd wording:
"Note that default namespaces do not apply directly to attributes."
