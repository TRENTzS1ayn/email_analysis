Hi Gregor,

See [1] and followups [2]. There are also previous comments on this.
There are requirements whereby here() or some equivalent function
is required [3]. A proposed solution exists [4] and there was some
discussion at IETF [5] but I can't tell what the outcome was. I
suspect that this will be further discussed in the upcoming
teleconferences [6].

>At least we should consider not to make this Transform REQUIRED.
