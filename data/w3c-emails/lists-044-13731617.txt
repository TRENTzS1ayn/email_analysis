Ok, I tweaked the text to:

Various canonicalization algorithms require conversion to [UTF-8].The two
algorithms below understand at least [UTF-8] and [UTF-16] as input
encodings. We RECOMMEND that externally specified algorithms do the same.
Knowledge of other encodings is OPTIONAL.

Various canonicalization algorithms transcode from a non-Unicode encoding to
Unicode. The two algorithms below perform text normalization during
transcoding [NFC]. We RECOMMENDED that externally specified canonicalization
algorithms do the same. (Note, there can be ambiguities in converting
existing charsets to Unicode, for an example see the XML Japanese Profile
[XML-Japanese] NOTE.)
 
and added the following text to the first bullt of minimal:

o converts the character encoding to UTF-8 (without any byte order mark
(BOM)). /+ Implementations MUST understand at least [UTF-8] and [UTF-16] as
input encodings. Non-Unicode to Unicode transcoding MUST perform text
normalization [NFC].+/
