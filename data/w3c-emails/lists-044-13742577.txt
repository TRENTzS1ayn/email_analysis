I guess I had remembered my message below as having been a bit more
specific than it was.  So, here is specific wording for the second
part of Section 7.1.

"Note that items (2), (4), and (5C) depend on specific schema, DTD, or
similar declarations. In the general case, such declarations will not
be available to or used by the signature verifier, particularly for
non-signature XML, which may be in othr namespaces, in the same
document as the signature. Thus, a signature will only be verifiable
by such a non-validating signature implementations if the following
syntax contraints are observed when generating any signed material
including the SignedInfo element:

          1. Attributes having default values are explicitly present.
          2. All entity references (except "amp", "lt", "gt", "apos",
"quot", and other character entities not representable in the encoding
chosen) are expanded and non-representable characters are replaced by
their numeric character reference.
          3. Attribute value white space is normalized."

Thanks,
Donald

I meant something like "Signatures which do not follow the three
syntax constrains below will generally fail to interoperate if any XML
implementation that ever tries to verify them does not have the
required DTD/schmea(s) present."  Note that it is not just the dsig
DTD/schema but for anything within the SignedInfo and other stuff in
the same document referenced by any References.  In generaly, it seems
like mandating these syntax contraints would be a good idea.

You have to be able to use most of the enumerated entities to properly
express things without tripping up the XML parsing and they are
pre-defined by the XML 1.0 specificaztion.  &amp; = &
"Expansion" is an odd term in this case as they change into one
character so they get shorter.

I guess that's right, ie, characters not representable should be
changed into a numeric character reference.  But I can't see how it
matters whether it is decimal or hex.  Any conformant XML 1.0 reader
will translate the numeric character references into the appropriate
character.  Things which depend on the surface input character string
and assume no XML processing are completely screwed as far as
interoperability anyway.
