I took a stab at putting this in the context of laxly schema valid, are we
in agreement?

Note that items (2), (4), and (5C) depend on the presence of a schema, DTD
or similar declarations. The Signature element type is laxly schema valid
[XML-schema], consequently external XML or even XML within the same document
as the signature may be (only) well formed or from another namespace (where
permitted by the signature schema); the noted items may not be present.
Thus, a signature with such content will only be verifiable by other
signature applications if the following syntax contraints are observed when
generating any signed material including the SignedInfo element:

I believe 2 now satisfies Martin's original question.
