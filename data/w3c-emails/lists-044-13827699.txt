I think the answer is in A.2 and A.3 of the namespaces standard which
I had to read quite a few times to get it.  In particular, the second
"good" element below is OK because it is as if the attributes were
"n1:good:a" and "n1:a"...

Attributes without a prefix are MORE than namespace qualified.  They
are element qualified including the namespace of that elelment if any.
