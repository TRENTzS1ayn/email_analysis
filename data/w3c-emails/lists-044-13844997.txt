No, I did not say that attributes "inherit their namespace setting
from the parent element".  I said that they are qualified by their
element.  That is, in

<b:a xmlns:b="foo:bar" c="xyz">

it is "as if" c were actually b:a:c except, of course, that this
syntax is illegal.

But n1:a and n1:good:a would be different.
