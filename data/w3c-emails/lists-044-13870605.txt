Hi Don,

I did not mean to misquote you.  However, I haven't seen any W3C documents,
nor implementations based on them, that use the term 'qualify' as you are
using it.  It is not possible to 'qualify' an attribute with anything but a
namespace URI.

In other words, in the example

<x xmlns:n1="http://www.w3.org" xmlns="http://www.w3.org" >
  <good a="1"     n1:a="2" />
</x>

There does not seem to be any basis in W3C work for the interpretation

1) that 'a' is qualified as (n1:good):a,
2) that 'a' is not qualified by a URI, and
3) that 'a' is qualified by elements, including any URI which may qualify
that element

Therefore, when you said that the attributes "are qualified by their
element", I assumed you meant 'qualify' in the sense defined by XML Names
[1, see the abstract], which associates elements and attributes with a
namespace identified by URI.  With this version of 'qualify', what you said
is equal to what I said you said.

Finally, ending most of our debate about this issue, Tim Bray states, "An
attribute whose name contains no prefix is not in any namespace".  This
means that in the first example of Section 5.2 of XML Names, the href in <a>
is not in the HTML namespace.

This means if I put an HTML island in the middle of some XML by adding
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40" to the html tag, then when I want
the href of some anchor, I cannot simply say
'get("http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40", href)'.  I must instead say

1) get("http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40", href)
2) if that fails, then get("", href)

Once again... Yikes!

No, I did not say that attributes "inherit their namespace setting
from the parent element".  I said that they are qualified by their
element.  That is, in

<b:a xmlns:b="foo:bar" c="xyz">

it is "as if" c were actually b:a:c except, of course, that this
syntax is illegal.

But n1:a and n1:good:a would be different.
