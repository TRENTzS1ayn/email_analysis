It is syntactically not possible to attach any type of qulifying text
string to an attribute other than a prefix which corresonds to a URI.
However all non-prefixed attributes are automatically 'qualified' by
their element.

See <http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114> section A.2.  I
had to read this section and related material many times to make sense
out of them.

The unprefixed "a" above is in the Per-Element-Type Partition
associated with the element "good" in the namespace http://www.w3.org.
Whether you consider "a" to be "qualified" by n1:good or "local" to it
or part of it's Per-Element-Type Partition is all the same.  And it is
different from n1:a which is in the Global Attribute Partition.

Unprefixed attributes are not associated with just a namespace.  They
are associated with an element which is in turn associated with a
namespace.

Well, it's not "directly" in any namespace.  It's in the
Per-Element-Type Partition of the element "a" in the HTML namespace.

No doubt debate is ended by a correct understanding of what Tim Bray
has said just as it is ended by a correct understanding of
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114 or a correct
understanding of the "Namespace Myths Exploded" material at xml.com.
The question is, what is "correct" understanding?

I'm not sure I understand this part of what you are saying but if your
understanding is that the treatment of unprefixed attributes is
fundamentally broken perhaps your understanding is incorrect.

Note that the Myths Exploded text keeps saying fuzzy handwaving things
like it doesn't really make much difference (which is why Appendix A
to the Namespaces document is not normative) because real applications
only handle non-prefixed attributes within the conext of the element
where they appear anyway.  In my mind it is just a difference in point
of view whether you consider such attributes to have no "qualifying
stuff" but to be used/operated on by their element, or you try to
induce a universal uniqueness by consdering them qualified by their
element name local part and their element's namespace if any.
