I like John's proposal of calculating the XPath expression identifying the
Signature element.

What I dislike about tweaking the URI syntax of the Reference element is
that we are only moving the XPath etc. expressions to an other location in
the syntax, not really proposing a new solution.

My "hack" when implementing the enveloped-signature and to work around ID
conflicts has been to generate a random string to use for a temporary
identifier attribute of the Signature element.
