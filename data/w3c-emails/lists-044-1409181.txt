It can't be just hint as long as our core signature validation rules state
that the DigestValue of an ObjectReference in SignedInfo must be validated.
Furthermore, we must have signatures that validate the DigestValue of an
ObjectReference because this is the actual data that the signer wanted to
sign.  Yes, we need to sign certain parts of SignedInfo for security
reasons, but this whole two step is irrelevant to the signer.  They want to
sign the bucket of bytes indicated by ObjectReference, and if core behavior
does not sign that bucket of bytes, then core behavior does not perform
digital signatures as they are defined in our industry.

> I _really_ think the last option is the right direction:
I agree. I strongly believe that the location is a hint at most, will rarely
be necessary (still waiting for objections here folks :-) and if the
location is kind of an "authenticated attribute" then it really belongs to
the data being signed.
