I have a somewhat similar feeling than Kevin, but on a
slightly higher level. Transforms in many cases are
defined by an input octet stream as a parameter, but
I think it's impossible to work with a model that limits
parameters to transforms to a fixed list. As an example,
many transforms need a character encoding ('charset')
as an input parameter, others may need other parameters.

If the model is written in a way that gives the impression
that the list of parameters is closed, and implementations
are built on that assumption, these implementations will
run into problems sooner or later.

So I would advise to: 1) Make clear that there can be
more parameters, depending on the transform. 2) For
the enveloped signature transform, make clear that
there is an additional parameter that identifies where
the signature is. It may not be necessary to define
a representation for this parameter, that may be left
to implementations.

In other words, tell people that something close to
a hack may be needed, but don't try to tell them how
to hack :-).

Regards,  Martin.
