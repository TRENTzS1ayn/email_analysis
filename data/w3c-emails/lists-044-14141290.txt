Hi John,

I agree with Petteri; your proposal to add the XPath expression calculation
to the processing model seems to be the first solution which need not be
described
as a hack.

Applause, Applause ;-)

I am completely with you regarding this issue. People which would like
to use enveloped signatures should utilize a XPath transform taking into
account the very special architecture of the regarding XML document. This
was the way of thinking most of us had (and I personally still have) until
the introduction of the enveloped signature transform.

To summarize my position:

1. Try to get rid of the enveloped signature transform and state that the
   XPath transfrom is required if people would like to deploy enveloped
   signatures.

2. If there are a lot of people who want to preserve the enveloped signature
   transform, then I would vote for your proposal to include the XPath
   expression computation in the processing model.

Regards, Gregor
