Now that's seriously ugly.

The policy decision went like this.  Given the following two things

  <html:a      href="foo"> 
  <html:a html:href="foo">

The namespace spec could have said

(a) these are always to be treated as identical
(b) these are always to be treated as distinct
(c) applications can make this decision

It went with (c).  Since the REC's publication, the majority of 
practitioners has grumbled experience teaches that we should have done 
(a).  Maybe this is correct; we didn't have that experience.  Frankly,
I can't remember anyone, during this debate, introducing the example

<html:a href="foo" html:href="bar">

and if they had, this might have driven the WG shrieking into the
arms of option (a).  

On the other hand, it should be noted that individual vocabularies
such as XHTML can specifically forbid practices such as that
given above.  And (I assume/hope) the schema machinery is also
powerful enough to make this distinction. -Tim
