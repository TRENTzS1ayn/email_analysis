while i accept that the XML-Sig spec cannot enforce these properties,
i suggest that some yet-to-be-defined XML layer will have to do so.
it's not sufficient for legislation and applications to take care of this,
because it's XML's richness that makes human-readable XML signatures
complicated.  i'm particularly concerned that application vendors, lacking
a higher-level "XML signed-doc't" specification that helps them navigate
these waters, will find secure but nonstandard ways to prepare signatures
for complicated XML documents.  then, those vendors and their customers
will get left out in the cold, when a higher-level signature standard for XML
becomes complete.

i'd be glad to see these sentences added to the spec.
