I did notice the initial wording that talked about only
having certificates "related" to the authentication public
key.  However, I still don't see why this change has anything
to do with moving from (a) multiple X509Data elements with a
single X509Certificate to (b) a single X509Data element with
multiple X509Certificate elements.

It seems that the coin flip went with (a) initially.  I don't
see why the change that you mentioned pushes us closer to (b)...

I would say because the spec was being interpreted to prohibit having
any cert in KeyInfo except ones with the signature verifying public
key in them and requireing the use of RetrievalMethod to indicate
any other related certs.
