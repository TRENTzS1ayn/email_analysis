DANGER, DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! This is exactly the attitude that got 
X.509/PKIX into the sorry state it is in today. If you want 
interoperability between signature creators and validators, you MUST 
prevent any ambiguity about how to interpret abominations like the 
above.

Then why even continue with this work? IETF work is meant to assure 
interoperability, not just "look, we came up with another format for 
an interesting type of data". This WG has the opportunity to make XML 
digsigs very useful, but if you can't even get them more 
interoperable than those in CMS or even PGP, they won't be very 
popular, which would be sad. (I say this as someone who holds his 
nose when I need to wade through ASN.1 but just wince when I have to 
use XML.)
