As canonicalizing the SignedInfo element or serializing the
result of enveloped-siganture transform and URI="#ID", I guess
an element is serialized with xml: prefixed attributes in its
ancestors because these cases are *subsets* of a document.  But
I don't know whether comment nodes are serialized or not because
these subsets are not defined as XPath expressions.
