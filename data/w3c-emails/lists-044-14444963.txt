I don't think any XML software I'm familiary with would generate the
above from the schema/DTD we have.  The URI attribute is a local
attribute of the Reference element and to prefix it with a namespace
is is really an error.

XML Digital Signatures are sigantures using XML syntax which can sign
anything.  We can fix most things for XML Digital Signatures by
constraining / defining its syntax and processing.  But we can't fix
the whole XML world.  I've never seen any XML appliciation that
defines what to do when you have duplicate local attribute names on an
element distnguished by prefix.  This lack is what I was talking about
above and actually has little to do with the interoperability of XML
Digital Signatures themselves, which we get to define.

Well, I don't really know just how much real world interoperability
there will be.  If people use lots of complex/proprietary algorithms
(including transforms and canonicalization as well as crypto), there
may be hardly any.

While the design of XML is perfectly understandable, given its
origins, it is pretty signatgure unfriendly.
