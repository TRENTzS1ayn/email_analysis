I don't recall there being any discussion of Merlin's comments on
RetrievalMethod below.  The main change suggested is to drop the
Method element as it is inherent in the Location URI.  Also, as far as
I know, we have decided to make fields which are always URIs be
attributes and have algorithms be elements with an Algorithm
attribute...  This leads to the following as the most consistent with
the rest of our syntax:

<RetrievalMethod Location="http://..." Type="foo#x509-certificate">
<Encoding Algorithm="bar#base64">
<possible-encoding-parameter>...</p.-e.-p.>
</Encoding>
</RetrievalMethod>

On the other hand, the minimum change would be to simply amend the
current definition by dropping the Method element.

How much implementation is there of RetrievalMethod at this point?
I.E., how much pain is involved in the larger change?

Thanks,
Donald
