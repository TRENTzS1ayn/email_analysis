     Don:

     In view of your response to my later clarification, I hope you
understand that I am NOT primarily concerned about whether a bag of
certificates is represented as multiple elements within an X509Data or
multiple X509Data's within a KeyInfo.  I just want the example to
illustrate that the most common use of a bag of certs is one or more
chains.  I suppose I'll need to change my existing example, which has each
element of the chain as a separate X509Data, though  (see my earlier
posting
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2000JulSep/0198.html).

It says in the Syntax and Processing document "Multiple declarations
within KeyInfo refer to the same key."  An X509Data element is a
declaration within a KeyInfo element.  The conensus is that other
certificates than ones actualy containing a key don't "refer to" that
key.  Thus the minor change of putting multiple certificates from a
bag in an X509Data rather than one certificate each in multiple
X509Data's.  All the groups involved in current interoperability
testing seem to think this minor change is fine.

I'm sorry if you guys don't think the above is sufficient motivation
for this minor change.  Most people seem to think it is.  And since
you seem to agree that it is not a big deal, unless some consensus
materializes to change it again, it will stay multiple certificates
per X509Data element in this document.

(And if the current consensus for multiple certificates per X509Data
element disolves into anarchy, the entire section will be pulled from
this document and there will be no standard in this area for some time
until a hypothetical additional document gets written and approved.  I
believe this would damange interoperabiiity.)
