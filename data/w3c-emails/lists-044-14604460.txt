I guess I wasn't clear below (although I think the element
declaration is).  Any of the first three triplet can be
included, but only one of each.

The CRL issue is interesting though.  I have to admit that I have
not thought about the best way to include the CRL.  However, I do
think that the other parts of the element declaration below make
sense...
