This is a reminder that we are still planning an informal meeting to
discuss requirements and a couple of early proposals (Simon/LaMacchia
and IBM) that have been made for XML Encryption. The meeting will be
immediately after Crypto 2000, UCSB Campus, Anacapa Hall Formal Lounge,
Thursday, 8/24, 1:30 PM. If you're interested in working on XML
encryption and can be there, please join us!  

We will publish the minutes to these lists.  Note also that this is not
a W3C activity, but rather a first face-to-face discussion prior to the
start of a formal working group.
