There are definitely things that fall in this category, in particular
in the area of localization. For example you can say that you want
some items sorted, and can indicate that the sort order should
be according to e.g. Swedish practices, but you are not guaranteed
that your processor knows Swedish sorting, nor are you sure that
all processors do exactly the same for Swedish even if they know it.

This is I guess quite a bit away from your main problem.
