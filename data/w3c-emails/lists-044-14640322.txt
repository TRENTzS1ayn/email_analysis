Hi Martin and Ed,

Actually, Martin, I do think DSig has some responsibility to document I18N
limitations of this transform, so we could really use your help on that.

However, I was more concerned with generic stuff like the fact that when I
set my XSLT processor to output text/html, it tends to rewrite some stuff on
me like line breaks and non-minimal minimalized attributes.  I don't
'serialize the result tree' tree directly as Ed recommends.

So, I'm fishing for some kind of statement that when an XSLT processor is
set to output text/xml, that these funny rewrite rules aren't applied to my
output.

As long as that's true, then a c14n transform after the XSLT should clean up
the mess; I just want some additional assurance as we approach CR that we
aren't messing this up. (And, again, thanks for your patience, Ed).

Sincerely,

There are definitely things that fall in this category, in particular
in the area of localization. For example you can say that you want
some items sorted, and can indicate that the sort order should
be according to e.g. Swedish practices, but you are not guaranteed
that your processor knows Swedish sorting, nor are you sure that
all processors do exactly the same for Swedish even if they know it.

This is I guess quite a bit away from your main problem.

Regards,   Martin.
