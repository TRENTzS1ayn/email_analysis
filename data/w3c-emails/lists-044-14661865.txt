The consensus of those on the conference call yesterday was to try to
re-use as much exiting mechanism as possible.  So what we came up with
was

<RetrievalMethod URI="...", Type="*1">
(Transforms)?
</RetrievalMethod>

that is, the syntax is the same as Reference.  *1 values for Type would
be as in 4.3.3 except that in the "http://www.w3.org/2000/07/xmldsig#*2",
*2 would be an element from KeyInfo other than RetrievalMethod.

See other comment below.

Thanks,
Donald

If the inability to do an HTTP POST is a problem here, which I'm not
sure it is in a practical sense, then wouldn't we need to generalize
Reference also?  And no internal structure menas giving up on
interoperability.
