Ok.

The problem is only for a reference to the signature itself.
So, how about adding another Reference element?
For instance,

<!ELEMENT SelfReference (Transforms?, DigestMethod, DigestValue)>
  <!-- The same content as Reference -->
<!ATTLIST SelfReference  
          OmitSignature (all|this) #IMPLIED
          XPath  CDATA #IMPLIED
          Id     ID    #IMPLIED
          Type   CDATA #IMPLIED >

- Remove enveloped-signature transofrm
- here() is available only in XPath attribute, and removed from XPath transform.
- Reference is not changed.

(I guess this is an incomplete proposal)
