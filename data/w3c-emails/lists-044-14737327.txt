Hi Kent,

The problem with here() has been fixed in the new transform processing
model, to be posted shortly (stay tuned!).

Ok.

The problem is only for a reference to the signature itself.
So, how about adding another Reference element?
For instance,

<!ELEMENT SelfReference (Transforms?, DigestMethod, DigestValue)>
  <!-- The same content as Reference -->
<!ATTLIST SelfReference
          OmitSignature (all|this) #IMPLIED
          XPath  CDATA #IMPLIED
          Id     ID    #IMPLIED
          Type   CDATA #IMPLIED >

- Remove enveloped-signature transofrm
- here() is available only in XPath attribute, and removed from XPath
transform.
- Reference is not changed.

(I guess this is an incomplete proposal)
