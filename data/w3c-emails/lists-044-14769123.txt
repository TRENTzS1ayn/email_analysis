[0] in respond to [1,2]. It isn't supposed to imply BOM is useful, just that
it isn't done, there might be a better way to do this.

Ok, I sprinkled two :
UTF-8 /+ (without a byte ordering mark (BOM)) +/
into the Signature spec (6.5.1:minimal C14N) and (7.0: XML Canonicalization
and Syntax Constraint Considerations) but it obvioulsy needs to go in
xml-c14n.

"Adding a sentence saying that the UTF-8 produced does not start
with a BOM may be a good idea for a clarification." 
[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2000JulSep/0045.html
"We should use the name 'UTF-8' in the specification but I hope adding short
note about no-BOM to the specification."
