     Why do we warn people about BOM but not about surrogates, anyway?  One
is no more appropriate than the other in canonicalized UTF-8.

[0] in respond to [1,2]. It isn't supposed to imply BOM is useful, just
that
it isn't done, there might be a better way to do this.

Ok, I sprinkled two :
UTF-8 /+ (without a byte ordering mark (BOM)) +/
into the Signature spec (6.5.1:minimal C14N) and (7.0: XML Canonicalization
and Syntax Constraint Considerations) but it obvioulsy needs to go in
xml-c14n.

"Adding a sentence saying that the UTF-8 produced does not start
with a BOM may be a good idea for a clarification."

"We should use the name 'UTF-8' in the specification but I hope adding
short
note about no-BOM to the specification."
