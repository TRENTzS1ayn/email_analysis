Hi all!

Maybe this question is kind of philosophical, but does anybody of
you know why the term "Canonicalization" is written as it is?

Recently I tried to find out, what it means to produce a canonical
form of something: 

According to the Merriam-Webster Englisch Dictionary [1] the only 
explanation which fits is:

  to canonize: to treat as illustrious, preeminent

This makes sense, since the canonical form of an XML-Document is
a prominent form of many representaions for the logical XML structure.

But the noun for the process of canonizing something is:

  canonization

However, I could not find "canonicalization" or "canonicalize" in any
dictionary I have access to.
