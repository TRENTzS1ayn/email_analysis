I personally had been (wrongly) thinking that XPointers always appear in 
attribute values, but of course there's no constraint that they do 
so...  So your questions are good ones.  I've copied the 
www-xml-linking-comments list in order to record this in our archive, and 
Daniel Veillard in order to ask him to add it to the issues list.
