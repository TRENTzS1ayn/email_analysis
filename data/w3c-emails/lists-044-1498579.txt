That is not at all what I am proposing.  I think it is just fine to sign
something that is not a manifest and is not in the current document.  What I
am stating is that if the application does not want the behavior that we
automatically go and try to verify what is being signed, then it goes in a
manifest.  If you want to have the core code automatically very what is
being signed, it can be in the SignerInfo object.  The locality of the data
is unimportant.
