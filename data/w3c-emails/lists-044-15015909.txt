No. You have to keep the comment about the BOM, because both
with and without a bom is legal UTF-8.

You better remove the comment about surrogates, because encoding
individual surrogates in UTF-8 is illegal. There are other things
that are illegal and still are sometimes done (e.g. using more
than the necessary number of bytes), and if we wanted to list
all of them, we would write another RFC for UTF-8, I guess.
