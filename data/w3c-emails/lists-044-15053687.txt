Hi Martin,

At the last teleconference, Joseph decided we would leave it as is (comment
about BOM but not surrogates) because there was not consensus to change it
either way.

Although I am still not convinced of its necessity, I really don't mind one
way or the other, and will most likely be adding the BOM comment to the next
C14N draft just because it doesn't seem to hurt anything.

Could you point me to some source I can cite which implies that a BOM at the
front of UTF-8 is actually legal UTF-8? (e.g. an URL to ISO 10646 Annex R,
and a paragraph would help).  I ask because, according to RFC2279, a BOM
does not legally decode into a UCS character, so a conformant implementation
would seemingly never generate a BOM, and it would throw an exception if
asked to decode one.  This is why I believe, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, that the BOM comment is superfluous (but also why I don't
think it hurts to keep it).

On your last point about using too many bytes, are you referring to cases
such as having the eleven x bits of a two byte sequence containing something
less than 80 (e.g. C0 80 in place of 00)?  That type of error came across
pretty clearly in RFC2279, so I don't think another RFC would be necessary,
but are there other cases that don't come across in RFC2279?

Thanks,

No. You have to keep the comment about the BOM, because both
with and without a bom is legal UTF-8.

You better remove the comment about surrogates, because encoding
individual surrogates in UTF-8 is illegal. There are other things
that are illegal and still are sometimes done (e.g. using more
than the necessary number of bytes), and if we wanted to list
all of them, we would write another RFC for UTF-8, I guess.
