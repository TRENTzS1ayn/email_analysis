Ok. Fixed.

Right. This isn't really a mistake as much as a best effort since the DTD is
limited (and I didn't want to create too many entities) and the schema
permits specificity and I know it wouldn't make sense just to throw a naked
signature in SignatureProperties... I could create a SignatureProperties.ANY
that was #PCDATA only, I could make the schema definition ##any, or leave it
as is. What's your preference?
