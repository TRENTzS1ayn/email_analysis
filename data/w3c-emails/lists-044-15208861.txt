Hello all,

I just finished the modifications to the c14n document to make it compatible
with our new processing model.  There are no changes to what c14n must
generate (though my next email will ask if we want a tweak).

Anyway, I noticed that as a result of our new processing model,
responsibility for non node-set results of XPaths shifts back to the XPath
transform from the c14n document.  The last editors copy I posted did not
reflect this.  The change will be trivial, but I thought I'd post a heads up
that the document will be tweaked.

Thanks,

     John Boyer
