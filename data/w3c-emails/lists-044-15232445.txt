Hello,

The issue with whitespace in XML element content has been very briefly
discussed during interop testing. I would like raise this issue on the list,
as I believe many people expect insignificant whitespace to be cleaned up by
the C14N algorithms.

The current specification provides no way for an application to skip or
cleanup insignificant whitespace from a signed XML document before
digesting. However, 'insignificant' comment elements are skipped by the
default C14N algorithm! 

I think we could make use of a transformation algorithm that cleans up
insignificant whitespace, the algorithm should obviously detect xml:space
attributes.

Petteri
