The schema declaration is fine. It expresses what we want, namely that
anything is allowed except structures from the dsig namespace.

None of the possible solutions for the DTD corresponds with this intention;
I think the less ill one would be to declare SignatureProperty #PCDATA only,
since it does not contradict the schema definition so obvious as the
current content model ;-)
