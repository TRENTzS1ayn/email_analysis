I don't know that I agree with this statement, but it's not that important.
Verifying that a manifest is correct does not validate any large amount of
data.

<John>
Are you saying that it's not that important that we sign the actual data
that a person using a private key actually wanted to sign???

I disagree with this statement.  I believe that the if and only if statement
is wrong, and everything following from that is therefore also incorrect.

<John>
It doesn't help to disagree without giving reasons.
The if and only if statement is not wrong.  The core rules sign the
Location; how can you move the object to a different location without
breaking the signature???
