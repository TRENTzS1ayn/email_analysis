The reason that I added this as a MAY is because many toolkits
automatically pre-pend that OID in an RSA signature.

Hi all,

I agree with Merlin, providing the option to wrap the RSA signature
octets
into
a ASN.1 structure, however it looks like

  * has no benefits ,
  * adds options which result in a more complicated verification
process,
  * is confusing (I had to read the text in 6.4.2 some times to get it).

Therefore I also vote to kick this option out.

Regards, Gregor
