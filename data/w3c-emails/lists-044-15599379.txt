Actually there is an advantage, consider that there is more than one
PKCS#1 version. The OID describes the specific packing format.
 
The verifier MUST understand the OID in order to correctly verify the
signature in any case - the OID is embedded in the packing format to
prevent a digest substitution attack. The OID in the message MAY occur
in different octet positions depending on the packing format. It is
useful to know in advance where the inner OID is positioned in order to
correctly validate the signature.

The reason that I added this as a MAY is because many toolkits
automatically pre-pend that OID in an RSA signature.

Hi all, 

I agree with Merlin, providing the option to wrap the RSA signature
octets 
into 
a ASN.1 structure, however it looks like 

  * has no benefits , 
  * adds options which result in a more complicated verification
process, 
  * is confusing (I had to read the text in 6.4.2 some times to get it).


Therefore I also vote to kick this option out. 

Regards, Gregor
