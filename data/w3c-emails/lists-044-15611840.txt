Hi,

Can we first clarify what the sentence actually means?
 
1) The signature may be either an encrypted ASN.1 blob (PKCS#1)
or an encrypted raw digest (like W?TLS)
  or
2) The signature is always an encrypted ASN.1 blob (PKCS#1) but
it may be wrapped/prepended/... by an ASN.1 OID.

The latter imposes some unnecessary knowledge of ASN.1 upon
the XMLDSIG toolit, and it is still not clear what encoding
is suggested. The former is a legitimate choice that we should
make in the standard. We have to make a choice because it may
fundamentally affect how crypto toolkits are invoked,
particularly where hardware is concerned.
