Yes and No.  I agree that it is important to sign the data, however signing
a digest of the data, and thus signing the original data indirectly, is not
a problem.  If you look at CMS, given that most people include authenticated
attribute, you never actually sign the data.  You sign the digest of the
data and the authenticated attributes.

As my previous mail has stated.  Location is a hint for where the document
is.  It is not the be-all and end-all for locating the document.  If the
application wants to enforce that this is the only location -- that is fine.
If the application wants to say that the data is someplace else -- that is
fine.  The fact that you update the document at a URL location will not
allow you to repudiate the fact that you signed the document.  I can cache
the document locally and take that copy into court when attempting to
enforce your signature.
