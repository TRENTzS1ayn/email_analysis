Oppose raw enrypted digests?
Oh yes, don't even think about it. If you do I'll 
have the folk from the other end of your corridor have a 
go at you. There is a specific known attack - and not a 
particularly computationaly intensive one.

What goes on INSIDE the signature is not something you want 
to get involved with here. That is for the cryptographers.


What we are debating is the structure of the wrapper.

While Merlin's suggestion of raw ASN.1 blobs that are tagged
and bagged via XML may sound as if it avoids ASN.1ery I think
it actually does the opposite. It means that the XML world
has to actually CARE about the ASN.1 blobs and manage them
- AND CODE FOR THEM!


Thinking ahead, I would much rather that we don't link the
ASN.1 and XML namespaces as suggested. Having one namespace 
recapitulate information in another is rarely a good idea.
Not only can it lead to inconsistencies it leads to admin
nightmares.

The situation I want to avoid is working on a layered 
standard where I have to go off to IANA to get an OID cut
for some PKIX related infrastructure and then go to W3C to 
get a URI cut. Particularly if IANA might require me to have
the W3C URI before they will hand out my OID.

There is potentially a multi-step synchronisation here that
I am anxious to avoid.

1) The signature may be either an encrypted ASN.1 blob (PKCS#1)
or an encrypted raw digest (like W?TLS)
