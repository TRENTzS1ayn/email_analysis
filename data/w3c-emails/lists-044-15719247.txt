Oops, yes, sorry I didn't mean to represent you advocated that. For some
reason I have trouble with formers and latters -- with left and right there

1) The signature may be either an encrypted ASN.1 blob (PKCS#1)
or an encrypted raw digest (like W?TLS)
  or
2) The signature is always an encrypted ASN.1 blob (PKCS#1) but
it may be wrapped/prepended/... by an ASN.1 OID.
