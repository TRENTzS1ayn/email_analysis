Ok, placed in Editors' copy.

Ok, I tried to work this in with Merlin's correction, and created new namespaces for KeyInfo element types, however, is the Type supposed to be mandatory? (See previous message).

What's the action item on answering this question?

My action item was to determine if a schema validator would choke on a qualified attribute if we said in fact there is an unqualified attribute (or what happens if a qualified and unqualified version are both present?). As I suspect, a qualified attribute would be schema invalid: in [1] the Id attribute on the Signature is schema valid [2]. The qualified dsig:ID attribute in [3] is schema invalid [4]. Consequently, I don't think there is any argument for us to change our unqualified attributes, it makes the XPath expressions a bit shorter too.
