Hi Jim,

Yes and No.  I agree that it is important to sign the data, however signing
a digest of the data, and thus signing the original data indirectly, is not
a problem.  If you look at CMS, given that most people include authenticated
attribute, you never actually sign the data.  You sign the digest of the
data and the authenticated attributes.

<John>
Yikes! Validating the digest of a resource is not enough.  If the resource
changes, the signature should break.

As my previous mail has stated.  Location is a hint for where the document
is.  It is not the be-all and end-all for locating the document.  If the
application wants to enforce that this is the only location -- that is fine.
If the application wants to say that the data is someplace else -- that is
fine.  The fact that you update the document at a URL location will not
allow you to repudiate the fact that you signed the document.  I can cache
the document locally and take that copy into court when attempting to
enforce your signature.

<John>
It's not a hint right now!  How is core behavior, independent of
application-specific behavior, going to validate a given signature if it
does not know how to dereference a location.  It cannot depend on
application specific caching mechanisms.
