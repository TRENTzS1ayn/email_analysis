I don't think that DNS makes a difference. Consider the
case in which you have DNSSEC (or equivalent) and so
you have a trusted binding to the IP address and you also
run IPSEC keying off an a DNSSEC secured key.

It still makes sense to follow the redirect since
you are being told authoritatively to 'go somewhere
else'.

Brians point may have been that the spec needs to
make the intention clear on this point.


The digest does not make a difference in practice
since the relying party has to decide whether to
trust the key, not the document signer. Thus the
validation information may well be different for
different relying parties. (Have a look at the
Federal Bridge CA for examples :-)
