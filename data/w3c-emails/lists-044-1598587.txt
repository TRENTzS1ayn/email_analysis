        http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/WD-xmldsig-core-19991117.html
now includes a link to:
        http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core-schema-19991117.xml
which is well formed and valid for:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xmlschema-1-19991105/structures.dtd
according to:
        http://www.stg.brown.edu/cgi-bin/xmlvalid/xmlvalid.pl
        http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/xml-check.html

went off to validate it at the other sites.) If you see the problem, please
let me know.
