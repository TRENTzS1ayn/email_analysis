I think it's Last Called but not positive, I haven't given any thought as to 
if/how this might affect us with respect to processing the octects returned 
via dereferencing a URI.

Abstract

    This document standardizes five new media types -- text/xml,
    application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --
    for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the
    Extensible Markup Language (XML). This document also standardizes a
    convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside
    of these five types when those media types represent XML entities.
    XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via the HyperText Transfer
    Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integral part of the WebDAV
    protocol for remote web authoring, and are expected to have utility
    in many domains.

    Major differences from RFC 2376 are (1) the addition of
    text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd, (2)
    the '+xml' suffix convention (which also updates the RFC 2048
    registration process), and (3) the discussion of "utf-16le" and
    "utf-16be".
