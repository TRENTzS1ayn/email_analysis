Hi all,

My understanding was that transforms were required to include all parameters
in elements, so mixed content of the Transform element is not required.

It used to be required because we were just including whatever data was
necessary (XSLT or an XPath expression), so I think the MIXED setting is
legacy.

However, I think the idea behind transforms is that they be extensible in
the future.  In the past, Ed pointed out that ANY means any element defined
in the DTD.  However, if you omit the Transform <!ELEMENT declaration, I
think you can put whatever you want inside it with a maximum of a warning
from validating processors.  I believe we could still include the <!ATTLIST
without trouble.

My preference is for element only as well for Transforms. Does anyone oppose
this. Ed/John, is the mixed content for Transforms even relevant to the
types of transforms we'd expect people to write now?
