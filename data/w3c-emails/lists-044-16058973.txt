I agree with element-only, because of the following:

- Mixed allows in most cases much more than you actually want
   (mixed in XML can be controlled much less than in SGML)
- Mixed is typically used for document text; transforms have
   clearly defined parameters (if not, something is wrong).
- If there should be a case where using mixed for a transform
   is an alternative worth to consider, it's usually very easy
   to create a corresponding element-only model by adding one
   or a few more elements.


Regards,   Martin.
