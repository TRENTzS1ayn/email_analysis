Hi Folks,
    I am working with a group that is using DOMHASH as their
canonicalization method for XML Dsig.

What I wanted to find out was:
- Are other groups trying to use DOMHASH with XML DSig
- Are there strong feelings in this group about the advisability of
doing so?
- If DOMHASH is used as the canonicalization method, does that
mean that you sign the hash generated by DOMHASH or do you ask
DOMHASH to give you a canonical representation of the document
and then sign that?


Any help will be very appreciated.
Regards,
Ambarish
