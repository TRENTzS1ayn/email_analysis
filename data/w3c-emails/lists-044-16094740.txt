We (TC TustCenter) were considering it. We decided not to use it for now
mainly for interoperability reasons. It seems to us that XML
implementations must know some sort of C14N anyway, and that it's not so
likely that others have DOMHASH implemented. In addition it is not clear to
us what reference should be used to mark DOMHASH
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2803.txt?) so that other implementations
recognize it... .

I'm interested in this too.

Would it be possible to use it as a DigestMethod in a Reference? I would
assume yes.

I would be surprised if not, since processing of each Node requires at
least converting the node name to UTF-16BE, and for Element nodes you need
to sort all children by name and separately hash all sub nodes... .
