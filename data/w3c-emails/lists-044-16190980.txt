We still have to deal with the mandatorines of that attribute. That means 
people HAVE to come up with a type. Is this intended? We only specify a 
subset of key types. Consequently people will come up with other types (that 
is fine) or throw dummy text in there which seems like a bad thing if they 
want to rely upon type information found elsewhere.
