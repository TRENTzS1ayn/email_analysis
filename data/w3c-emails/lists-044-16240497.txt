Based on the summary of options provided by Merlin [1] it is presently clear 
that 2 OR 4 (everyone seems to agree supporting both is not good) are the 
preferred methods. My present tally is as follows:

2) B64 (C(P(ASN1(D(data))))) (PKCS#1 wrapped digest)
a. Merlin Hugues
b. Mark Bartel

4) B64 (OID . C(P(ASN1(D(data)))))
a. Philip Hallam-Baker

If you have an opinion on this matter (or need to correct the above tally), 
please make it known by close of business (eastern time) Monday.
