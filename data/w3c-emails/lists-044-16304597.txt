John Boyer has provided a new version of the Canonical XML specification 
[2], as well as a document capturing the resolution of Last Call Issues [1]. 
We are awaiting some feedback from implementors (do the examples work?) and 
last call commentators (are the issues satisfactorily resolved?) but 
otherwise expect to request Candidate REC status within a few weeks.

Status of this document

    This is the fourth draft of this (XPath based) Canonical XML
    specification and it addresses all issues raised during the [17]second
    Last Call which ended July 28, 2000. While this specification attempts
    to capture the resolution of all issues, the list and disposition of
    last call issues itself is[18] a living document maintained by the
    [19]XML Signature Working Group. The Working Group expects to finish
    the documentation on all issues within a week and then request that
    the Director advance the document to Candidate Recommendation

    This specification includes editorial and technical clarifications and
    corrections suggested by last call reviewers. Additionally, this
    version also includes examples as well as two substantive differences
    from the previous version:
     1. The only change to the canonicalized output is the reduction of
        redundant namespace declarations (see section 4.6: [20]Superfluous
        Namespace Declarations).
     2. The processing model is changed with respect to the input
        expectations. Instead of an XPath expression, the canonical
        process expects an XPath node-set (or functional alternative such
        as octets that represent a well-formed XML instance).

    The [21]XML Core Working Group, which published the first Last Call
    [22][C14N-20000119], has delegated the completion of the Canonical XML
    specification to the IETF/W3C [23]XML Signature Working Group
    [[24]list archives].
