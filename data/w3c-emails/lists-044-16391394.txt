Forwarded Text ----
>W3C is pleased to announce the advancement of the XML Base
>specification to Candidate Recommendation status.
>
>     XML Base Version 1.0
>     8 September 2000
>     Editor: Jonathan Marsh <jmarsh@microsoft.com>
>
>     http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xmlbase-20000908/
>
> >From the Abstract:
>
>   This document proposes a facility, similar to that of HTML
>   BASE, for defining base URIs for parts of XML documents.
>
> >From Status of this Document:
>
>   This document is a Candidate Recommendation of the World Wide
>   Web Consortium. (For background on this work, please see the
>   XML Activity Statement.) This specification is considered stable
>   by the XML Linking Working Group.
>
>   The Working Group invites implementation feedback during this
>   period. Comments on this document should be sent to the public
>   mailing list www-xml-linking-comments@w3.org (archive) by
>   8 December 2000.
>
>   A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical
>   documents can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR.
>
>Results of Last Call:
>
>   In most cases, the WG followed the Last Call comments; where
>   disagreement remained, the author of the comment has been
>   contacted. There is, however, one significant unilateral decision
>   remaining after this phase:
>
>   Martin Duerst is not satified with our resolution on
>   the way XML Base scopes into external entities. This issue
>   was discussed by both parties without reaching an agreement,
>   and is recorded at:
>   http://www.w3.org/XML/2000/08/xmlbase-comments-20000810#IDA34UP
>
>   The publication is in response to the Working Group
>   Co-Chair's request, archived in W3C member space at:
>
>   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2000JulSep/0097.html
>
>   The Candidate Recommendation period closes on 8 December 2000.
>
>Deliverables for the Candidate Recommendation period:
>
>   There is currently no specific implementation of XML Base
>   since the deployment strategy of this specification is by
>   normative references from new specifications. Currently
>   the XML Linking Language does such a reference, implying
>   that XLink and SVG (which references XLink) are known
>   candidates for XML Base implementation reports. The XML
>   Information Set has been extended to support XML Base.
>
>        - XML Linking Language (XLink) 1.0
>          W3C Candidate Recommendation 3 July 2000
>          http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/
>        - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0
>          W3C Candidate Recommendation 2 August 2000
>          http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/
>        - XML Information Set
>          W3C Working Draft 26 July 2000
>          http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset
>
>   It is expected that at the end of the Candidate
>   Recommendation period, the Working group will deliver:
>
>         - proof of sucessful reuse of XML Base construct in
>        new specifications
>         - a report of successful XML Base implementations in
>        applications using those specifications.
>
>   Implementors are invited to contact the Working Group
>   chairs to participate in the final report.
