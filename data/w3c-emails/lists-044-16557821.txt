On behalf of the XML Plenary chairs
(one of whom recently had his laptop stolen)...

We are decided:

"3. Conclusions

By a large margin, the XML Plenary endorses the proposal
given below.
[...]

4.2 Proposal 

Proposed: to deprecate the use of relative URI references
in namespace declarations; that is: to say that while they
conform to the Namespace Recommendation of January
1999, later specifications such as DOM, XPath, etc. will
define no interpretation for them. "
