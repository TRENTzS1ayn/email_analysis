     It is my view, like Phill's, that there is no need to include the
digest algorithm outside the actual signature value for original RSA
signatures (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, or RFC 2313 compliant).  It is also my view,
however, that RSASSA-PSS signatures MUST have the digest algorithm included
independently, because the MGF functions require knowledge of which hash
algorithm is in use.
