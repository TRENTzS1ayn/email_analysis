No, if you follow the recommendation of the plenary (which I think you should
do), then the right way is to say that relative URI's behaviour is undefined,
and that they therefore should not be used for signatures. C14N applications
may/should/must issue a warning when they find one of these when the are
used to prepare for signing.
