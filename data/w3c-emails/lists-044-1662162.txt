We are allowing the signed object to be internal or external to a document.  Are
you disagreeing with this?  Should the object always be imbedded in the
<Signature> element?  If not, don't you have to locate it?  What if the signed
object isn't XML and isn't embedded?  Are you assuming we go for the object
first instead of the XML document that refers to it?  Are you trying to enforce
this approach?  Are you accounting for huge complex multi-departmental data
storage or reference sites?

I could envision applications where documents talk about other remote documents,
or at least we should allow for it.  Suppose I make a statement that "The
document at www.xxx.com/PG is suitable reading for children".  I could just sign
that statement and be done with it, but then I start worrying that a hacker
might go to that site and change it to pornographic content.  To make sure, I
could sign the document and say "I assure that the document at www.xxx.com/PG is
suitable reading for children if it can be authenticated with this (my)
signature" (the document hasn't changed since I read it).

Thanks,
Rich
