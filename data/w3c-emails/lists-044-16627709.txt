The decision of the plenary at:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xppa

concludes:

  new specifications prepared by W3C Working Groups include statements
  similar to the following:

    This specification does not define an information set
    [or whatever] for XML documents which use relative URIs
    in namespace declarations."

  or

     The scope of this specification includes all well-formed
     XML documents which use only absolute URI references in
     namespace declarations. Documents which use relative
     URI references are out of scope, and not addressed by
     this specification.

   or words to similar effect.

If you follow this, then you would simply say that you spec does not
apply to XML documents including relative namespace declarations, just
as it does not apply to ill-formed XML documents, nor to documents not
conforming to the Namespaces Rec.  If you do this, you don't need to
wait for any XPath errata.

Having C14N define the behaviour of namespace URIs is not inconsistent
with XPath (per the proposed errata), but is most definitely
inconsistent with the XML Plenary decision.
