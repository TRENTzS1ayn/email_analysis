The Last Call comments [1] that I sent you all appear to be resolved 
in the latest Working Draft [2] except for one typo and one comment 
that is expanded below. Thank you. I will try to read the CR in 
entirety when it is ready.

(your number 6)
2.4 par. 3
NOTE:XML
needs a space -> NOTE: XML

 From clause 4.1:
"...When canonicalization of a new version of XML is
     required, this specification could be updated to include
     the XML declaration as presumably the absence of the XML
     declaration from the XPath data model can be remedied by
     that time (e.g. by reissuing a new XPath based on the
     InfoSet data model)."

This sentence could be taken as speculation and might appear to speak 
for other editors or Working Groups. Probably, I would cut most, if 
not all, of the sentence, perhaps simply:

     When canonicalization of a new version of XML is
     required, this specification could be updated to include
     the XML declaration.

(your number 8)
 From clause 4.4:
"...an argument similar to this can be leveled against the
     XML canonicalization method..."

Not sure that a specification is the place to make arguments about 
other specifications. Perhaps the theorems in clause 4.4 could be cut 
in the CR.
