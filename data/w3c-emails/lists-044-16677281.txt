Hi Martin,

I am personally OK with this approach, but I wonder how many existing
documents it will rule out signing.

For example, unless I'm misreading rfc2396, <e xmlns="string"/> is now
deprecated.  It seems ludicrous that I cannot sign well-formed document.  It
is as if it is not well-formed, which contradicts the plenary's own
intentions.

I think instead that we should focus on the intent of the plenary as
manifested in Answer 4 of [1], which indicates that we should be calling
these things namespace *names*, not namespace URIs.  We want conformant
software to retain the original namespace name; we don't care about URIs.

No, if you follow the recommendation of the plenary (which I think you
should
do), then the right way is to say that relative URI's behaviour is
undefined,
and that they therefore should not be used for signatures. C14N applications
may/should/must issue a warning when they find one of these when the are
used to prepare for signing.
