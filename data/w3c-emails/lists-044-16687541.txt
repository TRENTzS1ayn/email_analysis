Is it acceptable from someone not on the committee (e.g. me) to lurk
at a DSIG face to face meeting?  I'd like to meet some of you people
and get a feel for the process, both the specification refinement and
the interoperability testing.

Is there a schedule of meetings with locations.  I didn't see one on
the web site.
