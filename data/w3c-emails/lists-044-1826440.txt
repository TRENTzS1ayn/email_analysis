My apologies for the mix up today.  I had scheduled calls through IETF
because I thought we might change the schedule at the WG meeting at the
Washington IETF.  When I belatedly scheduled a new series of calls, I used
the wrong time of time.  When I fixed it around noon today, this caused the
international number to change although the 888 number and passcode
remained te same...

There is no call next week but calls are currently scheduled for Dec. 2, 9,
and 16.  I'll double check earlier next time and try to avoid this problem.

Thanks,
Donald
