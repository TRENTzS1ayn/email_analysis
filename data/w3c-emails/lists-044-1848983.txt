I believe there are two other "orthogonal" assertions:

1. There is a set of documents that when processed via the specified chain
of transforms will yield DigestContent. 
2. At some point in time, the document obtained by dereferencing the URI was
a member of that set.

One does not need to "confirm" either of these assetions to have a valid
signature.
