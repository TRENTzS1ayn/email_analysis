I'd like to design a signature module that doesn't need to know
anything on how to retrieve documents out from a generic location. Not
assuming there only will be http: or one or two more, I would probably have
a retrieval-module that knows how to handle these things. I wouldn't
consider this module not to be application specific but enviroment-specific.
It would know where to look - and it might even look it up in the original
location if required.

Nice example. It nicely proves that using an URL for long-term
referencing a document that can change is not a good idea in the first
place.

http://www.CompanyA.com/documentD
If both companies had used from the beginning:
http://www.companyA.com/documentD.MMDDYYYY
the whole problem is nonexistent. If you use the location as a
location, what would it buy you in your example? The signature still breaks
and you still have no solution to solve the problem....

Still, location as a hint does not hurt here and the only real fix I
see is to properly use URL's.
