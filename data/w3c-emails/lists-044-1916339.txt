In the solution I'm proposing, those who expect Location to
move would omit Location from the SignedInfo message so that it can be
changed without breaking the signature.

Yes, one real fix is to use URLs, which is what we're saying
should be done.

Another real fix would be to completely abandon the idea
that core behavior should have anything to do with externally located
resources.
See the end of
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/1999OctDec/0311.html
for a description of how much simpler our task would be if we totally pushed
everything to do with resource location off to the application.
I like this because at least the application-specific logic
requirement has something to do with the needs of the application.
