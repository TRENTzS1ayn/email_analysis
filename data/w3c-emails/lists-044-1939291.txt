the only real fix I see is to properly use URL's.

>>Yes, one real fix is to use URLs, which is what

I'd like to rephrase my sentence:

Still, location as a hint does not hurt here and the
only real fix I see is to <emph> properly </emph> use URL's if they are used

>Another real fix would be to completely abandon the
idea that core behavior should have anything to do with externally located
resources.
Yes, I think that's something I would support.
