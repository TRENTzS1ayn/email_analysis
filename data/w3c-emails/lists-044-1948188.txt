Hi Peter,

Actually, the whole debate is about whether location should be a hint or
whether location should be a <emph> properly </emph> used URL.  The latter
is hurt by the former.  

Core code must either treat location as a proper URL or core code must call
back into application code to resolve location if it is only a 'hint' as to
how to obtain the bag of bits that were signed.

I favor the idea that we either treat location as a proper URL (which means
that some apps need to omit it from SignedInfo), or that we recognize that
core behavior shouldn't be trying to dig up the bits because it can't and
strip out the notion of trying to go to externally located resources.  In
truth, I favor the latter quite a bit, which is a point that I think we
agree on.

I sent a simplified syntax proposal to the list a short while ago.  When it
shows up, I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to have a
look at it and start some serious dialog on whether the WG should move in
this direction.  To be honest, the proposal relies heavily on what we
already have.  It only says to push to the Manifest  those things that it is
becoming increasingly clear should be pushed to the application.  Thus, a
fair bit of the spec we have would remain the same.

Thanks,
