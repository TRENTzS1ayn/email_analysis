Right, this is what I said at the end of that last message.  The base-64
decode can't be outside of the SignedInfo because it must occur after the
XPath of child::text().

In general, arbitrary transforms should not be omitted from (or allowed
outside of) SignedInfo.  Mark Bartel has a fine email that runs through an
example of why this is so.

This is, of course, why omissions from SignedInfo should be specified in
exacting detail using an XPath (provided that the XPath filter on SignedInfo
is not allowed to omit itself from SignedInfo-- the bottom turtle!).

Sorry I couldn't make it, I was on a plane.  Just wanted to note that if it
is a
good idea to specify base64-decode outside SignedInfo (I think it is), the
suggested transform should also be allowed outside SignedInfo.

Thanks,
