It isn't clear to me that we shouldn't be able to sign external bytes referenced
by a URL in core behavior.  It doesn't make sense to me to have to encode and
include a BLOB in order to sign it.  Perhaps locations should be restricted to
certain protocols in their simplest forms (http, ftp, file, etc.)  We should be
able to use standard URLs if they can be reasonably dereferenced.  Maybe I'm
missing something here.

Thanks,
