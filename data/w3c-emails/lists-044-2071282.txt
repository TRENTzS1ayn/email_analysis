The way I read Mark's example, the output of the spoof transform would fail
signature validation, so I'm still not convinced that signing transforms buys
anything.  Anything goes if we aren't validating.  I view transforms (including
c14n) as being very closely related to locations.  Both are windows that allow
us to see through to the signed bits.  Those signed bits can be passed through
new windows, but that's OK as long as you can specify a way (a new "path" of
windows) to get back to them.

Thanks,
Rich
