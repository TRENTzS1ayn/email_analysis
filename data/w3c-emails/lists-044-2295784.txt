Yes: it seems simple to me. Have a Location which the core can use to fetch
the document for verification; but don't include the Location in
SignedInfo, otherwise moving the document breaks the signature (at least,
as far as the core is concerned). Then, if the document changes location,
simply change the Location field accordingly. Isn't it as simple as that?

Why, when no other kind of electronic signature is invalidated by changing
the document's location, should XML signatures be any different? I can't
see why. Perhaps some kind and patient person could explain to me what I am
missing here.
