We can provide an option for Location to appear outside of
SignedInfo, but it must also be possible to include it. Just
as there are applications that require document mobility,
there are others that require location (which should really
be thought of as identity -- the hint argument) to be locked
down.

Yes: it seems simple to me. Have a Location which the core can use to fetch
the document for verification; but don't include the Location in
SignedInfo, otherwise moving the document breaks the signature (at least,
as far as the core is concerned). Then, if the document changes location,
simply change the Location field accordingly. Isn't it as simple as that?

Why, when no other kind of electronic signature is invalidated by changing
the document's location, should XML signatures be any different? I can't
see why. Perhaps some kind and patient person could explain to me what I am
missing here.
