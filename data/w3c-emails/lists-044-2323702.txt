The argument is:
1. It is not a location; it is a URI.
2. Is is merely a collection of bits, which represent a syntax, which we
define the meaning of! If we don't define it to be a location that MUST be
dereferenced every time a signature is checked, then it isn't!

I define the syntax to mean:
a. There is a set of XML documents that when transformed yield DigestContent
(the content that is finally digested.)
b. At some point in time, the XML document obtained by dereferencing this
URI was just such a document.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I've expressed it well, and any sort of
exposition on this topic seems to readily confuse people.
