The issue I foresee and am trying to identify how it should be solved is: if
I know that future generations of a document will be created and wish to
sign a reference to the future (as yet uncreated) generations how can I have
application independent support for this?.  

The clearest example of this I can think of is a digitally signed employment
contract that states the employee must comply with the current employee
handbook that is always maintained at
..../intranet/HR/current-employee-handbook.htm.  Since this is a legal
contract some form of non-repudiation may be required.

Since I cannot predict the content/DigestValue/Signature of
current-employee-handbook.htm all I can place into my electronic contract is
the uri to the location and the certificate details that will later be used.
I could do this using application specific logic (contract contains uri and
certificate and these are used by the application) in the same way that a
XML-sig document could always an embedded object that may contain the uri to
a detached object (and hence support for any detachment could be application
specific).  

My point is that, if there is an argument for supporting separating the
object and signature, this should support all the likely forms (my 3 cases).
To avoid the quagmire of application dependencies IMHO all 3 cases should be
addressed within the XML-sig standard.

Regards

Adam

I'm not sure I understand your question.

If you have a store with generations of an Object, each paired with a
<Signature>, I would think that each Signature would point to the
corresponding Object and you could accomplish your goal by just
pointing to the most recent version of the Signature.  It does
not matter if the Object is incorporated in the Signature or the
Signature has an Object Reference to it.

However, if you really want to point to them separately, it seems
pretty easy to define a

<SignatureReference ( URI= | IDREF= ) >
(ObjectReference)?
</SignatureReference>

or the like where presumably ObjectReference, if present, overrides
the first ObjectReference inside the Signature pointed to by the
URI or IDREF.  Is it that you think we should define something like
that in the draft?

Thanks,
Donald
