So, if I understand, you're proposing a mechanism whereby two URIs are
signed, one that points to the "current" document and another that points to
the "current" signature of that document.

I suggest that this is badly insecure.  Nothing prevents both URIs from being
spoofed and having the "current" document and signature be replaced.  The
signature on the document that combines the two URIs would still be valid, so
this kind of substitution would be hard to detect.

I think a better solution would be to sign, along with the document's URI, a
KeyInfo that represents the key to be used to sign the document.  As someone
else said earlier, this sort of thing is a bit outside the scope of XML
signatures.
