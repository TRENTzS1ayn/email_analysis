Adam, 

The W3C has issued the Resource Description Framework (RDF) [1] for this
very purpose. There are numerous application specific schema's and semantics
using XML syntax. RDF defines a data model and XML syntax for describing a
portion of interoperable application semantics that will be common to many
data applications. The semantics RDF focusses on are the relationships
between resources.

The RDF syntax ' rdf:about="http://mypage.com"' is an assertion about a
resource (and not necessarily it's content at any moment.)

Consequently you could have an XML/RDF application like the following, and
sign that:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:s="http://scala.se/schema/employee-policies">
  <rdf:Description
about="scala.se/intranet/HR/current-employee-handbook.htm">
    <s:Must><s:Read>All</s:Read></s:Must>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
