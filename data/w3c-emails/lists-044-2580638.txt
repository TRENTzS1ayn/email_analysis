In my mind, an object is the element which we define as having an open
content model. People can put whatever elements they want within an object
element (or if people wanted to use schema classes, other things could be a
subclass of an object).

Manifest, package and signature properties are all different "applications"
with different meanings that could be within an object (or a sub-type of).

I think of a Manifest as a collection of resource/content references and I'm
not sure what SignatureProperties has to do with that. SignatureProperties
is a set of semantics related to the signature itself. (A specific place to
make an assertion about the signature.)
