That doesn't matter, because what is signed is ABDE, not the original
document.

<John>
Incorrect.  What is covered by the digest is ABDE, but within ABDE is a
*signed* assertion that the only allowable difference between the document
and ABDE is the addition of C between B and D.  Can you please state why you
think this is insecure?  I don't think you can.

But neither matters, as it is *not* the *document* which is signed.
The signature is not on "the document ABCDE except with any C". It is on
ABDE.

<John>
Again, the digest covers ABDE, but ABDE includes an assertion that the only
allowable difference between the document and ABDE is the possible addition
of a *specific* C (not any C).
I don't understand why this is so hard to understand.

Much too complicated IMHO.

<John>
Not complicated at all, been doing it for years!
</John>

Could we just have a way of signing an XML
document?

<John>
We do, and the XPath transforms in that specification, *recommended by the
W3C*, provides a precision syntax for the representation of the concept I
have been trying for months and months to get people to understand.
</John>

If you want tro describe the XML document as the result of a transform of
som,e sort,
fine, but the thing which is being signed must be clear and distinct
and (even though it may not correpond to any resource on the web)
must be a self-defining XML document.

In the above case, ABDE.

On this you can build everything very clearly, without getting involved in
decising for some document semantics what would "substantially impact the
meaning".

<John>
Right.  On this I have very clearly built the assertion that ABDE contains a
very precisely defined (using XPath) assertion about what can happen to the
document without breaking the signature on ABDE. It is a pain to keep
repeating this, but every time someone sends a letter of disagreement
without considering the viability of this idea, document closure, what
choice have I but to respond (over and over and over and over again)?
