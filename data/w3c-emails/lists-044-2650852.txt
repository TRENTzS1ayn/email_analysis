Hi Daniel,

Taken out of the context in which I made the statements, yes my statement
may seem poorly worded.

True, the signer and verifier to mutually agree on the exact nature of an
agreement.  Indeed, it is really often the verifier that sets up the bulk of
what it said in the document because they want the signer to sign it and
send it back.

What I meant to say is that *at the moment of signing*, the signer of the
document must have a clear  definition of what he/she is signing as it is
the signer that is using his/her private key to authorize some transaction.
Once the signer's signature is affixed, if changes to the transforms are
allowed, then the document surrounding the bits covered by the signer's hash
can be changed.

If the signer intends to sign the document but must omit certain very
specific pieces so that others may complete the document (e.g. multiple
signatures, office use only sections, etc.), then changes to the document
other than those stated in the transforms should break the signature since
the changes cannot be guaranteed not to impact the bits signed by the
signer.  Thus, the signer must sign the transforms to prevent them from
being changed.

So, in the context of signature generation and verification mechanics (as
opposed to the context of transaction negotiations), it should be easy to
see that the signer does determine what must be signed since the definition
of what must be signed versus what must be omitted cannot change once the
signer has signed.

I agree with Mark, for the reasons stated.  This issue seems
fundamentally important to the goals and requirements of signatures and
until this is worked out, there are likely to be misunderstandings and
disagreements elsewhere, as is evident from the discussions of the past
several weeks.

To reiterate, it seems that it is ONLY the verifier that cares what is
signed.  When does the signer really WANT to sign something except to
satisfy the needs of verifiers.  What advanatage does the signer have?
A signature seems to only obligate the signer.

I'll leave open the possibility that there is some advantage for the
signer, regardless of the needs of verifiers, but I can't think of any
right now.  Please provide some examples to inform this discussion.

...sufficient for the purposes of satisfying the needs of the verifier.

Right.

Right.
