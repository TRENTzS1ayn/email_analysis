I think this overcomplicates things and nobody, or not many, will understand
that concept. This is as if we sign ABCDE and tell the user to ignore C.
Doesn't make sense. Either we want to sign ABDE, then we should sign ABDE,
and if we wnat to put C into the picture, why tell them that we don't want
to sign it, but still do in some obscure way, indirectly maybe.
