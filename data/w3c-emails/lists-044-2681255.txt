Regarding this general point, I have have a quite different view. I see
signatures as part of messages addressed to a certain recipient. Thus
they are special assertions that the signer wants to transmit (that is,
I think of signed documents as speech acts). I think the view that
signatures meaning and content are determined by the verifier stems from
the fact that, in most cases, there is a _final_ recipient (a court) who
takes the special role to prove or disprove the assertions made by the
signer - and often the signature will be practically designed after the
requirements of that verifier.
  I think there are many examples where the primary addressee of a
signed message is not even a priori determined - it may even be the
whole public as in copyright statements like digital watermarks. Even in
the case of a check, the assertive message character is quite clear
("Pay on behalf of [signer] ...") - and You don't have to use the banks
check form to make such a statement legally binding.
  Nevertheless, I do not see which restrictions the verifyer-oriented
view would pose on any syntax with which one wants to express
general-purpose digital signatures. Could You state for example, what
kind of assertions and syntax would be ruled out by Your view (e.g.
unsigned locations) and why? In fact, I would oppose any requirement You
would draw from Your viewpoint, that restricts the signers expressivity
beyond the syntactic restrictions posed by the current draft.
