I think a node-set MUST be well-formed.

Yes, the draft RECOMMENDs that a node-set is well-formed.  So,
you must define canonical form of a non well-formed node-set
more strictly.  Note that a node-set is an unordered collection
of nodes (not only elements).  The order of nodes depends on
XPath implementations.  The draft does not explain how to print
attribute nodes not in elements.
