Thanks, Larry.  I'm dealing with huge documents in court filings, and face the
same problem.  The only thing I'd like to add is that we need this capability to
be part of core behavior (it isn't now).

I agree.  Have we missed something or have I missed something?  ;-)  Here's our
situation.

We will likely have signed documents where the content and the signature reside
in the same file, initially.  Later, we may want to store the documents in a
bulk archive (some of these files are HUGE), and keep only a striped down
"shell" in a secure repository for long-term storage (life of the airplane = 40+
years).  This "shell" might contain only a reference to the file in bulk storage
and the original signature.  (The need for a manifest may not be apparent at the
time the original document is signed.)  

How?  I'm not sure, but for us it will be a requirement that the signature not
break just because we chose to later separate (or reassemble) the document
content and its signature.

Thots?
