Hi,

Attached is an interim XMLDSIG Syntax and Processing Draft.  This one
probably won't be linked to the web page or issued as an Internet-Draft
because it is expected that a further revised version will be out shortly.
(See attached file: core-1207e.html)
Thanks,
Donald

PS:  For a few simple elements that I think are stable I started adding DTD
fragments back in.
