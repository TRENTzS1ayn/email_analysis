A few quick comments on location in ObjectReference:

This seems to essentially codify 'location as a hint'. I have a slightly bad
feeling about this for the following reason: URI (URL/URN) have a well-defined
semantics given by the respective RFC and in the case of IDREF even by basic
XML. To introduce 'location as a hint' conflicts with these meanings by
introducing a little ambiguity to them.

Since the necessity for allowing application-specific locating of signed
content is rather clear, I see no _really_good_ solution to this other than the
- maybe trivial - to be explicit and have another name for the attribute
indicating location in this case (admittedly hint="..." sounds quite strange).

Sec. 3.3.3

> Note that a null URI (URI="") is permitted and
> identifies the parent document.

Contrary to my own saying above, I regard the empty URI as a very elegant
solution for this (exceptional) case. There should be a description of how to
proceed with this case in the processing rules stating that the signature (or
relevant parts of it) have to be omitted for digesting to avoid self-reference.
