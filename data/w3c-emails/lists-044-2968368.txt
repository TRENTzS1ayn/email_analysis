I am still unclear as to the issue here. Either we have a 
manifest that breaks down the huge document into components or
we have one huge blob.

Case A) We have a Manifest.
We can validate any component in the manifest that is
available to us. This is already supported.

Case B)We have a huge chunk of data signed as a single unit.
We might as well store the signature with the BLOB in the
archive. The signature is of zero utility without the
accompanying data.


Clearly a document management system should be able to track two
related documents (the BLOB and its signature) in the archive.

I still don't see how that this creates any new requirements.

Document management systems should support meta-data. That is a
document management system requirement, not a dig sig requirement.
signatures are only one of hundreds of types of Meta-data that
the DMS should be able to manage.

If you don't check the signature it tells you nothing.

The timestamp is a signature on a document. To give meaning to the 
timestamp you need to read that document. That document also happens
to be a signature on yet a third document. 

You are right in pointing out that to give meaning to a timestamp 
you don't have to derefference the entire chain of authenticated 
data.

All this points to is that signatures have to be first class objects
which is already a requirement.

Actually this is what your timestamp is.
