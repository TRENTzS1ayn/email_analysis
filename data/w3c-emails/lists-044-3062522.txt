Our XPath thing differs some from the XPath spec.  Perhaps it should
be called DSigXPath.  Since document order is a well defined concept
in XPath, I don't see why we can't specify that for attributes and
namespaces in DSigXPath if we want even if XPath doesn't.  But I also
continue to believe that most implementations will use DOM or, for the
resource constrained case, SAX.  Even SAX assumes that, while the
device might have problems manipulating the entire docment in memory,
it can always hold all the attributes, etc., from a tag.  So, my
inclination is to go with the canonicalization order since SAX or
DOM can scramble the order so you have to re-order in a canonical
fashion.

Thanks,
Donald
