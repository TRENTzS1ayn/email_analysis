     Signature Syntax & Processing draft questions < 30 minutes
     1. Renaming ObjectReferecne to Reference
     2. Grouping repeating elements (ObjectsReference inside SignedInfo and
Object inside Signature outside SignedInfo).
     3. When Object is used for data (as specified in the Type attribute),
do not include start/end tages in hash and auto-decode per any Encoding
attribute.  (If 5 and 6 below are adopted it might be possible to drop the
Type attribute on Object and use it only for data, or change to a MimeType
attribute or the data, which is what it was earlier.  Currently the Type
attribute is used up to distinguish between
data/manifest/package/signatureproperties.)
     4. Permits Object(s) inside SignedInfo.
     5. Pull Manifest/Package up to the level of Object.
     6. Pull SignatureProperties up to the level of Object.
