Great!

Sorry, I'm having trouble keeping track of our current state (how we are keeping
track of what is dereferenced, etc.)  If we are allowing location to be changed
for core behavior (are we?), and we are decoding (base64) content for the hash,
why is it tricky?  I believe John's solution involves retrieving the external
document, reconstructing the internal configuration, then starting the signature
process.  Not as clean as signing the unencoded data and allowing location (e.g.
IDREF or URL) to float.

Better design should be a strong enough reason for any changes we make at this
point.  I understand that we need to start finalizing things, and I understand
that there has probably been code investment, but I don't think we should freeze
it too early at the cost of capability, simplicity, or lucidity for the rest of
the world.

Thanks,
