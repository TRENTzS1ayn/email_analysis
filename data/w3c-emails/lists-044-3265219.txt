1. Includes lots of editing, definititions, references, and hyperlinks.
2. Only substantive change is move to Reference. In trying to implement
"References" I realized that element type name, and the plural of Reference
looked too much alike, and couldn't think of a different name, and don't
think it critical given I think the current exposition is pretty clear. I
can add a different name if people think it important, but otherwise there
is no Reference grouping element.
3. I plan on pushing this out as a TR and ietf-draft early next week, but
since I've done so many edits, I might be blind to some goofy errors in it,
so if someone has a chance to read over it on Monday, that'd be a good thing
(tm). <smile>
