I'm working in a health care setting and was wondering how the legal system
is viewing this work.  I am very interested in the efforts of this group but
would like to feel secure in knowing that its implementation will be upheld
by law should it come to that.

1. Includes lots of editing, definititions, references, and hyperlinks.
2. Only substantive change is move to Reference. In trying to implement
"References" I realized that element type name, and the plural of Reference
looked too much alike, and couldn't think of a different name, and don't
think it critical given I think the current exposition is pretty clear. I
can add a different name if people think it important, but otherwise there
is no Reference grouping element.
3. I plan on pushing this out as a TR and ietf-draft early next week, but
since I've done so many edits, I might be blind to some goofy errors in it,
so if someone has a chance to read over it on Monday, that'd be a good thing
(tm). <smile>
