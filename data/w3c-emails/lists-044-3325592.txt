I do not understand what problem you see.  Core signature
verification, in the example you give, would require that the Manifest
be fetched, digested, and this digest checked again the DigestValue in
Reference in SignedInfo.  In that regard it is of no partciular
significant that it happens to be a Manifest as opposed to plain data.
However, many applications will want to further vefify the digests
inside Manifests, perhaps recursively to many levels.
