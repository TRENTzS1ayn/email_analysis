We're really just trying to get a cyrptographically sound but flexible
and extensive syntax together at this point.  See the requirements
document
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-xmldsig-requirements-19991014.html.
There are people in the WG with this sort of concern which should
notice if we try to shoot ourselves in the foot.  Probably in a later
stage where some semantic labels are being defined, such
considerations will play a more explicity part.

Thanks,
Donald
