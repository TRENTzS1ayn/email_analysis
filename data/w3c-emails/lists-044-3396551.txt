This is the default for core validation.

I don't believe there was much opposition at the time and I liked it because
I was more confused with the treatment of URIs, mimetypes, and
fragment-identifiers than with the need to use (or not) XPath. This is one
of the design features I expect to get feedback on from the wider
communities. I believe you now think it is a mistake (and I might've missed
a post if you posted your argument to the list) saying why you think so, but
the cases are different.

I agree we have this bias (and I think it's been present from the start so
as to err on the side in terms of comprehension, security, and limiting our
dependencies on other specs.)

I agree, our TR states, "This is a draft document and may be updated,
replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time." However, in August I
mentioned how if we were to complete in time, we had about 4-6 weeks of
conceptual design time left, then 4-6 weeks of implementation experience
time. The way I think of those two phases is

conceptual time: try to address the requirements as elegantly as possible on
paper.

implementation time: improve exposition and make design changes if it is
quite clear that implementation experience yields knowledge that a mistake
was made.

I should've done a better job of documenting this, and mini-milestones along
the way, but I do think it is safe to say that we are now in the later
phase. Consequently, for a change to be made, the WG has to do the best it
can with the design decisions in the past unless its clear things can be
easily remedied and agreed to by the WG.
