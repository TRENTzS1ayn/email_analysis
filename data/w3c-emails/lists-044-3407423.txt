I'm not too keen on this because:
1. I don't know how important a requirement [1] it is nor how likely it is
that it will be implemented.
2. I generally prefer not to have these sort of optional features (bloat).
3. PIs are a bit of a black sheep in the XML world from what I understand,
they are generally discouraged.

[1] It isn't listed in:
