Frederick:

Clarifications on X.509 certificates included as KeyInfo:

 >2. For KeyInfo, KeyData, Is it correct to assume a CERTIFICATE element

David, Barbara, others?

(Barb) X509Data contains an identifier for the key or cert used to validate
a signature. These can be a certificate, a bunch of certificates or
identifiers like IssuerSerial, subject name, etc. We do not make any
assumptions about what collections of X509Data might be.

David, Barbara, others?

(Barb) Your statement is correct - sort of. OIDs in ASN.1 define a
de-codable structure that in turn, defines processing rules/semantics. In
XML, you don't need an OID as a parse hint for the bytes that follow it
because you can parse the XML directly. The important point is that the
processing/semantic meaning for an XMLDSIG doc can change on the fly. 


 >4. In section 3.4, KeyInfo, I note that the spec allows including a
 >CRL, with element X509CRL. Can we also define including signed OCSP
 >responses, with an X509OCSP element? This would allow transmitted the

David, Barbara, others?

(Barb) X509OCSP: This isn't a big deal to add, but it has the potential to
open a can of snakes that we've carefully tried to avoid, "freshness of
certificates." We don't require certificates in XML signatures. They're just
one form of evidence that MAY be provided by a signer to a verifier.
Attaching an OCSP response could be considered additional evidence. What we
want to avoid tho is our making any implied recommendations about signers
having to get and attach OCSP responses (or certs, for that matter) to their
signed documents. An OCSP response in particular seems pretty silly since if
a verifier wants freshness information about a certificate, he can get his
own OCSP response.
