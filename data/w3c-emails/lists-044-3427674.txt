So I conclude the following (please tell me if I am wrong):

If the Type attribute of Reference indicates a manifest, but the URI
attribute does not refer to a XML-Document which root element is a 
manifest, that is an application problem and does not touch core 
behaviour, i.e. the correctness of the type attribute is not checked
by core behaviour.
