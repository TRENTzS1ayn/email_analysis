Actually I would avoid the construct for a quite different reason. OCSP
responses are mainly constructed on an ad-hoc basis in response to an
actual request. I don't see particular value in embedding ASN.1 structures
of that type in XML documents. The OCSP server should have the manners
to deliver the data in XML syntax.

So while I think there is a value in incorporating an OCSP token in a sig
package I don't think we want to assume that it will be PKIX OCSPv1 in
ASN1 format. In fact one of the original reasons for supporting a variant
response syntax in OCSP was to allow an XML reply.

In fact I have recently been rewritting OCSP-X to exclude the
'controvertial'
Authorization functionality and rolled that into an XML based OCSP draft
for experimental track just so it does not get patented by some louse.
[Don't expect the drafts till I have spare time to finish 'em though]
