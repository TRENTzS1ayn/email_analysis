In case you missed it in the telecon minutes, the logistic information
for the upcoming Face to Face meeting is at
<http://www.w3.org/Signature/Minutes/SanJose/Logistics.html>.  Please
send me any suggestions to be included in the agenda.  I'll post and
agenda and cause an announcement to go out on the IETF Announce list
shortly.

Thanks,
Donald
