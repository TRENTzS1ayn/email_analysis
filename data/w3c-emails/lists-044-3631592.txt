I think we should change the name of Package because (1) there is an
explicit W3C "package" effort which is about quite a different thing
and (2) the name is not, at least to me, particularly descriptive of
what we mean by Package.

I suggest "EqManifest".  A bit ugly perhaps but I think it indicates
what the element is about.

Thanks,
Donald
