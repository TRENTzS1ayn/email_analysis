Formally, I believe the schema spec does what this WG needs it to do, as
I've applied it and a validator tool to our spec and some examples I've been
working on. Consequently, I think the more "formal" review from this WG
would be straight forward to write (it meets our requirements). However,
this is also a good time to make sure it will be a good and useful in a
broader light beyond the immediate requirements of this WG (i.e., the
requirements of applications using XML Signature with their XML syntax).

Would anyone else be interested in agreeing to review this spec over within
the next 4-6 weeks?

 The W3C XML Schema Working Group is planning to go to Last Call on the
 XML Schema specification soon....
 
 Can the DSig Working Group commit to reviewing the spec by 12 May
 2000?
 
 Please let us know asap either way.
 
 Thanks.
