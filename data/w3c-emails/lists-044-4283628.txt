I will use an abridged version of the XML spec text, and could refer to the
Character Model Working draft, but it hasn't been updated recently and I'm
wondering when it will be advanced past WD?

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-external-ent

"An XML processor should handle a non-ASCII character in a URI by
representing the character in UTF-8 as one or more bytes, and then escaping
these bytes with the URI escaping mechanism (i.e., by converting each byte
to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the byte value)."
