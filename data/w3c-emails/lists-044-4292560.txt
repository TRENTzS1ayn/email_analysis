A namespace declaration has no namespace, that is to say, there
is no namespace binding on "xmlns" prefix.  A URI as the value
of a namespace declaration is not its namespace.  So, there are
two interpretations:

  a) Namespace declaration has no namespace URI.  The primary
  key is empty.  The secondary key is a local name (the declared
  prefix.)

  b) Regards the value of a namespace declaration as namespace
  URI.  The primary key is the URI.  The secondary key is a
  localname (the declared prefix.)
