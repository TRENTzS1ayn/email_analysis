Unfortunotaly, the above is not in namespace-normal form
as defined by the current c14n draft. n2 is on no attribute
and no element, and thus by the definition of c14n just
superfluous and not allowed to be there.

And you may think about ways to fix this, but it's not possible
to fix this easily, unless you want to give up any chance to
veryfy namespace-normal automatically.

Unfortutately, it isn't.
