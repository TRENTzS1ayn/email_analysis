Hi TAMURA-san,

In section 5.4 of the XPath spec, the namespace URI for all namespace nodes
is declared to be NULL, so the comparison as defined always works (the
primary key is always the same).

Another way to put this is that I intend option A below.  I haven't seen
option B used elsewhere, and I don't think there would be any benefit in
deriving one here.

Thanks,

A namespace declaration has no namespace, that is to say, there
is no namespace binding on "xmlns" prefix.  A URI as the value
of a namespace declaration is not its namespace.  So, there are
two interpretations:

  a) Namespace declaration has no namespace URI.  The primary
  key is empty.  The secondary key is a local name (the declared
  prefix.)

  b) Regards the value of a namespace declaration as namespace
  URI.  The primary key is the URI.  The secondary key is a
  localname (the declared prefix.)
