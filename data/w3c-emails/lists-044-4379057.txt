Joseph:

Thank you very much for this post.  This reflects what the group agreed
early on and was one of my primary concerns.  You have stated the
proposition extremely well.  I support something in the spec that would
discourage people from using <SignatureProperties>.

Your example is reflective of the real-world distinction between documents
and signatures.  Documents (and surrounding circumstances) convey meaning.
A signature is merely evidence of an act that signifies one of many flavors
of intent (acceptance, acknowledgment, authorship, etc., etc.) with respect
to what is in the document (and surrounding circumstances).  Trying to
capture "intent" is not something that can be done in a standard (at least
not with current technology :-)

Thanks,

Todd
