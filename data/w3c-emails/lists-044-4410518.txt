1: some signature semantics are not application-specific in the usual sense
of that term. They may not belong to all signatures, but they belong to a
very large subset.

2: Joseph's example, in which the signed data contain an <approved by
="xxx"> element referring to the signature, has I think two drawbacks,
neither of them fatal.

2.1: It will be hard work to allow arbitrarily many signatures to be added
to a document using this approach. Subject to what John Boyer has to say,
it looks to me as if a document will need to be specially designed to allow
multiple signatures to be added.

2.2: Information about the signature logically belongs with the signature.
Forensic examination of signatures will be complicated by the need to
consult a plurality of resources in different locations in order to
reconstruct the evidence of a single historical event.

3: It is not the application which defines the meaning of a signature. The
application can only define whether the signature _can have_ any semantics.
It is the intent of the signatory which determines what a signature
actually means. (For more on application semantics, see e.g.
http://www.uniroma3.it/kant/field/chinese.html.)

For these reasons I think that Joseph's proposal is actually more untidy
than making use of the SignatureProperties. Perhaps he would like to point
out where I'm going wrong.
