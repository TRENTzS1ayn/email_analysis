Normally the date embedded in a signature is labeled as being the date
of the mechanical signature operation.  I don't see what's confusing
about this.  I suppose you could have a signature property that said
"ignore any date in the document, here is the true document date" but
I think it would rarely be useful and in any sufficiently powerful
expressive system, you can't stop people from making confusing or self
contradictory statements.  I believe our current syntax document only
mentions date of the signature (or digest) and hardware identifier for
crypto hardware used in calculating the signature (or digest) as
examples of appropriate properties of the signature itself to be put
into SignatureProperties.

Note, Tom said "add qualifications to his or her signature".  I don't
see that as amending the fundamental agreement.  Assume some sort of
bond with multiple sureties where each indicates the monetary amount
which they are willing to be bound and when their surety expires.  It
would be much better to format the document so these things were
outside the Signatures, in little surety elements or something, but
putting that info inside SignatureProperties isn't ridiculous and I
don't see it as in really amending the agreement, which presumably is
something like "The below signatories give surerty for the faithful
performance ... by A B of their duties as ...".
