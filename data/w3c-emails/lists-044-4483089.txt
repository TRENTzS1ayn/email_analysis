I'm not arguing against SignatureProperty and I appreciate your points.
Actually, I think the question is more of "Information about the trust and
semantics logically belongs with the [signature/application]." It's just
that the examples I was thinking of, that information belongs to the
application in my use scenarios.  My proposal was only that as presently
specified, I think it appears that SigntureProperty is the only way to go,
and one independent reader of the spec came up with the other way that I'm
more comfortable with.

One sentence in section 2.2 might do the trick
It already says:
        Applications that wish to represent other semantics must rely upon
other 
        technologies, such as [XML, RDF]. 
And we could add:
        For instance, an application might use as foo:assuredby attribute 
        within its own markup to references a Signature element.
Consequently, 
        it's the application that must understand and know how to make trust 
        decisions given the validity of the signature and the meaning of 
        assurdby syntax.

In my example, the application and the signer are the same (or at least both
are present at time of application XML and signature generation), though I
know this isn't always the case.
