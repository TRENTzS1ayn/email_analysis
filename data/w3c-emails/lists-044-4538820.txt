I would like to send some comments about minutes because my answer was 
misleading.

Although XML and ASN.1 are both grammer-based meta-language frameworks for 
tree-structured data, 
their expressive power is not exactly the same each other (unfortunately, 
none is a proper subset of the other).  
Our translator is designed such that no information is lost when 
translating any ASN.1 data into an XML document.  
Information such as data types and context tags is preserved as attribute 
values that are specified as defaults in the DTD.  
In particular, if the original ASN.1 data is encoded in DER, it is 
guaranteed that translating the ASN.1 data to XML and 
then back to ASN.1, exactly the same bit string is recovered.  
This is a desired property for dealing with digital signatures defined on 
ASN.1 encoding.
