There may be a need for an additional attribute for References and/or Objects to carry information like filenames.  For example, if I create an enveloped Reference for an HTML page that includes images it seems reasonable to include each image in a separate Reference.  Filenames and relative paths for those References would be nice to have, if not absolutely necessary to have, when rendering the contents of Signature and there is currently no place to put them.  Id is possible but to avoid Id collisions across Objects I'd been using a pseudo-random number for the Id, for reasons like those recently described by Tom Gindin regarding Id collisions across multiple Signatures.  Also Id does not work when paths are involved because slashes are invalid characters for Names.
