Hello All!

Our implementation of the latest draft (28-Feb-2000) is now at a stage where
we are ready to start interoperability testing.

To get started I've attached to this message a signed XML message (out.xml)
produced by our implementation. 

Please have a look at the sample and respond with results from your
implementations, or if you have any other comments or questions.

Our implementation currently includes all mandatory features from [1] except
for HMAC-SHA1 signatures. In addition to the mandatory features, we have
included XPath, full C14N and RSA signatures.

Petteri
