During the 2000 Apr 19 telcon meeting of the XML Core WG,
the WG discussed whether we should drop Canonicalization [1] 
as a work item with the understanding that we would make 
public our latest WD (currently [2]) so that XML Sigs (or 
anyone else) would have that work to pick up if they wished.

The WG asked that I transmit the results of the straw poll
to the XML Sigs WG.  We had 13 votes to drop it, 4 to keep it.

We then had some subsequent discussion wherein we decided not
to take a formal vote to drop it at this time, but we may take
such a vote at our telcon next week.

If we do not drop it as a work item, it is still clear that we
are well behind our schedule on C14N, and we would likely not
get back to work on it for some time.
