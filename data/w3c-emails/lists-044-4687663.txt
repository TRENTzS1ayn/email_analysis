I've updated the XML Signature schema [1] to the last call schema spec [2]. [1] doesn't contain many changes other than converting the syntax, when the authors send their revisions in prior to May 1, I'll include those as well and the push them into the body of the text.

There's now a alpha version of an online schema validator. [3] The Signature schema validates to the Schema schema [4], and the Signature example [5] validates to the Signature Schema [6].

BTW: It also validates to the DTD except for the external content from the timestamp namespace which DTDs don't handle well. I suppose next week I should see if Martin's proposal of %Object.ANY facilitates the creation of a derivitive DTD that application designers will have to make when they use DTDs and mixed namespaces...
