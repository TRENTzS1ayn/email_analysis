I think this statement is a bit misleading.  There are lots of technical
caveats to getting DTDs and XML Schemas to work together on one document
simultaneously.  The more complex the schema gets, the more difficult the
DTD may be come to generate. 

In addition, if you add the careful "dance" that you must do to get the
prefixes to work properly, I would say that, besides simple documents,
there are lots of problems.

It would be more correct to say:

  "You may be able to use a DTD via a DOCTYPE statement at the same time
   as using an XML Schema if you carefully execute the authoring of the
   document with a number of caveats in mind.  This caveats are: ..."
