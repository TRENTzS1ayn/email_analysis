We've been over this ground a number of times already. This doesn't
work. There's a substitution attack on DSA unless the standard
clearly specifies which digest algorithm to use [1].

Check the archives 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/1999OctDec/0079.html
and sequelae for a description of the attack.

[1] Except that if you use an extension of DSA with a longer q
then you can use different digest algorithms for each size of q.
