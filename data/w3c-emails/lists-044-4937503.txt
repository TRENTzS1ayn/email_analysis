 Dear Colleagues,
 
 A new Internet Draft for XML media types has been released.  
 Please discuss about it at the ietf-xml-mime mailing list.  
 You can join this mailing list and read its arcive at:
 
 http://www.imc.org/ietf-xml-mime/
 
 Sincerely yours,
 
 MURATA Makoto (FAMILY Given)
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Simon St. Laurent, Dan Kohn, and I create a new I-D for XML media
 types.  It is available at:
 
 http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-murata-xml-03.txt
 
 Major differences from previous versions are as below:
 
 1. Fragment identifiers for text/xml and application/xml are 
    escaped XPointers (section 6).  This addition was requested 
    by the XML Core WG of W3C.
 
 2. The base URI may be embedded in text/xml, application/xml,
    text/xml-external-parsed-entity, or
    application/xml-external-parsed-entity (section 7).  Again, 
    this addition was requested by the XML Core WG of W3C.
 
 3. utf-16le and utf-16be are mentioned (sections 5 and 9).  Since 
    RFC 2781 (UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646) introduce these 
    two charsets, they have to be mentioned.
 
 4. appendix comparing alternatives to '|xml' suffix added.  
    The suffix is changed from "-xml" to "|xml".  As of now, 
    no media types ending with "-xml" are registered yet.
 
 5. The security section is expanded on the basis of 
    David Megginson's presentation to XTech 2000.
 
 6. Lots of minor editing.
 
 We are looking forward to your feedbacks.
 
 MURATA Makoto
