Also new to the list.

ASN.1 is hard to read because it is so compact while XML is easy to
read because it's verbose.

For certificates, there is a big advantage to compactness, as they
often have to be stored on limited memory devices like smart cards.

I'd like to see a size comparison.  On a smart card, 100 bytes can be
very important.

Also, if the certificate is signed using a DSIG signature, including
the KeyInfo, which itself has a certificate, does this now require the
entire certificate chain to be included in each certificate?
