Other people share a similar opinion. Other than the general interest from
and conversations in other WGs, Juha Paajarvi has presented [1] a SPKI cert
structure [2] and Satoshi Hada presented on a ASN>1/XML Translator [3].
However, certificate structures are something that are specifically ruled
out of scope for this WG.

        ... The working group will not address the following issues: 
        XML schemas for certificates.

I encourage proposals to the degree that we can ensure the Signature design
can work with such structures, and I hope there will be synergies between
our designs, but if there is enough interest (which I hope) it should
instantiate another WG.
