Joseph (and Donald and John, who were also part of the discussion after the
meeting),

I've found the following function defined in XPointer (Working Draft 6
December 1999):

FUNCTION: location-set here( )
The here() function returns a location-set with a single member. That
location is of type element, and locates the element that directly contains
(as text) or bears (as an attribute value) the XPointer. This expression
results in a syntax error if the containing XPointer does not appear in an
XML document.

Using it we can find the ancestor Signature element (without defining
variable bindings) as:

here()/ancestor::Signature

Mariano.
