   The XML Signature WG thanks the XML Schema WG for their work and the
   opportunity to review the last call Working Draft [1].  This comment
   does not address the ease of implementation but only whether the
   functionality as specified meets our requirements. To that end, the
   last call specification easily meets our requirements. In particular,
   the content types (elementOnly | empty | mixed | textOnly) and the
   Wildecard Schema Component <ANY/> are very useful for dealing with
   mixed content scenarios which are common to the signature domain. In
   time, the type extension capabilities might be a useful feature in
   constructing other cryptographic (key and certificate) syntaxes but we
   are presently not employing these typing features.

   Since the XML Signature specification should enter the W3C
   Recommendation and IETF Standard tracks soon, we ask that the schema
   WG give priority to the need for a stabilized syntax and for
   expediently advancing the schema specification towards Recommendation.
