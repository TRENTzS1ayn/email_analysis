(issuer,serial number) is from the X.509 world and is one of the ways X.509 
is broken.

"issuer" is a  DN and might identify an issuer, if DN's were from a 
singly-rooted name space, as was the original plan in X.500.  DN's are not 
singly-rooted and never will be -- so using a DN as an identifier is broken.
