Carl,

Can you cite any actual real world [0] scenario where two certificates
have had the same issuer/serial and been issued by different issuers? 
If not, it's hard to take this objection very seriously.

[0] By real world, I'm explicitly including cases where the same 
entity has generated two keys with the same DN. Obviously, this
has the potential for confusion, but that can happen even in a
singly rooted namespace.
