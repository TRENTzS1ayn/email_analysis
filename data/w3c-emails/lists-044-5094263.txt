W3C Status of this document
   
   This specification follows the XML Signature Last Call and attempts to
   address all last call comments sent to the list and those issues
   discussed at the April meeting. This version should be the last before
   the document is proposed as a Proposed Draft and Candidate
   Recommendation. Consequently, it still has a few editorial marks
   [underlined and/or in red] and things that must be done before it can
   be advanced including:
    1. Finalize the disposition of all last call comments.
    2. We are not confident that our use of schema namespaces and
       qualifications provides a single schema that can be used for
       enveloped signatures (signature within content being signed),
       enveloping signatures (content is within signature being signed)
       and detached signatures (over data external to the signature
       document).
    3. Further work and coordination needs to be done regarding our
       employment of URIs, IDs, and XPath
         1. Including the specification of algorithm identifier as
            defined by XPath that eliminates the Signature element within
            enveloped signatures.
    4. Ensure that if the syntax constraints of section 7.1 are followed,
       a validating parser is not needed.
    5. Clarify any remaining ambiguities in the KeyInfo section.
    6. Update the acknowledgements to reflect changes in working group
       participation and the comments sent during Last Call.
       
   Please send comments to the editors and cc: the list
   <w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>. Publication as a Working Draft does not
   imply endorsement by the W3C membership or IESG. It is inappropriate
   to cite W3C Drafts as other than "work in progress." A list of current
   W3C working drafts can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/. Current IETF
   drafts can be found at http://www.ietf.org/1id-abstracts.html.
