[This is herewith submitted as a personal last-call
comment to XML Schemas.]

Hello Joseph,

This review deals with the suitability of XML Schema to describe
the constructs used in XML-DSig (Schema/DTD).

What is missing, and what I would hope the XML DSig group could
contribute significantly to, is some kind of analysis e.g. with
respect of what potentials and problems XML Schema offers with
regards to describing data that can easily be signed. Two examples:

- Because the 'boolean' datatype has four lexical values (true, false,
   1, 0; this is in the spec, no kidding) instead of two lexical values,
   that means that additional effort (at least) is necessary if somebody
   wants to create a schema for some data containing boolean values.

- If there is some way to express that elements of the same type
   have to appear in a certain order (don't know whether this is in
   the spec or not), this will also help to create schemata that can
   be used to validate data and then feed that data into XML DSig
   without any or without much processing.

In other words, try to make sure that for appropriately designed
XML Schemas, no additional 'data canonicalization' step is necessary
to sign some data.

What do the DSig experts in this group think about such issues.

Regards,   Martin.
