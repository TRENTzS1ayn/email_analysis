Martin (and the I18N WG/IG),

Thanks again for your comments. The disposition of your comments that
includes more explicit references to appropriate emails/minutes are at:
        http://www.w3.org/Signature/20000228-last-call-issues#I18N
To respond to your email more directly: We've updated our draft to address
many of your comments: 
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000510/
This draft reflects most of our responses to all the comments sent during
last call. Those issues not yet marked done, in combination with the
editorial to-do's (as stated in that STATUS of the spec) will be addressed
within the next few weeks (prior to going to CR).

As you can see, I hope we addressed most of your comments satisfactorily. I
believe many of the transform questions were resolved on the list when they
were raised. A few of the remaining transform and C14N issues have not be
explicitly resolved yet as I expect they will be more aptly covered in the
C14N specification, but I believe John Boyer hopes to publish a proposal
(and tweaked transform section ) that captures the changes and reflects the
advice you asked us to give implementors/users (or explain why it's not
necessary) within a few weeks.

I also feel obligated to point out that the one I18N request that was not
agreed to pertained to changing an element type name:

        Choice of Element names: There is a 'Transforms' element
         and a 'Transform' element. This is difficult to distinguing even 
        for English speakers. For people used to languages without 
        singular/plural distinctions, it will create even more confusion. 
        We ask you to change 'Transforms' to something like 
        'TransformList'.  

        Victoria#Internationalization:"It is suggested that we change 
        Transforms to TransformList, SignatureProperties to 
        SignaturePropertyList, etc., for easier understanding. 
        Participants appreciate concern but consensus at meeting 
        is not to change due to existing examples and code.
