Not necessarily, but that may well happen. We already see
in the DSig group that people want to use the DOM, and
don't want to keep around e.g. whether an attribute was
single-quoted or double-quoted. As we move up the semantic
ladder (well, it feels more like a very flat slope, but
that's a different issue), exactly the same will very
easily happen one step higher.

Actually, I'm pretty sure we would argue that if you want to schema
normalize an XML document, then you would need another transform for that.
Whether we define such a transform in this version of the spec is a decision
of the chairs.

Constraints on permissible values is one function, and probably
the most important one the way the spec is written. But for datatypes,
the 'infoset' aspect is already there, and C14N is what we are
just discussing here, and would be very very easy to add at this
point in time compared to having to start another group,...
in a few months. Something like DOM is not done yet, but
conversion from data to XML streaming and back is an
important application of XML Schema, probably the most important
one.

There is a clear difference between changing the value,
and producing a different lexical representation for the
same value. Changing from 0 to false is the later,
changing the string is the former.

Well, let's assume you have a list of students, with student id,
birthday, and a boolean for 'male' (gender). The task is to
produce a signable XML document from this data. In order for
the sign to be reproducable, the XML document has to be exactly
the same for the same data. Assuming that the structure looks
something like
<student><id>...</id><birthday>date</birthday><male>boolean</male></student>
...
...
and is described as an XML Schema, the 'missing pieces' for the
above task are to make sure the students are always in the same
order (e.g. by id) and that date and boolean are always in
a canonical form (and of course that the underlying XML is
in C14N).

Probably the above is not the most appropriate example, but I hope
you get the idea.
