Hello John,

Can you give some examples for what you mean by 'schema normalize',
i.e. a short document before and after normalization, or so?

What I'm saying is that with some rather minor tweaks to the current
Schema drafts, it will be possible to easily write Schemata that will
make sure that documents that validate against these Schemata will
already be normalized and won't need any normalzation on the schema
level anymore.

How could such a transformation look?
