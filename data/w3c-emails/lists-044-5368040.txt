In the W3C there are workshops, but they are usually more "costly" to start
than an IETF BoF. I believe for an IETF BoF you generally have to show the
area director(s) that there is a body of interest that would make scheduling
the topic worthwhile. I created the xml encryption list [1] to see if that
thresh-hold of interest is high enough. (Though I haven't committed to
starting/devoting-time to it and their hasn't been all that much
discussion.) Someone could do the same for XML cert (or I'd be happy to
create a list when I get back from Europe).
