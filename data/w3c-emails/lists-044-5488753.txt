Dear all,

Following the indications of Joseph Reagle, I send this
message to the list to tell you that it is available in the
URL indicated below a document where new XML types
for signature properties are specified.
The work has been carried out as a task of an 
ISIS European project, ESTIO (Electronic Signature Test suite
for Interoperability). This project aims to specify and develop
a test tool to assess products that generate and validate 
digital signatures and qualified certificates that should 
accomodate to what is established in the European Directive.
Several relevant documents to this goal have been taken into
account and a set of conformance requirements for these 
products have been specified. These requirements include the
presence of certain data structures added to basic structure of 
the digital signature itself (in ASN.1 terminology these
structures are called "signature attributes" -quite different
usage of the word "attributes" in XML).
ESTIO partners are aware of the growing importance of XML, and
for this reason, the work has been done of trying to specify 
in XML syntax some types that could contain equivalent
information to that being accomodated in ASN.1 structures 
defined in documents like ETSI ES 201 733, RFC 2634 etc.

The document can be accessed at the following URL :

http://www.ac.upc.es/homes/cruellas/res/XML_DIGSIG_UPC_001.doc

Should you have any comments on this document, please send me
them to my e-mail address.

Thank you very much for your interest in advance.

Regards


Juan Carlos Cruellas.
