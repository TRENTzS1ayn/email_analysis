You're comparing an abstract syntax notation with a transfer syntax.
When you write 'compact', I guess you're talking of BER (or PER that
is much more compact than BER) but not of ASN.1.

Again, you're comparing 2 things that are not on the same level.
When you want compaction, use PER (Packed Encoding Rules): I'm sure
it "beat S-expressions in all side-by-side comparisons". BTW PER is
used to store data on smart cards.

[Hope I won't settle a war, for it seems to me that ASN.1 is not very
welcome on such lists ;-) ]
