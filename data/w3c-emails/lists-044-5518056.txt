Petteri and I tested interoperability between each
implementation.  Petteri's implementation has succeeded in
verifying a signature produced by my implementation on last
Friday.

We found some non-explicit points in the XML-Signaure spec.
  - A trailing newline of canonicalized SignedInfo element
    (Maruyama-san pointed out in this mailing list.)
  - Endian for big integer values such as P, Q, G, Y, Modulus,
    and Exponent
    (It seems that the spec. mentions only 'I2OSP for (r, s)')
