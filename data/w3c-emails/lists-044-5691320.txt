Actually, it does not take a fundamental redesign to add this feature.  It
would simply require a new axis like all-descendants.  Furthermore, I
expressed an opinion that it seemed overly cumbersome to indicate the entire
parse tree *because* the ability to apply certain tests to every node (e.g.
give me every node except those having a certain ancestor) is quite useful
in a variety of circumstances.  You declared that you didn't believe there
was a problem.  Is there some reason for this belief (i.e. something that
would follow the word *because*)?

I don't think there is any possibility whatever that the meaning of
/descendant-or-self::node() will change.  You can't fundamentally
redesign a spec after it's become a Recommendation. (I don't agree, by
the way, that the current design is flawed in this respect, but that's
academic at this point.)
