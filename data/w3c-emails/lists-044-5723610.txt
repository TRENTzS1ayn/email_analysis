This is not exactly fine. First, for XML, processors may or may not
take into account equivalences, and may change UCS code point values.
Please check 'match' in XML 1.0.

Second, while the i18n WG/IG agrees that character normalization
should not be part of XML canonicalization, there are contexts
where you may want to do both, and therefore the topic of
character normalization should explicitly be discussed in
the XML c14n document.

Third, in its use in XML signatures, XML c14n should not be
used directly in combination with character normalization
as a single transform, but character normalization should be
checked (not actually done) as a separate transform. Please
see the I18N WG/IG last call comments for this.
