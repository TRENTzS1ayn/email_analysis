  Hi John,

 well XPointer Last Call has finished and we are in the last steps
toward moving XPointer to Candidate Recommendation status. Unfortunately
this seems too late now to get this rather radical change to XPointer,
and I suggest you rename your function call. I also suggest you send
your proposal for extension of the XPath library to the XPath comment
list so that it gets added (but under a different name you should suggest)
in the next revision of XPath,

  regards,

Daniel
