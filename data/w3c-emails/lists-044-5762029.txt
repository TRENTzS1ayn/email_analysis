Done.

Good point. I used your text, then included the actual definition of
detached, then tweaked it all over resulting with:

Signatures are related to data objects via URIs [URI]. Within an XML
document, signatures are related to local data objects via fragment
identifiers. Such local data can be included within an enveloping signature
or can enclose an enveloped signature. Detached signatures are over external
network resources or local data objects that resides within the same XML
document as sibling elements; in this case, the signature is neither
enveloping (signature is parent) nor enveloped (signature is child).

Ok.

Ok.

Can't find that.

Ok.

The reason it's first is to be consistent with those in section 6.

How about: 

The identifier (that can be used within a Reference element to identify the
referents type) is:
Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#Object"


 >Section 4.5, curretn 4th paragraph, "signature document" -> "signature

Ok.

Kept at location to be consistent, and used similar wording as above.

Ok.

Application developers are strongly encouraged to support all transforms
listed in this section as RECOMMENDED unless the application environment has
resource constraints that would make such support impractical. Compliance
with this recommendation will maximize application interoperability and
libraries should be available to enable support of these transforms in
applications without extensive development.

 >Section 8.1, last line, "application" -> "applicaitons".

Ok.

 >Section 8.2, last sentence, "application" -> "applications".

I think this was done before.
