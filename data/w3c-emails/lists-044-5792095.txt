I am sorry, but I do not understand this question. If we restrict the
properties
to be applied only to the signature they are within, I do not see a problem
with nesting. Can you please give an example?

If we make this restriction (I do not see an argument against it), I suggest
to reject the SignatureProperties element at all, since it only works as
an additional "container" level between Object and SignatureProperty, but
nothing else.

In this case I also suggest to reject SignatureProperties. Instead, supply
each SignatureProperty element with an Id AND a Target attribute.
