Hi Joseph,

as I read your reply to Don's error report today, I recognized that I did
not
send you the list of errors I have found in the draft (for whatever reason
:-(

So here are the errors I have found; I hope you find it useful despite the
delay.

Section 1.3, last paragraph (macro definition):

  I think the file extension in "xmldsig-core-schema.dtd" is misleading
  here. Please replace it with ".xsd", as done in section 9.

Section 2.0, example:

  Left parenthesis is missing before the Reference clause.

Section 2.1, example:

  Alg ids for CanonicalicationMethod (line s03) and Transform (line s07)
  are outdated.

Section 2.1, last paragraph:

  Keyword OPTIONAL is misused here. Should be written in small letters.

Section 2.2, first paragraph:

  Replace "use as foo:assuredby attribute" with "use a foo:assuredby
attribute"

Section 3.2.2:

  Adapt section since there is a default c14n now.

Section 4.1, Schema definition:

  Attribute Id should be declared with optional use.

Section 4.2, last sentence:

  The Schema defintion for SignatureValue does not allow own encodings for
for
  specified algorithms.

Section 4.3.1, first paragraph:

   * Paragraph sould be adapted for default c14n.

   * Refers to section "6.1 Algorithm Identifiers", should be "6.1 Algorithm
     Identifiers and Implementation Requirements"

Section 4.3.3.1, third paragraph:

   The words MimeType, Charset should be set in normal font, since they are
no longer
   defined as attributes.

Section 4.3.3.1, Schema definition:

   Why use mixed content Ttransform?

Section 4.3.3.1, DTD:

   Reject MimeType and Charset attributes

Section 4.3.3.2, last sentence:

  Reference to section 6.1 should be adapted (see my remark on section
4.3.1)

Section 4.4, Schema defintion:

  * KeyInfo: maxOccurs in clause choice should be unbounded instead of 1

  * KeyInfo <any> Element is missing in clause choice, otherwise it is not
possible
    that applications place their own semantics within this element, as the
    textual description says.

  * KeyValue: Why mixed content model?

Section 4.4, DTD:

  * Replace Element content model for KeyInfo by an internal entity to allow
for
    application specific sematics.

  * Content model for KeyName, RetrievalMethod, MgmtData is wrong
(%Key.ANY;)

Section 5.1, Schema definition:

  * Why use <sequence> in type definition?

  * Either minOccurs='1' is wrong or the content model of the corresponding
DTD Element
    declaration (Reference*)

Section 6.1, first paragraph, third sentence:

  Adapt sentence for default c14n.

Section 6.3, first paragraph:

  Adapt paragraph for default c14n.

Section 6.4, first paragraph:

  Adapt paragraph for default c14n.

Section 6.6, first paragraph:

  Adapt paragraph, since MimeType and Charset attributes no longer exist.

Section 6.6.2:

  Remove quoted printable.

Section 7.1

  I think your remark in the first ordered list, item 2 actually belongs to
the second
  ordered list, item 2.


Regards, Gregor
