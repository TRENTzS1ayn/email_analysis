I just noticed in the latest XPath serialization and c14n specs, the
namespace axis processing says that the node with prefix 'xml' should be
omitted if it is equal to the value defined in Namespaces in XML.  Actually,
this should say that the namespace node with *local name* of 'xml', which
declares the xml prefix, should be omitted if it is equal to the value
defined in Namespaces in XML [1].  This will be fixed shortly, but it seemed
implementers would want to know this ASAP.

Also, note that if the new definition of c14n works out, then there will be
no need for a separate XPath serialization spec, so that would be removed
from the DSig specification.
