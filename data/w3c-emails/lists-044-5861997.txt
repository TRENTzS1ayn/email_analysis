Short answer, yes it will change; not sure when is optimum though.

It's supposed to change, when the semantics/syntax of namespace
substantively change. [b]  Neither our syntax or semantics have
substantively changed, instead it's been additions and clarifications.
However, I think the build up of change, particularly as we enter the
standards track merits a new namespace. But since we're pushing so hard to
make that happen ASAP, I don't want to do it quite yet since our examples
(from Kent and Petteri) wouldn't be quite right then. However, I planned on
asking them and the WG if people area conformtable with:
        http://www.w3.org/2000/06/xmldsig#

In general, changing namespaces can be work for editors and implementors as
a spec progresses, but if you aren't careful about this, you can end up
messing up the very people using your specification.

I recently commented about this to the Schema WG itself. Unfortunately,
they've been using the same namespace through big changes in their syntax
which means that our signature examples that, on a certain date, validated
against X will stop working when the schema WG publishes a new draft with
big changes under the same namespace and retroactively change what that
namespace means (and how a validator works!).

  I appreciate you don't want to change the namespace every time
  you issue a new draft and I hope you would try every time you made a
  substantive change, because now the result is that even if I write my XML
  instance that (today) validates under [1,2] next time you put out a new
  draft it won't! Before, not updating your namespace violated a philosphical
  point (but the actual dtd and schema were in a more specific (month) date
  space). Now you are violating a more practical point, if I have an example
  that works now based on something in date space it won't in the future.
