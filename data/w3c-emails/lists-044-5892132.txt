That's a good point. It is rather superflous. I'd be interested in what
others have to say...

Well, I changed the example to make it clearer this is what should happpen
(though I'm hesitant to make the change of removing SignatureProperties' ID,
or the element itself without further discussion (though I agree with you on
removing it.))

   [p10]  <Object> 
   [p11]   <SignatureProperties> 
   [p12]     <SignatureProperty Id="AMadeUpTimeStamp" 
                 Target=" #MySecondSignature "> 
   [p13]        <timestamp xmlns="http://www.ietf.org/rfcXXXX.txt">  
   [p14]          <date>19990908</date>  
   [p15]          <time>14:34:34:34</time>  
   [p16]        </timestamp>  
   [p17]     </SignatureProperty> 
   [p18]   </SignatureProperties> 
   [p19]  </Object>
