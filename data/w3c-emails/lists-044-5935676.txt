This draft is not acceptable at all.

Existing XML processors does not inform whitespaces outside the
root element to applications, and SAX parsers can not inform
comments.  To modify XML processors for this specification is
impractical.

I know the XPath processes comments and whitespaces outside the
root element.  It is better approach to write a note what is
interoperable XPath expressions for XML Signature Transform than
to modify existing XML processors.
