Hi all,

The XML Link WG has decided that our definition of here() was useful since
it allows one to distinguish which attribute (or block of text) contained
the actual XPath being evaluated, which could've been a source of ambiguity
under the current XPointer draft [1].

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr

Therefore, our recent change in the XPath serialization spec to the function
name this() should be changed back to here().

Thanks,

John and Michael,

The XML Linking WG has discussed the issue of here(), and has agreed to
change the definition so that it returns the node that the XPointer is
actually in.  We hope this satisfies your concerns.

Best regards,

Eve
