Hi Gregor,

Excellent work. I see that now.  The list of children of root does not
include text nodes, so I can add a sentence to c14n section 1 explicitly
stating that there are no text node children of root, then tweak the c14n of
PIs and comments to say that the closing ?> or --> will be followed by a
single #xA if the node is a child of the root.

Note to implementers:  this makes 2 confirmed changes so far

1) The change above will (and obviously must) happen.
2) Also recall earlier comments on this list that mean we must change text
node rendering to include changing all '>' characters to &gt; (as was the
case in the prior c14n spec).  Based on XML [1] rules 10, 15 and 16, this
change is not needed for PIs, comments, attributes and namespaces.

Thank you,

Ups, no references included ...
