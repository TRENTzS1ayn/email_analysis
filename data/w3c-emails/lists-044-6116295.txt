I hope not. The intent of the design is to permit externally defined
signature techniques and not become a repository for all signature profiles.

If I was designing this application, my initial though would've been to
place this data in KeyInfo:

"KeyInfo is an optional element that enables the recipient(s) to obtain the
key(s) needed to validate the signature."

"Additional information items concerning the generation of the signature(s)
can be placed in a SignatureProperty element."

My own distinction between these two things is that KeyInfo is the
information necessary to procedurally generate/confirm the SignatureValue
octets and any of its metadata (like a signed cert); SignatureProperties is
other data relevant to application/trust decisions about the
assuredness/trustworthiness of that SignatureValue. If others agree, we
could try to make this clearer...
