     The reason I have the manual signature in a SignatureProperty, rather
than KeyInfo, is that SignatureProperty tends to be data associated both
with the signer and with the signed document or the circumstances of its
signing, while KeyInfo is typically data associated with the signer which
is in no way specific to the document.
     This signature technique does not have any cryptographic key at all,
even though it is a variation on XML signatures.  It also cannot be
verified fully by any automated technique.

I hope not. The intent of the design is to permit externally defined
signature techniques and not become a repository for all signature
profiles.

If I was designing this application, my initial though would've been to
place this data in KeyInfo:

"KeyInfo is an optional element that enables the recipient(s) to obtain the
key(s) needed to validate the signature."

"Additional information items concerning the generation of the signature(s)
can be placed in a SignatureProperty element."

My own distinction between these two things is that KeyInfo is the
information necessary to procedurally generate/confirm the SignatureValue
octets and any of its metadata (like a signed cert); SignatureProperties is
other data relevant to application/trust decisions about the
assuredness/trustworthiness of that SignatureValue. If others agree, we
could try to make this clearer...
