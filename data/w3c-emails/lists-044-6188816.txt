Joseph and Tom:

Sorry, but I strongly believe that this manually signed digest signature
type is a huge mistake for this working group to even consider. The
focus of the working group and its charter from inception has been
digital signature in the cryptographic context. Adding this
"interpretation" of signature opens to door to all kinds of random
definitions and it seriously dilutes the work we've done so far.

I hope not. The intent of the design is to permit externally defined
signature techniques and not become a repository for all signature
profiles.

If I was designing this application, my initial though would've been to
place this data in KeyInfo:

"KeyInfo is an optional element that enables the recipient(s) to obtain
the
key(s) needed to validate the signature."

"Additional information items concerning the generation of the
signature(s)
can be placed in a SignatureProperty element."

My own distinction between these two things is that KeyInfo is the
information necessary to procedurally generate/confirm the
SignatureValue
octets and any of its metadata (like a signed cert); SignatureProperties
is
other data relevant to application/trust decisions about the
assuredness/trustworthiness of that SignatureValue. If others agree, we
could try to make this clearer...
