I understood KeyInfo to be the information related to generating the
SignatureValue. Consequently if someone defined a non-cryptographic method,
KeyInfo should carry the hints appropriate to validating SignatureValue
using that method.

Your definition is appropriate as well (particularly given it's called
KeyInfo) in that KeyInfo only holds information related to generating the
SignatureValue via a cryptographic algorithm.

I just want to be clear which it is and what the implication of your
definition:
A. Non cryptographic electronic signatures should place their "validating"
information in SiggnatureProperties, or
B. Non cryptographic electronic signatures can not use XML Signature syntax
what-so-ever. (Specifying this would be difficult as we would then have to
enumerate all the algorithms that may be used, or all those that may not,
and it's difficult to enforce.)
