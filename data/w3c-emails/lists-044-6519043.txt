Why? Won't many programs look for certain well known namespaces like
the one for XMLDSIG without caring in the slightest whether they point
to anything, let along whether it has changed...?

I agree that including a reference to the content pointed to by a
namespace URI in an XML digital signature can be a useful technique
under some circumstances.
