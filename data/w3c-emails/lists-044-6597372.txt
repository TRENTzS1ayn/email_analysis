Hi Joseph,

Attached is an updated copy of the c14n spec.  It has the following changes:

1) Encoding of > with &gt; in text nodes.
2) Linefeeds for PIs and comments; slight difference from old spec.
3) Elimination of comments as default.
4) New way for document subsets to handle attributes in xml namespace.
5) Better description of node-set processing.
6) Additional note about node-set as set of nodes, not list of subtrees.
7) Tweaks to document date, Status, Resolutions and Acknowledgements.

The Resolutions section contains the few differences between the past c14n
and the current c14n.

I am away next Monday to Thursday, but on Friday I should be able to send an
updated XPath transform that simply refers to the c14n rather than repeating
the c14n material.
