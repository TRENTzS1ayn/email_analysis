I agree entirely, up to the last few lines.  I think it is
unnecessary and indeed somewhat misleading to define your
serialisation in terms of your definition of subtree.  The flattened
set of all descendants has the wrong shape.  It makes serialisation
non-recursive, i.e. you can't say: to serialise an element node (an
XPointer result), do this, that, then serialise its attributes, then
do blah, then serialise its daughters in order, then do zyzzy.  I
suggest that that's precisely what you want, your own, recursively
specified, definition of 'serialisation'.  That's why I brought up
'string-value': I think the definition of 'serialisation' should be
very similar to that of 'string-value'.  Doing the definition in terms
of node sets actually makes it harder, in my opinion.
