The upcoming IETF meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
<http://www.ietf.org/meetings/IETF-48.html> should make the logistics
of interoperability testing easier.  Anyone with an implementation,
particularly of the mandatory parts of our draft, and who will be
represented at the meeting and would like to participate, should
contact Joseph and myself.  This will not be a part of the actual
working group meeting but, if scheduling works out well, we may be
able to announce some results at the WG meeting.

Thanks,
Donald
