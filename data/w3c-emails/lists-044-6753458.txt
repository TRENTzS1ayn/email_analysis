To close on the issue of electronic signatures, I propose that the
following text be included as paragraph two in Section 6.1, Algorithm
Identifiers and Implementation Requirements:  

"This specification defines a set of algorithms, their URIs, and
requirements 
for implementation. In general, requirements apply to 
implementations, not to signature use. However, this specification
REQUIRES cryptographic 
SignatureMethods for SignatureValue generation and verification. Other 
authenticators (electronic, biometric, etc.) may be included ONLY as a 
supplement to the cryptographic signature via the SignatureProperty
element 
type."

This should remove any ambiguity.
