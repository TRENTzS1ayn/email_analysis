 Abstract
 
    This specification describes a method for generating a physical
    representation, the canonical form, of an input XML document, that
    does not vary under syntactic variations of the input that are defined
    to be logically equivalent by the XML 1.0 Recommendation [16][XML]. If
    an XML document is changed by an application, but its Canonical-XML
    form has not changed, then the changed document and the original
    document are considered equivalent for the purposes of many
    applications. This document does not establish a method such that two
    XML documents are equivalent if and only if their canonical forms are
    identical.

 Status of this document
 
    This is the second draft of a proposal that (1) serves as an
    alternative approach to the Canonical XML specification using the
    XPath [17][XPath] data model, and (2) includes a few substantive
    changes that affect the canonical serialization of an XML document. It
    is not necessary for implementations to use XPath to generate the
    canonical form of an XML document. XPath simply provides a data model
    that is simplified compared to InfoSet, yet sufficient for the purpose
    of canonicalization. XPath also provides an expression syntax for
    describing the desired portion of a whole document. Any variances
    between that result from this specification's use of the XPath
    [18][XPath] data model and the XML Information Set [[19]InfoSet] will
    be reported to the XML Information Set's comments list.

    Prior versions of this document were published by the [20]XML Core
    Working Group (the last of which was the [21]20000119 draft), which
    delegated the completion of this specification to the IETF/W3C [22]XML
    Signature Working Group. We expect continued substantive discussion
    with respect to the treatment of XML namespaces, but hope to address
    that (any any other issues) quickly such that we can issue a second
    Last Call at the beginning of July 2000.

    The XML Signature and XML WGs and other interested parties are invited
    to comment on this proposed direction, review the specification and
    report implementation experience. While we welcome implementation
    experience reports, the XML Signature Working Group will not allow
    early implementation to constrain its ability to make changes to this
    specification.
 
    Please send comments to the editors and cc: the list
    <[23]w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>. Publication as a Working Draft does not
    imply endorsement by the W3C membership or IESG. It is inappropriate
    to cite W3C Drafts as other than "work in progress." A list of current
