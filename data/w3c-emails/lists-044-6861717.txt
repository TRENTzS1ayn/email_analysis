I apologize for not being entirely caught up on this thread yet.  I do want 
to make one "side comment":

XLink is not based on XPointer; it has no dependency on it.  XLink and 
XPointer can be used entirely separately, as when you have a "third-party" 
(out-of-line) XLink extended link that associates two GIFs, or when you 
have an HTML document containing an <A HREF="..."> link into the structure 
of an XML document.
