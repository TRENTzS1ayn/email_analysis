Nice job! Some suggestions regarding readability follow.

"See below" is ambiguous. "See following paragraph" "See Expression X", or
"See section X" with hypertext as appropriate is better.

Given the importance of this expression you may wish to set it apart from
the reset of the text and associate some token (Expression 1) with a name
that is then referenced from the following sections that presently speak of
"the default given in the Canonical XML Data Model."

 >     * An element's namespace and attribute nodes have a document order

Please define "greater" and "lesser."

To what degree is "Canonical XML" the serialized result of The Expression or
the serialization of the complete document's node set? I think the content
is right but the section headings could use a slight tweak or re-org to make
the relationship between these things more clear.
