I don't see any particular reason to add restrictive wording.

We have defined a syntax for associating digital authentication data
with information that is being authenticated.  Just how the
authentciation data is strucutred and divided into "keying info",
Signature/Digest Value, various algorithm identifications, etc., in a
general way and specifically for the algorithms we specify is the
result of various engineering decisions on which some still
disagreement but there seems to be a clear consensus.

There are all kinds of grades of security and security model.  We
explicitly recognize and suggest public key and secret key algorithms
but recognize possible use for biometrics or as yet unknown security
models. And I think we adequately warn readers to take care in this
area.

We don't require that uses of our syntax be secure.  We don't require
any particualr strength of key or algorithm.

If someone wants to design a system that, for example, uses a
digitzied manual signature where the environment where the signature
is taken, the path to the verification point, and the system that
verifies the signature are all physically secure and all use XML why
do we want try to deny them the use of our syntax or require them to
go through the empty exercise of using the same syntax with a
different namespace?  We'll obviously fail anyway.
