You assume that the XML document constructor has properly declared all
namespaces that appear in XML attribute values. Of course there is nothing
an XML processor can do to verify this. A short sample:

<doc>
<reference expr="foo:bar"/>
<foo:bar xmlns:foo="uri"/>
</doc>

This is completely valid XML and the namespaces axis of the 'reference'
element is empty even if the attribute value refers to a namespace. One does
not have to declare the namespace at the 'doc' element level, and if this
document was constructed using DOM then the above XML representation would
most likely be the result.
