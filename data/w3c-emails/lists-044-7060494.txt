Hello Kent,

I concur with John. Please note that the page you cite says:

Note: The italicized names are not yet registered, but are useful for 
reference.

(and UTF-8N is italicized).

Please also note that with regards to UTF-8 and "A real ZWNBSP at the start of
a file requires a signature first", this is an interpretation of the author
of the page you cite. From RFC 2279 (IETF definition of UTF-8), it is not
even clear whether a signature is allowed or not.

Also, the descriptions are given more in terms of a receiver than in
terms of a producer. As a producer, writing out a BOM/signature is a
bad idea among else because:
- There are XML parsers out there that don't support it.
- A plain ASCII file turns into a non-ASCII file.
- UTF-8 can easily be detected if necessary.

Adding a sentence saying that the UTF-8 produced does not start
with a BOM may be a good idea for a clarification.

Regards,   Martin.
