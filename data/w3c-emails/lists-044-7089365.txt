Depending on how fortune's winds blow, by the end of next week we might have
a good sense of both the Director's and IESG's thoughts on entering
standards tracks. So I could be comfortable on presenting the status of XML
Signature at the end of August. However, it's difficult to predict right
now, so it's something I'll keep in mind as the June 30th deadline
approaches.

If you have something Signature related that you think would qualify
(implementations and such) this might be a good forum for you.

 occurs, just as the final programs go to press. Preference will
 be given to the most technically newsworthly submissions.

 Extreme is a new, highly technical conference concentrating on the
 evolving abstractions that underlie modern information management
 solutions, how those abstractions enhance human productivity, and how
 they are being applied. Abstract and concrete information models,
 systems built on them, software to exploit them, SGML, XML, XSL,
 XLink, schemas, Topic Maps, query languages, and other markup-related
 topics are in scope for this conference.
 
 Speakers will have 30 minutes for their prepared remarks followed by
 fifteen minutes during which the audience will pose questions.
