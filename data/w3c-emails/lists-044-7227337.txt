Hi Kevin,

Because as said in the first point of 3.3.3
"--a character reference is processed by appending the referenced
character
to the attribute value"
if you had &#xD; in an attribute value of your inital document, then the
processor would have dereferenced the character to #xD so when you
serialize
it, you have a #xD character in atribute value.
