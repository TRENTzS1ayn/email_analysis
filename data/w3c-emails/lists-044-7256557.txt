Most people do not have the capability of keyboarding separate accent
marks anyhow (their keyboards generate the normalized forms).

No, that would not change the normalization status.  Any passage through an
8-bit set (other than the bibliographic oddballs I mentioned), or a legacy
double-byte set such as Shift_JIS, would leave the text normalized.

The trouble is: equivalent to whom?  Normalized and non-normalized XML
documents are typically not equivalent to XML parsers, so treating them
as equivalent for signature purposes is dangerous.
