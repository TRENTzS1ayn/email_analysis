     The generalname draft is for displaying the variants of GeneralName,
which are usually found in the alternate name certificate extensions.  It
assumes that a DN (and issuer names are DN's) are displayed essentially in
LDAP (RFC 1485/1779/2253) format, with a fixed prefix of "directory:".  It
also specifies formats for several other GeneralName variants.

A previous version of the XML-Signature draft mentioned RFC 2253 as the way
to represent a Name as a text string, I think this is still intended by
the authors

(Joseph, Brian: Am I right here?)
