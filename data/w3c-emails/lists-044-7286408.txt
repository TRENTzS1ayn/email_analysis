That is a compatibility decomposition, useful for specialized purposes,
but not relevant here. The Normalization Form C of U+00BC is simply U+00BC.
Indeed, every Latin-1 document without exception is already in Normalization
Form C, as is every other document in any charset that contains no combining
marks.

A document in ISO 5426 or ITU T.61 (ISO-IR-103) is not already normalized,
and if naively converted to Unicode will need to have the full normalization
algorithm run on it.

Can you cite examples?
