The Japanese XML Profile Submission now provides some helpful
background material. It wasn't out at the time we made our
last call comments, unfortunately.

DSig is not the first customer at all, it's just that for
Signatures, different issues have to be considered.
There is no need to write a verification algorithm, because
it's trivially defined by the actual normalization algorithm
(normalize, compare with original, if the same, okay, otherwise bad).
But the I18N WG retracted this request, anyway.
