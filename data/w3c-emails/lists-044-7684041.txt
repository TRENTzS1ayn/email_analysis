Either that or it is core behavior to omit the contents of
SignatureValue in
that case.
The spec should define that, but I can't find anything about it in [1],
neither
in sec. 2.3/3.3.3 nor 6., or have I missed it?

Btw two minor editing points:

1. sec. 2.3 defines URI/IDREF as exclusive alternatives

   <Reference (URI=|IDREF=)? Type=?>

in contrast to sec. 3.3.3

2. DTD in sec. 3.3.3. still uses 'ObjectReference'.
