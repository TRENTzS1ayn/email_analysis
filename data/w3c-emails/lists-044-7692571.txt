I think it should be clear that in this case an additional XPath transform 
has to be applied to exclude the Signature. I don't think it is necessary to
state this as core behaviour.

I don't see a contradiction here. In [1], sec. 3.3.3. you can find: 

"The URI/IDREF attribute identifies a data object using a URI [URI] or IDREF [XML]."
                                                                    ^^
