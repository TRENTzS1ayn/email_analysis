The only thing which is clear is that self-referential sigantures will never validate. I
think this problem and any solution the standard provides should be explained somewhere
- may it be core behavior definition, a recommendation to application designers, or at
least application examples.

Nevertheless, since signing 'this' document seems to me to be a quite common case, so
why not provide standard means to cope with it? To define exclusion of SignatureValue as
core behavior is the simplest way to achieve this.

Right. This was only in  conflict with John's idea of using URI and IDREF jointly to
solve the problem above.
