Also, not all URIs include a scheme that designates ways of providing a
document's bytes (for instance, URN or UUID).

However, these might be useful transforms for a 'URI-reference' [1].
Furthermore, they still might be useful if you do an XPath and XML c14n
(canonicalization) _first_.  Or maybe in the java example, the java code
c14n'izes and removes the signature elements itself. Consequently,
disallowing them in this particular case doesn't seem ecessary.

[1] URI-reference = [ absoluteURI | relativeURI ] [ "#" fragment ]
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt

However, the status of the URI and IDREF was 'lets put it in there, and see
what sort of response we get.' No one seems to be a huge fan from an
elegance point of view. The two options we had of proceeding were as follows:

a. (absoluteURI | relativeURI) and IDREF
b. (URI-reference) and no IDREFs

(We constrained ourselves so we'd have a single consistent way of doing
something). I'm beginning to think the right interpration would've been B.
(Partly because I don't think we can define a 'clean URI' (without a
fragment) that anyone will pay attention to. The uri schema datatype isn't
defined that way.) No attribute should be definied as an IDREF, instead it
should be defined as a URI. However, this still means that someone can
specify an XPath or an XPtr as part of the URI and also have one as part of
a transform. The consequence of this would be to return to a target
attribute of type attribute, but I'm curious to hear other thoughts.
