    Signature Syntax & Processing draft questions:

    1. WG status and solicit other issues.
         1. What to do with IDREF/URI?
            ACTION Reagle: ask schema WG if URI="#ref" a valid instance
            of the uri schema type. ACTION Eastlake: Otherwise, leave it
            as is and add a sentence or two clarifying thte IDREF must be
            processed like an XPATH.
         2. What about XSLT/Java?
            Not a technical problem, but no longer a compelling editorial
            reason to keep it if we aren't going to properly profile it.
            XSLT's are going to have to be c14n'ized as well (c14n before
            or after XSLT? Not sure). ACTION Eastlake: add a sentence to
            the XSLT explaining this.
         3. PIs and comments: ACTION Eastlake: add a small paragraph for
            each section.
         4. One time processing: Does anyone plan on implementing this?
            Reagle: lets not add features where no one in the WG is
            planning on implementing it. RESULT: leave as proposal unless
            we expect to have two interoperable implementations of that
            feature.
         5. Canonicalization: ACTION Eastlake: add his text on c14n as a
            seperate section, then WG should ask reviewers if they find
            it to be useful.
         6. ACTION Boyer and Reagle: work on FAQ/scenarios.
         7. ACTION Reagle and Simon: work on valid syntax, DTD, and
            schema with cryptographic values.
    2. Logists:
       No WG calls before FTF.
