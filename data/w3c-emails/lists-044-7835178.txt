I agree with your point here.

Ok, when I wrote these I was thinking if you used a URI to some other
resource, it was obviously a detached signature, if it was in the same
document it was either enveloped or enveloping:

<enveloped>
  <signature/>
</envoloped>

<signature>
  <object>
      <enveloping/>
  </object>
</signature>

You are speaking of the case of

<some element>
   <signature/>
   <signedobject/>
</some element>

Even though they are in the same document, I think I agree that the best
match (instead of creating a new name for it) would be to call it a detached
signature -- even though they appear in the same document.
