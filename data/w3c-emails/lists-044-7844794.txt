It should also be noted that, according to the current spec [1], a signature
can be enveloping, enveloped and detached all at the same time.

SignedInfo can have multiple References, some of which refer to enveloping
Object elements in the Signature, some of which refer to elements outside of
the signature and possible in other documents (detached), and some of which
refer to an ancestor element of the signature (enveloped signature
(signature is enveloped by content it signs)).

I agree with your point here.

Ok, when I wrote these I was thinking if you used a URI to some other
resource, it was obviously a detached signature, if it was in the same
document it was either enveloped or enveloping:

<enveloped>
  <signature/>
</envoloped>

<signature>
  <object>
      <enveloping/>
  </object>
</signature>

You are speaking of the case of

<some element>
   <signature/>
   <signedobject/>
</some element>

Even though they are in the same document, I think I agree that the best
match (instead of creating a new name for it) would be to call it a detached
signature -- even though they appear in the same document.
