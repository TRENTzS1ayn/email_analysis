The problem as I can see it is that we distinguish between signature types
(enveloping, enveloped, detached), but a signature can be of more than one
type at the same time.

As an alternative approach, consider to label the types which a data entity
to be signed could have, in relation to its signature:

o A data entity can be EXTERNAL or INTERNAL in relation to the document 
  holding the signature element

o An INTERNAL data entity can be INSIDE or OUTSIDE in relation to the the 
  signature element

The advantage of this kind of labelling is that the attribute combinations

o EXTERNAL,
o INTERNAL-INSIDE and
o INTERNAL-OUTSIDE

are "exclusive-or", in contrast to (enveloping, enveloped, detached).
