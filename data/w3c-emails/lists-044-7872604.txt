I disagree with that. Please remember the discussion a few weeks ago concerning
"location as a hint". The result of that discussion can be found for instance in
the following paragraph of section 2.3 of [1]:

  "This identification, along with the transforms, are a description provided
   by the signer on how to obtain the signed resource in the form it was digested
   (i.e. the digested content). The verifier (i.e., relying party) may obtain the
   digested content in another method so long as the digest verifies. In 
   particular, the verifier may obtain the content from a different location
   (particularly a local store) other than that specified in the URI/IDREF."
