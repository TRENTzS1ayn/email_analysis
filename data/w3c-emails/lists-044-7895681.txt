To:"IETF/W3C XML-DSig WG"<w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>

The XML Signature (xmldsig) Working Group will be having a FTF meeting San
Jose, January 21 [1].

[1] http://www.w3.org/Signature/Minutes/SanJose/Logistics.html

The goal of this meeting is to resolve all known open issues and produce a
specification that can be advanced to institutional last call within the
IETF and W3C. An institutional Last Call is basically a statement from the
WG that we think we've met the charter and requirements  -- and the rest of
the world should correct us if we are wrong before we advance the document
further.

Consequently, if there is an issue that you don't think has been raised or
satisfactorily resolved, speak now so we can discuss it next week.
