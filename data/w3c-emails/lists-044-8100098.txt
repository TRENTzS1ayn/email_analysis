Gregor, thank you again for the careful readings! I corrected everything
aside from the three points below that others in the WG should be able to
respond to.

I assume the authors of that section intend option (b): for more than one
type of KeyInfo to be provided. Consequently, repeated declarations
redundantly refer to the same key.

I actually believe the DTD is correct and the other language is incorrect. I
would think it would be possible to provide only two objects within a
Manifest. Donald?

Makes sense to me? David/Barbara/Donald?
