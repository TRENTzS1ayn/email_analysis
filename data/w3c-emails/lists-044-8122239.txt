The version of the document we will work from at the FTF can be found at
[1]. I will probably not have time to turn it around into an 'official'
TR/ietf-draft before the meeting. But, it includes _lots_ of editing. I've
placed a temporary snapshot of my editorial issues list at [2]. The CSS
'.done' class prevents completed issues from being rendered. If you want to
view the completed items, load it into an editor or remove the
'display:none'.
