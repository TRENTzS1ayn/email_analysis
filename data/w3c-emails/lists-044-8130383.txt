It's normally only one value but MgmtData can appear with KeyuValue...
Maybe (KeyName | (KeyValue MgmtData?) | SubjectName | RetrievalMethod
| x509Data | PGPData)

We have always used R+ O* before.  Personnally, I'd be happy to move to 
R|O+, which is more general, but I believe the consensus in the WG has been to
avoid such variable orderings and stick with fixed orderings of sub-elements
as implied by R+ O*.
