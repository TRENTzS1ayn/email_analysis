Actually, I've been doing some work looking at how XSLT/XPath-aware
processors like LotusXSL can be used to ease implementation of the
XML Signature spec.  (Kent saw much of this work last week when we
were working on the example.)  I hope to present on this topic at 
the  face-to-face.

Regards, Ed

If I implement a signer and a verifier for the XML-Signature, of
course I use an existing XPath implementatoin in LotusXSL or XT.
It is impossible to sort the result node-set evaluated by these
XPath implementation in the c14n order because the node-set can
contain attributes from more than one element and application
can not know a parent element of an attribute node in DOM Level 1.

I think modifying an existing generic XPath implementation as
ordering in the c14n makes no sense.



I found one more problem.
5.6.3 XPath Filtering:

How to render a node-set that consists of only attributes?  The
c14n does not define the way to render attributes out of an
element.



I think the XML-Signature specification should forbid XPath
expressions such that its result node-set consists of only
attributes.
If the problems I wrote were solved, the specificatoin would be
very hard to implement and to be understood.
