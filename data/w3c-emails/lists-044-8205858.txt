First it seems to me, that these two could be combined into a single
question (maybe with subpoints). Two suggestions, that I think would help
clarifying
the issues:

1. In answers 2) A3 and 5) A2 the _minimum_ content to be omitted by the
transformations (DigestValue and SignatureValue), and that it MUST be omitted
for the signature to validate
should be clearly stated (since I think FAQs are for the non-expert). Editorial:
The URI="" addressing method should be spelled out and a reference to the
defining portion of the spec
should be given.

2. In [1] I made the suggestion that URI="" should automatically omit the stuff
leading to self-referentiality, which was objected in [2,3]. I would suggest
that the design choice
taken for core syntax behaviour is explained at this point (I think including
such stuff in a FAQ
helps clarifying and is therefore generally a good thing). Text proposal:

  "This two step procedure, using URI="" and transformations, has been
prescribed in spite of
    its apparent redundancy for the following reasons: ..."

The reasons given in [2,3] are to be filled in for ...
