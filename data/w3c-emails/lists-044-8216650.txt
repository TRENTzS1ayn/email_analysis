As I'm not an active member of this group, I'll state the context :
In the IETF IMPP WG, we are currently defining an XML presence format that
should be understood by "very simple parsers", though allow signing 
documents. The idea at the moment is to use multipart/signed for that, 
although we would like to evaluate the use of XMLDSIG, especially for 
signing only part of the document in some circumstances. But if I believe 
the FAQ, it seems not possible to use XMLDSIG in S/MIME. Right ?

So maybe none of the three solutions below would work, as we expect
the XML document to be "untouched". Or could we have a "detached"
signature that refers to the "related"/sibling MIME part ?
(Is there an URL way of refering to siblings ?)

I think it is needed to elaborate on that last sentence in another FAQ : 

Q 2 bis) I want to include an enveloped signature inside the signed 
document. How can I exclude itself from the signing process ?

They look very close to me too, but maybe there is a difference I don't get ?.

yes, and I'm definitely one of those. Even further : an example of such a 
transform in the FAQ would be appreciated.
