Hi Christophe,

I don't know for sure why you are concluding that you cannot use XMLDSIG in
the way you want.  Why don't you send in a few example messages along with
indications of the parts you'd like to sign.  Then, we'll have a better
understanding of whether your conclusion is correct.

Regarding your request to elaborate on 2.answer3 in another FAQ, there won't
be a need to do this.  The current document included only 'rough' answers
that will be elaborated upon in more detail and *including* DSIG markup
examples.  We only wanted to get some questions and rough answers out there
in case anyone felt we were way off base regarding the overall document
structure or the general direction that the answers would take.

As I'm not an active member of this group, I'll state the context :
In the IETF IMPP WG, we are currently defining an XML presence format that
should be understood by "very simple parsers", though allow signing
documents. The idea at the moment is to use multipart/signed for that,
although we would like to evaluate the use of XMLDSIG, especially for
signing only part of the document in some circumstances. But if I believe
the FAQ, it seems not possible to use XMLDSIG in S/MIME. Right ?

So maybe none of the three solutions below would work, as we expect
the XML document to be "untouched". Or could we have a "detached"
signature that refers to the "related"/sibling MIME part ?
(Is there an URL way of refering to siblings ?)

I think it is needed to elaborate on that last sentence in another FAQ :

Q 2 bis) I want to include an enveloped signature inside the signed
document. How can I exclude itself from the signing process ?

They look very close to me too, but maybe there is a difference I don't get
?.

yes, and I'm definitely one of those. Even further : an example of such a
transform in the FAQ would be appreciated.
