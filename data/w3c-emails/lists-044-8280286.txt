Status of this document

The XML Core Working Group, with this 19 January 2000 Infoset Last Call
working draft, invites comment on this specification. The Last Call period
ends the 22 February 2000.

The W3C Membership and other interested parties are invited to review the
specification and report implementation experience. Please send comments to
www-xml-canonicalization-comments@w3.org (archive).

Note: The XML Core Working Group strongly solicits commentary, especially
from early implementors of this Working Draft, on the appropriateness of the
requirement that Canonical XML be in W3C normalized text form as well. The
Working Group has published a minority report on this question at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-canonicalization-comments/2000Jan
/0000.html. A rationale for the majority viewpoint embodied in this draft
has been published at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-canonicalization-comments/2000Jan
/0001.html.
