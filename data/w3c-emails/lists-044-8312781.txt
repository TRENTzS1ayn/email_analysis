I believe the changes I suggested before are close to what we agreed
to at the Face to Face.

Subject:  suggest text re "Type"

Replacement for paragraph re Type in 2.3 (assuming dropping of
Package/EqManifest):

<p>The optional <TT>Type</TT> attribute provides information about the
resource identified by the <TT>URI/IDREF</TT>.  In particular, it can
indicate that it is an <TT>Object</TT>, <TT>SignatureProperties</TT>,
or <TT>Manifest</TT> element.  This can be used by applications to
initiate special processing of some <TT>Reference</TT> elements. For
this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that when a <TT>Reference</TT> is to
data which may require such special processing and such data is within
an <TT>Object</TT> element, the <TT>URI/IDREF</TT> be to the enclosed
element / data. When a <TT>URI/IDREF</TT> is to an <TT>Object</TT>
element itself, the <TT>Type</TT>, if given, SHOULD indicate
<TT>Object</TT>. Note, however, that <TT>Type</TT> is advisory and no
action based on it or checking of its correctness is required by core
behaviour.</p>

Add to 2.4:

Note that an application could decide whether to verify a
<TT>DigestValue</TT> based on the <TT>Type</TT> given in the enclosing
<TT>Reference</TT>.

Add an "Other Useful Type" value for Object.


Thanks,
Donald
