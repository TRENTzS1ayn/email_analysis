Some minor edits and a couple of changes to make it clear that this
section is not just vague advice but rather that, under the conditions
described, your signatures won't work if you don't follow the
prescriptions.

7.0, paragraph 2, third sentence is missing terminating period.

7.1, item 6 in first list, delete "(6) ".

7.1, replace

"Thus, for interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
syntax constraints be observed when generating any material to be
signed and processed as XML, including the <TT>SignedInfo</TT>
element:"
 with
"Thus, to interoperate between different XML implementations, the
following syntax contraints MUST be observed when generating any
signed material to be processed as XML, including the
<TT>SignedInfo</TT> element:"

7.2, paragraph 2, replace "one requries a canonical method" with "a
canonical method is needed"

7.2, last sentence, "must" -> "MUST"

I'll send the results of these changes as a separate message.
