I believe there will be very few naked <Signature> documents.  Almost
all real uses of Signature will be inside forms or protocol messages
or whatever.  But that's not relavent to this point.

When I say the signature spplication can find our IDs in our elements, I
mean you could have

<!DOCTYPE ... whatever ...>
<rootelement>
... lots o junk ...
<Signature xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/...signature...">
<..various signature guts..>
<Object ID="item1" encoding="...">
...stuff1...
</Object>
</Signature>
...yet more junk...
<Object xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/...signature..."
ID="item2" ...>
...stuff2...
</Object>
</rootelement>

and certainly any reasonable implementation of XML digital signatures
should be able to find stuff1 from a reference to ID item1 from inside
"signature guts" and that it is perfectly reasonable for an XML
digital sig implemention to be able to find stuff2 from a reference to
ID item2 from inside signature guts.  This is true whether or not the
parser which parses rootelement is validating or has access to either
the rootelement or Signature DTDs.  If it, for example, have access to
the whole doucment DOM tree, it can, if necessary, grovel over it
looking for elements in the dsig namespace where it knows what
attribute is the ID.

No, I would expect dsig to almost always be inside application markup
and application markup to frequently occur inside dsig.

In general it can't, without the DTD.  And I'm not eliminating the
possibility of using XPath or the like.  I'm just saying that if the
applicaion is willing to reference the IDs that dsig provides on the
dsig defined elements, then for dsig purposes it does not seem
necessary to have the application DTD available.  My argument is that
IDREFs may therefore be more useful than it seems at first glance,
which is independent of whether you require a separate IDREF= usage or
permit URI="#token".

Yes, I agree.  A single URI-ref is simpler.
