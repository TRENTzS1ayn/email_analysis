Hi Joseph,

The following paragraph can now be omitted from the DSig requirements as we
seem to have XPath transforms to do this work.

"We are considering implementing this
       requirement via (1) a special <dsig:exclude> element, (2) an
       exclude list accompanying the resource locator, or (3) the
       XML-Fragment or XPointer specifications -- or a requested change
       to those specifications if the functionality is not available. See
       List(Boyer(1,2)) for further discussion of this issue"
