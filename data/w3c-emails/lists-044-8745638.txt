The latest draft has been published at: (ietf-draft should follow shortly)
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000208/ 
We are trying to go to institutional last call by February 21st. This is a
representation that we are fairly satisfied and we think we've met our
requirements; the rest of the world should speak up now before we move
forward. 

Before that of course, the WG needs to be satisfied. I understand Eastlake
(or others) might try to post a plug/play proposal on URI/IDREF, and Boyer
might post a proposal to move XPath results back to our own serialization.
If we can get those proposals in and discuss before the deadline, that'd be
great. If not, we can note that in our last call (or delay it a week if
absolutely necessary.)

Otherwise, this is your last chance to document dissatisfaction with the
design as specified. That "minority report" will then qualify the semantic
of "The WG is satisfied and thinks we've met our requirements." I'm not
expecting a new last minute concern at this point since we've asked this
question many times, but just to make it clear we are moving forward!
