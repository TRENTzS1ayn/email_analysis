Since XML and RDF are explicitly designed to do data and resource
description, we do not specify much of our own. Instead we expect others to
design such applications in XML/RDF, over/with which our signatures will
orthogonally operate. However, we do provide the following element:

  5.2 The SignatureProperties Element

   Additional information items concerning the generation of the
   signature(s) can be placed in a SignatureProperty element (i.e.,
   date/time stamp or the serial number of cryptographic hardware used in
   signature generation.)

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000208/#sec-SignatureProperties

Signature validating applications have no obligation to understand the
content within this element, they are only REQUIRED to process core
validation [1] with respect to the simple semantic  "XML Signatures provide
integrity, message authentication, and/or signer authentication services for
data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature
or elsewhere." That's it.

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000208/#def-ValidationCore

However, this element provides one (of many) places one could place an
assertion about a signature, such as a timestamp, hardware profile, or
semantic extension. For instance, one could assert within a
SignatureProperty that the containing signature means "authored by." Again,
while the signing application should be very careful about what it signs (it
should understand what is in the SignatureProperty) a receiving application
has no obligation to understand that semantic (though its parent trust
engine may wish to).

This isn't very well explained in the present spec, though I think the text
above does capture the sentiment expressed by the WG.

Consequently I propose adding similar text (unless someone thinks I got it
wrong, which is a very real possibility.)
