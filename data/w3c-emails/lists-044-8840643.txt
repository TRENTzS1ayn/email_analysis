I believe that a comparison of CMS/PKCS#7 and XMLDSIG Signature
capabilities would be very useful, although perhaps it should be a
separate document.

An example of s SignatureProperty is also useful, but I believe we
have one in an example in the current documentation.

An example showing ASN.1 would, in my opinion, detract from the
current syntax document if put there by adding needless complexity
that most readers would not understand.
