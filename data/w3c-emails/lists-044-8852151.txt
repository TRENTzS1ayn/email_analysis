Subject:  Re: Signatures draft




I believe that a comparison of CMS/PKCS#7 and XMLDSIG Signature
capabilities would be very useful, although perhaps it should be a
separate document.

An example of s SignatureProperty is also useful, but I believe we
have one in an example in the current documentation.

[Tom Gindin]   Where?  I don't see any such example in the current core
document.  There are schema and DTD definitions for SignatureProperty, but
the only example seems to be section 10, which does not use
SignatureProperty (nor Object nor Manifest, for that matter).

An example showing ASN.1 would, in my opinion, detract from the
current syntax document if put there by adding needless complexity
that most readers would not understand.

[Tom Gindin]   An example with ASN.1 would only be appropriate for a
comparison of CMS/PKCS#7 with XMLDSIG.
