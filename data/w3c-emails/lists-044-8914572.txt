We've posted the latest version at
        http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/WD-xmldsig-core-20000218/

   Status of this document

   This is a WG draft prepared as a candidate for IETF/W3C last call. The
   next version of this draft will be advanced to last call on Februrary
   28th. That version will likely include minor editorial and exposition
   edits exclusively. If necessary, the STATUS of that version will also
   document any last minute concerns or minority opinions expressed prior
   to its publication.

Next week we'll try to clarify a couple of small issues (highlighted in
red), make sure everything is good (validation, references, etc.) and
prepare the last call to be issued on the 28th.

NOTE: This includes both the re-org of section two, and the move away from
IDREF.
