Thanks for the references update.

On the "multiple distinct signatures" text, I guess it isn't very
clear.  The idea is that if one wants the protection of two different
algorithms, for example, so the signature would still be secure if one
is broken, then one could define a composite algorithm that produced
the two signatures concatenated.  This would probably need a composite
key which was the two keys, one for each algorithm, concatenated.

It is just as valid to view this composite algorithm/key as a new
single algorithm and single key format.  Perhaps it would be better to
handle this with a note somewhere pointing this out...

Thanks,
Donald
