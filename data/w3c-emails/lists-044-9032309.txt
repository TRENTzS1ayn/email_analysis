Until tools understand XML Schemas, I suspect XML-structure-validation of
XML Signatures won't really be reliable.  I think the IBM XML4J parser has
an early schema handler.

Thanks for this enlightenment! Up to now I thought PCDATA would correspond 
with String, and the behaviour of a XML parser API I have in use fortified
my opinion (please see my response to Joseph's article).
