Status of this document

   This specification is a last call Working Draft of the IETF/W3C
   [27]XML Signature Working Group. The Working Group invites review from
   the IETF community, W3C members, and other interested parties. This
   last call serves as a statement that the Working Group believes that
   the specification satisfies the relevant terms of the [28]charter and
   [29]requirements document. The W3C last call ends March 27, 2000; the
   IETF last call should substantially overlap but may not exactly
   coincide with this period. Subsequently, the Working Group plans to
   issue a specification that addresses any comments resulting from the
   review and propose it as a W3C Candidate Recommendation and IETF
   Proposed Standard.

   This document continues to be a draft document and may be updated,
   replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. While the
   Working Group feels the design meets our requirements we especially
   welcome comments on the following topics: security concerns, URI/IDREF
   usage, XPath, DTD/schema specification, and implementation experience.
   Please send comments to the editors and cc: the list
   <[30]w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>. Publication as a Working Draft does not
   imply endorsement by the W3C membership or IESG. It is inappropriate
   to cite W3C Drafts as other than "work in progress." A list of current
   W3C working drafts can be found at [31]http://www.w3.org/TR. Current
   IETF drafts can be found at

   Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on the
   Working Group's [33]patent disclosure page.
