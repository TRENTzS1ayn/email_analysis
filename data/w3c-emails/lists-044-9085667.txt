You have to use the escaping mechanism of XML here. Instead of the left angle bracket you
can use the corresponding character entity "&lt;". If the parser parses your DN containing
this entity string, it is replaced by the orginal left angle character again, e.g.

your DN: "Jim < Jack"
encoding of XML character data: "Jim &lt; Jack"
after parsing: "Jim < Jack"
