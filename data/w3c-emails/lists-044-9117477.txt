Section 2.0, last paragraph holds the following sentence:

  Within an XML document, signatures are related to data 
  objects via IDREFs [XML] ...

I think this has forgotten to be changed as we have moved over
to the "clean" URI solution. 

However, if the sentence is there intentionally, I suggest to
add some clarification that the mechanism does not work with
an explicit IDREF attribute but with a URI's fragment identifier.
