Comments for the record:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000228/

1. The spec still speaks of IDREF in a few places (last paragraph of 2.0 and
definitions). There are no more IDREFs, spec should only speak of URI="#foo".

2. Need to ensure use of declarations like 
        <!ELEMENT KeyValue  (#PCDATA|DSAKeyValue|RSAKeyValue)*>
make sense as an equivalent of "ANY" for any element type (not just those
found within the local DTD.

3. The content models of the schema declarations need to be improved. For
instance, there  should be a <any/> somewhere in:

  <element name='DigestMethod'> 
    <type content='elementOnly'> 
      <attribute name='Algorithm' type='uri' minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='1'/> 
    </type> 
  </element>

(I couldn't get these to work with an "<any/>" before Last Call. There is a
new schema draft out [1] and I plan coordinating with the schema group to
improve the DTD and schema.)
