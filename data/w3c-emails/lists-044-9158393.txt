I was thinking #PCDATA might be the better route, I didn't like the sentence
that we interpret what ANY means as it is clearly defined by the XML spec.
However, I'm not convinced this is the right choice, this is something I
hope we get more feedback on. Regardless, a validator [1] will fail on
examples of either case. [2] is an example where there is mixed content in a
Signature Method with the #PCDATA version of the DTD; [3] is the same
example using ANY. Both cause errors ...
