This might be somewhat forward-looking but given that the KeyInfo element
will likely be re-used for the future XML Encryption spec, would it not make
sense to give it its own namespace?

We could for example, use these three namespaces:

  "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/signature#" 
   for the Signature-specific elements

  "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/encryption#" 
   for the Encryption-specific elements

  "xmlns="http://www.w3.org/xml/security/keyinfo#"
   for the the KeyInfo element
