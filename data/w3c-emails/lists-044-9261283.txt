I still don't understand (please show me an example of what this provides
above/beyond my example). If you and/or Ed are advocating a DTD module based
construction [1], I would advise against that: XHTML did it because they
started well before schemas. If you are advocating a composed schema [2]
based on specific namespaces, I think that would be interesting, but a bit
too advanced for my tastes at this moment. (And -- obviously -- I'm not sure
what having a separate namespace without either of these things actually
provides.)

I believe the general feeling has been to avoid OIDs (and related
discussion).
