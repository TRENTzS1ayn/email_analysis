In section 2.1, example explanation [s18-20]:

In my opinion, the sentence: 

"First, the signer may not wish to reveal key information 
 to all signature verifiers." 

should read 

"First, the signer may not wish to reveal key information 
 to all document processing parties"

, because a _verifier_ must have access to the key information. The 
intent is to disclose this information from all those who only work 
with the data without doing a validation/verification. 

-----------------------

In section 2.2, example line [p12]:

  Is:        <SignatureProperties ID="... 
  Should be: <SignatureProperties Id="... 

(See section 5.2, Schema of SignatureProperties)

-----------------------

In section 2.2, explanation of example [p04]
  
  Is:        "In particular, [...] Object, SignatureProperties, or
  Should be: "In particular, [...] Object, SignatureProperty, or

(See end of section 4.3.3, example values for "Type" attribute)

Related to this definition, another problem occurs. The 3rd "Type" 
example in 4.3.3 refers to 
"Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/xmldsig#SignatureProperty"", 
although the referred ID is a Properties element within an Object 
and not a Property within a Properties element. 

Suggestion: 
     It would be clearer to substitute all occurences of 
     http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#SignatureProperty 
     by 
     http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig#SignatureProperties
     and let the above sentence in its current version. 

-----------------------

In section 3.2.1 "Reference Validation", item 3.:

Is:        "Compare the generated digest value against 
            DigestValue in SignedInfo;"

Should be: "Compare the generated digest value against 
            DigestValue in Reference;"

(Because DigestValue is child of Reference, and Reference is child of 
 SignedInfo.)

-----------------------

In section 4.3.3 first paragraph, 3rd sentence, it would be clearer 
to include a "(URI)" comment:

Suggestion: "The identification (URI) and transforms describe ..."
                                ^^^^^

----

In section 4.3.3 second paragraph, maybe it would be clearer to 
say ("should" added and "null" moved) :

Is:        "We RECOMMEND they be able to dereference 
            null URIs and URIs in the HTTP scheme."

Suggested: "We RECOMMEND they should be able to dereference 
            URIs and null URIs in the HTTP scheme."

----

In section 4.3.3 third paragraph, there are two "the" words:

"XML Signature applications MUST support the the XPointer"
                                             ^^^
-----------------------

At the end of section 4.3.3, namespace of example values for "Type"
attribute:

  Is:        Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/xmldsig
  Should be: Type="http://www.w3.org/2000/02/xmldsig

Section 4.4: DTD of <KeyInfo>: Substitute "*" by "+"

Is:

<!ELEMENT KeyInfo ((KeyName | KeyValue | RetrievalMethod |
          X509Data | PGPData  | MgmtData)*)  >

Should be:

<!ELEMENT KeyInfo ((KeyName | KeyValue | RetrievalMethod |
          X509Data | PGPData  | MgmtData)+)  >

See the Schema:

<element name='KeyInfo'>
  <type content='elementOnly'>
    <group order='choice' minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='*'>...</group>
                                     ^

-----------------------

Section 4.4: Schema of MgmtData not present, DTD is present.

-----------------------

Section 4.5: third paragraph:

Is:

<p>The <code>Object</code>'s <code>ID</code> is 

Should be:

<p>The <code>Object</code>'s <code>Id</code> is 
                                    ^

-----------------------

Section 5.2: DTD of <SignatureProperties>: Substitute "*" by "+"

Is:

<!ELEMENT SignatureProperties (SignatureProperty*)  >

Should be:

<!ELEMENT SignatureProperties (SignatureProperty+)  >

See also schema:

<element name='SignatureProperties'>
  <type content='elementOnly'>
    <element ref='ds:SignatureProperty' minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='*'/>
    
-----------------------

Section 5.4: Literature reference is wrong:

Is:

the Canonical XML [<a href="#ref-XML-c14n">XML-canonicalization</a>], is
...

Should be:

the Canonical XML [<a href="#ref-XML-c14n">XML-c14n</a>], is ...

-----------------------

I hope the comments are ok ;-)
