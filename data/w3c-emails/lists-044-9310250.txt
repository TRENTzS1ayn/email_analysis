Actually, your example is fine. Adding a new namespace for general crypto
references is not so much a matter of simplifying a concrete specification, but
can help (in my view) to make the design of additional Schemata using crypto
easier, as there is a canonical place to look for previous definitions of crypto
primitives. It could help to avoid multiple definitions of the same algorithms
in several places, as happened with OIDs. As I have not been involved in the XML
Signature definition process up to now, I am not sure if, how and when this can
be realized, but I like the idea of crypto namespaces along the lines sketched
by Ed Simon, where the definions might even contain informational mappings to
OIDs. 

But then, this might also be
