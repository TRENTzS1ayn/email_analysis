  Main syntax document

    Old Last Call Issues 10 minutes

     * Transform: Maybe consider to change the type of attribute
       'Charset' to 'uri'.
       Eastlake: Supposed to be on IANA Charset types, keep at Charset.
     * Is minimal C14N sufficiently specified?
       Eastlake: Connolly asked question about line feeds and we
       responded use the XML line feed conventions. Yes, thinks it's
       adequate.
     * If minimal canonicalization or Canonical XML has been chosen it is
       clear what forms the input of the signature method, because both
       methods are using UTF-8 as character encoding. But what if no
       canonicalization is used?
       Eastlake: If you don't specify any form of canonical XML, then the
       byte order is application specified. Bartel agrees.

    New Last Call Issues 10 minutes

     * Being queued in the [5]Last Call Comments page.
     * Simon's namespace proposal: something to think about further.

     * Simon: can generate cryptographic values.
