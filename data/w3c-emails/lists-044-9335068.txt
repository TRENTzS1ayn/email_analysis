6.6.3 XPath Filtering:

I would give up implementing XPath filtering based on the draft.

Don't use information not in the XML Information Set [1], such
as $exprEncoding, $exprBOM, and Exact Order, and don't suppose
strings in XPath can have each character encoding.  We could not
use existing XML processors and existing XPath engines to use
these information.

I think representing digital signatures in XML would be nonsense
if we could not reuse general-purpose XML libraries.


6.6.4 XSLT Transform:

The XSLT transfrom has the same problem as the XPath filtering
about attribute order.


7.1 XML 1.0, Syntax Constraints, and Canonicalization:

The sixth item in the first list, "6. for elements declared ..."
is incorrect.  XML processors must not remove any white space.


7.2 DOM/SAX Processing and Canonicalization

The first paragraph:
> losing the namespace prefixes in the source text and, in most
> cases, losing where namespace declarations appeared in the
> original instance.

Applications can know the namespace prefixes and the namespace
declarations with SAX 1.0, DOM Level 1 and Level 2.
