There will be a Face to Face meeting of the XMLDSIG WG at the Victoria
Conference Center in Victoria, British Columbia, Thursday April 13th,
hosted by PureEdge Solutions, Inc.  Info on hotels will be posted
shortly but people might want to start looking into airfare.  The
Victoria and Vancouver areas have a number of attractions so you might
consider staying later or arriving earlier and doing some touring.

Thanks,
Donald
