Yes, an application can get a BOM if it receives a raw octet
stream.  But applications may interchange XML documents in
internal character representation such as UTF-16 without BOM in
Java.

As I have written repeatedly, don't use information not in XML
Information Set.  If we wanted to refer information not in XML
Information Set, we would need tricky implementation or could
not accomplish completely.

I think no one implements exact order.  I may request for
Xalan/LotusXSL team to make output of XPath lex-order.
