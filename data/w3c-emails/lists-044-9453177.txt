Given the upcoming Adelaide and Victoria meetings and the present
Working Group status, it does not appear to be worth while to have a
teleconference this week, as originally scheduled.  Mailing list
discussion and the Face to Face meeting appear to be adequate.  So
unless someone comes up with an important reason today or tomorrow,
the call Thursday is cancelled.

Thanks,
Donald
