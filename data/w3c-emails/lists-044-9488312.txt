Hi all,

We are booking for a max of 25 people, which seems to be in excess of the
usual attendance for these meetings (which is around 20).  There will be a
continental breakfast and buffet lunch provided.  A/V equipment =
whiteboard, overhead and either a 1024x768 LCD panel or a computer screen
projector.

Also, there has been some interest in getting together for Tea at the
Empress.  If you are coming to the Victoria meeting, and you would like to
come to tea at 3:30pm on April 19 (the day before the meeting), could you
please send me an email so I can get some idea of how big a booking we will
need.

Thanks,
John Boyer

Due to several schedule conflicts, the face to face meeting has been
moved one week later.  Our apologies for this change but it was
important to be sure that the primary authors and editors of the
syntax and processing ]document could attend.

There will be a Face to Face meeting of the XMLDSIG WG at the Victoria
Conference Center in Victoria, British Columbia, Thursday April 20th,
hosted by PureEdge Solutions, Inc.  Info on hotels will be posted
shortly but people might want to start looking into airfare.  The
Victoria and Vancouver areas have a number of attractions so you might
consider staying later or arriving earlier and doing some touring.

Thanks,
Donald
