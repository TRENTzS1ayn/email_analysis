Barb,

Thanks to Brian's comments I understand now the idea is for KeyInfo to serve as a "hint" and little/nothing more.  However, I still fail to see where KeyValue provides anything in the way of "base interoperability" where a PKI application receives a key via KeyValue from a non-PKI application and thus fail to see why KeyValue is required.  It seems only to provide enough interoperability for a non-PKI application to deliver a key that cannot be validated to a PKI application.

Without clarification in the text as to the intent, I believe the structures provide too much of an invitation to be used in a manner not consistent with the intent.  As for the DSA parameters, since using them directly from a KeyValue is not the idea, why mandate their inclusion?   Certainly there would be no harm in relaxing the requirement that every KeyValue include them; a simple minOccurs=0 seems appropriate.  It would definitely save many bits spent on information that's really more nice to have than necessary for many/most implementations.
