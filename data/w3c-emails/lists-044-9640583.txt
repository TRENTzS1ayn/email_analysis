The primary use in both XSLT and XPointer is to locate nodes relative to a
context node, and thus the LocationPath assumes special importance.  As a
constrained version of Expr, it always returns a nodeset given a context
node.  It seems to me your problem also could benefit from LocationPaths.

Yes, Expr could be defined in your spec as the entry point.  In XSLT,
certain attributes are defined as Expr and others as LocationPath.  It
should be clarified in the spec exactly which entry point you intend.  I
assumed LocationPath.

XPath states: "Expression evaluation occurs with respect to a context. ...
The context consists of: a node (the context node); a pair of non-zero
positive integers (the context position and the context size) ..."

Thus the context position and context size may not be set to zero, and it is
a reasonable assertion that the context node may not be omitted (a null
context node doesn't seem like a context node to me).  I think this goes
beyond "odd".

I'll grant you that these are legal in an Expr, but not that this will be a
familiar use of XPath to users.  XPath states "The primary purpose of XPath
is to address parts of an XML [XML] document. In support of this primary
purpose, it also provides basic facilities for manipulation of strings,
numbers and booleans."  It seems to me that you have inverted this in your
model.  This is of course a philosophical debate, and as such cannot be
"won", but it is our responsibility to at least comment that looks like a
potential source of confusion and inconsistency with existing XPath useage.

I'm not completely familiar with your scenario, but doesn't this allow the
user to prepend any old byte order mark and declaration, even if they don't
accurately describe the XML data?  If they aren't prepended correctly, a
parse error could result, right?  It appears that the encoding and BOM are
available as variables, so is it the case that an author must prepend these
variables only (and always) in order for the parse to be successful?  Why
can't this be automated?

Scenarios?  If the need for parse() is eliminated, is there still a need for
this?

I'm suggesting that not() is fairly unwieldy if it is the common case.
Instead the filtering mechanism could build "not" into it.  Any nodes
identified by the XPath would be omitted from the result (along with their
children, of course).  This would seem to have a number of advantages:

- simplifies XPaths since you don't need tons of not()s all over the place
- conceptually, this lives up to the name "filtering"
- the default is that the entire tree will pass through -- an empty XPath
query would mean no change
- simplifies serialization algorithm
- improved perf when a generic XPath processor is used (the nodeset of
affected items is much smaller)

But on the other hand - are there situations where you want to filter out an
element, but keep it's children in some way?

Besides the arguments presented above, I do think consistency with XSLT and
XPointer is desirable from the users perspective.

Why?  Pass in all namespaces in scope - only the ones referenced in the
XPath will be needed during evaluation.  And the XML Namespaces mechanism
could be used to ensure there are no conflicts.  E.g.

  <Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116">
    <XPath xmlns:foo="uri:foo">//foo:bar</XPath>
  </Transform>

This comment is based on my experience that not providing this functionality
results in severe backlash from the user community.  And most of this
experience comes from uses where providing namespace bindings is extremely
difficult (e.g. URIs).  Users have not been forgiving about these mitigating
circumstances.  In your case, this seems trivially easy, and I encourage you
to learn from my mistakes.

Why then constrain the serialization process so much?  If the user wants a
canonical output, he can canonicalize it by applying a subsequent transform.
It seems to me that this feature is introducing a kind of
mini-canonicalization and the relationship to full canonicalization is not
clear.

Yes, XSL Patterns are derived from XPath expressions.  I guess match
patterns are a bad idea.  But I'm not convinced the "not" semantics
shouldn't be built in.  For instance:

  Signature[@id="S1"]/SignatureValue | 
  Signature[@id="S1"]/KeyInfo | 
  Signature[@id="S1"]/SignedInfo/DigestValue

This LocationPath identifies nodes which (along with their children) would
be trimmed from the tree.  I believe this would simplify the description of
the serialization mechanism, as well as provide a "positive" way for the
user to describe what is to be cut.
