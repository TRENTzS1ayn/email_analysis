This is only true for required-to-implement features.

Recommended and optional features already sacrifice a certain amount of
global interoperability.

If we follow your advice to the end, it means that we cannot sign XML at
all, in whole or in part, because we cannot count on attribute order going
from tool to tool, which will break signatures signatures unless full c14n
is required or, at the very least, lex order XPath serialization.

Minimal Canonicalization should be removed with the same reason.
