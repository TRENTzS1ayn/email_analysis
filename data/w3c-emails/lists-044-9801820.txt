I'm seeing a fundamental disconnect here.  XPath was designed to operate on
data structures, not on strings.  I understand that digital signatures
ultimately involve mathematical operations on a series of bytes, i.e.
strings, but shouldn't transformations apply to the structures represented
by those strings?
