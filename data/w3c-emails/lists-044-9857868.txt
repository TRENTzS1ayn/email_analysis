Carl:

I understand that you don't want to implement KeyValue. The fact that
KeyInfo is OPTIONAL and KeyValue is the one subclause of KeyInfo that is
mandatory-to-implement. This is consistent with other IETF RFCs. The idea
here is that if you DO include KeyInfo, then there must be a
mandatory-to-implement form. Do you have a suggested alternative for
KeyValue that is semantically neutral? 

I agree that we need some explanatory text on DSA parameters, but the
parameters cannot be omitted from KeyValue for cryptographic reasons
discussed previously. There is no scenario using KeyValue in which the
parameters can be left out. 

In terms of your issue with schema, I don't understand that. Maybe you would
also like to include an example of what you think needs to change.

My comments are inline and I've snipped away a great deal of text.

This is the core of my initial question.  KeyInfo is OPTIONAL.  Why require
those wishing to use a form of KeyInfo to implement KeyValue?  The fact that
it is optional undermines "base interoperability".  The fact that KeyValue
may be protected may further undermine base interop.

I think we are arguing the semantics of the terms "validation" and
"verification".  Let's not.

This depends on your point of view.  If you accept that the parameters
should never be used directly from the message without outside confirmation,
due to parameter substitution, then it is logical to think that the
parameters could simply be obtained from the outside source and need not be
present in the message.  Having them there invites misuse.  Some verbage may
clarify this issue, but minOccurs=0 would permit implementations to avoid
including them where unnecessary just to claim "compliance".

Perhaps an explicit statement of the intent of KeyValue.  Perhaps some
elaboration/example of MgmtData and its relationship with KeyValue.  Perhaps
watch the use of the term validate which is used to describe both KeyValue
and X509Data since it has different meaning in each location.  Perhaps use
verify instead when discussing KeyValue.

Lost is this has been the question whether or not the DTD/Schema is
sufficient to support stated usage of KeyInfo.
