Hello Donald,

Many thanks for your detailled answer. I have forwared
your mail to the W3C I18N IG. Some comments also below.

Well, yes, but this means a lot of work, doesn't it?
And a lot of chances to get it wrong. It looks like
the group is caring more about implementation than
users.

I see.

Well, there is Content-Language. Not that a transform would have
to take it into account, but it is relevant because of content
negotiation. This is a different problem; I just want to mention
it here; the XMLSig draft doesn't seem to address it.

Also, I'm sure there are other parameters to Content-Type than
'charset' that are relevant, a search through the IANA archives
will easily bring some up.

No, it doesn't multiply transform names. You just need one transform
with two parameters, the character encoding of the input and the
character encoding of the output. (or even just one, the character
encoding of the input, and have the output be UTF-8).

This is definitely a bad idea. We are telling everybody to get
their HTTP headers straight, and you just ignore it.

Did you say that you want to have transforms defined in an interoperable
way? If you want that, don't leave it to transforms.

Well, yes. But if you look at the details, they are not all that
easy. And please note that the XML spec not only says 'external
Charset information' but uses words such as 'delivered with'
or 'acompagnied by', which clearly applies to Mime headers,
but not some info far away somewhere in a different place
such as a signature.


Regards,   Martin.
