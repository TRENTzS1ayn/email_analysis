Having received no requests to the contrary, this is just to confirm
that the telecon for today is cancelled.

Thanks,

Subject:  XMLDSIG March 16th Con Call Tentative Cancelation

Given the upcoming Adelaide and Victoria meetings and the present
Working Group status, it does not appear to be worth while to have a
teleconference this week, as originally scheduled.  Mailing list
discussion and the Face to Face meeting appear to be adequate.  So
unless someone comes up with an important reason today or tomorrow,
the call Thursday is cancelled.

Thanks,
Donald
