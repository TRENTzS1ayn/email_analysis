To:"IETF/W3C XML-DSig WG"<w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>

I just wanted to point out that a new XHTML forms is in the works that will
probably have relevance to signatures and encryption:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-forms-req#req-inter

2.4.2  Security and authentication

It should be possible to perform secure, protocol-independent form
transactions as well as to be able sign a form and to work with signed
forms. There should be a way to control access to a form or to sections of a
form based upon user authentication.

Note: The forms subgroup is exploring what is needed for a form to become a
legaly binding entity, and what constraints this requirement has on the
design of the new forms model. Coordination is needed with the XML-Digital
Signature Working Group.
