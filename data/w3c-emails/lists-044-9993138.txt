Hi all,

Just curious.  How would a vendor's product like PenOp's electronic
signature software work into the XML signature syntax?  Any thoughts on
this?

Have a blessed day.:)

This is not equivalent to James' example.  I think the following is,
however:

  parse($input,true())/node()[self::e1 or self::e2 or self:e3 or self::e4]

I can't think of a situation right now where multiple parses would be
necessary, but some of the cases could get pretty byzantine:

  a | b//x

becomes:

  parse($input,true())/descendants::node()[(self::a and not(parent::*)) or
(self::x and ancestor::b)]

Generic XPath implementations will be optimized for the simple case and may
perform better.

Also, just because parse() need only be called once, doesn't preclude users
from calling it more than once, which could be quite costly.
