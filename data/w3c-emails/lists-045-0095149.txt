Actually, I'd like to have people choose between the two options I 
presented, though they certainly should take into account what you say (and 
others in the discussion), and can even change their position before 
Wednesday during the discussion. If it becomes clear in others' responses 
that no coherent resolution is forthcoming because of my formulation, we 
could try again with a different one.

I want a sense of the two questions I asked. If everyone favors (2), we 
could consider this proposal further. However, even then I'd have concerns as:

1. This type of conformance constraint is complex IMHO. People have 
expressed a desire for canonicalization algorithms that do one thing and do 
it well. I fear this additional level optionality where we say to implement 
this OPTIONAL feature you MUST do this. (The xmldsig spec is starting to get 
like this with respect to Recommending XPath to implement a REQUIRED feature.)
2. Part of the 'philosophical' argument I stated for (2) was that we were 
being all-together URI unaware. This might be a spurious argument, however 
your proposal places us closer to the scope of the Plenary decision, and 
more obligated to adhere to it I think.

Yes, people should realize that if they have a document  with a relative URI 
in a namespace of the type xmlns="../foo" or even xmlns="bar" then option 
(1) means there is no canonical form. However, everyone else respecting the 
plenary decision has the same issue. It's a heavy cost, but the only one the 
Plenary could come to agreement on to close that issue and move on.

This is true. However, it furthers the statement that option (1) means this 
class of comments can not be signed as already stated, "There are documents 
out there that use relative URIs and need to be signed." So I don't see a 
need to reformulate the poll yet.
