To:"IETF/W3C XML-DSig WG"<w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>


While we marshal are resources for getting Canonical XML to Candidate REC 
<smile>, hopefully sometime next week (as early as possible) new drafts of 
the dsig spec will be issued with a second last call. This makes sense even 
though there hasn't been a ton of debate/contention on this spec (mostly 
clarifications resulting from implementation experience), but the time from 
the first last call and the changes in the process model to account for 
Canoncal's last call merits another one just to be safe.

So this will be the time to make sure this WG and the rest of the world is 
happy with the changes we've made in order to address the earlier issues and 
the Canonical dependency.
