I very clearly prefer (1), because it's fully aligned with the
rest of the XML world. If it becomes clear how to handle relative
URIs in namespaces, we can update, with an update of the relevant
URIs so that it's always clear what's intended.

The argument that Canonicalization is URI-unaware doesn't hold,
because it can't be namespace-aware and URI-unaware.

Regards,   Martin.
