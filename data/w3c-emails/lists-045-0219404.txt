This is an interesting point I hadn't considered, that #1 requires you to 
add code to determine if it is an absolute URI. The pseudo-code should be 
based on the absolute URI definition.

"To be defined, the name space node value must meet the following production 
rule from [URI, section 3]:
    <scheme>://<scheme-specific-part>
A namespace node value which does not meet this production rule is undefined 
-- and it consequently can not be canonicalized by this specification."
