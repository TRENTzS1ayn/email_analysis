I think I'm missing something...

I don't understand how #1 mandates or forbids anything.  It merely says
that we're not specifying what happens.  If it mandates anything I'm
against it!  Perhaps we should change the wording to "can not be
interoperably signed."

Under #1, an implementation can choose to treat URIs as per #2... we're
just not guaranteeing that it will interoperate.  But it seems to me that
#2 doesn't guarantee interoperability in the grand scheme of things anyway
since other specs don't define what happens in the case of relative URIs.

I think odds are most implementations will behave as per #2... I just
object to requiring them to behave that way.
