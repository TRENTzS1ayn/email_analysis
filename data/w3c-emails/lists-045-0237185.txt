Hi Mark,

The description of the first choice Joseph has given starts with:

>1. To state that the canonical form of a document containing a relative URI
>in a namespace is undefined, and consequently such a document can not be
>signed. [...]

My way of thinking is that an algorithm performing Canonical XML must return
an error if it dedects relative URIs in the input. Maybe I am wrong, Joseph?

Regards, Gregor
