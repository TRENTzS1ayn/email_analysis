>         Registration and rules for participation
>
>Participants do not have to be W3C members. However,
>everyone must REGISTER by October 23. Participants are
>expect to be familiar with the reading below. Registration
>is on a first-come-first-served basis and registration will
>be limited to 35 participants. So make sure you use the
>REGISTRATION FORM to ensure that you can attend.
>
>         Workshop Goals and Scope
>
>If XML is to become the language of trusted Web applications
>(e.g., electronic commerce) it needs standard mechanisms for
>digitally signing and encrypting XML entities (and it needs
>them soon!). Furthermore, this mechanism must be fully
>functional in environments where only XML tools are
>available. While the joint IETF-W3C Working Group is
>completing a XML Digital Signatures specification, its
>charter expressly precludes work on encryption.
>Consequently, this Workshop will focus on (1) the
>requirements for XML encryption, (2) the proposals being
>discussed on the public XML Encryption list as potential
>starting points for a specification and (3) the structure of
>a possible W3C activity to advance such a specification to
>Recommendation.
>
>         Relevant topics include:
>
>         Scope of encryption: should the scope apply to
>         elements only, or any Information Set Item? How
>         should the scope of encryption be described/
>         identified: should the data model be based on a
>         simple ad-hoc representation or the complete
>         Information Set? Should the data model be
>         represented via URIs or an XML instance using RDF
>         Schema or XSet?
>
>         KeyInfo: Given that encryption keys might encrypt
>         content or other keys, in what way must the
>         Signature KeyInfo be extended to handle the common
>         Encryption applications?
>
>         Digital Signature "awareness" and syntax alignment:
>         to what degree can XML-Encryption use use similar
>         syntax and algorithm identifiers?
>
>         Schema design: how will encryption portions of an
>         XML instances affect that instances XML schema
>         validity? Algorithm, modes, and formats: which
>         algorithms and formats MUST be supported?
>
>         Parser impact: will parser have to either
>         post-process or be "callback equipped" to avoid
>         re-parsing of an entire document after a portion has
>         been decrypted? What rat holes can be identified
>         as out of scope?
>
>         Related topics that are not part of XML Encryption
>         (though they may provide requirements as an
>         application) are:
>
>              XML Access Control Policies: specifying
>              policies and mechanisms beside encryption that
>              control access to XML content.
>              Trust Mechanisms: specifying how much a key is
>              trusted in a given application context.
>
>         Expected audience
>
>We expect several groups will be interested in the workshop:
>
>         Experts in XML and data-models, who understand the
>         affect and requirements related to parsing/validity
>         and how to best represent the relation between the
>         plain text and encrypted content within a single
>         instance.
>
>         Experts in Encryption, who wish to ensure XML
>         Encryption applications are properly secured and
>         which KeyInfo structures are critical to dependent
>         applications.
>
>         Experts in Message Protocols, who understand the
>         requirements messaging protocols may have with
>         respect to encrypting a conversation/interaction as
>         part of the protocol.
>
>         Draft Agenda
>
>A preliminary draft agenda is available.
>
>         Position Papers
>
>Position papers are not required. However, attendees must be
>informed with respect to the reading below. If you would
>like to give a presentation on related issues or proposals,
>please contact the Chair.
>
>         Workshop organization
>
>The workshop will last for a single day. The structure of
>the workshop will be focussed on addressing the issues and
>leaving with specific approaches towards the technology and
>its standardization.
>
>         Meeting Location Details
>
>The meeting will be taking place at the Lafayette Park
>Hotel, a ~40 minute drive from San Francisco. Methods for
>getting from San Francisco to Lafayette include rent-a-car,
>door-to-door van service, taxi, and public transport.
>Driving directions from San Francisco and Oakland Airports,
>as well as from SanJose are available. The Workshop will
>take place at:
>
>              George Washington Meeting Room
>              Lafayette Park Hotel
>              3287 Mount Diablo Boulevard
>              Lafayette, CA 94549
>              925-283-3700
>
>         Hotel Details
>
>A set of rooms have been reserved at the Lafayette Park
>Hotel at a reduced fee. While the registration page asks if
>you require a room, this is only for planning purposes. You
>must make your own room reservation by October 23 and state
>that you wish to have the XCert rate.
