My intent was to think that there would be an error. However, I hadn't 
considered the idea of saying there is a canonical form, it just won't 
necessarily be consistent/interoperable. This sounds like a reasonable 
interpretation of the plenary decision, but then it seems we aren't doing 
anyone a favor. If we're going to "permit" relative URIs when we should be 
encouraging their deprecation, at least we should do it consistently...?

(More later).

BTW: I understand our treatment of this issue was briefly discussed at the 
XML Plenary this week with the following two sorts of positions
