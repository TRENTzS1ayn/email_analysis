Again, I'm not exactly sure what unspecified means (saying an error is 
thrown is more specific than permitting applications to do as they wish as 
Mark points out) but the end result is less interoperability for the 
canonical spec, and regardless of the nuances of this issue, that's what I 
think the big goal should be.
