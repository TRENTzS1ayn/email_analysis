My personal opinion in this is to go with #2 and suitable warnings
that realtive URI namespaces are flakey.

I think of C14N as an algorithmic transform of well-formed XML into
well-formed XML.  While the treatedment of relative URI namespaces may
be undefined, it is hard to think of any reasonable future meaning
which might be attached to them, ranging from them being a fatal error
to being realtive to xmlbase, which wouldn't be the same for both
non-canonical and canonical forms.
