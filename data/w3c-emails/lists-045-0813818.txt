Hi Ed, just cleaning the last spider webs of my issues list as we prepare to 
request advancement. As Henry never responded with respect to using schema 
to limit the specification of <any> to a specific root element (transforms) 
I expect to advance with the following (recommending using prose; I'm 
hestitant to specify mandataory schema requirements in anything but schema) 
unless you have a counter-proposal:

4.3.3.4 The Transforms Element
...
    <element name='Transform'>
      <complexType content='elementOnly'>
        <choice minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='unbounded'>
          <any namespace='##other' processContents='lax' minOccurs='0'
               maxOccurs='unbounded'/>
          <element name='XSLT' type='string'/>
          <!-- should be an xsl:stylesheet element -->
          ...

6.6.5 XSLT Transform
         Identifier:
         http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116

The normative specification for XSL Transformations is [XSLT]. The XSL 
stylesheet or transform to be evaluated appears as the character content of 
a transform parameter child element named XSLT. The root element of a XSLT 
stylesheet SHOULD be <xsl:stylesheet>.
