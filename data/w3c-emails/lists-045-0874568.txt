Just to make sure you know: There is a proposal from Juan Carlos Cruellas
available, which we would consider a rough, early draft, and Gregor is
working on comments to that draft. We have been in contact with ETSI in that
issue for a while , and we have promised to assist them too.

I would hope so too, and I don't see an obvious reason why this  should not
be possible. Futher than that, we are participating in an European project,
where this is quasi a long-term requirement...
