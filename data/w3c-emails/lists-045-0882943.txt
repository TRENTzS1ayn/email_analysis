     The CRL variant defined in X.509v3 is version 2 of the X.509 CRL data
structure.  There is no version 3 of this data structure AFAIK.  That
syntax could be plausibly referred to as "version 2 X.509 CRL's" because
its version number is 2, or as "X.509v3 CRL's" after the spec in which it
seems to have been first published.  "X.509v2 CRL's" is an apparent
mistranscription of "X.509 v2 CRL's" (as used in RFC 2459) with the space
indicating the structure version rather than the spec version.  The
simplest description is actually "the X.509 CRL format with extensions".
     Does anybody care which of these descriptions is used in our spec?

I don't think there is any significant use of other than v3 these days.
