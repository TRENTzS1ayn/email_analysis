The text should not specify a version number.  X.509 mandates that CRLs
having no critical extensions also have no version number.  From X.509
section 11.2:

 "If any extensions included in a CertificateList are defined as critical,
the version element of the CertificateList  shall be present.  If no
extensions defined as critical are included, the version element shall be
absent. "

Elsewhere it is stated that when the version number is present it must be
set to two.  Requiring CRLs with version number equal to two requires the
presence of a critical extension.
