Hi Merlin,

Firstly, note that the specific examples you give are now illegal because
they are not absolute URIs.  The c14n document will soon be changed such
that the examples contain a leading scheme.  This is aside from your main
point though.

As to that point, the omission of xmlns:foo="rab" should actually have no
effect on the namespace URI of foo:attr.  The assignment of namespace URI is
done at parse time and does not change based on omissions from the node-set.
In order for an omission to have such an effect, you would have to create
the canonical form, then parse the canonical form.

Since sorting by namespace URI does not cause the problem you mention, this
should get rid of the major part of the objection to sorting by namespace
URI.

As for why we do this, we sort by namespace URI because this follows more
closely the intent of XML Names, which is to identify namespaces by
URI+localname, not by prefix+localname.  Thus, the effect of the sort is to
group together all attributes that are in the same namespace.  Though not a
requirement for producing an unambiguous canonical form, it is preferrable,
particularly if one factors in the optics of *appearing* to violate the
intent of XML names by sorting with prefixes, even if one is not technically
violating the intent.

Hi,

I strongly agree with Doug Bunting's note:

r/Doug@ariba.com/2000.09.26/12:47:45

Sorting by URI value is reasonably more complex than sorting by
prefix.

Additionally, consider the following document:

  <Foo xmlns:foo="bar" xmlns:bar="baz">
    <Bar xmlns:foo="rab" foo:attr="value" bar:attr="value" />
  </Foo>

And consider a node set including everything but xmlns:foo="rab".

For sorting purposes, is the namespace URI of foo:attr equal to "rab"
or "bar"? According to my parser, it is equal to "rab" but according
to my node set it is "bar".

2.2 states that "an element E has namespace nodes that represent its
namespace declarations..." which does not preclude namespace attributes
absent from the node set.

If we sort by namespace prefix then this problem does not arise
because interpretation of the attribute's namespace URI does not affect
sorting.
