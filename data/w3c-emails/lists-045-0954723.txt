     To avoid confusing anybody on the applicability of v1 CRL's, the best
wording is something like "CRL's as defined in X.509v3" which covers both
v1 and v2 CRL's.

The text should not specify a version number.  X.509 mandates that CRLs
having no critical extensions also have no version number.  From X.509
section 11.2:

 "If any extensions included in a CertificateList are defined as critical,
the version element of the CertificateList  shall be present.  If no
extensions defined as critical are included, the version element shall be
absent. "

Elsewhere it is stated that when the version number is present it must be
set to two.  Requiring CRLs with version number equal to two requires the
presence of a critical extension.
