Hi Merlin,

Actually, you can get the exact characters for each c14n example by
downloading the spec and opening it in a text editor.

Be careful to download it as a binary file.  For example, use IE and you go
to the c14n spec, then right click the link to the c14n spec and choose
'Save Target As...", note that you have to choose 'All files' in the 'Save
as type' popup so that IE will not rewrite the HTML for you as it comes
down.

Inside, there are comments containing the intended XML for each example
(except possibly the use of \r\n line delimiters).  As well, the actual HTML
for producing the examples contains <br/> commands to indicate line breaks
and nbsp; for the specific number of spaces whenever multiple consecutive
spaces are needed.

Finally, note that the input for ex.3.6 requires a version number, and
example 3.4 needs to have the leading and trailing space removed from the id
attribute in the normId element (both previously found by Gregor Karlinger,
and the latter reported more recently by Doug Bunting).  As well, note that
the normId element in 3.4 intentionally doesn't work on validating
processors.  When I tweak this example (soon), I will add a line that
demonstrates almost all the same functionality for validating processors.

Regards,
John Boyer

Hi,

I've attached a gzipped tarchive containing the usual suspects:

  signature-enveloped-dsa.xml
  signature-enveloping-b64-dsa.xml
  signature-enveloping-dsa.xml
  signature-enveloping-hmac-sha1-40.xml
  signature-enveloping-hmac-sha1.xml
  signature-enveloping-rsa.xml
  signature-external-b64-dsa.xml
  signature-external-dsa.xml

Of minor interest is signature-enveloping-b64-dsa.xml which
performs a base 64 decode step over an Object containing some
base 64 data.

In addition, there is a subdirectory containing the c14n stages
of each signature. The largest change was in this aspect of the
spec so this is where I believe most problems will occur.

Major caveat: I've only managed to put a few hours into this,
and my c14n with namespace axis is not happy. Fortunately, my
greatest enemy is XPath and that is not represented here. So,
while I can't say that I think I've tracked the latest specs,
i don't think I'm too far off.

Gregor: I could not verify your examples. Can you fire against
mine and see if the problem is mutual? Perhaps we should compare
c14n offline?

Joseph: I'll try to produce a c14n stress signature. We also
need a bunch more tests of the implicit comment stripping,
etc.

John: Do you have a copy of the c14n examples outside of an
HTML document. I've had a hard time getting some of the weirder
ones to work..
