I have a question regarding the expected behavior for caclulating the digest
value of the null URI (URI="") in case if reference does not contain a
Transforms element.  URI="" identifies the nodeset (minus any comment nodes)
of the XML resource containing the signature.  The Transforms element is
optional.  Does application that calculates a digest value has to skip this
reference from calculation, or skip the digest value element, or skip the
text of the digest value element, or indicate an error/warning?  Is the test
for such expected behavior a part of the compatibility tests?  Any reply is
appreciated.
