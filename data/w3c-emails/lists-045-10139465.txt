Such information can be readily captured using the
existing signature property framework. There are
many possible implementations; for example:

  <SignedInfo>
    <Reference ID="foo" ...>
    ...
  </SignedInfo>
  ...
  <SignatureProperty>
    <DateTime Target="#foo" Value="..." />
    ...
  </SignatureProperty>

I can't see the strong argument for modifying the
current dsig versus using this type of mechanism.

I suspect you might also be able to define a DT
attribute in an external namespace and add it to
references without changing the existing model.
