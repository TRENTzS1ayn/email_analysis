Hi Amir,

This seems like the beginning of a never ending series of special
fields to give you a clue about the data. I think all of this should
be in the URI.  You say that URI's "refer to a resource which may
change over time". But that isn't necessarily true. For your suggested
special proposed DT field to be of any use, there must be a mechanism
for retrieving the data with "name" & "DT". So why not just say
something like "mechanism:name?DT" ?  URI's are supposed to provide a
Uniform Resouce Identifier to all resources of arbitrary specificity
or generality.

Most implementations of http just stuff query parameters into
environment variables or some assoicative array and ignore any
extra/unknown varaibles anyway.  I just tried appending
"?DT='2001-07-04T17:49:04T' to the URIs for a variety of well know web
sites including both www.w3.org and www.ietf.org and they all worked
fine, ignoring this additiona info. But even it that broke the average
web site, in your case you apparently have some mechanism that wants
to see the date and time so it should be implemented to anticiapte, at
least optionally, the presence of such a query parameter.

It would certainly be reasonable to throw in a sentence suggesting
this technique in the XMLDSIG write-up. Something like

"Systems which need additional information to specify the precise data
signed, such as date and time, geographic location of creation, name
of author, etc., can be designed to provide such information as query
parameters to the Reference URI."

Thanks,
Donald
