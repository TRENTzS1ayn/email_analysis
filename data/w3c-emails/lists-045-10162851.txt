While there isn't anything to stop someone from doing this, it seems
to me it violates the idea that a SignatureProperty is supposed to be
something about the signature/digest process itself, not about the
data.  Seems to me that your verifier wants to be able to hand just
the URI (usually obtained from the attribute but sometimes from the
application context) and give this URI to a data retrieval service
without having to worry about something off in a a SignatureProperties
element. If we had a DataProperties element near the URI, that would be
a fine place for this, but we don't.

Thanks,
Donald

PS: Another kind of data property you might want to give is language.
Systems should just be desiged so this can all be encoded into the URI
one way or the other.
