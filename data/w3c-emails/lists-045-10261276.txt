Hi Blake,

You're right, for Canonical XML there isn't much of a reason. *But* since 
other canonicalizations can be used, in order to satisfy the "see what you 
sign" (and its sister maxims) you should reference validate (see) what was 
signed (canonical form.) An area where this might be important is where a 
canonicalization algorithm rewrote URIs. Even something as innocuous as 
absolutizing relative URIs (which was a point of debate with respect to 
namespaces) could change what it is your signing.

Canonical XML doesn't make any such changes, and one could optimize 
appropriately, but since the specification is generally written from an 
algorithm independent point of view it includes that processing/warning.
