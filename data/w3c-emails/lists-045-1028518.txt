[I'm cc:ing the list so we have a record of the changes, most of these are 
small, but I wouldn't want to make a change on the SPKIData front without 
the list seeing it.]

Good point. However, I think like PGPKeyID, the intent is for people to plug 
in actual present-day SPKI structures (and not an XML representation) . So 
this would be a Canonical S-expression that is octects (or their base-64 
encoding)  [1] and could be reprsented as PCDATA. If this is the case, it's 
the schema that is off; the schema declaration for SPKIData should simply be:
   <element name='SPKIData' type='string' minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='1'/>

Do people agree with my recollection?

Ok, typo fixed.

This has been noted and corrected in editors' copy, it is optional.

Fixed. (Fortunately, these are already correct in the actual schema and DTD 
because I can validate and parse them, whereas the excerpts in the spec seem 
to get a little out of line!)

>4.4.6

Fixed.

Thanks for your comments!
