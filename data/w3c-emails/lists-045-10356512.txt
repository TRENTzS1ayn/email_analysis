     Actually, IMHO, the main reason this doesn't work as a
SignatureProperty is that the time is typically different for each external
Reference element.  If one wanted to construct an Object with this function
it would have to have both a time and the ID of the Reference (thus
requiring that the Reference have an ID).
     However, is putting the date and time in the URI any cleaner than
putting it into the ID with a delimiter?  The ID doesn't have any standard
internal structure, but there is no really standard way of adding
non-retrieval-related information to a URI without affecting its retrieval
characteristics either.

Hi Merlin,

Sure, if you just want to record the time data was actually retrieved
when the signature was generated, that's fine as a SignatureProperty.
But that isn't what Amir said. He said that one message wanted to
refer to another message based on the message date.  That is to say,
this date and time were data labeling information and didn't have
anything to do with when the data was actually retrieved or the
signature actually generated. In his case, using SignatureProperties
does not conform to their intent. If this D&T are being used by some
retrieval method, then it should be possible to encapsulate that
retrieval method into a URI scheme and all of the retrieval parameters
into a URI.  (While that is the right way to do it, practical
considerations may make it a lot easier to stick the info elsewhere in
some circumstances.)

Thanks,
Donald
