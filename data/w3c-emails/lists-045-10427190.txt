Thinking again on Merlin's note... He suggested adding a ReferenceProperties
element within Object, thereby not requiring change in the spec. But, I
believe we can place the Object tag only in the main Signature element,
which makes the linkage between it and the reference itself quite obscure;
also, since we obviously need to _sign_ the date/time (or other reference
property), this requires to also sign the Object, which makes it even more
complex. 

If we could have Object in Reference also, as a general extension mechanism,
it would mostly solve the problem (except it would leave the time
non-standardized - I think time is such an important element of many
signatures that we should have standardized way to specify it). 

So I still prefer us to agree on a simple DT attribute to Reference. But
allowing Object under Reference would be almost as good.
