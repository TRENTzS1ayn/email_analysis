I suggest to clarify XML 1.0 by making the word 'content' in the
definition of 'empty' a reference to '#NT-content'.

Btw.:

  Original Input            | Canonical representation
  --------------------------+-------------------------
  <elem />                  | <elem></elem>
  <elem></elem>             | <elem></elem>
  <elem><![CDATA[]]></elem> | <elem></elem>

Since in the original input the element is not empty, it is in the
canonical representation, I won't call that "logically equivalent",
maybe this should be listed in the "Limitations" section of XML C14N.
