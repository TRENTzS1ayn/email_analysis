Sure, depending on your point of view, the fact that Canonical XML
discards the information as to where CDATA sections were in XML input
is a "limitation" or a "benefit". Just like the fact that XPath
discards where most namespace delcarartions were in XML input. There
would be no harm in specifically mentioning this partiuclar
consequence of dicarding the existence of CDATA sections as a
limitation of Canonical XML.
