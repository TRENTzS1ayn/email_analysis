Note, it's a more verbose restatment (with examples) of what is already said 
in the spec:

http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html#sec-See

    Some applications might operate over the original or intermediary
    data but should be extremely careful about potential weaknesses
    introduced between the original and transformed data. This is a
    trust decision about the character and meaning of the transforms
    that an application needs to make with caution. Consider a
    canonicalization algorithm that normalizes character case (lower to
    upper) or character composition ('e and accent' to 'accented-e'). An
    adversary could introduce changes that are normalized and
    consequently inconsequential to signature validity but material to a
    DOM processor. For instance, by changing the case of a character one
    might influence the result of an XPath selection. A serious risk is
    introduced if that change is normalized for signature validation but
    the processor operates over the original data and returns a
    different result than intended.

That's a mistake. &disg;#base64 is a decode transform, there's no URI yet 
for an encode algorithm as there isn't much use for such a thing besides 
examples! <smile/> If there was an base64-encode URI, it would be different 
than the one I gave.
