To 3.2.2 the last point of the notes was:

<cite>
Different implementations may produce different [...]. That is because they 
may encode the relevant DigestValue in the Reference to the data with 
different white space or the like.
</cite>

I think the produce different SignatureValues because the signature 
algorithm uses some random value  (time varian parameter) during signature 
generation which is used to protect against some attacks. This is the 
reason why you can supply some SecureRandom (in JAVA) to a Signature 
generation. ...

I would add "That is because ... white space or because of algorithm 
behaviour."
