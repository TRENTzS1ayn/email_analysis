I think that this may be part of a bigger issue raised later
in [2]. I agree with you that it is probably smart for us to
derive from string.

It is not clear to me whether a schema-validated document is
required to expose both the initial value (i.e., post-DTD)
and the schema-normalized value, or whether it can expose just
the schema-normalized value. But schema validation may
introduce a set of normalization problems with signed docs.
