Ok, I appreciate the need to make some of the changes you did make (some of 
them are even things I asked for), and (un)fortunately because of other 
dependencies (i.e. C14N relative URIs) this won't affect this too much 
because we are not yet on the Standards track. I hope to move to the latest 
version prior to going to Candidate REC (as soon as we finish up these last 
minute editorial issues), though I can see it's going to be some work 
(successfully migrating, then updating the in-line examples in the spec). 
Regardless, now that you've made these changes, I'd _further_ encourage the 
WG not to twiddle with the syntax! <smile>

I tried to apply this to [1] and I get nothing back (not even an HTTP 
error). I grabbed the XSLT out of the CVS space and it merely processed the 
nodes (removing the internal subset and comments) without any change.

Ok, I'm glad to see this. I'm still a little confused by what conventions 
you use in H10 [2] to distinguish between:
1. a latest version: ? (should it have a date at all?)
2. a dated/stable version: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema ?
3. it's instance: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance ?

The decision is acceptable though as stated I need a little more help in 
understanding its effects.
