Hi Eric,

Does rewriting anything other than all prefixes actually provide
any benefit?

I understand that normalizing namespace prefixes may be useful to
applications that do not preserve this information. However, if
we are not to normalize certain prefixes then that implies that
the relevant application will also preserve those prefixes, which
implies that it could preserve all prefixes?

I presume that you have a use in mind; can you elaborate?
