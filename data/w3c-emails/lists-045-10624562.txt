Hi Eric,

Could you explain a bit more clearly what you mean by "specify which
namespaces prefixes cannot be rewritten"?  An example to show the
behavior you would expect of such a feature would be helpful.

It is difficult to tell without more information why the regular XML
c14n does work in the following:

"If I wanted to canonicalize a XSLT template or a W3C XML Schema element
definition I would certainly like to preserve all the prefixes."

Thanks,

I was proposing this by analogy with UnsuppressedNamespacePrefixList...

If I wanted to canonicalize a XSLT template or a W3C XML Schema element
definition I would certainly like to preserve all the prefixes.

A common class of applications that will likely be using QNames are all
the applications using XPointer expressions.

The latest XPointer LC offers a way to define the namespaces within the
XPointer expression itself [1], though and these applications should now
be able to deal with NS prefixes rewriting.

I am not a great supporter of using QNames as values and I was more
concerned by finding a way to (optionally) include prefix rewriting in
the canonicalization method than by the granularity of the feature and,
you're right, a boolean parameter (RewritePrefixes or
DontRewritePrefixes) may be a better way to achieve it.
