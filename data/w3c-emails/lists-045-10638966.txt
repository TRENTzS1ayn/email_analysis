Yes, sorry I haven't been clear.

I was refering to "No Namespace Prefix Rewriting" [1], a point that you
have well described in Canonical XML.

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#NoNSPrefixRewriting

I think that some (not to say many) applications would not suffer from
namespaces prefixes rewriting and that for those applications, rewriting
namespaces prefixes would increase the reliability of the comparaisons.

It does work since it doesn't rewrite any prefixes.

But since an "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" is being developped that
is more stringent than regular c14n and accepts at least one parameter,
I think it would be worth considering adding a second parameter to
switch prefixes rewriting on and off.

Regular c14n would then be the "safe" choice while Exclusive c14n would
be more precise tool to tailor the c14n to your needs.
