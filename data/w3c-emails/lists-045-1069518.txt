Ok, thanks for staying with me on this, but I still feel we're not on the 
same path.

Ok, let me restate the scenario:

Forget about KeyInfo for the time being.

In order for applications to do signature validation (3.2.2) it must use the 
specified SignatureMethod algorithm identifier. Since that is part of 
SignedInfo, and SignedInfo is potentially altered by CanonicalizeMethod 
before it is signed, signature validation should see the canonicalized form 
of the SignatureMethod algorithm identifier.
