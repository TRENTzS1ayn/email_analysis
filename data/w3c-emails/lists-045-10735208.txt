I just look at &exc; as the specification for an algorithm and &more;
as a specification for how certain algorithms are identified and encoded
for use in &dsig;. In much the same way, &c14n; specifies an algorithm
and &dsig; specifies (among other things) algorithm identifiers and
parameter encoding. The &exc; document is not tied to &dsig; and really
doesn't need to know how it will be encoded.

If this is not how things are, then I'm wrong. merlin
