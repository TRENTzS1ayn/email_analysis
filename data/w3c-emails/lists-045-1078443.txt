     Speaking of MINOR corrections, it's ISO/IEC 9594-8:1997 in the
reference.  The colon is needed.  No comments as to the anatomical location
of this correction are needed, however :-)

Ok, so I've tweaked that section as follows:

4.4.4 The X509Data Element
...
An X509Data element within KeyInfo contains one or more identifiers of keys
or X509 certificates (or certificates' identifiers or revocation lists).
Five types of X509Data are defined
1. The X509IssuerSerial element, which contains an X.509 issuer
distinguished name/serial number pair that SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253
[LDAP-DN],
2. The X509SubjectName element, which contains an X.509 subject
distinguished name that SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253 [LDAP-DN],
3. The X509SKI element, which contains an X.509 subject key identifier
value.
4. The X509Certificate element, which contains a Base64-encoded [X509v3]
certificate, and
5. The X509CRL element, which contains a Base64-encoded certificate
revocation list (CRL) [X509v3].
