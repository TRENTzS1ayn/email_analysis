The path part is absolute if it starts with a "/". In your last
example "/../blah" is an absolute path because it assumes a root
starting place while "../blah" is relative to wherever you happen to
be.

Any complete "//" type URI, that is, one with "scheme://" in it, has
to be absolute because the path part starts with a "/" and the root is
defined by the stuff before that "/".  So in your last example,
"http://www.w3.org" defines a root (probably as part of the
configuration of that http server) and "/../blah" navigates from that
root. It is absolute because it is indpendent of the context ("web
page") where this URL occurs.
