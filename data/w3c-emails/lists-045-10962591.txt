I've taken a stab and tweaking the text of XSLT, and including a similar 
section on Schema. (I know the formatting isn't, but I want to send this 
before I have to run.)

Presently it states:

http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html#sec-XSLT
>6.6.5 XSLT Transform
>Use of the XSLT transform without any parameters indicates that any in-line 
>XSLT within the resource being processed should occur (see examplein [XSLT, 
>2.3]). Use of a namespace-qualified stylesheet element, which MUST be the 
>sole child of the Transform element, indicates that the specified style 
>sheet processing should occur; whether this instantiates in-line processing 
>as well is determined by the XSLT processing model. No special provision is 
>made for the identification of a remote stylesheet at a given URI because 
>it can be communicate via an xml:include or xsl:import within a stylesheet 
>child of the Transform.

I wonder in the XSLT or schema case (which has similar text), if this is 
correct, or if we can say anything more " is determined by the XSLT 
processing model" which respect to being clear about the order of processing 
that might occur?
