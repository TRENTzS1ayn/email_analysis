I don't really care that much where the documentation of the algorithm
URI and parameters for Exclusive XML Canonicalization go. But XMLDSIG
is quite stable so I don't think we want to add things there.  It
seems to me that the More XMLDSIG URIs document is really intended for
secondary things. So I guess I lean towards putting it in the
EXCL-C14N specification.
