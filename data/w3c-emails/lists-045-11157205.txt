Hi Blake,

I wasn't going to continue this thread yesterday because the discussion
seemed pretty much over, but apparently one of the things you agreed to
was not fully understood.  Could you please explain why your proposed
text is true?

<blake>
Joesph,

How about something like:

"Canonicalization is used implicitly when a node-set is converted to an
octet stream in the transformation pipeline. Care should be made not to
include it unnecessarily as an explicit transform. Doing so may affect
core
processing performance."
</blake>

I do not believe this is true.  If you include it as an explicit
transform, then the result is an octet stream, so a double
canonicalization does not occur.  Hence there is no performance
degradation resulting from stating the c14n explicitly.
