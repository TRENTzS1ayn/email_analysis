Hi Joseph and Blake,

If C14N is called with a node-set, then it processes the node-set.  Only
if it is called with an octet stream does it behave as if running an
XPath that eliminates comments.  Therefore to retain the default
behavior of stripping comments, we defined the processing model for
References as stripping the comments out.

As to why comment stripping is the default and required c14n, the WG
decided that comment stripping represented the lowest common denominator
XML processor, which is not strictly required to provide comments to the
calling application.

I too am a little foggy on the relationship of XPointer and comments
here. 
The appropriate text is:

Since one has the option of deciding which c14n to use (the implicit
without 
comments, or an explicit with comments, or an explicit without) I no
longer 
remember why the XPath nodeset processing needs this final step? John?
