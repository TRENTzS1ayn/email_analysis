Sure, putting it at the top is a good idea.

I meant they can either do a comparison based on a decoded octet
stream or on that stream converted to an arbitrary precision integer.
These might differ in which is considered larger if they are different
(left versus right justification, signs, etc.) but should come out
with the same answer on equal or not.

Thanks,
Donald
