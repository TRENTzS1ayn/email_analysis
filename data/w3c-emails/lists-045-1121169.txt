Hrmmm... well my immediate goal was to make your examples a bit more pretty 
like Kent's example from the last version [1]; this has white space 
indenting in SignedInfo. However, Tidy started as an HTML processor and 
white space isn't important in that context for element content. But I think 
your right, in our context it  does matter. Consequently, this means that 
while you might verify Kent's Signature and Kent might verify your 
Signature, your two applications (when signing the same document with the 
same key and everything else equal) will yield a different SignatureValue 
depending on how you output the XML.

Regardless, I restored your tested examples (if I grabbed the right ones out 
of my attach directory! <smile>) to [2], and if someone provides me with 
pretty and tested examples, I'll include them.
