I think it's taking the text to text view of canonicalization. In the
first part it is just repeating the requirement in the XML 1.0 
Recommendation that all XML parser must understand UTF-8 and UTF-16
encodings. In the second phrase, it is syaing that if your parser
understands some non-UCS encoding, it must translate that to UCS
code pooints.

>2. Question: How did you check the 3rd processor requirement: 
>"Implementations MUST NOT be implemented with an XML parser that

>Xerces) convert a URI? Does a parser understands what a URI is?

Don't know about a parser but a schema verifier would, I think.
If it knows that some attribute value is a URI, who knows what
it might do to it... knowledge can be a dangerous thing.
