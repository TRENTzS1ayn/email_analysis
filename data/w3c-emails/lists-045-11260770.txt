Hi Donald,

OK, this relates to Schema. My question is:

Do we have some test vectors (like 3.1-3.7 examples in the c14n spec) that 
define the correct behaviour? I'm looking for test vectors (correct and bad 
ones) that allow me to ensure functionality of my implementation. For 
instance I want to ensure that an input like

<absolute:correct      xmlns:absolute='http://www.absolute.org/#likeVodka'>
<relative:incorrect    xmlns:relative='../cheating#away'>
</relative:incorrect>
</absolute:correct>

throws an CanonicalizationException because of the use of relative URIs. Do 
we have something like this for the above topic?

Question to IBM and IAIK: How did you test this behaviour?


Regards, Christian
