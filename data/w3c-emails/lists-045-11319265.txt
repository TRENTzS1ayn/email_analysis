What does section "6.6.2 Base64" mean whan it states:

"If an XPath node-set (or sufficiently functional alternative) is given as 
input, then it is converted to an octet stream by performing operations 
logically equivalent to 1) applying an XPath transform with expression 
self::text(), then 2) taking the string-value of the node-set."

Is the following fragment valid input which decodes to "The URI of the 
transform is http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#base64"
