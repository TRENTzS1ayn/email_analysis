Hi all,

Question: "The Reference Processing Model" [1] describes that if the data 
object is an octet stream and the next transform requires a node-set, the 
octet stream has to be parsed and converted to an XPath node set.

What exactly does this mean?

If I reference an octet stream which is an XML document, I have to parse 
it. After this step, do I  apply "(//. | //@* | //namespace::*)" to the 
Document to get the node set so that it contains all nodes in the Document 
or does the node set contain only the Document Node?

Christian
