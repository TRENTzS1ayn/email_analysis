 Algorith \ Document size | 1.5KB | 18KB | 902KB
-------------------------------------------------
 non-validated parsing    | 1.0   | 1.0  | 1.0
 c14n                     | .44   | 0.52 | 0.84
 exclusive c14n           | .48   | 0.69 | 1.58
 reaglonicalization       | .36   | 0.42 | 0.82

Times down a column are measured relative to the
parsing time; times across a row are independent;
the large documents were quite repetitious.

All the values are, of course, meaningless, except
to possibly conclude that Reaglonicalization may
be an acceptable substitute for Exclusive
Canonicalization that fits Joseph's desired
parameters (no slower than regular c14n).
