Hi Christian,

The inserted <comment> element (which is not an XML comment, but rather
an XML element like any other) would cause a problem for base-64
decoding.  The behavior to mimic is XPath string(), which  concatenates
all descendant text nodes.

What does section "6.6.2 Base64" mean whan it states:

"If an XPath node-set (or sufficiently functional alternative) is given
as 
input, then it is converted to an octet stream by performing operations 
logically equivalent to 1) applying an XPath transform with expression 
self::text(), then 2) taking the string-value of the node-set."

Is the following fragment valid input which decodes to "The URI of the 
transform is http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#base64"
