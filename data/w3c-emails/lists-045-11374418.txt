The last two open issues for XMLDSIG [1] (aside from discussion and 
editorial tweaks) included questions about the format of the base64 type and 
invariances resulting from one person using schema validation, and another 
not.

In the last two weeks we've addressed these by:
1. Receiving feedback [2] from the Schema WG as to the lexical forms of 
base64 types. I'll also forward the results of our minutes to that WG with 
respect to our preferences for its schema normalized form [3].
2. Understanding that schema validation is like any other transform: if 
transmitter executes it, but the recipient doesn't, the signature may break. 
This is best addressed by the use of an explicit transform [4]

Consequently, I have marked these issues as closed and Don and I will start 
the process to advance the spec to the next maturity level in the IETF and 
W3C.
