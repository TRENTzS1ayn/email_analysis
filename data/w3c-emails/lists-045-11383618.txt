Hello,

I know this is a bit off topic, but I am trying to think up an XPath
expression that can be used with the XPath transform that will
exclude an attribute from an element. Can anyone help me with this?

For example, given:

<Reference URI="#foo"> ... </Reference>

I want the data that is signed to be

<Reference> ... </Reference>

This would allow me to change the URI without altering the validity of the
signature.

Kind Regards,
