Hi Gregor,

As far as I (possibly we) understand it, schema-normalized values are
*not* exposed as part of the standard XML infoset (and thus probably
not DOM), but as part of the post schema-validation infoset, which is
an augmentation, not a replacement, of the XML infoset.

So, any canonical form for base64 should not affect signature processing.

Also, there is a proposal that schema validation be an *explicit*
transform, so the possibility of sender/recipient schema validation
conflict (defaulted values) may be reduced. Of course, this won't
really help in the case of same-document references.

Merlin
