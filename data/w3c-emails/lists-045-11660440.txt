Presently, the transform requires octets on input and yields octets on 
output. The XSLT spec processing model requires:

1. A source tree [1].
2. An XSLT instance.
3. "An XSLT processor may output the result tree as a sequence of bytes, 
although it is not required" [2].

I want to make sure that it's our intent to book-end this with octets when 
you might want to do node-list to node-list transforms. (Or do we simply 
assume implementations might make do this as an optimization without ill 
effect?)
