As far as I know you are using Xerces as parser for your toolkit. How do
you deal with the related behaviour of Xerces? Xerces does not provide
an interface for "exposing the post-schema validation infoset , beyond
that provided by DOM or SAX;".

So this means that if I turn on validating parsing in Xerces I get a DOM
document with schema-normalized base64Binary values. It seems that Xerces
does this validation not on all types. For instance, no normalization is
done for an integer type. Currently I have not found a way to avoid this
behaviour.

As you state, this does help neither for same-document references nor for
getting the octets that form the input of cryptographic signature
validation.

BTW, Merlin: I have not able to send you email to merlin@baltimore.ie in
the last couple of days, since I always get back an unknown user error
from the baltimere.ie postmaster.
