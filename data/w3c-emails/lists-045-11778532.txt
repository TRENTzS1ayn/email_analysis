Internet Society's 2002 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium  (NDSS'02)

Catamaran Resort - San Diego, California
February 6-8, 2002

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper and panel submissions due August 22, 2001
Author notification October 17, 2001
Final version of papers and panels due November 20, 2001

GOAL: The symposium fosters information exchange among research scientists and practitioners of network and distributed system security services. The target audience includes those interested in practical aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus on actual system design and implementation (rather than theory). A major goal is to encourage and enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the state of available security technology. The proceedings are published by the Internet Society.

OUTSTANDING PAPER AWARD: There will be an Outstanding Paper award. The award will be presented at the symposium to the authors of an outstanding paper, as selected by the Program Committee.

SUBMISSIONS: Both technical papers and panel proposals are solicited. Technical papers must include a main body of at most 12 pages, with any additional details in clearly marked appendices for a combined total of at most 20 pages. Technical papers will appear in the proceedings. Panel proposals should be one page and must describe the topic, identify the panel chair, explain the panel format, and list three to four potential panelists. A description of each panel will appear in the proceedings, and may, at the discretion of the panel chair, include written position statements from the panelists.

Submissions are solicited in, but not limited to, the following areas:
* Integrating security in Internet protocols: routing, naming, TCP/IP, multicast, network management, and the Web.
* Intrusion avoidance, detection, and response: systems, experiences and architectures.
* Attack-resistant protocols and services.
* Network perimeter controls: firewalls, packet filters, application gateways.
* Virtual private networks.
* Public key infrastructure, key management, certification, and revocation.
* Secure electronic commerce: e.g., payment, barter, EDI, notarization, timestamping, endorsement, and licensing.
* Supporting security mechanisms and APIs; audit trails; accountability.
* Implementation, deployment and management of network security policies.
* Intellectual property protection: protocols, schemas, implementations, metering, watermarking, digital rights management.
* Fundamental services on network and distributed systems: authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, authorization, non-repudiation, and availability.
* Integrating security services with system and application security facilities and protocols: e.g., message handling, file transport/access, directories, time synchronization, data base management, boot services, mobile computing.
* Security for emerging technologies: sensor networks, specialized testbeds, wireless/mobile (and ad hoc) networks, personal communication systems, and large heterogeneous distributed systems.
* Special problems and case studies: e.g., interplay and tradeoffs between security and efficiency, usability, reliability and cost.
* Security for collaborative applications and services: teleconferencing and video-conferencing, groupwork, etc.

Each submission must contain a separate Submission Overview specifying the submission type (paper or panel), the title or topic, author names with organizational affiliations, and must specify a contact author along with corresponding phone number, FAX number, postal address and email address.

Submissions must be received by August 22, 2001, and must be made electronically in either printable PostScript or PDF. Each submission will be acknowledged by e-mail; if acknowledgment is not received within seven days, contact a program co-chair (see above). Authors and panelists will be notified of acceptance by October 17, 2001, and given instructions for preparing the camera-ready copy. The camera-ready copy must be received by November 20, 2001. 

FURTHER INFORMATION: Official dates, the final call for papers, the advance program, and registration information will be available shortly at http://www.isoc.org/ndss2002. For official submission information, visit http://www.isoc.org/ndss2002/cfp.
