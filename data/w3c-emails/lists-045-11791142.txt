We're now at PR; Don and I are sending the new ietf-draft in and hopefully 
we'll be able to get approval to publish it as a Draft Standard in the same 
time frame as the W3C Advisory Committee Review and Director decision.

My only concern is that I've introduced little editorial errors into the 
document so this is our last chance to catch them before we're done! <smile/>

Status of this document

This document is a Proposed Recommendations (PR) of the W3C. The IETF/W3C XML 
Signature Working Group(W3C Activity Statement) believes this specification 
addresses all issues raised during Candidate Recommendation and its 
specification is sufficient for the creation of independent interopable 
implementations (see the Interoperability Report).

W3C Advisory Committee Members are invited to send formal review comments to 
the W3C Team until 17 September 2001 at xml-dsig-review@w3.org.The public is 
invited to send comments to the editors and the public mailing list 
w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org (archive ).

After the review the Director will announce the document's disposition. This 
announcement should not be expected sooner than 14 days after the end of the 
review. Advancement (or even the announcement) will not occur until the 
Director is confident of its advancement to Draft Standard in the IETF.

Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on the Working 
Group's patent disclosure page, in conformance with W3C policy, and the IETF 
Page of Intellectual Property Rights Notices, in conformance with IETF policy.

Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the 
W3C membership. This is still a draft document and may be updated, replaced 
or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite a 
W3C Proposed Recommendations as other than a "work in progress." A list of 
current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be found at
