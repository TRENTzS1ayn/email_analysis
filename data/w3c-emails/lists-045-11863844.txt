Hi,

I more or less made up the format. It was intended to be a way to give
a less detailed skeleton so you could see the structure without being
buried in details.

If I recall properly, initially <> meant that either there was no
element content or the element content was given explicitly while ()
meant there was element content that was suppressed. But what's there
now has been changed considerably from the initial version....

I don't really care that much at this point and would be happy to
go with your version.

Thanks,
Donald
