Sorry fo bugging again. Could this be done by saying in the spec:

   "It's not possible to apply Transforms that produce octet
    stream output (like base64 or c14n) prior to
    #enveloped-signature transform or an #xpath transform
    that uses the here() function."

Would this make sense?

Christian
