Hi Christian,

That doesn't cover the case of applying the transform to a non-local URI.
At most, a sentence saying that enveloped signature cannot be applied to
a resource other than a node set from the original signature document.
Given that the usage seems nonsensical, I'm not sure that even this is
really necessary.
