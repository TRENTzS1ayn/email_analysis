Hi,

4.4.4 The X509Data Element:

The commented distinguished names in the example are
backwards; in text form they should go from CN to C,
as the non-commented distinguished name does. Also
the intermediate cert says "... issuer ,C=..." which
might be better expressed as "...;<br>issuer C=..."
or somesuch.
