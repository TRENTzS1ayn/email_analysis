You might not always have a SignatureProperty (or some other thing relating 
to it) but I would recommend every signature be provided with a URI. 

Regardless, for SignatureProperty we borrowed the grammar of RDF, and opted 
towards defining relationships with URIs instead of containment -- especially 
for anything outside of Core-Processing/Validation. Since SignatureProperties 
are in an Object, and might have nothing to do with that Signature it will 
always need an explicit relationship. One could've specified that sans a 
Target the application will need to know to which Signature it applies  to, 
or it always applies to the containor Signature but no one advocated this and 
it fell afar of the explicit RDF like grammar.
