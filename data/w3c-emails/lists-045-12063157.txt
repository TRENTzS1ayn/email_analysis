you will agree that, first, your example does not really reflect the usual
use-case. second, i would not recommend anyone to structure a document in
such a wired and inconvenient manner. third, the Target attributes do not
help you a lot in that case. because the application normally searches for
signatures and there it has to dereference all Reference elements in the
SignedInfo of each Signature. therefore, it knows, which Signature signs
what content and what SignatureProperty. if you are coming from the other
direction - the application has the SignatureProperties and wants to know,
what Signature covers what SignatureProperty - the application may follow
the Target reference. nevertheless, it has to verify if the Signature really
has a Reference to that SignatureProperty. moreover, if the application in
your example wants to have more than one Signature to cover the same
SignatureProperty, you cannot set a Target reference. it can be a
many-to-one reference, if several Signatures sign the same
SignatureProperty. and if you cannot share SignatureProperties among several
Signautre elements, it does not make sense to place them in a manner as your
example shows.
in my opinion, the Target reference attribute should be 'optional' rather
than 'required'.
