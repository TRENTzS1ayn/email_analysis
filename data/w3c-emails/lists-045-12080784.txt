Hi Joseph,

Two comments:

4.4.4 The X509Data Element (dname encoding)

I'd possibly suggest that instead of "compliant with RFC2253", we use
the text "compliant with the subset of RFC2253 described below" or
somesuch, because RFC2253 allows encodings that are not permitted
by the text that we have.

Is it intended that space be considered an ASCII control character; if
not, I'd suggest the text "\00-\1f inclusive".

In this case, leading and trailing ' ' should be escaped. If we want
to allow leading and trailing whitespace to be trimmed from dname
text nodes then we also need to state that a "\ " occuring at the
end of a dname must be replaced by "\20".

6.6.6 (always fortuitous to see) Schema Validation

You have some text relating to XSLT at the end of the first paragraph.

Merlin
