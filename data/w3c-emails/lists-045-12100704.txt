Hi Gregor,

I'm very strongly opposed to this. One of our goals is
human readability; Jim\20Smith Research\20&\20Development
is far from as readable as it should be. If we don't want
human readability, we should base 64 encode the DER-encoded
ASN.1 dname.

Realistically, it is a _trivial_ special case; all the
rest is RFC 2253.

Ignoring UTF-8 encoding, the current wording is:

RFC 2253 -> replace "\ " with "\20" -> replace 0x00-0x20 with "\xx"

My suggested wording is:

RFC 2253 -> replace 0x00-0x1f with "\xx" -> replacing trailing "\ " with "\20"

That's not much of a change.
