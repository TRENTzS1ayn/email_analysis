  I do not understand. In the email cited above it is stated that XML Schema
  does not provide default attributes as normalized values, but only as
  PSVI normalized attribute values. This is a problem different from what
  I have described, isn't it?

<Gregor>
  The problem I have results rather form using schema validation during the
  signature processing rather than using it as a Transform:

  In our implementation, when verifying a signature, we perform as a first
  step a schema validating parsing using Xerces to check the syntax of the
  signature.

  What we expect as the result of this parsing from Xerces are the
normalized
  values. Xerces fulfills these expectations, with one exception: The value
  of base64 types is presented in schema normalized form.

<Gregor>
  It is quite simple:
    1. Create an account (specify your name and email address) on page
       http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/createaccount.cgi
    2. Submit bug at page
       http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Xerces-J

<Gregor>
  No, unfortunately not. I mixed up things at that time and thought they
  are right.
