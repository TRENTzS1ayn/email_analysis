The content will be invalid regardless... Even in the entities we expect 
someone else to define (when they want to make practical use of the DTD in 
their own mixed content model) we use #PCDATA:

        <!ENTITY % Transform.ANY '(#PCDATA|XPath|XSLT)*'>

I'll create a
         <!ENTITY % SignatureProperty.ANY '(#PCDATA)*'>
         SignatureProperty.ANY '(#PCDATA)*'
which makes it clear that if folks are using the DTD, they will need to 
change it regardless. (I presumed people would go down into the DTD to 
change it, but since we have this convention we might as well use it.)

Fixed:

          <sequence minOccurs="0">
            <element name="Seed" type="ds:CryptoBinary"/>
            <element name="PgenCounter" type="ds:CryptoBinary"/>
          </sequence>

The example is fixed.
