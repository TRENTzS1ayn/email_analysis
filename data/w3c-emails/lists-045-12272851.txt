That's what that sentence is *supposed* to answer [1]. If you want to do 
multiple validations, use multiple transforms. If the schema have complex 
relationships between them, build your relationship with includes imports and 
the like.

[1] 
http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html#sec-SchemaValidation
... the ordered application of multiple schema validations may require 
multiple Transforms.... 
No special provision is made for the identification of a remote stylesheet at 
a given URI because it can be communicated via an xsd:include or xsd:import 
within the schema child of the Transform.
