I understand this. However, use of import/include requires me to reference
an external schema which may not be available. Using multiple transforms
is not equivalent to explicitly including all the relevant schemata in
a single transform. I cannot search for other validation transforms that
include a required schema, however I can search through multiple children
that may provide it.

It basically seems to me that support for a single schema child goes only
half way.  I am probably wrong, but the two meaningful options seem,
to me, either not to support any explicit schema child, or to support
multiple children. Very Irish of me, I know.
