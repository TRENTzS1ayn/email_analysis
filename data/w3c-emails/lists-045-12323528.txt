Hi Joseph,

> Christian/Merlin, I don't recall, did we ever resolve this proposal?

I actually don't know. For me, it reads like :

  "It's not possible to apply Transforms that produce octet
   stream output (like base64 or c14n) prior to
   #enveloped-signature transform or an #xpath transform
   that uses the here() function. Additionally, it's not
   possible to apply #enveloped-signature transform or an
   #xpath transform that uses here() to a non-local URI."

But I am not sure whether this is correct.
Christian
