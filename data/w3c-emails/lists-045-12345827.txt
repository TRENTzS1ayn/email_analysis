Hi all, 

In message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2001JulSep/0165.html,
Joseph adopted a minor modification I suggested to the `shorthand`
introduced and used by Don to provide high-level description of DSIG
appearing in the spec. 

I later looked at the `shorthand` Don used for XML Encryption, and I noticed
some minor differences. 

Let me offer some new text to describe the shorthand and a slightly improved
shorthand version, to be consistent btw DSIG and XML Encrypt and well
defined:

We show below, in a simplified, `shorthand` notation, the structure of DSIG
signatures. Elements appear zero or more times if followed by "*", zero or
once if followed by "?" and once or more if followed by "+". When not
followed by a symbol, elements appear exactly once. Attributes were removed,
as well as the contents and end tag of some elements. 

<Signature> 
     <SignedInfo>
         <CanonicalizationMethod/>
         <SignatureMethod/>
         <Reference>
             <Transforms>?
             <DigestMethod/>
