Gregor,

Since you already have an account and opened the issue, would you take the 
action to reopen the bug report [1] with an explaination that Xerces is 
collapsing the white space facet of the wrong item [2]? We can refer them to 
Henry Thomson and the Schema WG if they have further questions about the 
Infoset and Post Schema Infoset contributions.
