Hi Merlin,

On the other issues, great job!

On the xmlns="" issue, yes I see now that the example is incorrect.  You are
right that in e3, xmlns="" should not appear.  As a result, I will update
the example and get back to you shortly.  Also, condition 2 is redundant; I
had put it in to be clear about the fact that the top-level document element
will not ever receive an xmlns="", but I can make that clear in the sentence
that follows.

Excellent work, Merlin.

Thanks,

>From the spec, wrt element nodes, their namespace axis and emission of
xmlns="" iff:

1. Yhe element E that owns the axis is in the node-set

Here, element E is in the node set.

2. Element E has a parent element

Here, element E has a parent element.

3. The nearest ancestor element of E in the node-set has a default namespace
   node in the node-set (default namespace nodes always have non-empty
values
   in XPath)

Here, element E has no ancestor element in the node set.

Thus I do not see why this case qualifies for xmlns="".

Incidentally, it would appear to me that condition 3 implies condition
2 and thus condition 2 is redundant?

Yes, I was having ID problems. I've fixed them and attached a signature
using the standard expression.

I now only differ on example 7, as explained above.
