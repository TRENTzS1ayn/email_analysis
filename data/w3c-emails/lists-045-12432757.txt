See other recent threads - it's not clear whether it's a bug or a feature.

This _was_ a bug in XSV, in the sense of not conforming to the
spec. as written.  For some time now, you get

          <normalizedValue xsi:nil='true'/>
           . . .
          <psv:schemaNormalizedValue>baz</psv:schemaNormalizedValue>

from XSV -r.
