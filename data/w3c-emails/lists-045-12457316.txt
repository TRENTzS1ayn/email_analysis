Merlin has suggested that the white space not be escaped when encoded in a 
DNAME, and provides some tweaks to effect that change. Gregor responded 
that those tweaks were the reasons he escaped it in the first place. Merlin 
argued that the tweaks aren't that much trouble, they make the encoded text 
more human readable, and conforms to earlier examples -- which I think were 
the basis of the earlier conformance tests?

Consequently, I'd argue we should adopt the "\00-\1f inclusive" text unless 
I misunderstand the course of the argument or others want to argue against 
it.
