The following question asks what the parsing method is for XML1.0: 
well-formed or validating? I've presumed this is up to the applications, 
and most applications, if they want validating, will provide information 
necessary for that validation (e.g., a doctype). Should we provide a 
transform that makes it clear that one application requires validated 
parsing for signature validity (and consequently default attributes might 
be present where they wouldn't have otherwise), make validating parsing the 
default, or is the present state sufficient?
