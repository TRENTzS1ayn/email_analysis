And a test with an explicit inline schema. Untested, etc.

WRT the PR review comment, it seems inconsistent that we say
*don't* schema validate, but *maybe* DTD validate. I know
that this has been a question from at least one customer, so
some clarification might be in order. I'd vote for *don't*
validate against an external DTD either. We've nailed down
implicit serialization (c14n); implicit parsing might be
good too.
