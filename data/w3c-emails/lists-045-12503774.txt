Well fortunately, I'm don't think XML1.0 (DTD) validation will affect the 
instance all that much: introduces changes that survive C14N. We don't use 
default attributes/values in the signature DTD. We do define internal 
entities which require validating parsing, but I just added some text to 
1.3 saying while we use them for editorial purposes, they aren't 
recommended in actual instances.

Can anyone else think of anything that would break (survive C14N) where one 
party validated the signature, and the other didn't? (Or even yet, run a 
test?)

Can we leave it up to the application by permitting it to include the 
DOCTYPE with DTD reference or not? (This was my assumption.)

How many people actually DTD validate during their processing?
