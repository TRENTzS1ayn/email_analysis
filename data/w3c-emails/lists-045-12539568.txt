Note, if the Signature is enveloped or enveloping, [XML] or [XML-schema] 
validation of the document might introduce changes that break the 
signature. Consequently, applications should be careful to consistently 
process the document or refrain from using external contributions (e.g., 
defaults and entities).

I suppose we should do (c). I'd suggest the following as RECOMMENDED

What do others think?
