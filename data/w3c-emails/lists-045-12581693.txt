Hi Christian,

We leave it as a Unicode character. When the XML document is
serialized, it will be encoded as per the chosen character
set.

No.

I would summarize our encoding (assuming the changes recently
discussed on the list) as:

Translation from RFC 2253 -> XMLDSIG:

. UTF-8 decode the string.
. Encode characters < ' ' as "\XY".
. Replace any trailing "\ " in the full dname with "\20".

Translation from XMLDSIG -> RFC 2253:

. Replace any trailing "\20" with "\ ".
. Replace any "\XY" with the corresponding character.
. UTF-8 encode the string.

Broadly, this is RFC 2253 without the UTF-8 encoding step,
with all characters < ' ' encoded as "\XY" and any trailing
"\ " in the full dname replaced with "\20".

To be honest, I would be cautious about the text that we have
in XMLDSIG; it duplicates material from RFC 2253 and may lose
clarity in so doing.

I've checked none of the above, so may be way off the mark.
