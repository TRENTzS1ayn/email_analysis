Given no objection to my summary/proposal [1], I've moved the escape of 
whitespace to those only occuring at the end of DNAME as you proposed:

[ 
http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/#sec-X509Data
$Revision: 1.123 $ on $Date: 2001/09/14 16:55:21 $
...
     * Escape all occurrences of ASCII control characters (Unicode range
       \x00 - \x [INS: 1f :INS] ) by replacing them with "\" followed by
       a two digit hex number showing its Unicode number.
     * [INS: Escape any trailing white space by replacing "\ " with
       "\20". :INS]
]

If you'd like to an improvement, please do!
