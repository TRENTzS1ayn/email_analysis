Hi,

 I have a comment on the X509CRLs structure.

 In verifying, do you use X509CRLs which is created before verifying?
If X509CRLs are all valid, then there is no problem.
But if there is an invalid X509CRL of an invalid certificate,
should I get the new CRL for it?
 We would retrieve CRLs of invalid ceritifcates if it would be mixed
X509CRLs structure, and this would occurs invalid process. And if we would
not retrieve CRLs,
it would be uncertain to check certificate well by CRLs.

 I think X509CRLs are for speed up of a right system security check.
So I propose the following structure where we can check valid certificate by
valid X509CRLs, and check it by the system instead of invalid X509CRLs.

 <!ELEMENT X509Data (((X509IssuerSerial | X509SKI | X509SubjectName
 | X509Certificate), X509CRL*)+ %X509.ANY;)>
