Thank you for your comment. As you noted in your PR comment the X509 DTD 
had not been changed along with the spec and schema. (The DTD update was 
lost between [1] and [2], after Merlin raised the issue of the X509 
structure in his May [3] email entitled "X509CRL Discord". We altered the 
schema and text, but not the DTD.)

On this basis, I've changed the DTD to:

<!ELEMENT X509Data ((X509IssuerSerial | X509SKI | X509SubjectName |
                    X509Certificate | X509CRL )+ %X509Data.ANY;)>

However, to your question below, I defer to those more knowledgable about 
X509 processing.
