Hi Merlin,

I've changed example 3.7 as given below, and I am hoping you can provide
feedback ASAP on whether you concur with the new version:

Input:

<!DOCTYPE doc [
<!ATTLIST e2 xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'>
<!ATTLIST e3 id ID #IMPLIED>
]>
<doc xmlns="http://www.ietf.org" xmlns:w3c="http://www.w3.org">
   <e1>
      <e2 xmlns="">
         <e3 id="E3"/>
      </e2>
   </e1>
</doc>

XPath:

(//. | //@* | //namespace::*)
[
   self::e1 or (parent::e1 and not(self::text() or self::e2))
   or
   count(id("E3")|ancestor-or-self::node()) =
count(ancestor-or-self::node())
]

Canonical Form:

<e1 xmlns="http://www.ietf.org" xmlns:w3c="http://www.w3.org"><e3 xmlns=""
xmlns:w3c="http://www.w3.org" id="E3" xml:space="preserve"></e3></e1>

Hi,

Attached is a gzipped tarchive containing a signature over the
seven C14N examples from the latest C14N draft, hopefully
conforming to the latest signature draft. Included is also
the raw C14N output. However, there is still one difference
between my signature and the "correct" output so this should
not yet be considered a valid test of canonicalization.

All becomes clear. I have a patch for the Apache XML parser,
I'll clean it up and submit it to their dev list.

>From the spec, wrt element nodes, their namespace axis and emission of
xmlns="" iff:

1. Yhe element E that owns the axis is in the node-set

Here, element E is in the node set.

2. Element E has a parent element

Here, element E has a parent element.

3. The nearest ancestor element of E in the node-set has a default namespace
   node in the node-set (default namespace nodes always have non-empty
values
   in XPath)

Here, element E has no ancestor element in the node set.

Thus I do not see why this case qualifies for xmlns="".

Incidentally, it would appear to me that condition 3 implies condition
2 and thus condition 2 is redundant?

Yes, I was having ID problems. I've fixed them and attached a signature
using the standard expression.

I now only differ on example 7, as explained above.
