Speaking just as a WG member, Option 1 leads to the longest delays in
achieving higher standards levels.  The key phrase is "wait for
Interoperability".

Option 2 seems a bit flakey. There is a risk the higher approval
bodies will decide this is really just a variation of 1 and impose
delay. A better subvariation of option 2 would be to move them to an
informational Appendex but see 3 / 4 below.

Option 3 (labeled 2) and 4 seem best from the point of view of
advancing the XMLDSIG spec. And if we think we know what we want to
say about these transforms, which I believe we do, then putting them
in the additional URIs/algorithms informational document seems like it
adds value.

So I think option 4 is the best way to go.

Thanks,
Donald
