Right, it is describe in 4.4

Hrmm... I think I prefer to err on the side of making the RetrievalMethod 
author include a specific c14n in the transform.

Ok, new text:

4.4 The KeyInfo Element
.... The following list summarizes the KeyInfo types defined by this 
specification; these can be used within the RetrievalMethod Type attribute 
to describe the remote KeyInfo structure as represented as an octect stream.

4.4.3 The RetrievalMethod Element
.... RetrievalMethod uses the same syntax and dereferencing behavior as 
Reference's URI (section 4.3.3.1) and The Reference Processing Model 
(section 4.3.3.2) except that there is no DigestMethod or DigestValue child 
elements and presence of the URI is mandatory. Note, if the result of 
dereferencing and transforming the specified URI  is a node set, then it may 
need to be to be canonicalized.All of the KeyInfo types defined by this 
specification (section 4.4) require octets, consequently the Signature 
application is expected to attempt to canonicalize the nodeset via the The 
Reference Processing Model (section 4.3.3.2)
