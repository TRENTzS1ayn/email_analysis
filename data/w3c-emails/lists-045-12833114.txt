I'm confused by bullet "1." in section 4.4.4, which describes the X509Data
element.  It says each (from the following list) may appear more than
once if and only if the describe the same certificate.  But third paragraph
after the bullet list says all certificates must either be hold the
key or be in a cert chain.

So, is "describes" really mean "is related to" ?
