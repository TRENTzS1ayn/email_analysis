This has been reflected in:

http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html#sec-ReferenceProcessingModel

o If the data object is an octet stream and the next transform requires a 
node-set, the signature application MUST attempt to parse the octets 
yielding the required node-set /+via [XML] well-formed processing.+/
o If the data object is a node-set and the next transform requires octets, 
the signature application MUST attempt to convert the node-set to an octet 
stream /+using Canonical XML [XML-C14N].+/

I'm not convinced the latter addition (using C14N) is completely right 
though, but I think it is.
