Since both of you favored option1 (retaining these transforms) but also did 
not indicate you had immediate plans to implement/interoperate, has your 
plans for implementation changed?

If we wait to get interop on these, the *implementors* would determine how 
long that would take. If no one says, "it's a high priority, we should be 
able do interop testing within the month", I don't think we should delay ...
