     The order you give is the correct LDAP order.  The order currently in
the document matches the actual DN in ASN.1 and also the OSF syntax.  Since
we're using LDAP delimiters, we should probably use LDAP order.

Hi,

4.4.4 The X509Data Element:

The commented distinguished names in the example are
backwards; in text form they should go from CN to C,
as the non-commented distinguished name does. Also
the intermediate cert says "... issuer ,C=..." which
might be better expressed as "...;<br>issuer C=..."
or somesuch.
