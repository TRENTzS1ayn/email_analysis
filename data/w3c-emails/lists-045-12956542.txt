You are cordially invited to actively participate in the 2002
International World Wide Web Conference May 7-11 in Honolulu, Hawaii,
USA. Beginning with the first International WWW Conference in 1994, this
prestigious series of the International World Wide Web Conference
Committee (IW3C2) also provides a public forum for the WWW Consortium
(W3C) through the annual W3C track.

Hawaii's mid-Pacific location and multi-cultural heritage make it the
finest place in the world to draw together a mix of attendees from the
Americas, Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. International
researchers, technologists and leaders from industry, academia, and
government will gather at WWW2002 to define, refine, present,
demonstrate and discuss the latest ideas and developments in web
technologies. We want you to be one of them.

You can actively participate in WWW2002 through a variety of activities.
The conference will consist of a three-day technical program, preceded
by a day of tutorials and workshops and followed by a "Developers Day."
Developers Day will be devoted to in-depth technical sessions designed
specifically for web developers. The technical program will include
refereed paper presentations, peer-reviewed presentations, plenary
sessions, panels and poster sessions describing current work. The
tutorials and workshops will provide in-depth looks at specific areas of
current interest.

be invited to submit extended versions for publication in a special
issue of the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.


ALTERNATE TRACKS

Other program tracks at WWW2002 will address topics of interest through
presentations of current work, panel discussions and demonstrations.
Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee and all accepted
papers will be published in a separate proceeding from the ACM
publication used for the Refereed Papers Track. GeneraI questions about
these alternate tracks can be sent to Dave De Roure. Papers and
presentations are invited in the following areas:

   Education
   Global Community (includes culture & society
      and internationalization)
   Telehealth
   Practice & Experience
   Vendor Track


POSTER SUBMISSION

The poster area provides an opportunity for researchers and
practitioners to present and demonstrate their recent web-related
research and obtain feedback from their peers in an informal setting. It
gives conference attendees a way to learn about innovative works in
progress in a timely and informal manner. Accepted posters will be
displayed in a dedicated poster area and the presenters featured during
an evening poster reception. Abstracts will appear in a proceedings
volume distributed to all attendees.
