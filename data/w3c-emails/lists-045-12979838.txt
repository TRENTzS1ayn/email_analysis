Given the noted immaturity [1,2] of the XML Schema validation transform 
that was included prior to PR, the absense of a transform for XML1.0 
validation, and the lack of immediate plans for implementation and ability 
to do interop testing [3], the proposed text for XML validation transforms 
has been moved from the XML-DSIG [4] spec to a new document [5]. I spoke 
informally with TimBL (W3C Director) about this, and will add the 
advancement of this new document to Recommendation as a deliverable (along 
with Exclusive Canonicalization) during our next re-chartering. XML-DSIG 
*has* been clarified to state the default processing and serializaiton 
within the Transform processing model is well-formed and XML 
Canonicalization respectively. [6]
