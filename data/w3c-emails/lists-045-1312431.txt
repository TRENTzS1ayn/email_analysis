Hi,

The C14N of e3 should ?not? have xmlns:w3c.

Also, I do not believe that the XPath tests for (self|parent)::e(1|2)
are correct. The default namespace for those nodes is non-null, and I
think that 2.3 of REC-xpath suggests that if you want to capture this
in an XPath you must use a namespace prefix in scope for the expression.
Hence ietf:e(1|2) in my earlier version of the XPath. Which was...

  <Transform ...><XPath xmlns:ietf="http://www.ietf.org">...ietf:e1...

But I'm often wrong about namespaces, so I'm prepared again.

I think that adding a regular attribute to e1 would be potentially
useful for this example (i.e., <e1 foo="bar">), just so the second
clause of your XPath can capture more than just namespace nodes
(which are probably treated differently to regular attributes).

Also, an example of C14N on the e3 element below would be interesting:

<e1 xmlns="http://foo" xmlns:bar="http://baz">
  <e2 xmlns="" xmlns:bar="">
    <e3 ID="E3" />
  </e2>
</e1>

This captures that empty xmlns namespaces are not really inherited,
but empty xmlns:* are. At least, I think they are.
