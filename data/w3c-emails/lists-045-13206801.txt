Hi TAMURA,

 I agree with you at the point of not using X509CRLs in verifying.
But I don't agree with you on the KeyValue element.
 I think whether a KeyValue is trusted or not
is decided by a system, but not by a processor.
 So our XML signature processor rises an error event like SAX,
if a SignedInfo-verifying X509Certificate is not or is not trusted.
When it's NG as Signature , we throw an fatal Exception.
