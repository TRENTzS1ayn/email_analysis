Hi all,

I'm new to this mailing list and also new to XML Signature. I would like 
to use XML Signature to sign XML document (by inserting in them a signature 
tag) with a Java API. I had a look to XML Secure Suite which seems to be in 
addequation with what I want. On the other part I would like to be able to 
verify my XML document and be sure it has been signed and not modified 
since. I would like to do it with a C++ API ( a DLL would be a nice way).
Unfortunately, I can't find free C++ implementation of this standard. Does 
anyone know one?
It seems there is another way to verify signature using Microsoft Crypto 
API, does anyone aloready use it?

Thanks a lot

David.
