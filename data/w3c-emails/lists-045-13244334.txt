Hi all,

there's a new XML Signature implementation in town ;-)) Late, but anyhow, 
here it is.

I did not yet prepare the documentation for it completely,
I do not have a markting label, but what I can tell you
is the following:

- The (old) website is at [1]; there are also download
  instructions how to get the sources using CVS.
- Today, I packed an HTTP-downloadable package [2] which
  includes everything you need (except of the JAVA Development
  Kit). For easy compiling and testing, please use the Ant make-tool.
  The ZIP is 2.8 MB (sorry for this inconvenience). This is because
  Xerces and Xalan are included.
- The sources can be browsed online using the Web-CVS Front
  on Apache [3]. For discussion on this peace of software, there
  are mailing lists on xml.apache.org [4].
- The complete project is a new XML Apache project under Apache
  License. See [5] for more on the License. We will lauch the
  web-site in 1-2 weeks when the documentation is nicer to read...

Joseph, I hope you had nice vacation and that this is a good start for the 
new week.. About the inter-op:

Simply to say what did _not_ work from the three tables on [6]:
- merlin-xmldsig-sixteen.tar.gz
  - Manifest DigestValue valdiation:    NO
              (not yet, ask again in a week)
  - The Rest:                           Y1
- merlin-xmldsig-sixteen.tar.gz
  - Canonicalization minimal (deprecated): NO
  - The Rest:                           Y1
- merlin-xmldsig-fifteen.tar.gz
  - Everything:                         Y1


I hope you can successfully check it out...

Best regards,
Christian
