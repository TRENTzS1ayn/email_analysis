Hi,

Sections 4.3.3.2 and 4.3.3.3 refer *only* to the reference
processing model; that is, processing the target of a
dsig:Reference element. They do not say anything, explicit
or implicit, about the document in which a signature is
created.

Indeed,see section 3.1.2 of the processing rules (signature
generation):

" Note, if the Signature includes same-document references, [XML] or
  [XML-schema] validation of the document might introduce changes that
  break the signature. Consequently, applications should be careful
  to consistently process the document or refrain from using external
  contributions (e.g., defaults and entities). "

[ http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html ]

This clearly states that parsing of the signature document
itself is application-specific, and may be validating or well
formed.
