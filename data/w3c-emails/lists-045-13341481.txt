You're right. It's an ugly trick, but the only one that exists. Imagine 
you're creating a document from scratch and you want to define IDs. I asked 
the xerces-user mailing list and what I got was that there is no way in DOM 
to define that an attribute is of type ID during document creation. But I 
got a hint that Xerces allows this tricky thing to set IDs during creation:

((org.apache.xerces.dom.DocumentImpl) doc).putIdentifier(idValue, element);

So well, that seems to work.
