Hi Don,

I think that the problem with the software is implementation specific. The 
Signature spec allows you to create Signatures without prefix. In my 
opinion, it's a philosophical question whether you want to use prefixes or 
not or whether the prefix should be "ds" or "dsig" or "digsig" or "foo"...

The XML Signature spec let you choose.

Christian

PS: My library does, too. Simply say:

org.apache.xml.security.util.Constants.setSignatureSpecNSprefix("");

before you use the library and everything should be fine... Signatures 
without prefix (But now you should take care if you include ds:Objects with 
element content outside Signature space to make something like:::

<Object>
<Context xmlns="" />
</Object>

because with prefix, this was not a problem:

<ds:Object>
<Context />
</ds:Object>

PPS: If you need infos about the library, simply subscribe to

security-dev-subscribe@xml.apache.org
