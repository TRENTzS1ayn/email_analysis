I agree (subject to usual caveats of not delaying the process).

>XMLDSIG Section 4.3.3.1 contains this paragraph which identifies when

>If the URI attribute is omitted altogether, the receiving application is
>expected to know the identity of the object. For example, a lightweight
>data protocol might omit this attribute given the identity of the object
>is part of the application context. This attribute may be omitted from
>at most one Reference in any particular SignedInfo, or Manifest.

>What is the justification for the restriction embodied in the last

>verifier must have out-of-band knowledge to match up Reference and
>referenced content.  Given that the receiving application has to know
>how to find one referenced object, why can't it know implicitly how to
>find multiple referenced objects and match them up?  Since we're talking
>about application-specific context anyway there's no interop issue, so
