That would work but, even if you are very strictly following the Core
Validation Processing Rules, I don't see why you couldn't just use the
fragment URI to get the data from the original document without
plugging back in the parsed canonicalized SignedInfo. I don't see that
it would make sense for the fragment to point at or inside the
SignedInfo, although you should check for that and probably fail the
signature if you find it's set up that way.

Even further, it seems to me that most implementations will not allow
arbitrary CannonicalizationMethod elements and, in fact, all the ones
we have ever specified are such that you would not get in trouble
doing the Reference Validation on the original document, then applying
CannonicalizationMethod and doing Signature Validation, even though
that's not what the Processing Rules say and is not safe for arbitrary
CannonicalizationMethod elements...
