Don,

I believe there will be implementations of XMLDSIG that will be able to
deal with multiple elided URLs.

Your alternative suggestion, to use application-specific URLs in
References, seems worse in that it promotes the proliferation of
private-label URLs that cannot easily be filtered as private.  If the
URL is elided that is a clear signal that interpretation of the
Reference is application specific.  If the URL begins with "don:", how
do I distinguish between private use of a prefix and public (but unknown
to the verifier) use of the prefix?

I could see you making an argument that elided URIs should be completely
prohibited, but I can't see a justification for claiming that one is OK
but two are evil.

As a WG member, I oppose this change. If you are being grossly
application dependent, you can always just have one Reference where
the application magicly knows how to construct a composite TLV encoded
octet string or the like with all the data you want to sign.  Or just
forget about using the XMLDSIG standard at all.

I would assume the way some XMLDSIG libraries would work is that you
give them the Signature element and they use a call back to get the
data based on the URI. Under such an arrangement, there is no problem
with application dependent URIs like "x:1", "x:2", etc. And the
application could know what to do for a special callback indicating no
URI. But how could it work for multiple call backs for no URI? After
all, the XMLDSIG library isn't constrained to do these Reference call
backs in any particular order. With multiple null URIs there would be
no way to know which Reference a call back was for.

Thanks,
Donald
