Hi Christian,

Apart from the manifest and the reference below, your signature
verifies for me. In response to your questions; no, it is a
useless example that should never have a real-world use; and
no, it was generated automatically from the template. It was
just a test of here(), id() and prioritization of references
during generation. Temporarily interesting, but of no practical
use.
