The XMLDSIG spec Proposed Recommendation period ended a bit back, and I 
think we successfully addressed the critical question of default validity 
processing [1]. Once we have an indication from the IESG for advancement, 
we're finally there! To the questions of the X509 structure [2] and 
Reference URI [3], Don and I are trying to push the process such that we 
can go to REC and Draft Standard ASAP. Consequently, we don't plan to make 
any more changes that will delay that unless it's of a critical level -- 
and even then W3C colleagues suggest that such issues could addressed in an 
erratum or XMLDSIG 1.1 .

To speak more substantively to those two issues.

Schema Global Structures: We did rewrite the schema to make more elements 
and types usable in February [4] and the present dicussion would have been 
of use back then, but I'm presently afraid to introduce these changes  
because of delay and/or bugs. Also, I do believe there are schema tricks 
whereby someone can "redefine" [5] the xmldsig schema to one where those 
are global.

Elided URI attributes: I'm sure we had our good reasons when we did it a 
few years ago, and we might now reconsider given all of our experience, but 
again, unfortunately, we didn't consider the quesetion during CR and I'm 
not keen to go back in order to consider changing the behaviour of multiple 
absent Reference URIs.
