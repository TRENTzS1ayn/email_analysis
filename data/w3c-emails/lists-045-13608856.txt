Hi,

I forgot something that supports this (I love to reply to my own e-mails 
;-))):

In Section 5.1 The Manifest Element, we son't say how to verify a 
ds:Manifest, but I think it's abvious that the reference validation 
processing has to be applied to ds:Manifest as well. But this is not 
possible cause there's no CanonicalizationMethod inside a Manifest.

One reason more to omit the misleading sentence from 3.2.1.

Best regards,
Christian
