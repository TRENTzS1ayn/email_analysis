I have a related question. When doing signature validation after having
done reference validation how does one treat the xpointer string? In 
other words, if my <Reference> element looks like this:

<dsig:Reference URI="#xpointer(/)">

does canonicalization of <SignedInfo> do anything at all to this tag?

Hi all,
as my signature says, we are a students groups working on an open
implementation of XMLDSIG.
I have some doubts about URI dereferencing, in particolar:
xpointer(/) dereferencing is equals to null URI?
xpointer(id('ID')) dereferencing is equals to barename XPointer
and therefore to  #fragment about XML spec?,
Thanks in advance!
