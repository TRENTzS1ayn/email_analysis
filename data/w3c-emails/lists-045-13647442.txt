Hi,

if I understand correctly, you ask about how the c14nized form of this 
looks? Well, I think it's only a fragment of a greater document, so the 
answer cannot be given that way (depends on eventually existing parent 
elements and whether you have element content or not).

To play arount with c14n, I would suggest you download an implementation of 
c14n and feed some examples to this implementation to it to understand how 
it works.

(If your XML snippet is some single Element, the c14nized output would look 
like

<dsig:Reference URI="#xpointer(/)"></dsig:Reference>

but there is no xmlns:dsig="" declaration. If you have some child elements 
and parent elements, the Start tag would not be changed.
