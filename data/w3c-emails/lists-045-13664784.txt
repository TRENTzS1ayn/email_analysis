Only 25% shorter than XML?

Canonical S-expressions [CSEXP] (as used in SPKI/SDSI) is also a
binary format, is 1:1 with a major subset of XML (see
http://world.std.com/~cme/html/spki.html#XML), and is about 50%
shorter.  Then again, CSEXP is almost always shorter than traditional
ASN.1 without any XML compatibility.

Of course, %-shorter is strictly a function of the ratio of tags to
content and is a pretty meaningless measurement apart from a real
document.

[P.S. for some reason, Netscape gets to the #XML tagged line above
but IE doesn't.]
