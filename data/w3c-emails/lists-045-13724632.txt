Hi,

Whether to process Manifests, what to do if one or more items in the
Manifest fails Reference validation, whether to chase down Manifests
pointed to by Manifests, etc., is all application dependent.  It would
be reasonable, in my opinion, for an application to only process
Manifests where the Reference has a Manifest type attribute, in which
case you would need to generate signatures where the Reference URI
points directly at the Manifest (rather than, say, an encompassing
Object) and specify the Manifest type, if you want that Manifest
checked. But applications are not required to behave in this way.

Donald
