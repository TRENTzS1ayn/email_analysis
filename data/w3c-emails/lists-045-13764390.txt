Hi Donald,

I understood that processing of Manifests or referenced References is up to 
the implementation. I only wanted to hear about what other implementors do. 
There could be multiple scenarios:

- Only make core validation as described in the
  spec (we don't follow Manifests)
- validate all referenced Manifests
- validate all referenced Manifests if they reside
  in the same document where the Signature was
- validate all referenced Manifests and References
- validate all referenced Manifests and References
  if they reside in the same document where the
  Signature was
- validate all referenced Manifest till a given depth
  (if a SignedInfo/Reference points to a Manifest
  which points to a Manifest which points to a Manifest
  which points to a Manifest, only go e.g. 2 leveles deep)

You can extend this to an arbitrary amount of different "flavours" in 
Signature validation processing rules. Basically, I see these:

- validate everything regardless of the depth
- validate till a user-supplied depth.

I know, this is application specific and that we don't mention it in the 
spec. I only wanted to hear what other implementors did and/or what users 
wish.
