As an aside, the likelihood of C14N re-writing URIs is not all that 
unlikely We considered it (in general) with respect to relative URI for 
namespaces before they were "deprecated" by XML Core, and others might for 
any sort of relative URI (this might help isolate the context). So I don't 
mean to dismiss them as something no one would ever consider, people might 
consider it, but they'll have to be *very* careful.

If you did have a C14N that absolutized relative URIs given a base URI, 
then you would still need to ensure *both* the signer and verifier c14n 
SignedInfo prior to Reference Validation.
