As recently discussed on the list [1], step 1 of Reference validation it to 
canonicalize SignedInfo, which mitigates URI rewriting concerns. I believe 
the order of Core Validation (Reference Validation, then Signature 
validation) was editorial, and written to be of the same order as as for 
signature generation. However, I believe implementations could do various 
optimizations. For instance, step 1 of Reference Validation requires the 
SignedInfo to be canonicalized for security purposes. However, that 
canonical form of SignedInfo can be retained for Signature Validation, in 
step 1, "Obtain the keying information from KeyInfo or from an external 
source." and for step 2,  "confirm the SignatureValue over the SignedInfo 
element."

If an implementation didn't care to provide specific information to the 
user about why a signature failed I don't see any problem checking the 
signature first and throwing an error. (I expect signature validation is 
cheaper than reference validation.)
