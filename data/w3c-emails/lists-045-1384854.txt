Hi Petteri,

Please note the following sentence, which leads the fifth paragraph of
section 2.1:

"The input octet stream MUST contain a well-formed XML document, but the
input need not be validated. However, the attribute value normalization and
entity reference resolution MUST be performed in accordance with the
behaviors of a validating XML processor."

Example 3.5 is designed to ensure that implementations conform with this
requirement (so that validating and non-validating processors have the same
output).

Thanks,
John Boyer

Does not the "Entiry References" sample in chapter 3.5 of [1] require a
validating parser because of the external entity references?

The spec does not require a validating parser, should not the sample be
changed to not require a validating parser?
