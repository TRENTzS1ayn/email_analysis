Donald,

I've posted the document at:
  http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xml-exc-c14n.html
with the following edits.

1. Cleaned up some of the html and a few typos.
2. hypertexted the definition of key words and references to them.
3. Rewrote section 3, particularly the implementation description.

I can work on this getting officially published (and maybe even last 
called) soon, but of course would appreciate feedback on whether section 3 
jives with folks' understanding of what we were trying to implement with 
exc-c14n.
