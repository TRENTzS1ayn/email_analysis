Dear John, 

please note also the effort of ETSI to provide a XML Format for
advanced features like time-stamps and certificates. This effort
want's to provide a XML Format for Electronic Signatures as
defined by the EU Signature Directive.

I have to ask back, where the full Draft is available on the
Web... 

But as Gregor Karlinger is one of the co-authors, perhaps he can
give us more information. 

Best,
