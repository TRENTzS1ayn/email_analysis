Hi,

There is no correct model.

If you are of the extreme protocol point of view, b is always right
and your protocol specification should tell you where signature(s)
should be.  If you are of the extreme document persuation, you
obviously have to search for Signature elements. For what I mean by
protocol/document, see
<ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-proto-doc-pov-04.txt>.

As for which is more prevalent, I don't know right now. It is possible
that some document uses may be very "important". But if XMLDSIG is
used in instant messaging or protocols like that, I would guess that
the number of b cases would eventually be orders of magnitude larger
than the number of "a" cases.

Thanks,
Donald
