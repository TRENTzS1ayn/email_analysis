Christian,

in IAIK's implementation we do not process Manifests at all per default.
Instead we provide methods by which the user can check if a Reference in
the SignedInfo references a Manifest (indicating this by using the Type
attribute). If yes, the user can trigger the Manifest validation in the
mode that is most convenienct for his use case (either validate a single
Reference of the Manifest, or validating all References of the Manifest).

Regards, Gregor
