Hi Hans,

If the intent of the section is to show exact exc-c14n output, then yes
the full end tag would be required.  I assumed that the section was
mainly showing the nodes "extracted by the XPath expression" since
otherwise the attributes would not be on separate lines either.

Joseph, perhaps we should changes this to showing exact canonical
forms...

Cheers,

Should the example exc-c14n output in the exc-c14n draft [1], 
section 2.2 (the last code example), not be
   ...
       <n3:stuff xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org"></n3:stuff>
   ...

instead of

   ...
       <n3:stuff xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org"/>
   ...

?

Thanks,
Hans Granqvist
