Abstract

   Canonical XML [XML-C14N] recommends a standard means of serializing
   XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes its namespace and
   some other XML context. However, for many applications, it is
   desirable to have a method which, to the extent practical, excludes
   such context from a canonicalized subdocument. In particular, where a
   digital signature over an XML subdocument is needed which will not
   break when that subdocument is removed from its original document
   and/or inserted into a different context. The Exclusive XML
   Canonicalization method described herein provides such a method.

Status of this document

   This is the first official publication and Last Call for the
   "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" Working Draft from the IETF/W3C XML
   Signature Working Group (Activity Statement). This version satisfies
   the Working Groups requirement to exclude ancestor context from the
   canonicalized form of a subset of an XML document. This specification
   is an alternative to behaviour of the Canonical XML Recommendation; it
   is based on an implementation; the Working Group expects to move
   through last call and towards Recommendation quickly. The last call
   period is in 3 weeks, ending on 11 December 2001.
