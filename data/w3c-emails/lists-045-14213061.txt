The fact that ancestor xml:base declarations would be absent from a 
serialized subset seems to be a cause for surprise. However, I believe this 
is the intent of exclusive canonicalization unless we wanted to make 
exceptions for certain types of xml:foo -- which I would not support. It's 
an interesting concern though and I don't recall myself thinking about it 
too much beyond xml:lang .

Thank you, we'd certainly appreciate DOM's feedback!

This is true. xml:* declarations need to occur within the utilized (in the
XPATH selection) nodes if they are to be serialized.
