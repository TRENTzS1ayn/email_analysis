You can make arguments either way for each current xml namespace thing
but we really don't want to make things too complex or have too many
options, as you would if inclusivity/exclusivity were independent for
namesapces and xml namespace attributes... It seems cleanest to have
pretty much the two extreme points of inclusion and exclusion
predefined and let people set up what they want via XML composition or
explicit manipulation to deviate from these. Besides which, I don't
think we should change it now without a strong reason.

Thanks,
Donald
