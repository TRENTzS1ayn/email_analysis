Just to mention that the Xalan developpers have done nothing more than 
follow the XPath rec by doing so ;=) :

"Each element has an associated set of namespace nodes, one for each 
distinct namespace prefix that is in scope for the element (including 
the xml prefix, which is implicitly declared by the XML Namespaces 
Recommendation [XML Names]) and one for the default namespace if one is 
in scope for the element."

Eric (who has recently opened a bug against libxslt which was not doing so)
