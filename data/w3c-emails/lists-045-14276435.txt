True enough.

I have found this, in a real world application, writing a pretty printer 
in XSLT and noticing that the resulting document was quite different 
depending on the XSLT processor I was using but I reckon that this is a 
very specific operation.

OTH, XSLT 1.0 will probably be used still for a while and it seems like 
a good idea to be compliant with it as it stands today, or I have missed 
something else?
