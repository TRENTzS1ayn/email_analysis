Hrmm... tricky. In the Python implementation [1] we don't even bother with 
*real* namespace nodes since they aren't in DOM Levels 1/2. They are only 
available as attributes and we then separate them for processing based on 
what they look like; implicit xmlns:xml declarations are not returned in 
the attribute list regardless.

In Xalan, do they have an implementation of a DOM  *and* XPath nodeset? Or, 
like in PyXML, is XPath filtered through a DOM nodeset? (I'm not sure if 
there is a python parser that provides a genuine XPath nodelist.) If so, 
when the xmlns:xml is added, is it added to an attribute list? (I would 
think this might "break" DOM in order to comply with XPath...).

Regardless of what is happening in XPath/DOM, I believe Canonicalization 
allows us to ignore it [2] regardless, right?

  Element Nodes- ... Namespace Axis-...To finish processing L, simply
  process every namespace node in L, except omit namespace node with local
  name xml, which defines the xml prefix, if its string value is
  http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.
