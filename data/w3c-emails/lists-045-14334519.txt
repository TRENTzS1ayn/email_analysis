XML-Canonical is a Perl Module that supports Canonical XML.  It is an
adaptation of the XML Security-J org.apache.xml.security.c14n package for
Perl.  The parser is based on the libxml C library, so it should be 
very fast.

Next steps:
Make DocSubsets example (3.7) work.  One way of doing this is
to replace libxml with libgdome once libgdome gets XPath support
with namespaces.

Enjoy,
TJ Mather
