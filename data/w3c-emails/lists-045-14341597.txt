I notice that the identifier URL for exclusive XML canonicalization
is http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#

As I recall, I initially ended it with a "#" so there could be a
http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#WithComments in analogy with
the inclusive canonicalization recommendation and I still think that
would be a good idea. Anyone object?
