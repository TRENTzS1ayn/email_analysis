Hi all, 

1. Thanks to all that already sent comments!
2. Sorry for not making it clearer, but, I think it is not worth your
time sending comments on the article, since it is the old version. I'll
post it later it as a chapter form (Notes in this page) (it's not done
yet and I have some more pressing things so it may take few weeks). The
article to be published has already been substantially improved both by
the DDJ team and myself, but for that final version you'll probably have
to read DDJ, since (1) I'm not sure it's Ok for me to post it and (2)
some of the editing and final changes (including some meaningful for the
XML Encrypt group reflecting recent discussions) were only on PDF
versions which I cannot edit... 

I'll add a comment in the site. 

3. Several complained about my use of backslash \ in the filenames
instead of slash / . Well I'm a bit  puzzled by now, in my configuration
(Windows and IE I'm afraid) both work fine, but I changed them all to \
due to some previous complaint... There must be some way which works for
all?  

Best regards, 
Amir Herzberg
