Hi all,

question about interoperability testing: Do there exist test vectors from 
different XML Signature implementations?

I found the huge collection of vectors from Merlin (Baltimore) and Gregor 
did also sent me actual files generated with the IAIK implementation. The 
signatures (test data) from IBM's xss4j are unfortunately covered by the 
IBM license and therefore cannot be used by me for automated interop 
testing. Does one on the list has signatures and signed data which he 
generated using xss4j and/or other implementations?

The values I actually collected can be found under [1].

Thanks in advance,
Christian
