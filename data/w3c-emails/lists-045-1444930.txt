All but one of the examples validate with our implementation, but not
without minor tweaks:

- example-4.xml (chapter 3.4) fails because of problems with normalization
of attribute values with special characters (#xD) by the XML processor
- the other examples with DTDs need to be manually fixed to also declare the
elements in the DTD, otherwise the XML processor will not recognize the
attribute declarations

The second problem is solved by adding something like "<!ELEMENT e2 ANY>" to
a DTD. This is of course not a very acceptable solution, but a simple
workaround for a conformance problem of the XML processor.

Hi,

Attached, then, is hopefully a non-tentative signature over
the updated C14N examples.

If Petteri can verify it, then I think we can call it good.

Thanks, John and Petteri, for all assistance!
