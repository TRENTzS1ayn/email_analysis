Step 3 of section 3.2.1 states:

  "Compare the generated digest value against DigestValue 
   in the SignedInfo Reference; if there is any mismatch, 
   validation fails."

Does "validation" above mean "core validation"? If a single
reference fails to validate, core validation fails. I assume
this means an implementation should (must?) abort validation of the 
remaining references and return a failure. Is my assumption
correct? I think the section could be a little bit more clear
on what an implementation should do when a reference fails
to validate.

Thanks,
Sean
