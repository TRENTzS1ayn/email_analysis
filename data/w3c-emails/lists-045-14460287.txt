Hi Sean. It means Reference Validation fails and since Core Validation 
requires Reference *and* Signature (cryptographic) validation, Core 
consequently fails as well.

According to the specification the Signature is not valid. How this is 
communicated is up to the application which could short cut and immediately 
abort, continue processing the other references so it can identify which 
ones failed, and/or do the cryptographic signature validation as other 
piece of information to the user or calling application.
