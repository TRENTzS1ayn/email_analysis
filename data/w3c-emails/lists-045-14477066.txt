Hm. :(

When I see an article that refers to "Draft Standard" (capitalised) stage for 
a W3C specification, I have to ask if the author understands W3C process.

When I see an article which recommends, as the first resource to be read, XML 
Schema Part I REC .... I have to doubt the author's sanity. :) ... If you 
have ever tried to read XML Schema Part I REC you will probably know what I 
mean. It certainly isn't an easy read even if you want to understand W3C XML 
Schema. But as first thing to read about XML Signature ... <
