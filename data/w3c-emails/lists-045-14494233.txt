I agree about Schema. But on "Draft Standard", XML Digital Signature
is being developed by a joint IETF/W3C working group and going up both
standards ladders simultaneously. As well as its W3C status, it is an
IETF Proposed Standard (via RFC 3075) and would probably have already
been approved as a Draft Standard if it were not for some bureaucratic
delays. I expect it to be approved during the IETF meeting in Salt
Lake City next week.

I haven't read it all but the author of the cited article seem opposed
to standards having any flexibility so they can be extended, for
example, by Microsoft...  And they seem to think that the use of URIs
(actually they always say URLs...) to identify and label things like
algorithms implies dereferencing them and dependence of the site
specified in the URL. I don't agree.

Since there is a provision for feedback, I posted a negative comment
on the article including pointing out that I couldn't possibly be
biased by being a co-author of the XMLDSIG standard :-)
