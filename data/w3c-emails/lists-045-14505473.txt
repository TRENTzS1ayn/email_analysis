Just discovered this reply never made it from my "Draft" folder to my "Sent"
folder.  Oh well, better late than never...
---------------------------------------------------------

The "short" (and incomplete) answer is that, yes, an application can "discover"
a signature using DOM, XPath, XSLT, regular expressions, or whatever.

HOWEVER, in my view, the "correct" answer is that a practical, secure system
will use schemas or some other higher-level mechanism to dictate whether
or not a signature must, or may, be at a certain node in the document.
Further, such a system will dictate certain parameters of the Signature
such as the algorithms used, and, of course, what that signature must cover.
 These parameters may be dictated through schemas and enforced through schema
validation or through some other way of verifying the integrity of the structure.
 It isn't enough to simply find a signature willy-nilly and indicate only
whether it is valid or not.

Does this help?  If I read too much into the question or misinterpreted
it, let me know.
