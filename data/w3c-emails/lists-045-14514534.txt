The opinion of may people in the IETF is that the above is
superstition.  In fact, the status of something as being mandated by
government immediately makes some IETF people suspicous.  After all,
if a network protocol was worth anything, people would use it
spontaneously and the greatest strength of the early IETF efforts was
that they were not even just purely voluntary but their adoption was
activley discouraged by most civil governments.

Surely it's implict and obvious from the IETF documents which give the
procedures for the issuance of what the IETF and virtually everyone
else in the unvierse calls standards? Are you actually being so
pedantic as to make a distinction based on the captialization in
English of the word S/standard? How is this different from the PKCS
series of Public Key Cryptogrpahic Standards issued by RSA or the
zillions of other standards issued by consortia and companies? Given
the demonstranted incompetance of governments at promulgating
successful internetworking protocols, why should they have some magic
monopoly on the word "standard"?

Although it was common in the early days of the IETF, I haven't heard
anyone raise the issue you do for over five years. It's sort of
refreshing, actually... If governments want to impress people who are
impressed by governments, they should label their stuff "government
standards" to avoid confusion.
