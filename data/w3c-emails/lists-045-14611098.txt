Hello John,

I was just looking through the Canonical XML Recommendation at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n and noticed what appears to be an error
in the XPaths that it uses to describe which nodes are collected
within the document. Both the paths start with:

  //.

which is not a valid path. I believe it is intended to be:

  //node()

Cheers,

Jeni
