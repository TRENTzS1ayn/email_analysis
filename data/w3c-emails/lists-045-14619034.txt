Hi Jenni,

Thanks for the note, but I don't understand why you claim that //. is
illegal.  From the XPath spec:

Expr -> ... -> LocationPath -> AbsoluteLocationPath ->
AbbreviatedAbsoluteLocationPath -> '//' RelativeLocationPath -> '//'
Step -> '//' AbbreviatedStep -> '//.'

Clearly it is legal according the BNF rules in the XPath specification.
Perhaps you have an implementation of XPath that contains an error?

Regards,
John Boyer

Hello John,

I was just looking through the Canonical XML Recommendation at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n and noticed what appears to be an error
in the XPaths that it uses to describe which nodes are collected
within the document. Both the paths start with:

  //.

which is not a valid path. I believe it is intended to be:

  //node()

Cheers,

Jeni
