The latest version of the Canonical XML specification [1] (with many 
up-to-the-wire example tweaks!) has been published and will be forwarded to 
the W3C Director for consideration as Candidate Rec.

Abstract

    Any XML document is part of a set of XML documents that are logically
    equivalent within an application context, but which vary in physical
    representation based on syntactic changes permitted by XML 1.0
    [15][XML] and Namespaces in XML [16][Names]. This specification
    describes a method for generating a physical representation, the
    canonical form, of an XML document that accounts for the permissible
    changes. Except for limitations regarding a few unusual cases, if two
    documents have the same canonical form, then the two documents are
    logically equivalent within the given application context. Note that
    two documents may have differing canonical forms yet still be
    equivalent in a given context based on application-specific
    equivalence rules for which no generalized XML specification could
    account.

Status of this document

    This document is referred to the W3C Director for review and
    consideration as a Candidate Recommendation. It addresses all issues
    raised during the [17]second Last Call. The list and disposition of
    last call issues is [18]a living document maintained by the [19]XML
    Signature Working Group.

    This specification includes editorial and technical clarifications and
    corrections suggested by last call reviewers. Additionally, this
    version also includes one substantive difference from the previous
    version: the recent [20]XML plenary decision regarding deprecation of
    relative namespace URIs is represented in this specification.

    The [21]XML Core Working Group, which published the first Last Call
    [22][C14N-20000119], has delegated the completion of the Canonical XML
    specification to the IETF/W3C [23]XML Signature Working Group
    [[24]list archives].

    The XML Signature Working Group invites implementation feedback during
    this period. Please send comments to the editor and cc: the list
    <[25]w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>. While we welcome implementation
    experience reports, the XML Signature Working Group will not allow
    early implementation to constrain its ability to make changes to this
    specification prior to final release.

    There have been no declarations regarding patents related to this
    specification within the XML Signature Working Group.
