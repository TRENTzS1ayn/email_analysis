This is correct. exc-c14n is a tweak to Canonical XML, which is based on 
Xpath, and preceded both InfoSet and Schema. I expect Infoset and Schema 
aware canonicalizations will be proposed and may even be the subject of 
chartered work of future activity -- not necessarily xmldsig. However, I do 
have a draft for addressing validating augmentations as a xmldsig transform 
[e] and some thoughts on schema aware canonicalization. But presently, it's 
"unchartered" territory.

Input:
<a><b><c/></b></a>
 o a is an ancestor (grandparent) of c.
 o b is an ancestor (parent) of c.

Output
<a><c/></a>
 o b is absent.
 o a is an "output parent" of c since its the most immediate ancestor in 
the output of <c/>.

This text is John's and I had to draw an example tree and label these 
things to first grok the terminology. Subsequently, I acknowledge other 
readers might have to make a similar effort, but I've been unable to come 
up with an alternative that is better expressed. Suggestions?
