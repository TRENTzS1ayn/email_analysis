BTW, I certainly don't mind seeing the more esoteric XPath questions come
up (like Jeni's or my one of some weeks back).  

Jeni, just so you know, John B. is laps ahead of the majority of us when
it comes to understanding the intricacies of XPath.  And since a solid understanding
of XPath is very beneficial to making the most of XML Signature, it is good
to see these questions posed on the list.
