I think that you have to be very careful about how many information your 
implementation gives the application/user/attacker about a non-verifying 
signature. I know that there have been successful attacks on SSL because 
the server was too noisy and provided to much information about protocol 
failures. It must be ensured that such information cannot be exploited by 
an attacker.
