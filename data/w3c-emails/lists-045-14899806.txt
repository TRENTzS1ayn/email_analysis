Hi Merlin,

I guess my mail did not make it to the list, so here it is again:

Hi Merlin,

Thanks for the good explanation. In your example below, I do not understand 
the 'Input: "/"' thing. The tree under "Consider" is the original document. 
What's the XPath node set which is used as input to your transform? Does 
"/" mean URI="#xpointer(/)" ?

If I'm right, your xpath expressions address nodes in the original 
document, but the transforms result node set can only contain nodes which 
have also been present in the input node set.

Christian
