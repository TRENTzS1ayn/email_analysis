      Actually, example.org is better for examples than the US Post Office
(usps.gov) .

Merlin, thank you for the new examples but I had a couple of questions.

I'm confused as to whether your update [1] is supposed to replace
merlin-fifteen and merlin-sixteen in the interop matrix? (I think for new
implementors, it's easier to download a working tar ball than one with some

broken versions and updates.)

Also, Don said he'd tried to restore xmldsig.pothole but I don't think he
has, and I'm still willing to provide a necessary URI.

As an aside, unless the post office has a address namespace, it's probably
best to start the URI with example.org.

Also, I wasn't sure what you were trying to do with [2], but I don't think
it worked since the attachement didn't get a new URI?

Finally, one of your examples uses
"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#Reference" and that identifier does not
exist (there's no definition, if we need such an identifier we should
create one instead of abusing the 09/xmldsig namespace.)
