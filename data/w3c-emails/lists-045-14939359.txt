Palani,

the additionalNSPrefixes tell you which namespaces the prefixes
used in the XPath expression are bound to.

Where to use it depends on how you evaluate the XPath expression:

In the default case, Xalan uses the context node to resolve prefixes
in the XPath epression: The namespace declarations in scope for the
context nodes are used to determine the namespace a prefix is bound to.

If this is not sufficient for your scenario, you have to provide your
own implementation of the interface org.apache.xml.utils.PrefixResolver;
best is to derive from class org.apache.xml.utils.PrefixResolverDefault,
which is the default resolver Xalan uses. You can tell Xalan to use
your prefix resolver by using constructor 
org.apache.xpath.XPath(String, SourceLocator, PrefixResolver, int).

HTH, Gregor
