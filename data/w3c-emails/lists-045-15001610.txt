I am tardy in sending this announcement to these two lists, but I agreed, 
on behalf of the xenc and xmldsig WGs, to bring this last call before these 
WGs. I've already been contributing my comments as a participant of the 
XKMS WG. However, if you are not actively involved in that WG this is still 
an important opportunity to consider and comment on the requirements. If 
you think there is an issue or a concern that should be discussed by the 
xenc/xmldsig WGs please let me know. Otherwise, comments should be sent to 
the XKMS as directed in their document.
