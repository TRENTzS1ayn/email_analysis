Not a newbie question as I asked the same question earlier for pyXML [1]! 
<smile/> c14n.py has a means of taking additional prefixes, and I just 
added an option for the xpath/test command line and test harness. However, 
I'm still not sure how to pass the default ns to the python xml libraries 
-- that' s something I need to dig more on. In terms of API for our own 
(thtis WG's) tests, I'd prefer that the parameter be a string of white 
space delimited series of prefix:values and '#default' be the key word, but 
whomever sends the tests dictates their form. <smile/>
