Hi Joseph,

>Merlin, thank you for the new examples but I had a couple of questions.

It was a temporary fix while I was on the road. Attached is an
updated single archive that is a replacement for -fifteen (simple
signatures), -sixteen (complex signature) and -seventeen (various
key info types).

>Also, Don said he'd tried to restore xmldsig.pothole but I don't think he

Now using http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/04/xml-stylesheet.b64.

>As an aside, unless the post office has a address namespace, it's probably

Now using http://example.org/XXX.

>Also, I wasn't sure what you were trying to do with [2], but I don't think 
>it worked since the attachement didn't get a new URI?

Was trying for a new URI, but it got inlined.

>Finally, one of your examples uses 
>"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#Reference" and that identifier does not

Removed; that was from a hand-built template.

I've also reissued the certs with a longer validity, so the
cert-based examples will be more accessible.

It might be best to wait for someone to validate the signatures
before relying on their usefulness, although things seemed to be
working last time around.
