Merlin sent me a version of the specification integrated with his proposal 
[1]. Please comment! ( The only thing I did was tweak some of the 
formatting, and name it back to XPath Filter 2.0. I find it easier to 
explain there's the 1.0 version in the spec, and this is the replacement. 
But perhaps I am alone on this?)
