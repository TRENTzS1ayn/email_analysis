Hi Aleksey,

1. Agreed.

2. We choose to perform expansion from nodes to node trees outside
the XPath processor to maximize the possible execution speed. It
is much faster to evaluate and expand //Foo than to evaluate
//Foo//self::node(). Remember, the only goal of this transform is
speed; it doesn't provide any new capability.

3. The transform operates as you'd expect; the external document
is parsed and the filter applied. The only difference is that here()
is an error. This allows us to efficiently select subtrees of 
external documents; e.g., document.xml->intersect(id('foo')),
which selects the data that document.xml#foo would, if we permitted
that construct.
