Hi Merlin and all,

Instead of italics, we could keep the same letters and use bold,
possibly with a soft color.  The main idea would be that 'I' is read as
a set name, not a word referring to me.

As for the actual new draft, I just finished a complete read and could
find no errors. Excellent attention to all the details. This probably
sounds very nerdy, but it was exciting to read (Beethoven's 9th started
playing in my head as I got through the final example).

Obviously, I cannot say enough good about the work :-)

Cheers,
John Boyer

Hi Aleksey,

1. Agreed.

2. We choose to perform expansion from nodes to node trees outside
the XPath processor to maximize the possible execution speed. It
is much faster to evaluate and expand //Foo than to evaluate
//Foo//self::node(). Remember, the only goal of this transform is
speed; it doesn't provide any new capability.

3. The transform operates as you'd expect; the external document
is parsed and the filter applied. The only difference is that here()
is an error. This allows us to efficiently select subtrees of 
external documents; e.g., document.xml->intersect(id('foo')),
which selects the data that document.xml#foo would, if we permitted
that construct.
