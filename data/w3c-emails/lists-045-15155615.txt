I don't think that there is no new functionality at all. For example, 
uninon provides new ways
to apply some transforms to a part of the document and add more nodes 
later. Also some XPath
implementations operates on the actual nodes sets (no sub-trees!) and by 
this construction
S' is an additional and expensive operation!
