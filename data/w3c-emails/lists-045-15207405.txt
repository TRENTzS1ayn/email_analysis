I need to think about profiling this scenarios. Probably you are right 
about performance.
However, personally I don't think that it's a good idea to write general 
standard with
performance as a top priority. My expirience shows that performance 
improvements are
usually very complicated, not simple to explain and very difficult to 
maintain.

Calculating S' is one additional step and this step adds complexety to 
the proposed scheme.
I like the initial idea: describe XPath transform in terms of sets 
operations. It really simplifies
understanding and makes everything clear. I suggest you to take a look 
at this from a "user"
point of view: "I've constructed XPath expression but transform added 
some nodes to it. Why???"
And remember that users never read docs :)

And I think you agree with me that your solution for the second scenario 
I described (when only
node "b" is required) has worse performance then a solution w/o S'.
