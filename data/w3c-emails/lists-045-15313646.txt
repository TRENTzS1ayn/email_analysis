I'm Aleksey Sanin. I've started the XML Security Library with a goal to 
learn
new XML Signature standard. It turns out that many people are interested 
in an
OpenSource library that will provide support for XMLDSig, XMLEnc and
XKMS standards. So after implementing XML DSig I've started work on XMLEnc
and I guess XKMS will be next :) The down side is that now it takes more 
and
more time and I still have to work on a full-time position :(

I agree to work according to the WG contributor policy,
