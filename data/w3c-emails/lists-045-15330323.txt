Some thoughts on what we need to do in the near future:


1. Canonical XML

It's been a REC for over a year now: happy birthday! <smile/>

1. XML Signature Syntax and Processing

We're a REC and we have ~15  implementations (woo-hoo)! We have four 
erratum: either editorial clarifications or things we are actively working  
to address.

2. Exclusive Canonicalization

I feel like the work on this specification is done and we're pretty much 
ready to move forward. I'd like to hear a few more people report success 
with Gregor's tests [1] and that you're satisfied with its operation in an 
application context. (Even if you've already sent in a report, if your 
column isn't complete or haven't interop'd with Gregor's tests, please do 
so.) If I get this feedback soon, I'll stage it for publication as a 
Proposed REC at the end of this month!

3. XPath Filter 2.0 Transform

Thanks to this week's edits by Merlin (and discussion between Merlin, John, 
Aleksey, and Christian) I think we've converged on a design and text that 
we're happy with. If no one objects to the present text [2] (speak now!) 
I'll stage it for publication as a W3C Last Call Working Draft (and first 
"official" W3C WD) at the end of this month.

4. DNAMEs are always a fun issue <grin/>

The interop matrix for xmldsig now has an entry with Gregor's DNAME tests 
[3]. It would be great to get some other reports on that! (Harada?)
