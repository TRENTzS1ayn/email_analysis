There were no replies to my  suggestion [1] about an option to process
nodes instead of subtrees in XPath Filter 2.0 Transform so I am rasing this
question again. I understand the performance concerns (and I do see small
performance decrease in my tests).However,  I believe this will add 
flexibility
and provide better way to select "complicated" parts of XML document.
