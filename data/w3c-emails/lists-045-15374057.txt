Hi Aleksey,

You're right that it's difficult to prove anything given different 
processing scenarios, and there are questions of optimizing an XPath 
processor versus coming up with an optimized  "profile" akin to what we are 
doing. Our answers to these questions are driven by operational experience 
and it's the sub-tree case that we found needs to be addressed. For 
example, people want to easily isolate multiple signatures or a SOAP 
payload. These are our real world requirements.

That isn't to say the example you gave is unimportant, but absent a bunch 
of folks saying "hey, I have a critical problem in this application" I 
expect to publish this as a W3C Working Draft. We can continue the 
discussion and tests, and I certainly welcome proposed text to make the 
issue more clear to readers of the spec.
