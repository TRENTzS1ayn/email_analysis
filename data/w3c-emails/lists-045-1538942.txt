Here are just a few comments for your Last Call "XML-Signature
Syntax and Processing" Working Draft [1].

Globally, Base64, base 64, and base-64 can read "base64" (no cap).
"Canonical XML" needn't be capitalized unless it refers to the
Canonical XML spec, and "canonicalization" can also be lowercase.

Also globally, "transform"(s) can be lowercase unless it refers
to a Transform(s) element (in which case you have it marked up
<code>). Same for "signature."

4.3.3.2 pars. 6, 7 and 8
URI-Reference -> URI reference (four times)

4.3.3.4 par. 4
MimeType, Charset -> MIME type, charset
or <code>MimeType</code>, charset

6.5 par. 3
We RECOMMENDED -> We RECOMMEND
(I didn't understand why it was past tense that time.)

6.6.2 last par.
element<strike class="fix">s</strike> -> element

6.6.5
stylesheet -> style sheet (three times)

7.0 last par.
Normalized Form C -> Normalization Form C

In References, all the RFCs could be listed the same way. I don't
know the preferred way yet, and used commas and the space between
RFC and 2119 in this example:
RFC 2119, Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels, 
S. Bradner, March 1997.

4.3.3.4 par. 5
domain.Transform -> domain. Transform
