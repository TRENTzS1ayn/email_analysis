Hi Joseph,

1. #default is in the examples, so yes. Performance is
marginally better than regular c14n, depending on the
input.

2. We've used it informally in SOAP-based situtations
and it solves lots of problems; particularly helps in
the separation of some application layers.

3. I've tried Gregor's examples and, with one exception
(example 4, regular c14n, GrandChild, xml:fool should
not be there?), I think everything works. For other folks'
convenience I attach a signature that represents these
examples (hope you don't mind, Gregor), along with the
raw c14n output. I know you want non-signature-based
examples but, for the sake of this thread, it's a lot
easier to run a signature verify than to check these by
hand.
