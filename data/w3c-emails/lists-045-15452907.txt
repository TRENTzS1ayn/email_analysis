It is marginally faster depending on the size of the doc. Our code is
still fresh and full of debugging code. Hopefully after code review
and clean-up exc-c14n will be faster.

I am finishing the conversion of our now deprecated SOAP-SEC handlers
for Axis and HP-SOAP into new WS-security ones. Since WS-security
'strongly RECOMMENDS' the use of exc-c14n, I am using it to C9ze the
SignedInfo of SOAP messages signatures.

Yes, they seem to work. We have not try the signed version that Merlin
has just sent but we will.

I'll send you HP's entry for the interop matrix as soon as I have a
better feel for the performances.
