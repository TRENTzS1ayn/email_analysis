Yes: The Phaos implementation supports the "#default" token, and 
performance appears, informally, to be at least as good for exc-c14n as for 
c14n.

Not yet, sorry.

>3. Have someone else try Gregor's examples.

Yes: The Phaos implementation successfully verifies all of Gregor's 
examples, as bundled in the 2nd version of Merlin's signature. (The 1st 
version fails, as expected.)
