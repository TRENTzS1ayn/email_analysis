I'm noting that QNames are increasingly being used as identifiers within 
specifications. For example, XKMS is moving this way given the precedence 
set by SOAP, I'm seeing it in other ws-security work as well.

My primary question is an architectural one: are these acceptable 
replacements for URIs as identifiers within our specifications? (They're 
certainly easier to read!) What is the identifier, the string "foo:bar" or 
the tuple [0]? Do we expect all specs to treat them uniformly in the next 
version of XML? What about present versions?

My second question is an unfounded question about security implications. I 
haven't thought it through, but I wonder if there's any security 
ambiguities arising from the use of QNames as identifiers within an 
attribute value. When you sign a document via XML Canonicalization, it's 
attribute value is a string-value (not an "expanded-name" in XPath 
terminology, nor a QNAME in others'), but it also doesn't rewrite prefixes 
either so I feel safe. UDDI's schema-centric c14n [1] does rewrite 
namespace prefixes [2], but it's also schema centric -- I'm not sure what 
the result is there. (Bob?) And in other applications, where both sorts of 
processing might be done (attributes as strings versus QNAMEs) it's hard to 
say...
