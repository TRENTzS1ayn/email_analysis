The reason for that example (in fact, all those X.509 examples)
is that I was under the impression that this working group was
required to demonstrate interoperability among all of our defined
syntax, which includes X509CRL. I don't think that inclusion of a
CRL is particularly useful; it is just part of our syntax.

RFC 2026, 4.1.2 Draft Standard (presuming that is our goal)

 The requirement for at least two independent and interoperable
 implementations applies to all of the options and features of the
 specification.  In cases in which one or more options or features
 have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable
 implementations, the specification may advance to the Draft Standard
 level only if those options or features are removed.
