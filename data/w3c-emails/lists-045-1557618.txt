Hi Susan, thanks for your comments.

Ok. Fixed the one remaining base-64. In english text moved Base64 to lower 
case, retained lower case in URIs.

All instances I found refer to spec.

fixed one instance of that.

Fixed about ~6 of Transform;  one of signature, otherwise XML Signature is 
retained.

That is a purposeful term used from section 4 of 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt.

ok.

ok.

ok.

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xsl-20000327/xslspec.html
uses "stylesheet" ? but when I speak in general I seperated them.

I believe it is Normalized Form C.

Could you provide a citation that this is the proper way? Regardless, Don 
did the RFCs and I think they are consistent amongst themselves, though not 
with other references.

ok.

Thank you!
