Thanks for the clarification. As an aside, when the XML Base specifications 
refers to "parent" [1] it means "ancestor", right? (I presume that by "the 
base URI of the element's parent element" this means even the attribute 
isn't present, the ancestor has a base from its parent, which has it from 
it's parent, and so on.)

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/#granularity
The base URI of an element is:

1. the base URI specified by an xml:base attribute on the element, if one 
exists, otherwise
2. the base URI of the element's parent element within the document or 
external entity, if one exists, otherwise
3. the base URI of the document entity or external entity containing the 
element.
