Hi Aleksey,
 
The format is not proprietary.  It is XML.  The only question you have
to answer is whether you can read the blob of XML and filter it with
expressions like the XPaths I gave as examples.  If so, how fast is your
filter operation.
 
You do not have to create or affix an XML dsig signature.  You only need
to filter the XML and see whether the results of your filtration match
the results of our software (which is, operationally at least, the
easiest way to determine whether we're getting a good representative of
an XPath expression).
 
Thanks,
John Boyer

It's quite difficult to generate signature from this template because
it has proprietary format. Since sign/verify operations are almost fully
symmetric I suggest to ask John to generate signed XML document
and compare performance on signature verification operation.

Thanks John! Would someone be willing to generate the signature over
this 
that John specified and shared it with the list, then implementors can
get 
a sense of how well the filter2 transform satisfies our requirement for 
decent performance?
