Exactly: does anyone defines what this means? When people expressed 
concerns that Canonical XML was too "context inclusive" in scenarios like 
SOAP, it was my argument that "packaged" XML applications (those that 
compose and decompose chunks of XML betwixt documents) might need to define 
the mechanism of insertion/deletion for things like this. While the 
argument for exc-c14n was compelling none-the-less, I still believe this 
doesn't mitigate the need for some sort of specification regarding the 
creation of "synthetic infosets" if an application is doing that sort of 
thing.

Right, and if folks use different mechanisms (e.g., copy/paste, XInclude 
like mechanisms, XSLT like mechanisms, DOM mechanisms) the result might 
vary regardless of what we can do with canonicalization since we are only 
operating on the "snapshot" XML instance or node-set/Infoset prior to 
serialization.

Yes, I was trying to do no more than demonstrate the effect; not to make 
justify the scenario -- but I expect it will arise somewhere at sometime.
