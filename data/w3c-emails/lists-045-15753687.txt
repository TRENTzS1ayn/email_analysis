xmldsig-filter2 is now a W3C Working Draft [1]. I expect to move to last 
call (and through CR) very quickly. The only thing I'd like to see 
addressed before then is an indication of performance results over the 
document John sent with xpath filters that effect the selections he 
specified. 

Also, I was also considering publishing exc-c14n as a Proposed REC at the 
end of April too. However, while I've made sure the path is clear (i.e., 
Proposed REC review meetings), I won't do the actual publishing until I get 
back from my travel in May. (The web team has a backlog of other specs to 
publish before the May 1 publishing moratorium and I didn't feel I needed 
to push this spec in before then.)

Abstract

   XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying
   information content to be digitally signed and for representing the
   resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications require the
   ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information
   content to be signed. The XML Signature specification meets this
   requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can be
   difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This
   specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the
   development of efficient document subsetting technologies that
   interoperate under similar performance profiles.

Status of this document

   This is the first publication for the "Signature Filter Transform"
   Working Draft from the IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group (Activity
   Statement). This specification defines an alternative to behaviour of
   the XPath transform of the XML Signature Recommendation [XML-DSig].
   The goal is to (1) more easily specify XPath transforms and (2) more
   efficiently process those transforms. This specification has already
   received a large amount of discussion and implementation within the
   Working Group. We hope to move to and through Last Call and then
   Candidate Recommendation very quickly.
