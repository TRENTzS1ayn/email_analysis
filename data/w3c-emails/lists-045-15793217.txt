Hi Gregor,

I would say that this sequence is ILLEGAL and/or simply does not work 
because c14n trashes the here() context and is therefore not allowed. XPath 
or enveloped-signature requires re-parsing and then here() is evaluated 
against a different document.

Apache impl throws exception in that case...

Regards,
Christian
