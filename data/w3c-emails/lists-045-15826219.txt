Dear Joseph and the XML DSig WG,

Thank you for reviewing the Last Call Working Draft:
   Character Model for the World Wide Web
   W3C Working Draft 26 January 2001
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-charmod-20010126
Comments such as yours help us produce a better specification.

Owing to the large number of Last Call comments and to the large number
of changes these comments gave rise to, the W3C I18N WG has decided to
issue a 2nd Last Call for comments:
   Character Model for the World Wide Web
   W3C Working Draft 30 April 2002
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-charmod-20020430

Please consult the Disposition of Comments:
   http://www.w3.org/2002/04/charmod-lastcall (public)
or:
   http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-lc (Member only)
to see the status of the comment(s) you submitted as part of the
original Last Call.  Note that the public version of the Disposition of
Comments does not contain details of Member only comments.

Please also check the new Working Draft to see whether you are happy
with the current wording.  If you don't understand our decision(s),
please write to us for details, using the email address given below.  If
you are dissatisfied with our decision(s), please submit a comment on
the new Working Draft.

Whether or not you are satisfied with our decision(s), please review the
new Working Draft and submit any comments by 31 May 2002.  Comments
should preferably be submitted via the Last Call Comment Form
(http://www.w3.org/2002/05/charmod/LastCall).  They may alternatively be
submitted by email to www-i18n-comments@w3.org.  To help us process your
comments, please submit each comment separately.  If doing so is too
awkward, please number your comments clearly.

Many thanks,
Misha Wolf
W3C I18N WG Chair
