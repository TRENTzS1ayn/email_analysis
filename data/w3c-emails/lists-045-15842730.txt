Hi all,

I created two signatures which re-create the example from [1].

One signature with, the other on omitting comments.

The signatures use a HMAC-SHA1 which is created using the 
"secret".getBytes("UTF-8") 'password'. Can anyone confirm?

BTW, do we have any other test vectors for this spec? Merlin?

Thanks
Christian
