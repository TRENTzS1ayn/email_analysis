Hi all,

short question about this: Did anyone ever had problems with things like 
this:

<XPath xmlns="&xmldsig-xfilter2;">
    here()<!-- comment -->/ds:Signature[1]
</XPath>

I mean that the XPath is "polluted" with a comment which splits the String? 
I figured out that this probably crashes my implementation.

Christian
