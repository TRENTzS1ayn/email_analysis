Subject: JOIN FOT FREE...Learn and Earn


Hello Fellow Networker,

My name is Melecio Ceniza . I am now focusing on one
online opportunity. 

I have tried several of these online opportunities 
full of hype promising us thousands of dollars 
every month.

It is a sad fact that many people who are in need
to earn additional income is being victimized by
this fly by night scam artists. Every time I tried
one opportunity after the other, I ended more broke
than ever.

As a result of trying all these opportunities, I
have decided to select on my portfolio the company
which is true to their words. Not the one full of
hype. The only one that has consistently sent me
the monthly check. Even without the hype they have
given me the best compensation plan with their high
% commission. They are providing real service not
the one that simply transfer wealth from the new
signups to the people at the top of the pyramid.
They are not a form of a pyramid scam.

Also when you join, you will have a team of upline
sponsors who will help you succeed every step of
the way. Instead of being left alone, you will be
guided step by step by real people, not those
autoresponders.

Do not believe in do nothing, no recruiting, no
selling schemes. They are scams. You might want to
try it to prove my words. Only you can make your
own success together with the help of your
sponsors.

If you have 2 to 3 hours a day, you will be able to
earn a full income in a few months. And there is
absolutely no limit as how much you can earn. It is
designed to gain momentum after some time.


But I prefer to avoid such statements as "You will
get rich". I read it everywhere and I do not want
to sound like them.

You can get your FREE membership ID by sending email to 
melcen25@lycos.com  and put "SIGN ME UP FOR FREE" 
in the subject and your Firstname and Lastname.
