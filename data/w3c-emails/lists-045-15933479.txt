Hi,

Has anyone had a chance to look further into my prior email about speed
testing the new filter.

I remain concerned that the new method remains too slow.  I agree that
it 'rules' from a flexibility standpoint, but correctness of the result
is not the only software requirement that exists.

Thanks,
John Boyer

Hi John,

OK, that's what I do. Interesting that the above is legal. Maybe we
should 
include such an obfuscation into our interops ;-)

Thanks,
Christian
