John,

could you please post the results of your software? I can't install it on 
my machine, so it'd be good to have the result of the transforms.

In your sample, I don't find tags called triggeritem. I only see 
<ae>triggeritem</ae>.

The same thing. I only see these values as text nodes:

<signitemrefs content="array">
  <ae>omit</ae>
  <ae>PAGE1.CHECK16</ae>

Hm, I try to create my filter based on your information: Is it the 
following? Could you fill out the ellipse (...) in the first XPath? Or even 
better, simply post a ds:Reference which is to be used for a signature on 
your sample file.

<ds:Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2002/04/xmldsig-filter2">
 <dsig-xpath:XPath Filter="subtract">
  /XFDL/page[@sid="PAGE1"]/*[@sid="CHECK16" or ... or @sid="FIELD48]
 </dsig-xpath:XPath>
</ds:Transform>
<ds:Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2002/04/xmldsig-filter2">
 <dsig-xpath:XPath Filter="subtract">
  /XFDL/page/*/triggeritem
 </dsig-xpath:XPath>
</ds:Transform>
