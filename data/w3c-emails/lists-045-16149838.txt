Hi John,

I attach a tgz file with signatures that covers the spec
examples and your XFDL document. The XFDL signature is
just stuck in the middle and has:

  URI=""
    enveloped-signature
    subtract /XFDL/page[@sid="PAGE1"]/*[@sid="CHECK16" or @sid="CHECK17" or @sid="FIELD47" or @sid="BUTTON2" or @sid="FIELD48"] | /XFDL/page/*/triggeritem

Is this the manner of signature desired? Is the triggeritem
a child of page/*? Should it be an enveloped signature or
subtract /XFDL/page/dsig:Signature?

[Christian: your examples work fine for me]

Merlin
