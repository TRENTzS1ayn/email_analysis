Hi all,

I am working for RSA Security Inc.
Currently, we are implementing an XMLSignature toolkit and we are looking
for other parties 
that we can test interoperability with.

If you would like to test the interoperability or your toolkit with our
toolkit, please let us know
so we can discuss the details on how to do this.

Thank you so much.
