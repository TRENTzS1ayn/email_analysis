I agree. If others find this confusing I could add the following erratum:

   E05 2002-05-08 (Clarification)
          The Type attribute described within 4.3.3.1 The URI Attribute
          and 4.4.3 The RetrievalMethod Element "contains information
          about the type of object being signed." The data object is that
          resulting from the Referencing Processing Model including any
          specified transforms. Using the Type to describe the object
          that is identified via the ferenceReference URI prior to its
          input to transforms is incorrect.
