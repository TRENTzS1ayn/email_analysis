Hi, Christian!

I've implemented your transform and the results are slightly better than
for the Merlin's one but I also have close to linear performance drop.
I probably can do some minor optimizations but I doubt that it'll give
more than 5-10% performance increase.
In general, your transform is much more complicated than Merlin's one
and I am not sure that it'll be simple to use it correctly.

Aleksey.
