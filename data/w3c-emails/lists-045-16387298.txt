Well, thanks for your quick reply. 
I was indeed looking for some standardized way of combining PKCS#7 and XML Signiture, just like it is possible for DSA an XMLdsig. 
(Because both are mechanisms for digital signing objects, aren't they?)
I came to that idea because I found a reference to an identifier called   <http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig-more#rawPKCS7signedData> http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig-more#rawPKCS7signedData in the document  <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-02.txt> http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-02.txt.
I unfortunately wasn't able to combine these pieces of information. 
 
greetings,
Roman

I think the first question to be pondered is NOT "How?" but "Why?".
 
You can of course use XML Signature to sign a PKCS#7 blob just like you can any other blob.  But I think the implication of your email is that you are looking for some standard specified way of combining PKCS#7 and XML Signature.  There isn't any.  Generally, XML Signature should be seen as the new way of doing digital signatures.  
 
It may make sense to port existing PKCS#7-based applications to XML Signature, but I doubt there would be any value trying to have a single digital signature be a hybrid of both XML Signature and PKCS#7.

Subject: newbie Question about PKCS#7

I'm very new to the topic of XML Signature and I have therefore a rather simple question, which I couldn' solve myself by reading the spec. I wanted to look, if this topic was already discussed in your list, but the mailing-list archiev was down. 
What I want to know is: How can I include the PKCS#7 Standard in an XML Signature? Do I have to use the http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1 URI?
