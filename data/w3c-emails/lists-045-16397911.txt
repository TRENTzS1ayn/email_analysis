Another approach is going forward in ANSI X9. A new work
item just begun, X9.96 XML Cryptographic Message Syntax 
(XCMS) will use the ASN.1 schema defined in X9.73 CMS 
and the canonical variant of the X.693 XML Encoding 
Rules (XER) to perform all CMS cryptographic operations
but in an XML format.

This same approach is going forward in the OASIS XCBF
work at http://oasis-open.org/committees/xcbf/, which
is based on ANS X9.84 Biometric Information Management
and Security and which relies on simplified versions of
X9.73 CMS types.

This approach takes the view that there are many simple
messages that require cryptographic enhancement that can
be expressed using XML markup but need not be processed
as if they were complex documents. Canonical XER allows
CMS signature operations to be performed in the same
manner as the current DER encodings used in IETF SMIME.
They are merely text instead of binary.
