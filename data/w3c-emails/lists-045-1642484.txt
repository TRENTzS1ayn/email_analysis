I've written a draft XML Signature Profile ( < 10 pages) in an invented P3P 
context [1]

This might be of interest to XML Signature folks because it shows how one 
might use signatures in an application context (particularly the definition 
of a signature semantic).

This might of interest to P3P folks because it shows how P3P might be fitted 
with Signatures, and it includes a basic XSLT that transforms P3P policy in 
XML --> English statement in  HTML.

Abstract
This document specifies a P3P Assurance Signature Profile.

Status of this document

This document has no status what-so-ever. It is a very rough draft of the 
author that hasn't received any review. It is not intended to be a normative 
specification. Instead, it an captures the authors' thoughts on how 
applications might use the XML Signature specification to meet their 
requirements (defining signature semantics and algorithm profile) via the 
P3P application context.
