For your information, we're working on an "XMLed" timestamping protocol (ie
RFC3161 in XML). In ASN.1, this time stamping protocol uses CMS (PKCS#7).

Well, thanks for your quick reply. 
I was indeed looking for some standardized way of combining PKCS#7 and XML
Signiture, just like it is possible for DSA an XMLdsig. 
(Because both are mechanisms for digital signing objects, aren't they?)
I came to that idea because I found a reference to an identifier called
<http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig-more#rawPKCS7signedData>
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig-more#rawPKCS7signedData in the document
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-02.txt>
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-02.txt.
I unfortunately wasn't able to combine these pieces of information. 
 
greetings,
Roman
