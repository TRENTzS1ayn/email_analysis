I would say XML Signature is a good way for creating digital signatures, 
even detached signatures which create arbitrary binary content. Even if 
there is no hint on what exactly IS the thing being signed, the signature 
itself has rich semantics. But of course, XML Signature will have no great 
future in environments where storage size or computing power are limited.

I would say yes. Signing a GIF or something similar is

<Reference URI="1.gif" (or URI="protocol://host/1.gif">
 and no transforms.

Other opinions?
