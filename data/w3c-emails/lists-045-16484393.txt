Hi Tom,

Please try signing a binary file using the Infomosaic SecureXML online
signature application. 
We use a base64 transformed version of the file when creating an
enveloped signature. This transform is part of the data in the signed
info section so one can get the original data back by doing a base64
decode. You can see how we fetch the original file back when you do the
verification. For a detached signature we simply calculate the digest on
the binary data with no transformation. One can obviously provide a
transformation here as well.

Manoj

      Ed:

      IMHO, XML Signature is not "the new way of doing signatures".
It's the new, and hopefully best, way of signing documents which include
XML. Do you expect people to sign pure binary data using XML Signature
rather than CMS?
      Maybe I'm confused about the standard, but I don't see a "Type"
value for transparent binary data or a transform for it.  Does a
Reference with both Type and Transforms omitted mean binary?

I'm didn't say that XML Signature is necessarily a replacement for
PKCS#7. What I am saying is that XML Signature is "the new way of doing
digital signatures" and that if one is introducing digital signatures
into a system, one should seriously consider using XML Signature over
PKCS#7.

Certainly, if a system is heavily ASN.1-oriented and where the subset of
digital signature functionality available in PKCS#7 is deemed
satisfactory for the foreseeable future, and the implementors really
want to use PKCS#7, I will not object.  There may indeed be cases where
PKCS#7 remains preferable.  But, in general (eg. not always), I think
XML Signature should be initially assumed to be the best alternative
until proven otherwise for application-layer security.

Perhaps I am misreading your email, but are you stating you don't think
XML Signature can sign binary data without adding a "binary" transform?
If so, I should point out that XML Signature today can sign binary data,
and that no "binary" transform is necessary.  Indeed, the great thing is
that a single XML Signature can cover mulitple binary objects (either
referenced or enveloped (and base64-ed)).

Please correct me if I'm misinterpreting any part of your email.

Regards, Ed
