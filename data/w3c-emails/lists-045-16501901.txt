The X9F4 WG has recently started X9.96 Trusted Time Stamp, a
new work item that will include XML markup representations 
based on the ASN.1 schema defined in the draft international
standard ISO/IEC 18014 Time-stamping Services, and the X.693
XML Encoding Rules (XER). The ISO/IEC 18014 draft includes 
support for the IETF work which is based on CMS.

Premature as to what X9F4 will do about signature support for
the XML markup encodings of time stamp values, but they will
likely rely on the processing defined in X9.95 XML Cryptographic 
Message Syntax (XCMS).
