Hi,
  The value of the URI attribute contained in the Reference element in
Manoj's example is "logo-text.gif". Should this not be prepended with
"file://" to give URI="file://logo-text.gif" to make it a valid URI?
Tony

Hi John,

You are right.
Please see the attached signed xml. The file that was signed is also

Thanks,

Wouldn't you need to include the message digest of the file in the
signed data as well and then sign the reference and the message digest
as signed info?
