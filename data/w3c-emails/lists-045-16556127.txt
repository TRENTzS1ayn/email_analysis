No, no need to.

file://logo-text.gif is an ABSOLUTE URL.

logo-text.gif is a RELATIVE URL and refers to the same directory in which 
the file resides which carries the XML Signature. For instance, if the 
signature file is in

http://www.vordel.com/~tony/mySignature.xml

, the URI="logo-text.gif" refers to the entity (file)

http://www.vordel.com/~tony/logo-text.gif

. If the signature is in a file on URL

file://C|/My Documents/Tony/mySignature.xml

, the relative URI refers to

file://C|/My Documents/Tony/logo-text.gif

. The advantage of a relative URI for a detached signature is that you can 
move around signature and signed contents from your local file system to a 
web server or whatever, the signature remains valid (as long as the target 
system supports the concept of what-is-a-directory and 
how-to-resolve-relative-URLs.
