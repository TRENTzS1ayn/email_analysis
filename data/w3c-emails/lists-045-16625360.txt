It is octets or a node-set.

[[
URI="http://example.com/bar.xml#chapter1" 
  Identifies the element with ID attribute value 'chapter1' of the
  external XML resource 'http://example.com/bar.xml', provided as an
  octet stream. Again, for the sake of interoperability, the element
  identified as 'chapter1' should be obtained using an XPath transform
  rather than a URI fragment (barename XPointer resolution in external
  resources is not REQUIRED in this specification). 
...
The data-type of the result of URI dereferencing or subsequent Transforms 
is either an octet stream or an XPath node-set. 
...
If the data object is a node-set and the next transform requires octets, 
the signature application MUST attempt to convert the node-set to an octet 
stream using Canonical XML [XML-C14N].
