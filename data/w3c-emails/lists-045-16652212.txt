Honestly, I'm not sure how. Haven't really seen anything like this to 
borrow from. And given what I've learned here I've tried to be more 
specific in xenc without much result for good reasons...

However! I am willing to add a row in the interop matrix if someone can 
provide me two things (that might already exist, just point it out to me).

1. A specific instance/example that we want to test over. (I'm sure there's 
an instance of a signature over John's test and expression on the list, but 
I lost track of all the examples while I was gone!).
2. A decent metric for evaluation. Is it adequate to say something like 
"Validate this signature on an expected target machine in under 500ms". Do 
we need to specify the type of target machine? I think we're talking 
something around 600 bogomips [1]...
