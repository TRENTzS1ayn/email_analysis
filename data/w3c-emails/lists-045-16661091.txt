      Joseph:

      If the syntax which has been suggested for transparent non-XML data
could be interpreted as a node-set, then IMO we need a syntax which
explicitly tells developers: "This reference accesses data transparently as
a sequence of octets.  That data is part of the base on which the digest is
calculated, but is not to be interpreted as XML."

It is octets or a node-set.

[[
URI="http://example.com/bar.xml#chapter1"
  Identifies the element with ID attribute value 'chapter1' of the
  external XML resource 'http://example.com/bar.xml', provided as an
  octet stream. Again, for the sake of interoperability, the element
  identified as 'chapter1' should be obtained using an XPath transform
  rather than a URI fragment (barename XPointer resolution in external
  resources is not REQUIRED in this specification).
...
The data-type of the result of URI dereferencing or subsequent Transforms
is either an octet stream or an XPath node-set.
...
If the data object is a node-set and the next transform requires octets,
the signature application MUST attempt to convert the node-set to an octet
stream using Canonical XML [XML-C14N].
