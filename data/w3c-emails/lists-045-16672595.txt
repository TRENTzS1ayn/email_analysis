Hi Tom,

in the example from the spec URI="http://example.com/bar.xml#chapter1", if 
you do not use any transforms which convert the octet stream into a node 
set (i.e. no transforms which return a node set), then the file contents 
are 'piped' into the digest method as is.

But if you (the developer) do something like XPath filtering, the octets 
from the file are treated as XML and are converted into a node set. But 
that's up to you. No transform - no node set.

Christian
