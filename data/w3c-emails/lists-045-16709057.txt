Hi Joe,

I have not the time to try the samples in depth; however,
two things strike me:

Your XPath transform '@*' apears to select any element
that has any attribute nodes; nothing else (no children,
no attributes). Is that intended?

Your XSLT emits a html document under the dsig namespace
with implementation-specific indentation. This seems
neither correct nor interoperable.

As always, I may be in error.

Merlin
