I don't see we have any open issues to discuss, but I'm not as familiar with 
the conventions of the IETF and whether the WG is expected to be present for 
a general update in a WG session or the SAAG. Regardless, if folks in the WG 
don't request a meeting, I'd expect you would be there I'd be happy to defer 
and rely upon your presence regardless.

I'd certainly encourage folks to work on interop if they are there and have 
the opportunity, and perhaps we could organize something like last time. 
However, if that would be the only reason for people to attend, we could 
lighten the travel by organizing a teleconference/IRC session  However, 
exchanging examples on the list seems to have been working well and I don't 
think that avenue is exhausted yet.
