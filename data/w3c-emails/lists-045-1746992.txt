Hi Joseph,

please add IAIK's implementation.

I will give you a report what our implementation is conform with at the
end of next week.

Regards, Gregor

> 1 Abstract
> 
> Any XML document is part of a set of XML documents that are logically
> equivalent within an application context, but which vary in physical
> representation based on syntactic changes permitted by XML 1.0 [XML] and
> Namespaces in XML [Names]. This specification describes a method for
> generating a physical representation, the canonical form, of an XML
> document that accounts for the permissible changes. Except for
> limitations regarding a few unusual cases, if two documents have the
> same canonical form, then the two documents are logically equivalent
> within the given application context. Note that two documents may have
> differing canonical forms yet still be equivalent in a given context
> based on application-specific equivalence rules for which no generalized
> XML specification could account.

> 2 Request for publication and outstanding issues
> 
> The publication of the Canonical XML Version 1.0 Candidate
> Recommendation is a result of a request sent to the Director and the W3C
> Chairs, archived at:
> 
> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2000OctDec/0021
> 
> The XML Signature WG reports that all last call issues have been
> resolved. The Canonical XML Version 1.0 Last Call Issue Report is at:

> 3 Exit criteria
> 
> The XML Signature Working Group encourages implementations during the CR
> period, which ends on 24 November 2000. The XML Signature Working Group
> must produce an amended version of the implementation report, taking
> into account new implementations, in order to exit the Candidate
> Recommendation phase, and showing that they have addressed all issues
> raised during the CR period.

> 4 Description of what Candidate Recommendation status means
> 
> The W3C Process Document describes the Candidate Recommendation status
> of a specification in Section 6.2.3:
> http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#RecsCR
> 
>     Advancement of a document to Candidate Recommendation is an explicit
>     call to those outside of the related Working Groups or the W3C itself
>     for implementation and technical feedback.
> 
> 5 Status of This Document
> 
> The "status of this document" section for the Candidate Recommendation
> reads:
> 
> This specification from the IETF/W3C XML Signature Working
> Group (W3C Activity Statement) is a Candidate Recommendation
> of the W3C. While this was originally a deliverable of the XML
> Core Working Group, completion of this specification has been
> delegated to the XML Signature Working Group.
> 
> The XML Signature Working Group believes this specification
> incorporates the resolution of all last call issues;
> furthermore it considers the specification to be very stable
> (as demonstrated by its interoperability report) and invites
> further implementation feedback during this period. The
> duration of Candidate Recommendation will last approximately
> four weeks (November 24).
> 
> Please send comments to the editors and cc: the list
> <w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>.
> 
> There have been no declarations regarding patents related
> to this specification within the XML Signature Working Group.

> A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical
