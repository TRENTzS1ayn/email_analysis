Done. A couple of questions, the first of which is mine, and the latter is 
something Boyer asked:

1. Is the requirement with respect to parsing and relative-URI-ns (reporting 
it as an error and not expanding) already implemented in the parser, or 
logic you had to add on for the time being?
2. <Boyer>One of the final editorial tweaks that Joseph asked me to make was 
to amend the beginning of section 2.1 to make it clear that document 
subsetting and node-set input meant the same thing.  When I say node-set 
input is recommended (as opposed to required), I'm saying that a conformant 
implementation should but is not required to do document subsetting as 
described in Section 2.4 and exemplified in Section 3.7. Since ... you have 
working code for example 3.7, I am just writing to ask whether this does 
indeed mean you created your implementation using XPath node-sets. </Boyer>
