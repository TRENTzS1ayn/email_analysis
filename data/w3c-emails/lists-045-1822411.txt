I have never seen a parser expanding relative namespace URIs to
abosolute URIs.  Our implementations uses Xerces-J parser.
Xerces-J does not report errors against relative namespace URIs.
So our implementation checks relative namespace URIs.

Yes.  Our implementation can process node-set inputs created
with Xalan-J's XPath module.
