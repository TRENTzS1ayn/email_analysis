Hi Gregor,

The role of a parser is only to crack a file into tokens and to identify
what those tokens are.  Optionally, a parse tree can be built. A
non-validating XML parser must identify ID attributes as being ID attributes
(whenever it can), in such a parse tree (or in the input token stream if a
parse tree is not built).

An application that uses an XML parser may choose to discard that
information if the application requirements do not identify a need for the
information, but this is outside of the scope of the XML parser
specification.  The information is provided by the parser should it be
needed.

Thanks,

That a non validating parser is required to normalize the attribute
values is ok. This is explicitley mentioned in XML 1.0 (Second Edition).

What I am not so sure about is, if a non-validating parser must support
structures which enable the application to select elements by the values
of ID attributes.
