Hi Gregor,

Actually, I understood your question a little better shortly after the last
email, though I wouldn't change anything in it at this time.

You are asking about the difference between what an XML processor must do
versus what information it must export to the application.

I don't recall anything that permits an XML processor to report less
information than it derives from the input.  In particular, I don't recall
anything that binds this concept to validating vs. non-validating
processors.

The closest we come to it is in the Conformance section of [XML], where
there is a reiteration of the idea that non-validating processors may vary
in their information output "depending on whether the processor reads
parameter and external entities".  But this is an instance of the processor
reporting less information because it has derived less from the possible
input (because it didn't read the input).

That in mind, I haven't gone looking through the spec for evidence to
support what you're thinking either, so I'd be happy to think about any
passage of the spec you may have come across that would substantiate a
behavioral difference.

Thanks,

That a non validating parser is required to normalize the attribute
values is ok. This is explicitley mentioned in XML 1.0 (Second Edition).

What I am not so sure about is, if a non-validating parser must support
structures which enable the application to select elements by the values
of ID attributes.
