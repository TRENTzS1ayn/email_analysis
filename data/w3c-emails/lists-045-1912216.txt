I am reviewing a specification for an application proposing to use XML
and DSIG.

The application proposes to use the feature of DSIG where the
Reference does not have a URI attribute.  Paragraph 4.3.3.1 says that
"the identity of the object is part of the application context."

I have a set of questions.

1

Is this another way of saying "it's up to the application to figure
out what the Reference points to."

2

If #1's answer is "yes", would I be correct to assume that such an
application could not use a generic DSIG compatible signer or
verifier, because this generic software could not resolve the
reference?

3

If #2's answer is "yes", isn't this a fairly strong argument for NOT
using the "Reference without a URI attribute" feature.

4

If #2's answer is "no", is this because there is an unwritten
convention for resolving a Reference without a URI?  For example,
would a generic signer/verifier assume it points to the whole
document, the first element, or something like that?
