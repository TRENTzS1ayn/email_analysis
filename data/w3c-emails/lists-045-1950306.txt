Joseph,

at IAIK we are currently trying to profile the Euroean standard
on Digital Signatures, ETSI 201.733 for XML Signatures.

In serveral cases it would be useful to be able to reuse Schema
types already defined in the XML Signature specification. 

But this is difficult, since most of the types are defined 
anonymously within the content model definition for the XML 
elements.

Therefore it would be a great idea to rewrite the schema with
explicitly named types. I don't think that this would be too
much work, and the changes do not influence any parties relying
on the current XML schema definition.

What do you think?

Regards, Gregor
