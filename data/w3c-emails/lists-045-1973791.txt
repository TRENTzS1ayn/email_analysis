Hi Gregor,

There's a couple of things I suspect we could do to make the schema a bit 
more robust/extensible, however I first wanted to error on the side of 
simiplicity given parts of the schema specification were changing. However, 
this among others like defining some of  our string fields as regexp facets, 
is quite simple and I think would be a good idea. It's a matter of people 
asking and proposing. Are you extending, restricting, redefining, using 
equiv classes, or subsituting?

Sounds good. Which structures do you want this over? Are you looking for 
somethign as simple as the following [1]. (BTW: If you just went ahead and 
tweaked the schema appropriately and proposed it (such that any instance in 
the old version is still valid in the new, that'd probably be the easiest 
way to go).)

[1] <element name="KeyValue" type="KeyValueType"/>

   <complexType name="KeyValueType" mixed="true">
     <choice>
       <any namespace="##other" processContents="lax"
        minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
       <element ref="ds:DSAKeyValue"/>
       <element ref="ds:RSAKeyValue"/>
     </choice>
   </complexType>
