Hi Ken, I believe you are correct.

Yes, as stated in the first paragraph, another feature of the Manifest is 
that it doesn't enforce reference validation. So if the app does want to 
validate them all, he would actually have N+1+1 hashes (the objects, the 
manifest itself, and signed info) versus N+1 hashes (the objects and signed 
info). However, the size of all the signatures combined (what I was thinking 
of) would be smaller using the manifest. (Because you don't have to 
duplicate all the References, the occur in a single Manifest which is 
Referenced each time.)

I'm not sure if your 1 and 2 are AND or OR. If I understand this correctly, 
if the three Signature are unable to jointly refer to a single Manifest, it 
doesn't save them much by way of space.
