Yes, sorry. I will take the single paragraph [1] and move it into the DSA 
section and in the RSA section provide a backwards reference (e.g., "do the 
same thing as stated in DSA").


[1] Arbitrary-length integers (e.g. "bignums" such as RSA moduli) are 
represented in XML as octet strings. The integer value is first converted to 
a "big endian" bitstring. The bitstring is then padded with leading zero 
bits so that the total number of bits == 0 mod 8 (so that there are whole 
number of octets). If the bitstring contains entire leading octets that are 
zero, these are removed (so the high-order octet is always non-zero). This 
octet string is then base64 [MIME] encoded. (The conversion from integer to 
octet string is equivalent to IEEE 1363's I2OSP [1363] with minimal length).
