Joseph,

Thank you for preparing the draft document on P3P Assurance
Signature Profiles. The P3P Specification Working Group
reviewed it at our face-to-face meeting last week. Overall,
we think your suggestions for signing P3P policies
and putting the signature in a seperate document sound
reasonable. We agree that attaching a signature directly
to a P3P policy or policy reference file would be nice, but
we are not prepared to work on that for P3Pv1. That is
certainly something that could be examined for version 2.

Some members of the spec group plan to review your
document further and may send you some additional
comments.

Regards,

Lorrie Cranor
P3P Specification Working Group Chair
