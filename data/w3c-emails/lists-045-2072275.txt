Thanks.

Yes, I have heard that there will be a fix in the Xerces parser we are
using in the next update.

Good question. Having read [3], I also thought John would like to close the
issue.

I am not very happy with the current situation, since I do not want to build
the functionality for the XML id() mechanism for my own, but want to utilize
existing parsers. 

For the Xerces DOM parser I can state, that selecting a
DOM element by specifying the value of its ID attribute is only possible if 
the DOM model has been built using validating parsing.
