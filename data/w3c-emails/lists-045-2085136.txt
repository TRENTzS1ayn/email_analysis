Hi Joseph and Gregor,

I was pretty sure we covered off the correctness of Example 3.7 last time.
There is no justification in any of the recommendations for ignoring the ID
type of e3's attribute when using a non-validating parser.

Though the change is simple, I would prefer not to change the example at
this time since it would also require a revalidation effort among the other
implementers who had no problem with this.

As well, your assertion that the Xerces DOM parser cannot select by id
unless using validation seems, on the surface, to contradict IBM's
interoperability report since they are most certainly using Xerces and yet
were able to complete example 3.7.

Moreover, if the id() function is something you have to implement, it is not
actually very hard to implement as long as 1) the parser correctly types the
id attribute when not validating, and 2) it is easy to hook your resulting
id() function into the Xpath implementation that evaluates the expression
given in example 3.7.  Are you saying that one of these two things isn't
working.

And again, if you are, then perhaps we should talk to Kent to find out how
IBM got it to work-- because it is certainly a legal example.

Thanks,
John Boyer

Thanks.

Yes, I have heard that there will be a fix in the Xerces parser we are
using in the next update.

Good question. Having read [3], I also thought John would like to close the
issue.

I am not very happy with the current situation, since I do not want to build
the functionality for the XML id() mechanism for my own, but want to utilize
existing parsers.

For the Xerces DOM parser I can state, that selecting a
DOM element by specifying the value of its ID attribute is only possible if
the DOM model has been built using validating parsing.
