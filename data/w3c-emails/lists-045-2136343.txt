The reason I asked was that because in the conformance table [1], I had 
nodest input with SHOULD and subsetting with MUST which was sort of confusing:

>Implementations MUST support the octet stream input and SHOULD also support 
>the document subset feature via node-set input.
>http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xml-c14n-20001026#DataModel

With this understanding I'll show subsetting as a mandatory feature, and 
node-set input as a optional way of implementing and mark Baltimore with a Y 
for both.
