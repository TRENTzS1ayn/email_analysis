Hi,

I think that most XMLDSIG implementations (certainly ours)
accept contextual information as a parameter to the
signing/verification process.

The resolution of an implicit reference (URI or node set)
is part of this contextual information.

Other relevant contextual information is a base URI against
which to resolve relative references, a security context in
which to resolve keying information, etc.

I think you will find that an external "reference resolver"
is a fairly typical form for this part of the contextual
information. Applications can configure and/or implement this
resolver as appropriate for their needs; specifying, in
particular, how to resolve implicit references.
