A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: ECDSA with XML-Signature Syntax
Author(s): S. Blake-Wilson, Y. Wang
Filename: draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt
Pages: 7
Date: 14-Nov-00

This document specifies how to use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm) with the XML-digital signature syntax.
The mechanism specified provides integrity, message authentication,
and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether
located within the XML that includes the signature or included by
reference.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
