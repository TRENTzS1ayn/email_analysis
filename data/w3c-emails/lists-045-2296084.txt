Hi folks,

Yongge Wang and I have taken a cut at extending the DSIG syntax to allow ECDSA.
(See the I-D referenced below.) We'd like to solicit comments from anyone in the
group that can find time to look ... in particular, did we do the extension
correctly, etc. We're hoping that if we can get the extension mechanism correct,
our work could help people who come along later and want to add support for
other alogrithms ...

Best regards. Simon

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


     Title          : ECDSA with XML-Signature Syntax
     Author(s) : S. Blake-Wilson, Y. Wang
     Filename  : draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt
     Pages          : 7
     Date      : 14-Nov-00

This document specifies how to use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm) with the XML-digital signature syntax.
The mechanism specified provides integrity, message authentication,
and/or signer authentication services for data of any type, whether
located within the XML that includes the signature or included by
reference.

In the body type:
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-blake-wilson-xmldsig-ecdsa-00.txt".

NOTE:     The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
     MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
     feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
     command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
     a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
     exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
     "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
     up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
     how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
