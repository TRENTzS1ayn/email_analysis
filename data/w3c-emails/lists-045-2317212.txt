     This draft doesn't contain any examples yet, so it's fairly hard to
critique, or test against.  It did take a while to do the examples for
PKCS-1.
     This may be an ignorant comment by someone who is far from being an
XML guru, but I didn't see a revised version of the Schema definition of
KeyValue incorporating ECDSAKeyValue, which would naturally go in there.
