Hi Kent,

It is easy enough to change the examples, but the purpose of the examples is
to show how XML can change as the result of c14n.  If one is using a
validating parser, one is expected to be able to modify the examples to
account for this.  It's really easy; you put DTD declarations into the
document until it validates, and all of your DTD declarations are removed,
so the canonical form is unchanged.

So, clearly I am most interested in your troubles with the non-validating
version of Xerces.  It certainly appears to me that Xerces does not fully
comply with XML 1.0 if it does not read attribute types and provide them to
the application for use.  It's DOM call may decide not to work, but even if
you have to implement id searching yourself, the attribute type should at
least be available for you to do this.  If not, IBM needs to do a patch for
you.

It would actually be better to get tools out there that can process the
examples as they are than it would be to let this go and have
non-interoperable signatures because even the major vendors don't follow the
spec closely enough for the ever scrutinous sha-1 hash.

The Document.getElementsById() method of Xerces-J's DOM
implementation works only with the validating parser.  while I
tested the example 3.7, the parser output many validation
errors.  Fortunately, the parser does not stop parsing and
validation on a validation error.

In general, a validating XML processor MAY stop parsing on a
validation error, and a non-validating XML processor need not
process attribute types.  We would not get correct results of
example 3.4 and 3.7 with such XML processors.  I think example
3.4 and 3.7 have to be modified so that they become valid
documents.
