I have been using Xerces myself; a very minor patch corrects
the problem of it not applying internal doctype information to
documents in non-validating mode. Kent, if you're interested
I can send you the patch next week. I sent it to the Xerces
list a while ago but got no response.

With this patch applied, the DOM 2 ID resolution stuff works
fine. So my vote too is to leave the examples as they are.
