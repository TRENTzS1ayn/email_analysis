Hi,

Early in the XMLDSIG effort I presented some slides on what I perceive
as the difference between the document and the protocol points of
view.  I have written up a few words on this and caused them to be
posted as a personal Internet Draft as indicated below.

Thanks,
Donald

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: Protocol versus Document Points of View
Author(s): D. Eastlake
Filename: draft-eastlake-proto-doc-pov-00.txt
Pages: 8
Date: 15-Nov-00

Two points of view are contrasted: the 'document' point of view,
where objects of interest are like pieces of paper, and the
'protocol' point of view where objects of interest are like composite
protocol messages.  While each point of view has its place,
inappropriate adherence to a purely document point of view is
detrimental to protocol design.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-proto-doc-pov-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.
