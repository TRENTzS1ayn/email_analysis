The way I think about SignatureProperty is that it's an assertion about the 
Signature (an implicit RDF:about), so this sounds ok to me. However, this 
isn't explicit really and my preference is if people cleanly define their 
own semantics. So you could place this in an object, reference the first 
signature and it gives you integrity, if you want to mean something else, 
you could include that semantic (using the <CounterSignature> that Merlin 
suggested [1] (though it should be namespace qualified).)

I will add an ID to that element.
