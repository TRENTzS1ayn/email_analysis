Folks,

I have no idea who among you follows the PKIX-discussions, where new XML-
and PKI-related workitems have been discussed and promoted mainly by some
folks like Anders Rundgren and myself and others and fighted against by
others :-).

Topics would be anything that is PKI and XML related (so XMLDsig would have
been a candidate if it did not exist already) starting from
Attribute-Certificates, where some think that they are so
application-specific anyway that nobody will use the current AC-draft
anyway, up to the extreme - definitions of Public-Key-Certs in XML, whatever
the WG-participants decide to pursue. Anybody interested in (religious)
discussions should please read the relevant messages (archive at
http://www.imc.org/ietf-pkix/mail-archive/) first to spare us some time by
avoiding repeating arguments.

The idea now was how to proceed. Options are

- that this was a stupid idea from the beginning and everybody involved
should
  be ashamed
- to have it as an activity which would be ideally placed within the
  PKIX-group (which is not really an option as Steven Kent and many
  others would not support it)
- to have it as a new activity of the XML-DSig WG
- to start a new WG within the IETF
- to start a new WG within W3C
- to start a new joint WG within W3C/IETF

rumours tell that the XML-encryption-WG has been placed within the W3C due
to the experiences of the joint XML-DSIG effort.

As this group is as close to these topics as I can think, I'd like to get
your opinions.

Peter
