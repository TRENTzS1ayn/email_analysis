Dear all,
Some additional precissions to the message by Karl, coming from
my understanding of what it was said  in the ETSI meeting.

First, it was seen that this is a very generic problem whose solution
should involved to a vast community (even broader than W3C signature
group). So, if you know of relevant people in the W3C that could give their
opinion, you could pass these messages to them, or even you could direct
us to the specific forum (if there is one) where to raise the topic.

Second, although it is true that no decision was taken, the general feeling
of the group was more in favor of the URL solution, but then two different
approaches were sketched concerning to the management of the URLs.
I will try to summarize (please ETSI people, correct me if you think that I
missunderstood
them):

1. Try to envisage the possibility of making alll these URLs to be below of
the umbrela of W3C. So the URLs the could be something like:
http://www.w3.org/etsi/oid.

2. The second alternative would be that ETSI would keep itself as the
base URL: http://www.etsi.org/oid/....

So the questions that remain open are: which is the forum where
this discussion should take place? which one of the schemas proposed
seem to be more convinient? what would be the most convinient way 
for proceeding to the allocation and definition of the URLs (W3C tree or
ETSI tree)?

Regards.

Juan Carlos Cruellas.
