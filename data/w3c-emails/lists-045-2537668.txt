You should only use the number form such as in:
http://www.etsi.org/oid/0/4/0/1733/1/4/1
because the name form is not mandatory and synonyms can sometimes exist.

Of course, this is not readible but you could define aliases at each level of
the registration tree as I did on the ASN.1 website
<http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/oid/>. This would allow you to write things like:
http://www.etsi.org/oid/itu-t/identified-organization/etsi/electronic-signature-standard/part1/idupMechanism/etsiESv1

You could also use http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/oid/

The ASN.1 website allow people to add their arc (identifier + number) to
the view of the registration tree that is provided. Of course, the material
is validated before appearing on the website to avoid bad use of the tool,
but we tried to provide an easy-to-use feature (when filling the form,
you can indicate URLs where other information/spec./documents can be
found).

This company can at least register its arc by using its number form (but not
using its name form if the company thinks that it is confidential).

Yes, and legal things should also be checked.

There is a draft RFC (the author was Meallow if my memory serves me right)
that addresses the translation of OIDs into URNs. I sent comment to the
authors and proposed him to implement an OID-to-URN translator on the
ASN.1 web site, but I don't know what is the status of is document now.
