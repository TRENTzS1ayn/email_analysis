Hello Karl,

Many thanks for your message. The best mailing list for this
discussion is uri@w3.org, where you will find the experts and
interested people. If you are (an employee of) a W3C member
organization, you may also be interested in the W3C URI Planning
Interest Group (see http://www.w3.org/Addressing/Activity#current).

Regards,   Martin.
