Processing' <draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-10.txt> as a Proposed Standard.

Group.  The IESG contact persons are Jeffrey Schiller and Marcus
Leech.

 
Technical Summary

  portions of an XML structured document. It can also provide a
  mechanism for an XML document to provide a digital signature for
  information which is not directly contained within the XML document
  itself.

  The working group came to consensus on this document. Note: the XML
  Digital Signatures Working Group is a joint working group of the
  IETF and the W3C. The processes of both organizations were followed
  in the production of this standard.
