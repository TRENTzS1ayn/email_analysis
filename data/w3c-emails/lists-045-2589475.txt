Chris Lilley just pointed out the following problem
in C14N. I think this at least has to be explained
much more clearly in the notes.

It's not really NCRs. It's a special notation to stand in for byte values.

There needs to be a much better note to make very clear that (different
to the other examples), this example is not really intended to be XML
and cannot be used directly in a test. It would also be advisable
to provide an actual file that contains the real bytes, or to point
to it if that's already around.
