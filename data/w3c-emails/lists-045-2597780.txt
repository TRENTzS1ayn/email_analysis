i still prefer the version with names. i think that it is not really a
problem that there can be synonyms for a name. there is even no requirement
that there is just one OID for the same thing; e.g. there are several
different OIDs identifying DSA, 1.3.14.3.2.27 and 1.2.840.10040.4.3.

yes, i found if. it is RFC 3001. but it seems that "oid" was actually not
registered through IANA yet. at least i did not find it, when i was on their
web-site. i also saw, that they did not use names either.
