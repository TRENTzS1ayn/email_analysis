     Why, exactly, are we including the organization specification of the
OID in a URI as a subordinate of the domain name?  Both "etsi.org" and "OID
0.4.0" refer to the same organization, after all.  A meaningful URI for the
example below is more like:
     http://www.etsi.org/oid/1733.1.4.1 or
     http://www.etsi.org/oid/electronic-signature-standard/1.4.1

     The one real advantage of using URI's over OID's to a programmer is
that the programmer can find the assigning authority, and then have a
reasonable chance of finding the definition.

i still prefer the version with names. i think that it is not really a
problem that there can be synonyms for a name. there is even no requirement
that there is just one OID for the same thing; e.g. there are several
different OIDs identifying DSA, 1.3.14.3.2.27 and 1.2.840.10040.4.3.

yes, i found if. it is RFC 3001. but it seems that "oid" was actually not
registered through IANA yet. at least i did not find it, when i was on
their
web-site. i also saw, that they did not use names either.
