Hi Tom,

Sorry for the delay ... I wanted to get back to the office and consult with our
XML expert before responding!

Thanks for the comments. We're working on some examples, and are planning to
post them as a separate document. I'm not sure how we left out the updated
schema for KeyValue ... we've added it now and are planning to wait a little
while to see if any more comments come in before we post it.

Thanks again. Simon

     This draft doesn't contain any examples yet, so it's fairly hard to
critique, or test against.  It did take a while to do the examples for
PKCS-1.
     This may be an ignorant comment by someone who is far from being an
XML guru, but I didn't see a revised version of the Schema definition of
KeyValue incorporating ECDSAKeyValue, which would naturally go in there.
