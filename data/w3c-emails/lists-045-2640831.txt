(I'm not cross-posting, 'cause <your> listserv stripped the
XMLDSIG list address cc: off your posting, and I don't know what
it is :-)

I'd have some concern about:  what happens when there is discrepancy
between the digit and textual representations (i.e., it's an
error).

I'm not entirely sure that the XML problem couldn't be solved by
a convention of a comment line that accompanies any identifier,
to spell out what they need.

But, that's fairly top-of-my-head.

Leslie.
