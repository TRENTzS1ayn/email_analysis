you can never prevent anyone from making errors in principle. but i admit
that you should try to, if we can. but it's the same, if you encode an OID
in an ASN.1 specification: no one prevents you from writing wrong OIDs.

i don't think that a comment is the actual solution we are talking about (at
least not me). because for a comment, we need not to discuss the syntax.
but, comments will of course be used additionally where applicable.
