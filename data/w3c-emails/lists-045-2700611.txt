     Is what is meant "... from an encoding which is neither a UCS-n
encoding nor a UTF-n encoding"?  That would seem to cover UCS-2, UCS-4,
UTF-8, and UTF-16 (along with UTF-7 for good measure).  If UTF-8 is not
included, although the NFC transformation would seem to have no effect on
it, just replace "UTF-n" by "UTF-16" in the sentence above.

Subject:  Character Encoding Question



Hi Martin and group,

I received a letter today from Jeff Cochran (JCochran@docutouch.com)
regarding a tweak that would appear to be needed regarding c14n and xml
signature.

The I18N group asked us to include a sentence along the lines of "REQUIRED
to use Normalization Form C [NFC] when converting an XML document to the
UCS
character domain from a non-Unicode encoding".

Apparently this is not exactly what is meant since UCS-4 character planes
outside of the BMP are technically non-Unicode.  The point Jeff makes is
that he doesn't know whether to apply NFC to UCS data that appears outside
of the BMP.

Question:  Should the statement be rewritten?  If so, how?

Thanks,

Subject: Fwd: I18N problem in XML canonicalisation


Chris Lilley just pointed out the following problem
in C14N. I think this at least has to be explained
much more clearly in the notes.

It's not really NCRs. It's a special notation to stand in for byte values.

There needs to be a much better note to make very clear that (different
to the other examples), this example is not really intended to be XML
and cannot be used directly in a test. It would also be advisable
to provide an actual file that contains the real bytes, or to point
to it if that's already around.

Regards,    Martin.
