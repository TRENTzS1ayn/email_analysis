As far as I remember, you need to be subscribed to the ASN.1 mailing
list if you want to send to it (same applies to the ETSI list).
If you want to send to the people who are involved in ASN.1 standardization
(and not to all the subscribers of the ASN.1 list), send to asn1mtg@oss.com 
(anybody can send email to this one).

Th best way would probably be to use both the name form (for readibility) and
(mandatorily) the number form, and say that, in case of ambiguity or whatever,
the number form takes precedence.

See my proposition above.
