That is an incorrect statement. UTF-16 is able to encode things 
outside the BMP just fine, the the method for doing so is specified 
in the Unicode Standard an in RFC 2781.

This is also not true: there are private use areas allocated in 
planes 15 and 16.

This all started with a statement:

"REQUIRED to use Normalization Form C [NFC] when converting an XML 
document to the UCS character domain from a non-Unicode encoding".

This was a bit of shorthand on the part of whoever wrote it. Simply 
change "a non-Unicode encoding" to "any non-UCS encoding" or "any 
local encoding".

Oh God no. UTF-7 was a mistake and has, thankfully, never been widely 
adopted. The only real use of UTF-7 is in IMAP and everyone there 
deeply regrets it. Pretend that you never heard of UTF-7.
