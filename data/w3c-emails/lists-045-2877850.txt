Hello John,

There is no problem with UCS-2 and UCS-4. The UCS is a set
(in the math sense) of characters, each with a number associated.
There is only one UCS. Just saying 'UCS', there are no assumptions whatsoever
about representation (UCS-2 and UCS-4 are both 'charset' labels), and
no assumptions about subsetting (UCS-2 can be used, in the right context,
to denote a certain subset of the UCS). So I don't see any problem.

Regards,   Martin.
