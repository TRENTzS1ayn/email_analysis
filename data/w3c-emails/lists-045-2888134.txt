I do. :-) "Non-Unicode" is not specific enough to prevent confusion, 
as this discussion has shown. Does it mean:
- all charsets except UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE
- all charsets except UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UCS-2, UCS-4
- all charsets that are not defined by the Unicode Consortium in some 
version of the Unicode Standard
- something else
