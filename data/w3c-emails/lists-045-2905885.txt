Maybe we are talking about different things. Section 6.5 of 
draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-11.txt says:

The terms "non-Unicode encoding" and "Unicode" are not defined. I 
believe any of the following could be the definition of non-Unicode 
encoding:

- all charsets except UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE
- all charsets except UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UCS-2, and UCS-4
- all charsets that are not defined by the Unicode Consortium in some 
specific version of the Unicode Standard
- something else

Clearly, "Unicode" is the opposite of "non-Unicode".
