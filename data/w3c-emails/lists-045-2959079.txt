Subject: XML Key Management Services


Following up on the discussion on XML based PKI, those interested can
read about the proposal we announced this morning together with

The intention is to develop the specification further as an open
standards in a standards body that is generally considered a good fit.

I would like to request that the PKIX chairs allow a slot on the agenda
to present the initiative and how we see it as complementing
PKIX/SPKI/PGP rather than being a direct competitor.
