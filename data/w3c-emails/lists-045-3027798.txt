I finally got around to adding "Type" on the end of the complex types and 
representing the changes in the spec [1]. With respect to the "FIXME"s.

1. Ok, xml declaration is now present.
2. 'FIXME, as is, minOccurs/maxOccurs of "choice" or "any" can be omitted'. 
Are you saying it's redundant? I'm not sure: what I think we were saying is 
you can have 0 or more elements (any 0:unbounded) from 0 or more namespaces 
(choice 0:unbounded). I agree with you if we want to say every 
SignatureProperty content should only have elements from a single namespace 
-- which makes sense since people can use multiple SignatureProperties.
3. 'FIXME, HMACOutputLength is not referenced anywhere in this document'
It can be used in the SignatureMethod which has an open content model, but 
to make it clear I changed SignatureMethod to:
    <complexType name="SignatureMethodType">
      <choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
        <element name="HMACOutputLength" type="ds:HMACOutputLengthType"/>
        <any namespace="##any" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      </choice>
      <attribute name="Algorithm" type="uriReference" use="required"/>
    </complexType>

Also, to give SignatureValue an ID, it is now:
    <complexType name="SignatureValueType">
      <simpleContent>
        <extension base="ds:CryptoBinary">
          <attribute name="Id" type="ID" use="optional"/>
        </extension>
      </simpleContent>
    </complexType>
