The Call for Implementaion Period for Canonical XML closed on November 24th. 
An InformationalRFC as well as a new Candidate Rec (for consideration for 
Proposed Rec) is being prepared. Changes made include those resulting from 
comments [1,2,3], no change was made with respect to [4].

However, in order to successfully advance it to Proposed Rec, it'd be good 
in we could fill in some of the gaps in the interop-report [5]. (Petteri and 
Merlin, can you report on the list the status of your implementations with 
respect to these questions about the parsers treatment of encoding and 
relative URIs?)
