Hi, Tom,
Does this example make sense?
I have tried to open it with the IBM XML Viewer, it seems ok...
Note that I used the option: <!DOCTYPE Signature SYSTEM
"xmldsig-core-schema.dtd" .....
and the file xmldsig-core-schema.dtd was downloaded from
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/xmldsig-core-schema.dtd
and this file contains an error: line 109 should be: <!ELEMENT SignatureProperty
 %SignatureProperty.ANY; >
(The last ; is missed in the downloaded file).

Best regards,
Yongge

     This draft doesn't contain any examples yet, so it's fairly hard to
critique, or test against.  It did take a while to do the examples for
PKCS-1.
     This may be an ignorant comment by someone who is far from being an
XML guru, but I didn't see a revised version of the Schema definition of
KeyValue incorporating ECDSAKeyValue, which would naturally go in there.
