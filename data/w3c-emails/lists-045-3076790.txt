     Thank you.  I would remove the "X509Certificate" from the example, as
it isn't necessary with both SubjectName and IssuerSerial present, and the
value given seems far too short.

Hi, Tom,
Does this example make sense?
I have tried to open it with the IBM XML Viewer, it seems ok...
Note that I used the option: <!DOCTYPE Signature SYSTEM
"xmldsig-core-schema.dtd" .....
and the file xmldsig-core-schema.dtd was downloaded from
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/xmldsig-core-schema.dtd
and this file contains an error: line 109 should be: <!ELEMENT
SignatureProperty
 %SignatureProperty.ANY; >
(The last ; is missed in the downloaded file).

Best regards,
Yongge

     This draft doesn't contain any examples yet, so it's fairly hard to
critique, or test against.  It did take a while to do the examples for
PKCS-1.
     This may be an ignorant comment by someone who is far from being an
XML guru, but I didn't see a revised version of the Schema definition of
KeyValue incorporating ECDSAKeyValue, which would naturally go in there.
