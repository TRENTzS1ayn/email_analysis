I think you are close with the above, but I think you should change it to

"use Normalization Form C [NFC] when converting an XML document to the UCS
character domain from any encoding that is not UCS-based (currently,
UCS-based
encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE, UCS-2, and UCS-4)."

Why my change:

- There are also others in the IANA registry
    (look e.g. for 'unicode' or 'iso10646').
- There are things we know apply but we don't want to mention (UTF-7).
- We don't know what other might come up (hopefully none :-).
- UCS-2 is mentioned because it's not the same as UTF-16.

Please feel free to send this to the involved lists for further
checking.

Regards,   Martin.
