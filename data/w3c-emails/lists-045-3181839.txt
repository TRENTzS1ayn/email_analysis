     Time stamps are certainly likely to be in one SignatureProperty with
policies or condition assertions in another, and they will not normally
come from the same namespace.

Actually, my point here is that others might have though that (for
instance)
a signature semantic and a time stamp (both from different namespaces)
actually did sit in their own SignatureProperty. How do others feel?
