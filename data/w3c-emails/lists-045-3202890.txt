Status of this document
This is a revised Candidate Recommendation of the IETF/W3C XML Signature 
Working Group (W3C Activity Statement). This version includes three 
clarifications resulting from comments (1,2,3) made during the four week 
call for implementation (which formally ended November 24th). The XML 
Signature Working Group believes this specification incorporates the 
resolution of all last call and call for implementation issues; furthermore 
it considers the specification to be very stable (as demonstrated by its 
interoperability report). We hope to refer this document to the W3C Director 
for consideration as Proposed Recommendation in early January.

Please send comments to the editors and cc: the list 
<w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org>.
There have been no declarations regarding patents related to this 
specification within the XML Signature Working Group.
