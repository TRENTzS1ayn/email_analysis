Hi Rick,

I considered this feedback, as shown in the latest c14n issues document, but
came to the conclusion that I did not see anything confusing about

"The content of the doc element is NOT the string #xC2#xA9 but rather the
two octets whose hexadecimal values are C2 and A9, which is the UTF-8
encoding of the UCS codepoint for the copyright symbol (C)."

which appears as the only note in the example.  It seems impossible to miss.

S. 3.6 of Canonical XML is still confusing, in that the notation is not
explained.

It would be better to give a hex dump of the whole document

 < d  o c  >      <  / d  o c >
