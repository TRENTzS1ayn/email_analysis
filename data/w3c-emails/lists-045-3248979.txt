I missed it, twice!  Or at least on two separate occassions I read the
text, got identically confused and then later both times figured out what
was going on (only to forget).  In both cases, I think I assumed that
there was a typo and the & had been missed out from the things that looked
like numeric character references.

I think it is bad speccing to present something that looks like XML but
isnt.  Having the explantation after the event is not much help, because
the confusion has already ocurred. 

I hope you will consider my option.

Cheers
