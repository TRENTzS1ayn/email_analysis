Um, that's not how I remember the intent of these items.  It was my
understanding that we were defining <SPKIData> and <PGPData> as known tags
where the internal sub-elements would be defined by the respective working
groups.  We went a further step to define some of the PGP sub-structure
(based on advice from members of the OpenPGP WG).  I think the ANYs should
be present both for PGPData and SPKIData.

>3) The DTD version does not allow customization of contents of PGPData.

You are right (schema *does* permit ANY in PGPData). However, X509Data and 
SPKIData do not presume that you will add external elements to those element

types; instead should someone ever define an authoratitive structure, that 
structure will be the child of KeyInfo, not our placeholder. So I will 
remove the ANY from PGPData:

    <complexType name="PGPDataType">
        <sequence>
          <element name="PGPKeyID" type="string"/>
          <element name="PGPKeyPacket" type="ds:CryptoBinary"/>
        </sequence>
    </complexType>
