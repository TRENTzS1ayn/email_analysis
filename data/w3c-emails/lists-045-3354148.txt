Hi Brian, I bet your recollection is better than mine on this note.

However, I was going to ask even if that what was intended, should it be so 
now? SPKIData is provided for a particular a non XML representation, "The 
content of this element type is expected to be a Canonical S-expression." As 
is PGPData: PGPKeyID and PGPKeyPacket are of type string and ds:CryptoBinary 
respectively.

Given our philosophy of extensibility and the use of XML I'd think that if 
WGs created actual XML structures, they should have their own root element 
that sits under KeyInfo under their own namespace. Under my understanding, 
the following namespaces had well specified meanings:
[1] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#X509Data
         X509 is fairly extensive
[2] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#PGPData
         encoding of KeyID and KeyPacket
[3] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#SPKIData
         SPKIData for S expressions
and if someone supports any of these, it's clear what it means. Having ANY 
within these structures still requires the use of an external namespace, but 
makes the ability to say, "I support [1,3]" ambiguous.
