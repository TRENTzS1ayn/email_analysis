The ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) DASE (DTV Application Software
Environment) is expected to normatively reference the XML DSIG recommendation
(hopefully to be finalized very soon).

It is a requirement of DASE to support MD5 as a message digest algorithm as well
as MD5 with RSA Encryption as a signature algorithm, and thus we need URNs to
refer to these algorithms. We note that XML DSIG does not presently define a URN
for either of these algorithms. Therefore, we request that the XML DSIG group
add URNs for these algorithms, e.g.,

http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#md5
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-md5

If XML DSIG doesn't define these, we will have to define our own URNs; however,
given the very high likelihood of the use of these two algorithms, we believe it
would be in the best interest of the XML DSIG user community to have W3C specify
these URNs.
