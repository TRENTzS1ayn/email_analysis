We didn't define URLs for MD5 because the crypto community has moved
away from using or recommending MD5 in any new standard over the past
few years, and thus there wasn't anyone pushing for use of MD5 with
XMLDSIG.  Why are you specifying use of MD5 in a new standard?
Shouldn't you be using at least SHA-1?  Along these lines, the request I
expected to see is for XMLDSIG to specify URLs for SHA-256, SHA-384 and
SHA-512.

Note: I'm not saying we shouldn't specify an URL for MD5 and
RSA-MD5-PKCS1v1.5, just questioning your reliance on it in a new
standard.  However, if we are going to open up the URL list then we
should definitely add SHA-256, -384 and -512 to the list.

Subject: XML DSIG Algorithm URNs


The ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) DASE (DTV Application
Software
Environment) is expected to normatively reference the XML DSIG
recommendation (hopefully to be finalized very soon).

It is a requirement of DASE to support MD5 as a message digest algorithm
as well as MD5 with RSA Encryption as a signature algorithm, and thus we
need URNs to refer to these algorithms. We note that XML DSIG does not
presently define a URN for either of these algorithms. Therefore, we
request that the XML DSIG group add URNs for these algorithms, e.g.,

http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#md5
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-md5

If XML DSIG doesn't define these, we will have to define our own URNs;
however, given the very high likelihood of the use of these two
algorithms, we believe it would be in the best interest of the XML DSIG
user community to have W3C specify these URNs.
