As odd as it may sound to some I actually side with Adams on this one.
Sometimes it is necessary to compromise security in small ways (like using
MD5 instead of SHA-1) in order to make things fit just right. However
because this is in reference to such a situation, I believe we need some
method of classifying functions into at least 3 categories; strong,
moderately secure, broken. These will have to be done in such a way that a
function can be moved down the list, and I'm not firm on either the name or
even the number of categories so anyone can feel free to name them
differently if they can come up with something better. That would allow us
to meet the needs of those that need to use MD5 for whatever reason.
Alternately it may be recommendable for ATSC DASE to move to SHA-1. Based on
what's been said MD5 does not seem to be used because of it's speed, if for
no other reason than RSA signing is a fraction of the speed of DSA, and
unless you are signing values of astonishing size (Gigabytes at least) DSA
as spec'd will outperform RSA signing. MD5 was not used for it's size,
because an RSA signature size is chosen by the size of the modulus, if size
were an issue either ECDSA or DSA would have been selected. In terms of
security DSA is at least as good as RSA for the same size. So except for the
name there's really no reason to use RSA. If we do specify such URNs I would
like to see the use of the name PSS instead of PKCS 1.5 simply because it is
academically correct, the PSS paper specified PSS, and PKCS 1.5 merely
packages it up into an ASN.1 box.
