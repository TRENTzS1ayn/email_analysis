Hi Joseph,

Regarding the here() function, the XPointer WG some time ago agreed to
having essentially the same definition as ours, and their last call
working draft reflects this decision.

So, I'd say it is safe to take out the 'Note' in our document, though
hopefully this feature will not change after last call-- as was the case
with entity markers in InfoSet.

Subject: Prepping Next Version of Signature Spec


I'm working to publish a new Candidate REC next week, and then if we
haven't 
introduced too many more bugs, we can advance the document in May. We
may or 
may not be able to resolve the xmldsig#md5 and XSLT!=string issue by
next 
week, but I don't think they are critical path for an update to the spec

(they are straightforward choices regardless.)

Some things to note is that will be using the latest version of schema
[2] 
(hopefully I haven't introduced any bugs into the definitions and the
one 
example), and we now have a section on CryptoBinary [3] for which the
bignum 
text applies to (generalized to all CryptoBinary).

John, there's still some text in there that reads:

>Note: The function definition for here() is intended to be consistent
with 
>its definition in XPointer. However, some minor differences are
presently 
>being discussed between the Working Groups.

Can this be deleted now?
