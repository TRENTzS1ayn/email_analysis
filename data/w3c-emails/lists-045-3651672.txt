We are also using SHA-1 (and recommend it as a preference), but need to use MD5
for compatibility with certain existing practice as well; that is, we have
certain legacy issues we must contend with. It seems to us that XML DSIG should
recognize the continued use of these legacy algorithms even if they are not
recommended.

Glenn
