     Brian's point about defining URN's for the new extended SHA's is still
appropriate, even assuming that we include support for MD5 and RSA/MD5.
Should we include RIPEMD-160 (and perhaps RIPEMD-128) as well?  They are
not mandatory to implement, of course.

We are also using SHA-1 (and recommend it as a preference), but need to use
MD5
for compatibility with certain existing practice as well; that is, we have
certain legacy issues we must contend with. It seems to us that XML DSIG
should
recognize the continued use of these legacy algorithms even if they are not
recommended.

Glenn
