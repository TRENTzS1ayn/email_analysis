Given the suspicious things that have been found re MD5, I think that
if we included it, we would have to specifcially recommend against its
use with RSA or similar signature algorithms. (As far as I know these
suspicious things do not effect its security in HMAC applications.)

However, given the state of standardization of XMLDSIG and the large
number of possible additional URNs, I think it would be a better idea
to have an additional supplemental document for them.  What do people
think of such an idea?

Thanks,
Donald
