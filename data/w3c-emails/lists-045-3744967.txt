Gregor (and/or other implementors),

I know the one example you provided that I'm using for interop included the 
XSLT element. If we remove the XSLT element it will no longer be valid (but 
Gregor's point is that it isn't valid now as the type for it is defined as 
string.) Does anyone mind if we drop the element?
