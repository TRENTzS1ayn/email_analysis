In order to go to Draft Standard, the IETF requires there be two
indepenent interoperable implementations of each significant
option/feature.  As far as I can tell, there are none for Minimal
Canonicalization.  Unless a couple pop up in the next few days, say by
next Tuesday, I suggest that it be dropped from the specification.

Thanks,
Donald
