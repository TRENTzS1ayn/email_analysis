Hi Donald,

What guidelines are used to measure significance? Current
interop examples exercise KeyValue and X509Data, but none
of the other key info types. Is that important? It seems
that RetrievalMethod is possibly the most complex of them;
does it rise above insignificance?

On the m5l C14N front, the algorithm seems relatively 
unpopular with current implementers. I know that we will
not be implementing it in the near future, so will not be
able to participate in any necessary interop.

Merlin
