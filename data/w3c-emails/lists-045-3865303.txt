I'm not 100% sure but I can seek guidance if necessary.  I don't
currently believe it would include such things as syntactic hooks for
user defined algorithms.  However, I think you may have a good point
on RetrievalMethod.  Given that it's implementation is a SHOULD, it
seems like ti ought to be in the interoperability matrix...

Thanks,
Donald
