Hi,

We use the URI &dsig;dsa-sha1 to identify the DSA signature
algorithm; similarly, &dsig;rsa-sha1 to identify RSA with
SHA-1. I don't believe that we should use these same URIs
to identify the actual public key encoding. The hash
algorithm is unrelated to the key encoding. I would suggest
that, for the purposes of RetrievalMethod, we use the URIs:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#dsa
  http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa

In particular, bear in mind that additional documents will
be produced that define rsa-md5, etc. at which point key
encoding URIs will become confused if they are not clarified
here.
