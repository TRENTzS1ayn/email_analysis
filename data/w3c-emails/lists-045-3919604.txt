Following up to, and changing, my opinion:

I'm not sure that the language used in 4.4[1] is
entirely correct:

"The following list summarizes the |KeyInfo| types
 defined by this specification. [...]"

Technically, the DSA and RSA types are |KeyValue| types,
not |KeyInfo| types. I would suggest that we move all
the text for RSA and DSA down to just above the text
for &dsig;rawX509Certificate and there state that the
RSA and DSA |KeyValue| structures may appear as the
target of a |RetrievalMethodType| identified by the
URIs:
