Hi,

Attached is a revised version of the large signature from [1]
along with its intermediate c14n.

In accordance with my understanding of [2], the &xslt; stylesheet
element is now embedded directly beneath the &dsig; Transform
element with no intermediate &dsig; XSLT element.

Additionally, following from [3], the keying information is now
provided by RetrievalMethod. Resolution of this keying information
requires support for XPath and X.509. If it should prove useful,
I can revisit this; perhaps with more broken out examples.

Other than the obvious and requisite differences from [1], the
data are binary identical to before.

Merlin
