Hi Merlin, Gregor and Joseph,

Please note that the Transform is also the most likely place to define
the xmlns:xsl namespace attribute.

I'm with Gregor. I think that the text should be something along
the lines of:

The normative specification for XSL Transformations is [XSLT].
The XSL transformation is encoded within a namespace-qualified
<code>stylesheet</code> element which MUST be the sole transform
parameter child element.

I.e:

<Transform xmlns="&dsig;" Algorithm="&xslt;">
  <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="&xslt;" ...>
    ...
  </xsl:stylesheet>
</Transform>

Next paragraph, typo "covert" -> "convert".

Next paragraph, typo "to perform canonicalize" -> "to c10e".
