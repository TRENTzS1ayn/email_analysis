Merlin, I' agree, and I've done this a few times myself (starting tweaking 
the document on this note to improve it, then confusing myself!). But I 
think your suggestion of needing different URIs for the algorithm versus 
their structure is an improvement.

Ok, if I understand, you are suggesting:
1. We keep the &dsig;dsa-sha1 and &dsig;rsa-sha1 algorithm identifiers.
2. We create section 4.4.2.1 and 4.4.2.2 for a DSA and RSA key values, and 
give them their own URIs.
3. How much of section 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 do we move up in 4.4.2? Everything 
after the example SignatureMethod?
