Hi Merlin,

Sorry, in haste I was thinking of XPath, where you have to put the
namespace declarations in the XPath element (or any ancestor such as the
Transform element) because the content is an XPath expression, not XML.

For the XSLT transform, you don't need to put the xsl namespace
declaration in the Transform element because the XSL stylesheet is
itself XML and can therefore declare its own namespace (as Gregor
showed, had I gone down a little further).

So, sure you are right that it is safe to disallow specification of the
xsl namespace from the content model of the Transform itself.

John

Hi John,

I don't understand.. Is this for a technical reason,
or is it simply accepted practice? I ask because
when I use the DOM to form a namespaced document and
when I then serialize it, namespace attributes only
appear where evoked, not in anticipation of their
evocation as you describe.

Thanks,

Merlin
