     Your examples aren't truly MINOR nitpicks.  Having just reread section
4.4 and approved of its recent changes, I have some.
     In the first paragraph after the numbered list in section 4.4.4, some
text reads "MUST refer to the certificiate (sic) or certificates ...",
which should be fixed.  Two paragraphs later, the word "terminates" is
misspelled as "termiantes".  Furthermore, in the sample KeyInfo, the
intermediate cert subject is missing a comma ("OU=FVTO=IBM" should be
"OU=FVT,O=IBM") and the delimiter between the word "issuer" and its DN
should be a space rather than a comma for consistency.
     In section 4.4.6, there are some similarly trivial problems.  The
expression "at least" is missing a space between its component words, and
the phrase "replaced all-together" should probably be "replaced altogether"
or even "replaced entirely".
