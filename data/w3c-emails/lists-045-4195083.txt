Two questions:

1) Why did you choose to use URLs that were not of the form
"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#<something>", where the something is
sha256, sha284, etc.  Ideally these should probably be NIST-defined
identifiers, and failing that I would have expected them to follow the
XMLDSIG naming scheme.  

2) Why did you add the truncation options to SHA-384 and SHA-512?  I
can't really see a point in this; if you want a shorter hash output then
just use a shorter hash function.  DO you have a particular scenario in
mind that would likely want to use a subset of a SHA-384 or SHA-512
hash?
