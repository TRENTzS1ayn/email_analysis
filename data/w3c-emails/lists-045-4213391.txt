Thank you Brian, I've hopefully captured these tweaks and added the 
following paragraph:

http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html#sec-CryptoBinary
This type is used by "bignum" values such as RSAKeyValue and DSAKeyValue. If 
a value can be of type base64Binary or ds:CryptoBinary they are defined as 
base64Binary. For example, if the signature algorithm is RSA or DSA then 
SignatureValue represents a bignum and could be ds:CryptoBinary. However, if 
HMAC-SHA1 is the signature algorithm then SignatureValue could have leading 
zero octets that must be preserved. Thus SignatureValue is generically 
defined as of type base64Binary.
