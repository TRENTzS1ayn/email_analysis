Hi guys,

I dislike the truncation option on the two SHA digests. The fact
that their underlying implementations are similar will probably
be entirely hidden from XMLDSIG implementors who will likely do
MessageDigest.getInstance ("SHA-384") or equivalent. Truncation
will add significant (relative) complexity in this (probable)
situation.

I'd suggest, for consideration, the type foo#pkcs7SignedData
pointing at a PKCS#7 signed data with associated certs and CRLs.
While not necessarily _good_, it is a fairly common container.

I could not find draft-eastlake-uri-fqdn-param-00.txt but I
personally would prefer a single base URL (not the XMLDSIG
namespace) that suggests the common origin of these URIs.

Merlin
