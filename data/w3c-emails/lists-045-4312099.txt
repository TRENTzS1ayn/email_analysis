My draft doesn't prohibit there being anything at the URL's. These
additional URIs are, at this instant, not part of the W3C standard or
otherwise in the orbit of the W3C.  The XMDLSIG standard permits
algorithms defined by other orgnanizations, such as these, and does
not require them to be dereferencable.  Do you want to change the
XMLDSIG standard to require dereferencability?

But I still don't understand why you assume the suggested URIs would
not be dereferencable.  In fact, I would think that the IETF would be
more stable and better able to keep material there than you typical
current dot.com.  Furthermore, I can't understand why you say they
would be like OIDs.  There is no global database or protocol system
associated with OIDs that I am aware of.  Domain names and URIs are
inherently different in having a global database, which usually
contains physical address pointers, and a system of protocols
associated with them.

Well, since people seem to be against it, I do plan to drop it from
the draft. And if the unit testing impact is too much for some
organizations, that's another reason.

As for integration testing, I would argue that if there are no
DigestMethod's with a parameter, then the mechanism for handling
parameters to them will never be exercised and is a lot more likely to
be buggy than an implementation of this trivial truncation feature.

So I can't make any assumptions about implementations but should make
assumptions about cryptographic size/strength requirement
quantization?

Ahhh, you have an existing implementation without this feature...
