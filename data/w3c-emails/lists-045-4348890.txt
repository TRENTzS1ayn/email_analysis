>Abstract

>This document specifies XML digital signature processing rules and
>syntax. XML Signatures provide integrity, message authentication, and/or
>signer authentication services for data of any type, whether located
>within the XML that includes the signature or elsewhere.

>Status of this document
>
>         This specification from the IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group
>         (W3C Activity Statement) is a second Candidate Recommendation of
>         the W3C. This version contains many bug-fixes, clarifications,
>         and improvements for DTD/schema extensibility and re-use. It
>         reflects resolution of recent (and past) issues and the Schema
>         Proposed Recommendation. As warned in the previous Candidate
>         Recommendation, the minimal canonicalization algorithm has been
>         removed because the Working Group could find no implementation.
>         This specification is considered to be very stable. The W3C
>         Namespace Policy requires that if a change in the namespace
>         makes previously valid or compliant instances and
>         implementations invalid, the namespace must also change.
>         Since the clarifications do not substantively affect valid
>         instance syntax or implemented features, the namespace has
>         not been changed.
>
>         The duration of this Candidate Recommendation will last one month
>         19 May 2001 to ensure we have not introduced any new errors and so
>         as to coincide with the close of a four week IETF last call.
>         Subsequently, and assuming no substantive issues are raised, this
>         version will be proposed as a Proposed Recommendation and Draft
>         Standard. Note, this specification already has significant
>         implementation experience as demonstrated by its
>         Interoperability Report.
