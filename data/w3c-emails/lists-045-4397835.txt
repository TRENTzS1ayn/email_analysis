     The main advantage fixed URI's do have over OID's as algorithm
descriptors from a developer's standpoint is, after all, that you can look
at the URI and make a claim like "If there's online information on this
algorithm, it or a link to it should be in this place".  By comparison,
chasing down the definition for a given OID may not be quick, automated, or
cheap.
     If a URI is not dereferenceable, its usefulness is much closer to that
an OID, except that it's somewhat larger.  The domain name may give you a
contact without manually going through intermediate assignment authorities,
but that's all.

I didn't claim there weren't any tables of OIDs in the world.  But it
is fundamentally different from domain names whose intent in to be
indexes into an on-line distributed data bases and where it is an
error for the corresponding node not to be automatically locatable.
