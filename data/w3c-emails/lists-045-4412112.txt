I don't think XMLDSIG can require that every URI used be dereferencable,
since the identifiers may refer to private-label algorithms or only have
meaning within  a particular cloced community.  However, I think
anything we define in the standard (or a companion document) should be
dereferencable.

You put the URLs in the "ietf.arpa" domain.

1) That domain is not resolvable currently, at least none of the root
servers seem to know about it.  Please point me to a nameserver for the
ietf.arpa domain.  If the domain isn't active yet, please tell me who's
going to operate machines to  provide DNS service for that domain, and
what the policies will be to get content served from within it.  I
haven't seen a plan for this yet; maybe it's in another draft somewhere?

2) I never suggested that the URLs for these algorithms reside within
the domain of  any current corporation, so I do not understand your
comparison between the IETF and a "typical current dot.com".  I
specifically said that I expected the URLs to be "owned" by either NIST
or the W3C.  The W3C has already demonstrated their ability to provide
these services, and I believe NIST's stability is beyond question.

I don't see any difference between OIDs and un-dereferencable URLs in
the ietf.arpa domain unless you are assuming that particular DNS records
for these subdomains exist and are populated is some particular fashion.
I didn't see any mention of that in either of your drafts.  Furthermore,
I believe your statement above is incorrect: URIs in general do not have
any global database, although URIs in a particular scheme may inherit
one based on their scheme-specific structure.  For HTTP of course
there's a domain name in the URL, which allows you to look up a record
in DNS, but how does that help us specifically if the host doesn't
exist?

Huh?  The feature exists solely to exercise the implementations, not
because there's any customer need for it?  How can that possibly be
adequate justification for inclusion in a standard?

Yes, because that's part of our task -- to make security recommendations
on mininum  cipher strength, modes of operation, etc.  We do this all
the time.
