The IESG has received a request from the XML Digital Signatures Working
Group to consider XML-Signature Syntax and Processing
<draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-2-00.txt> as a Draft Standard, obsoleting RFC
3075, a Proposed Standard.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by May 27, 2001.
