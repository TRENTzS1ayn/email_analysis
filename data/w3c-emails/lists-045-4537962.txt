Hello,

RSA Security is interested in becoming part of the on-going XML Signature
interoperability testing. How do we become part of the
interoperability matrix? Additionally, have the interoperability results
that are posted http://www.w3.org/Signature/2001/04/05-xmldsig-interop.html
been verified by a third, or does each participant simply post their
results?

Please let me know what must be done to become a part of this testing.

Thank you very much,

Blake Dournaee

Hi Joseph,

Baltimore laxly enforces the schema. I'd suggest adding the
following to the list of features:

. XPath
. XPath 'here()' function

These are exercised by example 14.
