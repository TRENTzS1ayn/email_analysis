Hi

I hope this is the right place to ask questions on xmldsig...

I have just read the recommendation for xmldsig and now I have a question:

In many cases where a signature is necessary more than one individual has to
sign. How is it possible to have several people to sign the same document?
It seems to me that the schema only allows one signaturevalue?

Am I reading the schema right and is there a way to have documents signed by
more than one?

Thanks in advance.

/Jesper
