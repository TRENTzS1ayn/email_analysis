Hi,

I'd like to know what interoperability there has benn between
independent implementations of KeyInfo types other than KeyValue and
RetrievalMethod.

In particular, has there been such interoperation for
X509Data, PGPData, or SPKIData
and if so with what subelement or elements?
Also for KeyName, are there two implementations which have agreed on
some particular interpretation for some KeyName values and
interoperated?

Thanks,
Donald
