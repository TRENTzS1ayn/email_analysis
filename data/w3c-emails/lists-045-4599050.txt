Hi Elliotte,

As with the prior email, I'd appreciate it if you'd elaborate on this
point a bit more.  For my own case, I currently believe that DTD is used
interchangeably as an abbreviation for both the document type definition
grammar and the document type declaration.  Note, however, that I take
my understanding of what DTD means directly from its usage in the XML
Recommendation [1], which incidentally seems to use DTD more often to
refer to the DTDeclaration. Moreover, the same usage for DTD appears in
XPath [2].

In section 2.1 it is written that:

Note that the XPath data model does not create comment nodes for
comments appearing within the document type declaration (DTD).

The problem is that "document type declaration" is not abbreviated
"DTD". DTD stands for document type definition, which is not the same
thing as a document type declaration, though they're closely related. I
suggest simply deleting " (DTD)"
