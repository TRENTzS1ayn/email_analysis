Hi Donald,

The RetrievalMethod example from the last interop points at
an X509Data containing X509SubjectName, X509IssuerSerial and
X509Certificate. Clearly the certificate worked, as that is
where the verification key was retrieved. As for the other
bits, what are the criteria for interop? Successful parsing?

Is it important (from the perspective of having XMLDSIG
successfully advanced along standards tracks) to have hard
interop on these other features?

Merlin
