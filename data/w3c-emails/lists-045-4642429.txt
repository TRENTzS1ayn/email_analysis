Hi Elliotte,

[Definition: The XML document type declaration contains or points to 
markup declarations that provide a grammar for a class of documents. 
This grammar is known as a document type definition, or DTD. The 
document type declaration can point to an external subset (a special 
kind of external entity) containing markup declarations, or can 
contain the markup declarations directly in an internal subset, or 
can do both. The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken 
together.]

I think we read the last sentence of this definition differently.  I
read it as pretty much establishing that they are the same thing since
the DTD for a document consists of precisely that which is represented
by a document type declaration.  To wit, immediately below the
definition you cited, there appears the following:

Document Type Definition

[28]    doctypedecl    ::=    '<!DOCTYPE' S Name (S ExternalID)? S? ('['
(markupdecl | DeclSep)* ']' S?)? '>' [VC: Root Element Type] 

In other words, a document type definition is defined to be that which
gramatically resolves to a document type declaration.
