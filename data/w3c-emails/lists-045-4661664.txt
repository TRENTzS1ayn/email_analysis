I think it's quite clear. "The document type declaration contains or points to
markup declarations that provide a grammar for a class of documents.
This grammar is known as a document type definition, or DTD." This 
does not state that the document type declaration IS the DTD. It 
states that it points to or contains the DTD. Then it goes on to say 
that the document type declaration may in fact do both, in which case 
there's an internal subset and an external subset. In this case the 
document type declaration contains the internal subset and points to 
the external subset. In other words it contains part of the DTD and 
points to the other part of the DTD, but it still isn't the DTD!

I agree that's confusing and I should probably file an request for 
clarification on that as well. However, that heading is NOT the 
normative definition of a document type definition or DTD. The 
normative definition is given in the Definition paragraph quoted 
above.

It seems we're now arguing not about whether you can use "DTD" to 
mean document type declaration. but about whether there is in fact 
any difference between the document type definition and a document 
type declaration. There is in fact a HUGe difference, and this should 
be quite clear. A document type declaration specifies a root element, 
a system ID, and a public ID. A document type definition does none of 
these things. In the BNF grammar the document type declaration is 
represented by production 28. The DTD is represented by the 
combination of part of production 28 and all of production 30. Other 
specs like DOM and the XML Infoset are even clearer on this point.
