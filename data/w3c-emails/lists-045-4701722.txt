I believe that in cases where the XMLDSIG standard specifies
particular grandchildren of KeyInfo, such as X509Certificate,
PGPKeyPacket, or SPKISexp and there has not been any interoperability
demonstrated, we may have to move that part of the spec to the
Additional URIs document or to an appendix. The situation is less
clear for KeyInfo children that really just reserve a slot for
something pretty much undefined, like MgmtData. I'm not sure we need
to demonstrate anything there.

Thanks,
Donald
