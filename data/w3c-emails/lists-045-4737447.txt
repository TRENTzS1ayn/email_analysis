I then attach, for your pleasure, an archive containing a few
signatures that exercise:

  KeyName RetrievalMethod[rawX509Certificate] X509Certificate
  X509SubjectName X509SKI X509IssuerSerial X509CRL

Instructions for validating these are provided in an enclosed
Readme.txt.

We've exercised DSAKeyValue and RSAKeyValue often, and I think
we agree that MgmtData is reasonably safe. I'm afraid that I
cannot, however, accomodate PGP and SPKI data in the time
available to me.

If anyone can validate any or all of these, that would be
great. They seem to work for me, but I often break things
badly.
