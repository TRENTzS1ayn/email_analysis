Hello,

I had a general question about the XML Signature Syntax: Why were URIs
chosen as the main means identifying all resources, identifiers, and
references? I can see that this is a very convienent way of doing things,
but I was wondering if there is a little more history to how and why URIs
were chosen for everything?

Thanks,

Blake
