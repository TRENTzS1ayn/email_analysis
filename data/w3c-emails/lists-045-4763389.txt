I'm cc:ing your email to the list as others' recollections are probably more 
accurate than mine.

In general, we erred on the side of relying upon explicit declaration over 
implicit/default meaning and the element was made mandatory. Also, at one 
point we spoke of a "null algorithm" meaning no canonicalization. Over time, 
we lost the "null canonicalization" concept because it doesn't make much 
sense in the XML processing context and we continue to maintain the explicit 
declaration. Subsequently, the implementations have always used 
canonicalization, and it's been Canonical XML that everyone has used -- we 
dropped minimal canonicalization. Consequently, there are two slightly odd 
characteristics of this Method:

1. Should you wish to not use any canonicalization (this isn't really 
meaningful to my mind), the declaration would look like:
   <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm=""/>
2. CanonicalizationMethod, SignatureMethod, DigestMethod, and Transform all 
were of type "mixed", meaning character data could be included between the 
start and end tag, this would be information relevant to the actual method 
(parameters). Aside of transforms, we haven't seen a great deal of 
employment of this functionality yet.

I don't understand. Do you mean encrypted, or signed?

The *.tar.gz examples in the Implementation Report might help you understand 
how the CanonicalizationMethod is used:
        http://www.w3.org/Signature/2001/04/05-xmldsig-interop.html

If in fact someone wants to use null processing, giving that such an 
approach is rather rare (no implementations are supporting this), I think it 
should actually be explicitly designated.
