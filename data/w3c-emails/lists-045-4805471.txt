I don't think I completely understand the problem yet. Is this to say that

1. the content model for KeyName should be precluded from having a 
white-space as the first or last character? (Not sure if this is possible 
using XML Schema patterns [1] since they don't support ^ and $.)
2. That a processor will not have those white spaces available to them? 
(What happens if people want to use generic xml tools like query or XPath 
where the whitespace is preserved/important)
