1. The schema will not prevent people from having leading or trailing
whitespace in the content of KeyName (and it shouldn't!).  The spec will
just say that any leading and trailing whitespace MUST be trimmed to obtain
the actual KeyName.

2. The code will look something like this:

  Node nodeKeyName = XPathAPI.selectNode(doc, "//KeyName/text()");  // get
the text content of <KeyName>
  String strNodeKeyName = nodeKeyName.nodeValue();
  String strKeyName = strNodeKeyName.trim();
  KeyResolver.resolveWithKeyName(strKeyName);

I don't think I completely understand the problem yet. Is this to say that

1. the content model for KeyName should be precluded from having a 
white-space as the first or last character? (Not sure if this is possible 
using XML Schema patterns [1] since they don't support ^ and $.)
2. That a processor will not have those white spaces available to them? 
(What happens if people want to use generic xml tools like query or XPath 
where the whitespace is preserved/important)
