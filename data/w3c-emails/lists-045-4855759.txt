Hi Gregor,

I qualified RFC 2253 with 'I think' because I did not
have documentation in front of me.. You're right, it
is not explicit, but I think it is in the spirit of the
document and its requirements of flexibility in the
handling of whitespace. In particular, spaces at the
end of attribute values must be escaped, which suggests
(to me) that unescaped spaces at the end may be ignored.

But you are right, an XMLDSIG statement would be in
order, and would appear to be compatible with RFC2253.
It should probably state that escaped spaces at the end
must be preserved.
