There's another issue that seems relevant. RFC 2253 states
that strings must be converted to UTF-8 and then the escaping
rules must be applied. Do we honour this, or should we UTF-8
decode the RFC2253 string before embedding it in the text node.

Essentially, should the final example in RFC 2253 be encoded
in XML as:

UTF-8 encode and require ASCII escaping of high-bit-set chars:
  SN=Lu\C4\8Di\C4\87

UTF-8 encode and embed the result directly:
  SN=Lu??i?? (where ? is a high-bit UTF-8 byte directly embedded)
  (Here the meaning is confusing because the UTF-8 encoded
   text will correspond to some other Unicode charactes, e.g. ?)

De-UTF-8 and embed the Unicode original:
  SN=Lu?i? (where ? is the original character)

The last seems like the best option to me.

Plus require escaping of all ASCII controls.
