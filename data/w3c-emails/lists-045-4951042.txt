Hi Gregor,

If you choose to write a document using a lossy encoding then
all nonrepresentable characters will be corrupt - dnames, key names,
signed data, attributes, etc. - I suspect that lost dnames
would be the least of your worries. Indeed, if it is reasonable
to use a lossy encoding, then it is probably reasonable to
assert that any dnames in the signature should be representable
in that encoding too.

The benefits of encoding dnames in unicode (human readability
of signed documents for all, rather than just the US-ASCII)
I think far outweigh the alternative.
