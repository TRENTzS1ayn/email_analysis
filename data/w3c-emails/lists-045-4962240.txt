An XML document consists of characters, not bytes. And in
content, each character can be escaped by a numeric character
reference. Therefore, you can have a document only encoded
in us-ascii, but will lots of &#dddd; (or &#xhhhh;); this
will transport any character in Unicode, and a browser
will display it correctly (assuming it has the right font).

This would be okay.

This would be a catastrophe. You cannot put arbitrary byte
sequences into and XML document. UTF-8 for example uses
bytes in the range 0x80-0x9F, which are illegal is iso-8859-X.
Such a file would have to be rejected by the XML parser.

I agree. But it has to be spelled out clearly, and tested.
