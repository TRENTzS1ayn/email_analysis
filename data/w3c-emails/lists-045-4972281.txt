The escaping is useful because:

<DName>CN=foo
</DName>

According to RFC 2253, this states that the common name is
foo<LF><TAB>. However, if you trim() the text value then you
would get common name foo. Requiring escaping of ASCII controls
would result in CN=foo\0A\09 (if that is what is meant) which
is unambiguous and can be safely indented, whitespace formatted
and trim()ed. It would also eliminate a few other potential
ambiguities:

To reiterate what Tom said, RFC 2253 states that ignorable
whitespace may surround the comma or semicolon, then it says
that ignorable spaces (as oppose to whitespace) may precede
the comma or plus and may surround the equals. It also states
that spaces at the end of an attribute value must be escaped.

In other words, non-space whitespace around a plus or equals
or at the end of an attribute value (e.g., the end of a dname)
is significant. If we require that all significant ASCII
controls be escaped, then trimming and formatting involving
newlines and tabs will be safe, and meaningful whitespace in
dnames will be explicit.
