While I understand the sentiment behind this proposal, I believe it
would be a mistake.  We have specified that KeyName is a String value
whose semantic meaning is defined solely by the sender & recipient.
It's a transport mechanism for a string, that's all -- any rules about
proper format, contents, etc., thus are application-specific.
 
I can all too easily envision, unfortunately, scenarios for KeyName
where automatically stripping off white space would break
interoperability.  Consider the case where the KeyName is actually a
filename telling the recipient where to look in a local key cache for
the verification key.  Filenames on many operating systems can have
spaces in them, including leading spaces.  Alternatively, suppose that
the value of KeyName was used as a database lookup key, and it was
space-padded to be of fixed length.
 
(Here's another example, although specific to Microsoft.  On Win32
platforms, it is likely that folks would use KeyName to store CryptoAPI
key container names.  Rules for container name validity are defined by
each algorithm implementation (crypto service provider -- CSP).  A
limitation like this could create all sorts of weird behaviors...)
 
Let's leave KeyName as just a string.

1. The schema will not prevent people from having leading or
trailing whitespace in the content of KeyName (and it shouldn't!).  The
spec will just say that any leading and trailing whitespace MUST be
trimmed to obtain the actual KeyName.

2. The code will look something like this: 

  Node nodeKeyName = XPathAPI.selectNode(doc,
"//KeyName/text()");  // get the text content of <KeyName> 
  String strNodeKeyName = nodeKeyName.nodeValue(); 
  String strKeyName = strNodeKeyName.trim(); 
  KeyResolver.resolveWithKeyName(strKeyName);

I don't think I completely understand the problem yet. Is this
to say that 

1. the content model for KeyName should be precluded from having
a 
white-space as the first or last character? (Not sure if this is
possible 
using XML Schema patterns [1] since they don't support ^ and $.)

2. That a processor will not have those white spaces available
to them? 
(What happens if people want to use generic xml tools like query
or XPath 
where the whitespace is preserved/important)
