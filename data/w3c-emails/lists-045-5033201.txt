BTW, I'm not pushing one way or the other; those working most directly with
complex implementations are in the best position to comment.  My suggested
wording was only iff there was a concensus to make the change.

While I understand the sentiment behind this proposal, I believe it would be
a mistake.  We have specified that KeyName is a String value whose semantic
meaning is defined solely by the sender & recipient.  It's a transport
mechanism for a string, that's all -- any rules about proper format,
contents, etc., thus are application-specific.
 
I can all too easily envision, unfortunately, scenarios for KeyName where
automatically stripping off white space would break interoperability.
Consider the case where the KeyName is actually a filename telling the
recipient where to look in a local key cache for the verification key.
Filenames on many operating systems can have spaces in them, including
leading spaces.  Alternatively, suppose that the value of KeyName was used
as a database lookup key, and it was space-padded to be of fixed length.
 
(Here's another example, although specific to Microsoft.  On Win32
platforms, it is likely that folks would use KeyName to store CryptoAPI key
container names.  Rules for container name validity are defined by each
algorithm implementation (crypto service provider -- CSP).  A limitation
like this could create all sorts of weird behaviors...)
 
Let's leave KeyName as just a string.

1. The schema will not prevent people from having leading or trailing
whitespace in the content of KeyName (and it shouldn't!).  The spec will
just say that any leading and trailing whitespace MUST be trimmed to obtain
the actual KeyName.

2. The code will look something like this: 

  Node nodeKeyName = XPathAPI.selectNode(doc, "//KeyName/text()");  // get
the text content of <KeyName> 
  String strNodeKeyName = nodeKeyName.nodeValue(); 
  String strKeyName = strNodeKeyName.trim(); 
  KeyResolver.resolveWithKeyName(strKeyName);

I don't think I completely understand the problem yet. Is this to say that 

1. the content model for KeyName should be precluded from having a 
white-space as the first or last character? (Not sure if this is possible 
using XML Schema patterns [1] since they don't support ^ and $.) 
2. That a processor will not have those white spaces available to them? 
(What happens if people want to use generic xml tools like query or XPath 
where the whitespace is preserved/important)
