I'm not particularly motivated either way on this (moreso
on dnames), but if we leave things unchanged I'd suggest
that we add a sentence stating that whitespace surrounding
the value of a KeyName _is_ significant.

Apps with damagable key names could always surround their
keyinfo names with quotes - after all, they have to conform
their key names to valid XML characters. But that's probably
more ugly than leaving things the way they are.
