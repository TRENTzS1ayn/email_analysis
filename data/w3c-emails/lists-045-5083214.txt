Hi Gregor,

I would actually suggest something much simpler:

Encoding:
  Take the RFC 2253-encoded name, replace all characters < 32
  with \XX (RFC 2253 hex encoding) and then UTF-8 decode this.
  Whitespace format if desired.

Decoding:
  Trim whitespace, UTF-8 encode the text and you have the RFC
  2253-encoded name.

The value is RFC 2253 compliant (considering UTF-8) and is
easy to process without know anything about RFC 2253 or
DNames.

For example, to fire the dname at an LDAP directory from an
XML node you could just do:

out.write (node.getNodeValue ().trim ().getBytes ("UTF-8"));
