I've actually solved it for myself by using a framework that can
defer signing until the final document is complete. This is okay
for my particular needs, but it won't work for someone who is
using, for example, Apache's SOAP framework (which never builds
a DOM tree, but instead manually marshals the SOAP envelope in
text format*) or who has no control over the final embedding of
their signature.

My concern really revolves a bit more around interop and the dsig
spec than this particular instance.

* It does make the namespace available, but not through DOM.
