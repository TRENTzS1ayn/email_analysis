Hi John,

I agree that what we do is necessary. XPath is an obvious example of a
text node that relies on the namespaces in scope.

However, I still think that this subject deserves clear discussion in
the spec.

Other standards that rely on XMLDSIG will need to state explicitly
in what context the signature is valid. For example, XKMS can be
transported over SOAP. Should signatures in XKMS documents be valid
in the scope of the SOAP envelope, or only when removed from any
enclosing envelope. If this is not clearly stated, we're in for
complete interop failure. I think the fact that _every_ consumer
of XMLDSIG will have to make this decision means that it needs
better coverage in the XMLDSIG spec.

Also, do you happen to know if the following is sufficient, according
to the relevant XML standards, to eliminate all inherited namespaces
from a document subtree:

  subTree.getParentNode ().removeChild (subTree);

According to XPath, subTree will have started out with a bunch of
inherited namespace attributes. Are they now gone?
