Hi John,

Thanks for the insight into the group discussions.

You make the point about the "relative difficulty of assessing whether a
namespace attribute is actually being used".  I guess that you are referring
here to the possibility that the namespace prefix is being used within
element or attribute content which I agree is all but impossible to detect.

However, if you are willing to put some onus on the application to be aware
of the namespace context of the document fragment, then perhaps it would be
a reasonable idea to recommend an extension to Canonical XML processors
enabling them to take a list of namespace prefixes that they should not copy
into the output document.  After all, as you say yourself, there is no good
reason to keep the namespaces declarations of namespaces that aren't used.
And as Merlin pointed out, it can be rather awkward.

Regards
Rob Lugt
