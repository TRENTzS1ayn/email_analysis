We have been checking Beta 1 of our (DSTC) implementation against the interop
matrix and merlin-xmldsig-{fifteen,sixteen}.

My understanding was that some of these documents should *not* verify, 
because they have URIs that use id() functionality but the documents do not
have DTDs that specify the relevant attributes with type ID.

However, the interop matrix shows that everyone else has happily verified 
these signatures (and so have we, but only by implementing something that 
I think is a hack).

So:

      - does my understanding need fixing?  (an all too common event)

      - has everyone taken a pragmatic approach and implemented the moral
        equivalent of the example in the XPointer spec?

                        http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr#schemes

        (i.e. the last thing in section 4.3, immediately above section 5;
        I'm not game to try writing a more accurate XPointer for it)

      - is there some other option that I should have realized?

(By the way, merlin-xmldsig-sixteen was just wonderful for fingering bugs in 
my comment-filtering code -- blessings be upon Merlin H).
