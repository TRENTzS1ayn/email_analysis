Agreed.

Fair enough, good idea.

I was also thinking of the barename XPointers ("#object-3") that implicitly 
use id() semantics too (except for the discarding of comments) -- but your
approach also covers all the examples of barename URIs in both -fifteen and 
-sixteen.  I had it in mind that there were also examples of enveloped or
same-document detached signatures that used fragment IDs, but that must
have been a figment of my imagination.
