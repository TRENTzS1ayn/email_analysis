It may be too late but it would be nice if KeyName were normalized
like a CDATA attribute value.  In fact, I think it would have been
better if we had defined a "Name" attribute, rather than element
content...

We are not talking about it's semantic content.  We are talking about
it's encoding.  There are already numerous encoding rules.  The
KeyName can't have a less than character in it, it has to use &lt;,
etc.

So, just say &#20; where you want a real space, just like you
currently have to say &quot; if you want a " character, etc.

Sure it's just a string, but what kind of string encoding is the
question.
