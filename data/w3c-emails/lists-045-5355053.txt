Hi Joseph,

<joseph>
If we expect interopability over such ported signatures, should we amend
the 
spec with any text to this end?
</joseph>

A lot of applications won't need to remove a signature from its original
location, but it could be useful to add an editors' note to say that
moving such signatures to a different context can break a signature due
to a change of namespace context, and perhaps that this is necessary due
to the impossibility of assessing the namespaces in use by the signed
content.
