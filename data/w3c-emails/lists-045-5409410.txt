I've always thought that Encoding and MimeType were a bit
weird. They seem only to have meaning for character content
(which will be the minority of uses), the encoding is implicit
in the Transforms applied of the corresponding Reference and
the MimeType can be represented by its Type attribute. It
would make more sense to me if they were defined on a MimeData
element that could be used within Object, but I would not
even advocate that.
