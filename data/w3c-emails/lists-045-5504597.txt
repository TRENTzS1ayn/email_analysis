Excerpted from the Workshop description page:

==========
Goals

This workshop will consider the requirements for simple key resolution
and trust services for XML security applications, the degree to which
the XKMS specification satisfies those requirements, and determine if
there is sufficient focus and interest
to propose a W3C activity in this area.

Scope of the Workshop

Topics likely to be discussed at this workshop include, but are not
limited to:

       XML Security application key management requirements.
       Dependencies on XML Protocol, Web services, XML Query,
Semantic Web, and transport protocols (e.g., HTTP).
       Security considerations resulting from a specification.
       The scope of any resulting Activity.

...     _________________________________________________________________

The workshop is an open event; however, space is limited and preference
will be given on the basis of (1) quality of position paper, and (2)
members of W3C Working Groups.

Please follow the instructions on registration and participation
provided in the CFP Web page, at:

http://www.w3.org/2001/07/xkms-ws/cfp
