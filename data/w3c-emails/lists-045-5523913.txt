We could
1. remove those two and use attribute "Type", and say it has the same 
behavior as that in Reference.
2. maintain these two attributes, and say Encoding is the encoding of the 
Object content, MimeType is the mime-type of the data object (independent of 
its present encoding). All of this information continues to be advisory and 
when this information is necessary to processing we recommend it be 
explicitly specified via the Reference element and its Type attribute and 
Transform children (e.g., decoding).

I prefer option 2 since it doesn't require us to change the DTD/schema.
