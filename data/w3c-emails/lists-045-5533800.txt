My comments regarding the attributes simply concern the fact that they
duplicate information that is provided elsewhere (Object.MimeType =~
Reference.Type and Object.Encoding =~ Reference.Transforms) which may
lead to inconsistency, and they are redundant in the majority of cases
(non-data content). However, they are optional and unenforced, so
any redundancy or inconsistency is of little practical import.

My expression of what we could do is:

1. Simply remove the two and any text about them. The remaining text
already states that the object may contain any data, which is sufficient
(cf SignatureProperty).
2. Leave everything as it is, because despite their redundancy there
is no practical consequence of their misuse, and the text is fine.

Inertia clearly favours 2. If you stuck a probe in my skull, 1 would
glow faintly, but it is of no concern.
