This should be fixed in XML Schema, not in Signatures, I guess.
On the other hand, it's not a bad idea to have line breaks in
the Base64, just streaming out something as a very long line
(e.g. 1000000 chars) doesn't seem like a good idea. It will
cause problems sooner or later. For example, SOAP may be used
over mail, and what happens then?

Regards,  Martin.
