Hi,

On the DSA Key Value item, maybe I'm missing something but I don't
know what J, seed, and pgenCounter are about. So I agree with you
that, as far as I can see, they should be dropped. And it would be
reasonable for P, G, and Q to be optional.

On the other topics you bring up, there does not seem to be any
support for broadening the areas covered in the specifciation or
reducing the types inside KeyInfo, judging from the lack of email. So
we will consider those resolved to leave things as they are.

Thanks,
Donald
