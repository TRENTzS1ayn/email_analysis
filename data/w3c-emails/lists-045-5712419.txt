After seeing all the discussion, I'm okay with long lines as such.
But there is still the problem that XML Schema doesn't allow that,
because it references RFC 2045 directly, without anything else.
This is a problem on both sides:

- XML Signature cannot use the XML Schema datatype as it stands
   (and extension or restriction won't work here)
- XML Schema should consider changing their definition of
   Base64 to include longer lines, because it seems that that's
   widely used in practice. Whether that can be done as a corrigendum
   to Schema 1.0 or whether that has to go into Schema 1.1, I don't
   know.

I have copied www-xml-schema-comments. Schema experts, please see
the other messages in this thread
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2001AprJun/0183.html).

Regards,   Martin.
