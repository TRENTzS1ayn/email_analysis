You might be given the other parameters instead of p & q. Since many
keys can use the same p & q, you might want to know they were
generated as per the NIST rules before using them to generate another
key.  Perhaps the signer is under your authority and you want to
enforce this as a policy. Or maybe there are other reasons that don't
occur to me right now.

J, seed, and pgenCounter are not being required, just defined as an
option.
