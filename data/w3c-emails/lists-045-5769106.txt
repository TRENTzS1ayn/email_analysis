<Gregor>
You are right, in the current specification the XPath transform can
inherit the namespaces from the ancestors of the Transform element.

But, already in the current situation, it is possible to add additional
namespace declarations to the XPath parameter element.

If we now state that all namespaces that should be in scope for
the XPath expression must explicitely declared as namespace attributes
of the XPath parameter element, then we can isolate SignedInfo.
