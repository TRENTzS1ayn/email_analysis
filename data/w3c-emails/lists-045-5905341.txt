Hi Joseph,

The response is not sufficient since they made no mention of having
considered the point.

Immediately after the so-called definition, you provide a BNF grammar
definition of 'Document Type Definition' that indicates its equivalence
to the document type declaration.

Document Type Definition
[28]    doctypedecl 

If the authors of XML 1.0 intend to distinguish between document type
declarations and document type definitions, then they should not DEFINE
a document type definition to have the grammatical structure equivalent
to a document type declaration.  This is the point of the clarification.
