Gregor,

We need to fix this problem somehow. If we are going to stop inherited
namespaces from flowing down into signed material, whether it is
signed XML data or SignedInfo, but those namespace declarations are
still needed, then we need to do something to be sure they are still
there.

Sticking with the current C14N but cutting out the part to be
canonicalized with DOM or something before it is canonicalized, I
would have said we would need to also tell people to explicitly
declare any needed namespaces in the data, at the apex of the piece of
XML to be canonicalized, not in the Transform.

Donald
