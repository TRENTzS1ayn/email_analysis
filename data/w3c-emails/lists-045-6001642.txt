Hi Gregor and Donald,

Obviously, I would be an advocate for adding an XPath transform to the
C14N transform.  I proposed this at our third FtF, but it made some
people nervous at the time (and I can understand that; better safe than
sorry).  However, I think we all know now that the procedure is quite
safe provided the following additional step is taken:  after a c14n
transform's xpath transform, add an implicit transform that ensures the
signature element and all of its descendant elements, attributes, and at
least the xmldsig namespace are in the resultant node-set.  W.r.t. the
problem you are trying to solve, this limits the scope of the XPath to
namespace filtering, but with same document signatures, it eliminates
the need to have a separate Reference, do a double hash calculation,
etc.

Cheers,
John Boyer
