/+The MimeType attribute is an optional attribute which describes the data 
within the Object (independent of its encoding). This is a string with 
values defined by [MIME]. For example, if the Object contains base64 encoded 
XML, the Encoding may be specified as base64 and the MimeType as text/xml. 
This attribute is purely advisory; no validation of the MimeType information 
is required by this specification. Applications which require normatiave 
type and encoding information for signature validation should specify 
Transforms with well defined resulting types and/or encodings.+/
