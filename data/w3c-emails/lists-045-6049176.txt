Joseph and I have talked abou this and we want to minimize changes in
the namespace at this point. So our conclusion is to retain MgmtData
and its syntax but to change the explanatory text for it to something
like

"Use of this elemet is NOT RECOMMENDED. It provides a syntactic hook
where in-band key distribution or agreement data can be
placed. However, superior interoperable child elements of KeyInfo for
the transmission of encrypted keys and for key agreement are being
specified by the W3C XML Encryption Working Group and they should be
used instead of MgmtData."

Thanks,
Donald

PS: It also appears that PGPData and SPKIData can be treated as
syntactic hooks and retained without the demonstration of specific
interoperability.
