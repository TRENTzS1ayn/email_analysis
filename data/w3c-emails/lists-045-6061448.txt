Since I'm in Boston and it's relevant, I plan to attend. If others with experience from the dsig/enc context are interested, please let me know!

   The XML 1.0 specification specifies a particular format for textual and
   other data; the XML Information Set specification provides an abstract
   definition of XML in terms of information items and their properties. 

   Increasingly, software and specifications define processing of XML
   documents in terms of XML-to-XML or infoset-to-infoset transformations.
   The XML Core Working Group is developing the XInclude specification; the
   XML Linking WG has developed the XLink and XBase specifications, which
   can be viewed as ways to enrich or annotate infosets; the XML Schema 1.0
   language defines validation and annotation with datatype and other
   information in terms of a transformation from the input infoset to the
   output, post-schema-validation infoset. The XML Query language will work
   on an abstract data model defined in terms of the infoset, rather than
   in terms of the surface XML syntax. Encryption and digital signatures
   must be managed at appropriate points in the processing chain. The list
   could be extended indefinitely. 

   However, the relationship among all of these W3C specifications is
   unspecified -- in particular the sequence in which the
   infoset-to-infoset transformations may or must be performed. 

   There is also no specification, and currently no W3C work item, for
   specifying how an author or application programmer could specify an
   order to the various transformations. Thus it appears there is a missing
   specification in the XML activity. 

   As a first step toward addressing these and related issues, the W3C is
   sponsoring this XML Processing Model Workshop. The goal of the workshop
   is to determine community interest in the topic area, survey the
   problems and showcase existing solutions, raise awareness of the issues,
   and provide a forum for discussing how proposals for further work on XML
   should address this topic. 

   There are a variety of actions that could be undertaken by the W3C in
   following up from this workshop; these include creating a new Working
   Group to address the topic of the XML processing model, adding the
   problem to the charter of an existing Working Group, tasking the W3C
   Technical Architecture Board to consider the question, and others.
