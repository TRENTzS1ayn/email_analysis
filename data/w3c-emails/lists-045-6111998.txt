Hi John,

I don't particularly want to get into this complex area. However, If
an XPath transform were limited to just diddling namespace declaration
presence or absence, then it strikes me you are using a wrecking ball
to kill a mosquito.

I consider having separate DigestValue elements a feature absolutely
necessary to Manifest and of use in SignedInfo in finding out what
went wrong if a signature fails.
