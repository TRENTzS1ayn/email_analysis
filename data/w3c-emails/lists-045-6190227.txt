That makes sense for all examples except the two I cited. Since those are
examples of specifying a CanonicalizationMethod, shouldn't they be
represented using that method? It seems confusing to give examples that are
invalid. If I understand the spec correctly, you couldn't actually validate
the example in 2.1, which is represented as a (presumably correct) detached
signature of the content of the XHTML 1.0 recommendation.

Examples in the dsig spec are not canonicalized. I added a sentence to 
[s03], "Note that this example, and all examples in this specification, are 
not in canonical form."
