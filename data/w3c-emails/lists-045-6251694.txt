That's true, I can see how that asymmetry can be confusing. Consequently, I 
propose a parenthetical sentence to Reference Generation (3.1.1.3):

3.1.1 Reference Generation
For each data object being signed:

1. Apply the Transforms, as determined by the application, to the data object.

2. Calculate the digest value over the resulting data object.

3. Create a Reference element, including the (optional) identification of 
the data object, any (optional) transform elements, the digest algorithm and 
the DigestValue. /+(Note, it is the canonical form of these references that 
are signed in 3.1.2 and validated in 3.2.1 .)+/
