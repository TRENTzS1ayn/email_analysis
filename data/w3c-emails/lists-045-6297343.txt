While you typically want to send certificates of some sort along with
a signature, why would you always need them with encryption? The
recipient can probably recognize if the material is encrypted for them
by looking up the public key to see if its one of theirs and if so,
they presumably have the private key. There are lots of different
circumstances possible. You don't need to send any keyinfo at
all. Even if just sending a bare public KeyValue would be unusual, its
pretty easy to support and good for testing :-)
