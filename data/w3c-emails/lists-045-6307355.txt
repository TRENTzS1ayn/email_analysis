Hi

I have a simple question:

The DTD (or Schema if you like) says that there must be one and only one 
<SignatureValue> element.

Is it a problem to say that there can be one or more <SignatureValue>? 
Would it introduce anything else than flexibility? It surely would help me 
a lot, and (I think) make it more applicable.

Thanks in advance,

/Jesper
