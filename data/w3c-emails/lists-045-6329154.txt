This is somewhat offtopic and may already have been discussed previous.
If so, I apologize.

What is the value of sending RSA/DSA public keys outside of
certificates? Without certificates, the public keys cannot be trusted.
Unless I am missing something, I would suggest that the XMLDSIG should
discourage implementations from sending public keys without
certificates. Currently, section 4.4.2 section specifies that support
for DSAKeyValue element is REQUIRED. Doesn't this lead to
implementations that are insecure?
