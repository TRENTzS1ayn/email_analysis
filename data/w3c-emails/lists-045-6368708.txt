Merlin,

Can you be more specific on the mechanism(s) for inferring trust from just a
public key?

It is quite reasonable to assert trust over a public key, independent
of any certification scheme, and thus to assert trust over documents
signed by that key. Certificates are only one of many options available
for trust and authentication management.
