This mechanism is certainly sufficient for document authentication (for
which it is also sufficient to write down an appropriate crypto hash of the
document itself on the beermat).

However, it is not sufficient for non-repudiation, unless indeed looking up
the cert in a trusted public database (or having also a certificate).
Namely, if all you have is the beermat containing the key and the document,
you certainly can't prove that it was signed by the individual who handed
you the beermat (unless maybe using his fingermark on the beermat? now that
may work...).
