RE: DSAKeyValue text - inferring trust from just a PKOops, Daniel is right, I slipped and said... 

> looking up the cert in a trusted public database 

where of course the public trusted DB does not necessarily have to keep a PK cert, it is sufficient for it to keep a mapping between the Public Keys and the relevant properties (possibly identifications/names, possibly other properties). 

Plus, of course, when I refer ot a public key certificate, it also is not necessarily a signature over one public key and an identifier... any signature that contains one or more public key and properties of them is a public key certificate from my point of view.

BTW, I lost track of how this discussion is relevant to DSIG.

  XKMS, a protocol for XML-based key management, does not imply the need for certificates to be used to establish trust.  In fact, when provided as a third party service, trust could be achieved in many ways... beermat or cert.  Only a name is required to be associated with a key, and without a binding.  The third party trust service provides the binding and the trust.  

  Since XML-based key management is being considered as a project for W3C, this notion seems to have merit.
