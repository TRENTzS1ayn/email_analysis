1. I think the second issues mentioned by Donald,

     "The wording talks only of divorcing the signed XML from its context on
      validation but it is an equally important consideration on
      generation. The removal of old context can break things just as badly
      as adding new context.  In fact, for signatures to interoperate, the
      generator and validator have to somehow agree on this. Otherwise, the
      divorcing from context by the validator but not the generator can
      break a signature even if the "envelope" hasn't
      changed. Interoperability would be easier if this was explicitly
      specified."

   is still not covered by the current text.

2. Shouldn't it be a choice between steps (1) and (2) in the text? Currently
   it reads as if both steps (1) and (2) must be applied.
