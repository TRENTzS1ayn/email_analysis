Hi everyone,

As one of the recently laid-off Entrust employees (see "http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010604/n04191182.html"),
there are a couple of changes to my status that I need to make known:

1.  From now on, I am contributing only as an individual and not representing
Entrust.  Until July 31, I will refrain from commenting on issues that materially
affect Entrust. 

2.  My new email address is <edsimon@xmlsec.com> and my new phone number
is (613) 726-9645.  (Please assume that I have not, and will not, receive
any emails sent to my Entrust email adress since June 4.)

Regards, Ed
