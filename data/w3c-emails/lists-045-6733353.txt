Don,

Your wording on J is fine with me.  If you want to be more pedantic look
at the description of J in section 2.3.3 of
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-pkalgs-02.txt
(PKIX draft on algs for son-of-2459).  (2.3.3 is the D-H section but
basically it's the same idea.)

I don't have any big problem adding "J" back in but it needs
explanation.  I went to the FIPS for DSA and, as far as I can recall,
the only J that I saw was in the primality test.

See the attached.

Thanks,
Donald
