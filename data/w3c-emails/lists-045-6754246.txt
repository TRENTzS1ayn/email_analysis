Mark, I agree that it would be a useful thing to have. However, I think the 
composing XML applications are going to have to address this issue 
regardless, and if we do address it as REQUIRED as Don suggested, we're 
going to have to change the namespace for xlmdsig and take extra time to the 
Repulsive Canonical XML to REC. I'm happy for it to be specified externally, 
and even reach REC orthogonally (not speaking of Standard since we didn't do 
that with Canonical XML) but the mandatoriness will be expensive for &dsig; 
in terms of time and its affect on implementations. The question is, do 
people think it's justified? (It may well be, that's just not where my bias 
is presently.)
