I'm not understanding. You can't tweak the meaning of one specification from 
another. We can't say [1] "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315" 
now means something different. [1] means what it means, how would people 
looking at that spec know that other specs somehow changed it's meaning?

We can create a new URI and spec such as [2] 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20010723", but if it's a 
mandatory requirement, we'll have to let it precede xmldsig, and that'll 
hold us up.

We can create a new URI under the xmldsig namespace such as 
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#excC14N" . It's kind of editorially 
awkward to profile Canonical XML in this way, but it makes sense at least. 
My original concern is that this would necessiate a new namespace. But since 
this addition doesn't break any existing instances or processes, I think we 
can deal with it just by recycling at Candidate REC, ensuring interop and 
continuing to use the same namespace.

This still isn't an option an application has, it's saying, "If we had 
transforms over SignedInfo, then you could use Transforms. But we didn't, so 
you could use a different canonicalization." The latter statement is what is 
stated by option 2.

Ok, so I'll leave that bullet in. But the text has stated, "should be 
provided with the octets that represent the well-formed SignedInfo element, 
from the first character" which doesn't requries those characters to be in 
UTF-8. Are you adovcating we should move it to the octets represented by the 
UTF-8 encoding of those characters even if the XML document is encoded 
differently?

[I also continue to not like character base c14n, but we still need to be 
clear.]

Ok.
