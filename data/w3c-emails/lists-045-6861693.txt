Speaking for the JCSI gang at DSTC:

We believe that a significant percentage of candidate xmldsig applications 
suffer from the c14n variable-context issue.  Given this, we believe that
for xmldsig to be usable and interoperable, it is worthwhile for xmldsig to 
specify an interoperable c14n approach that resolves this issue, despite the
effect of this on the standardization schedule.

In other words, our preference is for option 2.  

Also, in the interests of interoperability, RECOMMENDED (or ideally REQUIRED)
would be preferable to OPTIONAL.
