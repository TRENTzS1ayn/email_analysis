So after much discussion and boneheadedness on my part, I've
understood what the problem is, and observe that it is not an option
to require enveloping applications to solve it -- as it stands there
is no way to un-declare a namespace prefix -- so some form of
exclusive cannonicalisation is required.

I guess I think the exposition in 6.5.2 of the suggested fix [1] is
not as clear as it might be -- I'd suggest that actually providing
alternative paragraphs for 'Element Nodes' and 'Namespace Nodes' to
those in section 2.3, as well as an alternative formulation of the
relevant paragraphs of 2.4, would be much less likely to lead to
misunderstandings.  I.e. give new text, and say 'exclusive
canonicalisation works as canonicalisation would with these
replacements in place'.
