I'd like to see the poll give a definition of 'exclusive canonicalization'
since I can guess what is being suggested but I did not read the entire
thread on C14N so I don't know for sure.

The ambiguity in what namespaces should be included in the scope of the C14N
is the main cause of interop issues with XKMS - and I would guess by
extension in any SOAP/XML Protocol application.

Rather than mess with the 'mandatory' status we should recognize that the
specification cannot mandate support for a specific canonicalization
algorithm and it is entirely wrong and unjustified to do so. 

The proposed C14N does not meet the requirements of signing SOAP or XML
Protocol messages. Any spec to support that application will inevitably
specify that another C14N algorithm is required. As currently specified the
C14N algorithm does not satisfy the requirement that nodes be signable
individually and independently.

Counter proposal:

1) Demote the requirement for the existing C14N from MUST to SHOULD
2) Insert a forward looking 'SHOULD support' for exclusive C14N
3) Develop spec for alternative C14N 
4) When Signing XML Protocol messages is written it will specify
   the alg that is most appropriate as a MUST.

XML Signature is not a complete specification, it is a component. MUST
implement for interoperability does not make as much sense at the component
level as at the system level.
