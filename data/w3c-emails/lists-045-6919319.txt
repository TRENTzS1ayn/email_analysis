I vote for option 2 and REQUIRED.

In the eProcess group at JetForm, I believe that anything else will cause us difficulty, as we expect composition to be not uncommon.  The eForms group tells me inclusive canonicalization is a serious problem for them, as their architecture starts with xml subdocuments that are later composed into the end document.

Subject: Poll on Exclusive Canonicalization


Members of the WG (and particularly implementors represented in the interop 
matrix), it's important that we know which direction you would like us to 
take. So please respond, on the list, to the following poll by end of Monday 
June 18th.

With respect to the issue of excluding ancestor context from the canonical 
form of a signature[1], the WG should pursue option:

1. Specify the exclusive canonicalization as part of the non-normative (nor 
required to implement) dsig-more specification [2].
2.Specify the exclusive canonicalization as part of the normative 
xmldsig-core as proposed in [3] (but with the URIs of [4]) as [REQUIRED, 
RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL]. (This option requires interoperable implementation 
of this feature before xmldsig advances.)
