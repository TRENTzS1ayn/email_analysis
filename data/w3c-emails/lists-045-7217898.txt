We need to specify it. (Canonical XML is done, there's nothing we can do to 
that spec.) The question is do we do specify exclusive canonicalization 
orthogonally and let xmldsig-core advance, or do we hold xmldsig-core until 
it's resolved so we can REQUIRE implementations to implement it. (Again, 
holding xmldsig-core for anything other than MUST doesn't make much sense to 
me now, and as you say the MUST in xmldsig-core won't tell people anything 
they don't already know if they face the enveloping scenario)...
