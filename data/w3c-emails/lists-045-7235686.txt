Dear friends:

I am developing an XML signature application and I have some doubts of
paramount importance for building the reference element.

When I need to apply the Canonicalization algorithm, I apply it only in
SignedInfo element after transforms and digests have been done. That is,

I apply it for the data between <SignedInfo> and </SignedInfo> after
transforms an digests have been calculated. Is that right? If not, what
must I do?

The output of a Transform element is used as input for the next
Transform. What is this result? How must I to use the Transform
algorithm? I suppose that these Transform algorithms are used over the
data we want to sign. It is OK?

If it is correct, I need to know the real data to be signed. In w3c
documentation, you write that the data to be signed is the attribute URI

of the Reference element. If this attribute has the value
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/xxx, what I sign? the content of this URI? the

characters appearing in the URI attribute value
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/xxx in this case) ?

Thank you in advance and sorry for my bad english.
