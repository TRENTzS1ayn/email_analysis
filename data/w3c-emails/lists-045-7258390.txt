Hi,

Apologies for being post-deadline.

I have qualms about pushing XMLDSIG out the door without protocol support
(exclusive c14n) because this will have a major impact on many dependent
standard efforts, and they may wind up with various uncomfortable
workarounds.

I also have significant qualms about delaying XMLDSIG because this will
have a major impact on many dependent standard efforts.

Iff we can define, implement and interop an exclusive c14n that addresses
basic protocol needs (noninheritance of namespaces and xml:* attributes)
to the satisfaction of, for example, XKMS over SOAP, and this will not
significantly delay the standards processes, then I would vote for 2.

If there will be any significant process delays then I would vote for 1.

I do not claim a sufficient understanding of the relevant processes
to know whether a significant delay would occur. For reference, an
offhand implementation of an exclusive C14N took all of 15 minutes,
so I am not particularly concerned about implementation delays.

And, as a sidenote, I dislike the URIs &c14n;, &c14n;#WithComments,
&c14n;#XXX, &c14n;#XXX-WithComments. IMO, it is a nasty misuse of
the URI. I would advocate exclusivity being specified by including an
Exclusive (or whatever) child element which can contain any desired
parameters.
