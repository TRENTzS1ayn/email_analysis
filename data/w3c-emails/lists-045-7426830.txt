Weird, it was in version 1.84 even, but got lost in 1.85 when I introduced 
Don's generalizations with respect to canonical xml. I wish I was better 
about commenting the versions, or had a useful htmldiff tool. (Though this 
is one of the reasons I send the editing trivialities to the list such that 
I folks can check me, and it laters helps figure out what happened.) So, I 
don't think I've lost any other recent edits, and the following should be 
correct:
