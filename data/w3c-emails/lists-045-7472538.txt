Hello All,

I have a comment/question on the latest Dsig Recommendation. In section
4.3.3.1 (The URI Attribute), the following sentence seems to contradict the
usage of the "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#Manifest Type identifier in
a URI element:

"The Type attribute applies to the item being pointed at, not its contents."

That is, if the above sentence were true, then there should only be a type
identifier for <Object> (e.g. "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#Object") -
this is because a <Manifest> element lives inside an <Object> element, so it
should refer to the type (Object), not the contents (Manifest). This also
would coincide with the comment in the end of section 4.3.3.1 about the
proper way to identify a <SignatureProperties> element.

Finally, if no explicit validation of the "Type" information is required,
why even bother putting the restriction there in the first place? It seems
like a restriction is suggested (which appears to me to be somewhat
contradictory) and then subsequently nullified by not including a
well-defined means to enforce the restriction (e.g. Explicitly saying that
the
information will not be validated anyway).

Please be sure to set me straight if I am off the wall on any of this! :)

Kind Regards,

Fixed.

I think you mean 4.3.3.4? We dropped the XLST element, <stylesheet> can be
included by the app.

Fixed.

I think this is because you "may" sign the data obtained by RetrievalMethod.

I'm not sure. Brian?

Done.
