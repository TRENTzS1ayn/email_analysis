Manifest only has to be inside Object when you have an enveloping
signature, i.e., the Manifest is inside a Signature.  There is no
reason you can't have Manifest or SignatureProperties floating around
elsewhere outside Signature in you document and point to it from a
Reference.

Even if you put Manifest inside Object inside Signature, I don't think
there is any restriction against pointing your Reference directly to
the Manifest.

It's a voluntary efficiency measure. Things like SignatureProperties
have no effect on the cryptographic core validation processes but some
code to check them might want to not bother chasing down a Reference
unless it has a hint there may be SignatureProperties there.  Some
References could be expensive/impossible to de-reference.  Similarly,
since its an application thing if/when/how you check Manifests, an
application might want to use the Type hint as to whether or not to
see if some Reference is actually to a Manifest...
