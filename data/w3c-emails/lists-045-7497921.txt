Yes, I meant 4.3.3.4. I said nothing about an XSLT element.  There is
a sytlesheet element.  For consistency, "stylesheet" should appear in
the Schema for Transform.  Otherwise, what namespace is it in? Why
should this be the application's problem?

If you signed it, it would only be because it was pointed at by a
Reference. The signing of it would have nothing to do with
RetrievalMethod.  This wording is confusing and should drop references
to canonicalization.
