[bal] Don's right, PGP Key IDs are 64-bit values.  I suspect we said
"string" here because traditionally PGP clients display KeyIDs as
"0x"-prefixed hex strings (and usually only the low 32 bits at that).
It seems reasonable to me to change PGPKeyID to be a Base64-encoded
value; I can't see any reason to introduce yet another encoding into
XMLDSIG.
