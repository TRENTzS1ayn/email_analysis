Hello All,

In section 4.3.3.2, I would like to clarify something. Consider the
following sentence (first bullet after XPath "box"):

"If the data object is an octet stream and the next transform requires a
node-set, the signature application MUST attempt to parse the octets."

Is the "parsing the octets" a well-defined operation? I am assuming this
implies that one must convert the octets into a node-set. Is this correct?
Can this be stated instead?

Kind Regards,
