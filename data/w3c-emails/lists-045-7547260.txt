I'm still not understanding, 6.6.5 says, "The normative specification for 
XSL Transformations is [XSLT]. The XSL transformation is encoded within a 
namespace-qualified stylesheet element which MUST be the sole child of the 
Transform element." Transform permits ANY, so you'd have

<ds:Transform>
   <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
       ....
     </xsl:stylesheet>
</ds:Transform>

Ok.

/- Note, if the result of dereferencing and transforming the specified 
URI  is a node set, it may need to be canonicalized. Consequently the 
Signature application is expected to attempt to canonicalize the nodeset via 
the The Reference Processing Model (section 4.3.3.2) -/

Ok:          <element name="PGPKeyID" type="base64Binary"/>
