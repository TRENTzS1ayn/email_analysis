John,

A followup question. If the XSDL instance document has default
attributes,
are they supposed to be added to the canonical form? 

So, continuing Don's example, let's say Price has a default attribute
defined, "maximum", with a value of "500". However, the source instance
doesn't contain the "maximum" attribute. Does the "maximum" attribute
show
up in the canonical form?

Kelly

Hi Don,

By validating XML parser, we mean validation as described in the XML
recommendation, not XML schema validation.  So A) would be rendered.

This is not to say that future canonicalization algorithms will not be
defined to rely on such things as schema validation.  A good first,
though, would be an XPath reliant on the latest infoset (but that's
beside the point of your interest).

Cheers,

Subject: Canonical XML & XML Schema


Hi guys,

I had a quick question regarding Canonical XML and instances of XML
Schemas.

Section 2.1 of the Canonical XML standard specifies what the canonical
output for attributes should be.  
"the attribute value normalization and entity reference resolution MUST
be
performed in accordance with the behaviors of a validating XML
processor"

Is there any guidelines on how to handle data of a content model in the
instance of an XML Schema ?

Example, if we have the following XML Schema
 
 <xsd:element name="price" type="xsd:decimal"/>

and my instance looks like

  <price>12.00  </price>

should the Canonical form of this instance be 

A)<price>12.00   </price>
B)<price>12.00</price>

Notice that the white space has been stripped out from (B), whereas it
is
being retained in (A).


Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

Regards

Don
