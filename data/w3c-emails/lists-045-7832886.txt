I've been occasionally tweaking my P3P/XML Signature proposal as a way of 
fleshing out my understanding of the xmldsig spec's treatment of semantics 
and such. I've updated the proposal to improve the association of a semantic 
(like assures) with a signature -- knowing that this will also frequently be 
defined by and/or implicit to the particular application using it. This 
approach allows the semantic to be explicitly bound to the Signature via use 
of SignatureProperty element and URI type. Comments are welcome:
