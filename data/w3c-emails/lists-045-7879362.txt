There are an infinite number of ways in which signed material can
include external references, from URIs to arbitrary pieces of source
or binary code to instructions to a human being to look something up
to who knows what.  And any standard for signatures never really has
any idea how the stuff being signed is to be
treated/interpreted/executed with the exception of some of the
material in the signature construct itself.  The semantics are all at
the application level and the application must calll signature
primatives to construct the signature in such a way that everything
the particular application needs secured is secured.

If some piece of XML is signed, how can the signature library know
whether namespace URIs, or any other kind of extrnal reference in it,
are to be used as is or perhaps only de-referenced after some some
mapping or XSLT is done on it, assuming the signature library can even
recognize the external references?  And even if it could get past all
those problems, how will it know whether the right thing is to secure
the reference or the data referred to?  If, say, the signed object is
a recommendation of some service, then it is just the URI to the
service, and maybe another key that that service uses to sign its
results, that the recommender wants to sign, not some snap shot of
some particular service results.

Fortunately, I think the vast majority of XML signatures will be for
protocol message use where most or all of these questions get decided
as the protocol is designed.  For the perhaps one in a thousand XML
signatures that are on ad hoc generally interpreted documents, which
seem to be all that you are considering, you really can't say much
more than that you need to sign everything you want to secure.
XMLDSIG has ample facilities for signing external DTDs, schemas, style
sheets, etc., if appropriate.
