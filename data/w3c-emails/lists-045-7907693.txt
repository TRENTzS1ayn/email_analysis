As currently specified the XML Signature namespace URI is specified as 

http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#

The final # is causing comment to be made. Is it or is it not significant? I
reference the XML Signature spec in XKMS and each time I issue a draft I get
questions about the # and I would like to avoid giving tutorials on XML
fragment identifiers.

Is there a way we could loose the # in the final itteration?
