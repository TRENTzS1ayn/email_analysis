Hi Phill,

When we considered how to partition our namespace for algorithm and 
structure purposes, we had two options:

[a] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#foo
[b] http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig/foo

RDF had already made significant use of "#foo" and this approach makes it 
much easier to maintain  all the URIs with respect to dereferencing in that 
I don't need a directory, instead, the namespace URI is redirected to the 
latest version of the spec for which there are actual fragments 
explaining/corresponding to that URI.
