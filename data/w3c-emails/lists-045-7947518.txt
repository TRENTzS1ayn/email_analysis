Joseph,

I'm actually not sure I understand your example without the portions of XML, 
but it sounds like an issue discussed before. The following text was agreed 
to in the specification to address it:

As Phill points out, Canonical XML provides a serialization of a XML node 
set, that's it. If you have concerns about other references, that is an 
application issue as Donald points out. (Consider a weird screw case where 
some applications might *wish* to make a statement about a URI with dynamic 
content.) Otherwise, if you want these things to be signed, then sign them 
in the Signature or package them together in some such archive.
