I think the idea is that the namespace changes if the specification
changes in a sufficiently incompatible way.  It was also more
reasonable to change the namespace more often when the specifciation
was evoloving more rapidly.  Now that it has been approved on the
standards track of both the IETF and W3C, I think any future change
will be considred very carefully.

PS: While everyone should be using the latest spec, personally, if I
was implementing a robust XMLDSIG, I'd be tempted to match
"http://www.w3.org/2000/*/xmldsig#".
