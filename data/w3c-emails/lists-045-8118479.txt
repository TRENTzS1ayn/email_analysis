As Don pointed out, we change the namespace when we've made a substantive 
change to the specification -- rather than clarification. Also, as we get 
more mature one would hope the specification and namespace doesn't have to 
change as often, however, at that time more people are likely to be tracking 
it and if something does change, they're better off stubbing their toe on 
the change in the namespace instead of a more subtle alteration in the DTD 
or schema that they don't notice for 70% of their instances. The namespace 
should reflect reality instead of keeping it the same while changing the 
spec/dtd/schema behind it and pretending because the namespace hasn't 
changed, everything is stable.

A dated (or versioned, or RFC allocated) specification has a specific and 
frozen meaning. Prior to clarification of W3C's policies, I had written 
instances using schema that were valid at a given time for a given 
namespace. The WG then changed the DTD behind that namespace invalidating 
the examples I wrote that used to work! My examples should've continued to 
be valid under that namespace, and they should've created a new one.

Yep, have a look at [1].
