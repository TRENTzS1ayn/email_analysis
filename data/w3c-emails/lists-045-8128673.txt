I realized my reference to WG might be confusing here: while I was trying to 
write signature instances and DTDs/schemas for the Signature WG, the Schema 
WG had updated their DTD while using the same namespace, causing previously 
working instance I had written to fail. But now things are much clearer as 
expectations about the stability of a namespace are explicit [1]. In the 
working draft stage, a WG should state how likely a given namespace is to 
chage, and once a spec hits CR, the namespace must be stable with respect to 
any affects it has on previously conforming instances and processors.
