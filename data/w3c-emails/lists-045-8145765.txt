Once there is substantial deployment, a change in namespace 2 to 4
times a year would be a non-started and would guarantee that either
the bulk of the implementors would ignore the change and stick to and
recognize only one earlier namespace or the bulk of the implementors
would use wildcards.

A change every two to four years might just barely be tolerable.

Note that the wildcard I said I would use included the fixed year 2000
and thus matched only past namespaces all of which are actually known
and would not match any new namespaces generated in the future.
