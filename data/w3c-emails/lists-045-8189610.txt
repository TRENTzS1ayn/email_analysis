A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the XML Digital Signatures Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Canonical XML Version 1.0
Author(s): J. Boyer
Filename: draft-ietf-xmldsig-canonical-01.txt
Pages: 28
Date: 19-Jan-01

Any XML document is part of a set of XML documents that are logically
equivalent within an application context, but which vary in physical
representation based on syntactic changes permitted by XML 1.0 [XML]
and Namespaces in XML [Names]. This specification describes a method
for generating a physical representation, the canonical form, of an
XML document that accounts for the permissible changes. Except for
limitations regarding a few unusual cases, if two documents have the
same canonical form, then the two documents are logically equivalent
within the given application context. Note that two documents may
have differing canonical forms yet still be equivalent in a given
context based on application-specific equivalence rules for which no
generalized XML specification could account.

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-xmldsig-canonical-01.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
