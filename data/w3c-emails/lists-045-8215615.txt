You are correct.

The concept is that you can have a single identifier which actually
identifies two or more of what are usually considered signature
algorithms and have as the signature value the binary concatenation of
the values they produce.  (Of course, from another point of view, you
are just specifying a single more complex signature algorithm that
produces a longer value.)  This would have the advantage that each
"sub-signature" could be cryptographically verified separately and you
would still be secure as long as one of them hadn't been broken.

I believe the idea behind the "raw*" type was for use in connection
with RetrievalMethod, if the item being retrieved happens to be a
binary Certificate sitting in a file or something, as opposed to a
Base64 encoded Certificate.
