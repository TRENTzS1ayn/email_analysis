It is a similar mechanism one level lower, but isn't it cleaner for the
mechanism to exist at one level instead of two and in one data type instead
of five?  Option two opens the possibility of encountering an X509Data
element, or potentially worse a KeyValue element,  that contains only
material that you do not understand.
