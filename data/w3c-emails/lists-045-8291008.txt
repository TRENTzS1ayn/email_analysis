You are right, this is the cleaner solution, since there are less options
to do similar things. But (2) allows it to augment types, and this types
can still be used by applications only aware of the basic XML-Signature
syntax.

As I already stated in my first response to the poll earlier this day [1],
one should use option (2) only if there is enough information in the type
that an application only aware of the basic syntax of XML-Signature can
still process the - lets say - X509Data element.

If the X509Data is augmented in a way that there is no common structure with
the ur type any more, one should not use (2) but define a new type using
option (1).
