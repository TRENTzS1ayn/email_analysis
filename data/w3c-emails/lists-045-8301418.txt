If the data is critical to understanding an X509Data, then we
agree that a new type MyX509Data must be defined. If it is not
critical to understanding the X509Data, then why not place it
in an X509DataExt element within the KeyInfo?

I just don't see the tangible benefit of dirtying (you seem to
agree that 2 is less clean) our primitive types.
