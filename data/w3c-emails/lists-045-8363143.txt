I agree with you.

The current specification allows [A] is signer's subject name
and [B] is issuer information of CA certificate that issued
signer's certificate.  That is very confusing.

<X509Data>
  <X509IssuerSerial>                           <!-- [B] information about CA's cert -->
    <X509IssuerName>CN=grand-parent CA</X509IssuerName>
    <X509SerialNumber>1234</X509SerialNumber>
  </X509UsserSerial>
  <X509SubjectName>CN=signer</X509SubjectName> <!-- [A] information about signer's cert -->
</X509Data>
