My question was bad.  I understand a resultant octet stream is a
raw X509 certificate if Type attribute is
"http://....#rawX509Certificate".  For "...#X509Data",
"...#PGPData", "...#SPKIData" and "...#MgmtData", the
specification does not mention what is the content type of the
resultant octet stream.  Is it an XML instance?
