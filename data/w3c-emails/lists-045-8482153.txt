Ah. They are octets representing an XML element. If an XPath expression was 
used, the application will have to serialize the node set:

There's also the question of what is the actual XML? Is it a KeyInfo 
element, or one of its children? Since the RetrievalMethod is modelled on 
the Reference, the Reference states:

So in this instance, since we don't even provide a KeyInfo URI (are you 
suggesting we should?), the dereferenced content will have to be an instance 
of one of the following:

http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#X509Data
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#PGPData
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#SPKIData
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#MgmtData
http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rawX509Certificate

Does this answer the question, and if so should we make this more clear in 
the RetrievalMethod section?
