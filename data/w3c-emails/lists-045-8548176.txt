I see.

Ok, I have understood the resultant octet stream represents a
FooData element.

Must the result strictly match to the `element' production?
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-element)

In my opinion, the result should match to the `document',
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-document, because we can reuse
normal parsing method of existing XML parser.
