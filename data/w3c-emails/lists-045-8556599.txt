Agreed.

Certainly.  But the current syntax makes the task of trust establishment
difficult, particularly in X509Data.  Allowing replacement or addition only
adds to the confusion.  While the info in KeyInfo is not guaranteed to be
correct, and can't be mandated to be so, the syntax can guide folks to
proper usage.

Not providing an indication as to who the signer is while packing the
signer's certificate along with any parent certificate from any path ina
single X509Data element is a bad idea, in my opinion, and I have proposed
changes to mitigate this.

We are talking about X509Data elements which are required to be about a
specific cert.  That one can have multiple certs for the same key is
unquestioned and not part of this issue - such certs would reside in sibling
X509Data elements.  Since extensions from a specific cert indicate to a
relying party if a signature is valid, establishes valid uses for the
private key, etc., they imply a great deal about the semantics of the
signature.

In my initial poll response offlist to Donald Eastlake I indicated that I
was against option 3 and think option 2 is OK if the syntax is changed to
support it as option 2, i.e. so it doesn't degrade to option 3.  Option 1
must exist and is a non-issue.
