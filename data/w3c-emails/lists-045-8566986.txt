Given the productions:
   [1]  document ::= prolog element Misc*
   [39] element  ::= EmptyElemTag | STag content ETag

The difference between the document and element is that a document might 
have Misc, and it will have a prolog (but the prolog itself has optional 
symbols), so how different is the processing? Actually, my original 
statement was wrong, the referent of the RetrievalMethod will be a document 
*or* element, and the reason I conclude this is the same as for Reference: 
one might have an XPath expression that identifies a node (where I identify 
a particular key structure in another XML document) that then must be 
serialized; or it might be a URI without a fragment that identifies a 
document. (Though we recommend against fragments in Reference URIs, and 
encourage them to be placed in Transforms in section 4.3.3.2)

Now, I'm just reading the spec to the best of my ability, I'm not 
necessarily arguing for what I conclude, so if you think it should be 
something else, please say so!
