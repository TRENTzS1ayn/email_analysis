If the result had to match to `element', signature applications
would have to throw an error for a result that matched to not
`element' but `document'.

According to the specification, the result of Transforms can be
non-document.

In 4.4.3:
| Note, if the result of dereferencing and transforming the
| specified URI is a node set, then it may need to be
| canonicalized. All of the KeyInfo types defined by this
| specification (section 4.4) represent octets, consequently the
| Signature application is expected to attempt to canonicalize the
| nodeset via the The Reference Processing Model (section 4.3.3.2)

This note mentions the case that the result is a node-set, and
does not mention non-node-set result.  The serialized node-set
can be non-document.

So, we should add a sentence like "The resultant octet stream
MUST be an XML instance of that the root element is FooData If
the KeyInfo type is not ...#rawX509Certificate."
