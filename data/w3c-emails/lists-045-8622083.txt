To the best of my knowledge, I believe my organization has Intellectual
Property claims regarding digital signatures. 

Specifically, I am referring to US Patent # 6,028,938 entitled "Secure
electronic forms permitting layout revision". 

This information was recently made public in the form of a media release on
22 January 2001, which reflects our intention to formally announce the
existence of the patent. 

We have been an Affiliate Member of the W3C since mid-2000: it is worth
noting that this patent was originally applied for in December 1996, and has
been part of our product architecture since that time. 

Sincerely,<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =
