We are trying to tie down the last details in the spec.  Please send comments
by Feb. 9th as to whether you think there should or should not be
a type URI for RetrievalMethod results at the KeyValue level or it
should remain that RetrievalMethod should result in something
at the #rsa-sha1 and #dsa-sha1 key levels.

Thanks,
Donald
