Subject:  RetrievalMethod type question

We are trying to tie down the last details in the spec.  Please send comments
by Feb. 9th as to whether you think there should or should not be
a type URI for RetrievalMethod results at the KeyValue level or it
should remain that RetrievalMethod should result in something
at the #rsa-sha1 and #dsa-sha1 key levels.

Thanks,
Donald
