Algorithm identifying URIs correspond to algorithms.  This standard
isn't about "meaning".  What do you mean when you ask what they
"mean"?  Those specified in the XML DSIG document refer to the
algorithms given.  Other URIs can correspond to the same or different
algorithms.  Things are currently set up so that if you dereferenced
them, you get to human readable English text.

From another point of view, these URIs are just character strings that
happen to meet the URI syntax constraints.  As such, if you felt like
using them as some sort of index or key into some table in some
implementation, I don't see why you shouldn't.  I don't off hand know
what syntax constraints there are on java class names.

>3) There seems to be no reference to the XML Schema / DTD in the document,

The signature Schema and DTD are referenced from the XML-Signature
Syntax and Processing document if you want to use them as part of a
rule driven syntax check.  A validating parser is not required.
(Note: The word "valid" is used in the standard for signature
validity, not XML validity.)

Why haven't you simply tried dereferencing it?  All this stuff is
currenlty set up to get you to the English human readable
XML-Signature Syntax and Processing document.
