There have been some questions on what the X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI,
and X509SubjectName can refer to, how many of them there can be, etc.

Unless there is some objection, we will go with addition of the
following, or something close to it, to the spec:

All X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements must refer
to certficiates with the validation key.  However, because you can
have multiple cetificates for the same key in the same X509Data
element, there may be multiple such elements referring to different
certificates or, of course, the same element.

Thanks,
Donald
