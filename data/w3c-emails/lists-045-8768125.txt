>1. Abstract
>
>         The XML standard supports logical documents composed of
>         possibly several entities. It may be desirable to view or
>         edit one or more of the entities or parts of entities while
>         having no interest, need, or ability to view or edit the
>         entire document. The problem, then, is how to provide to a
>         recipient of such a fragment the appropriate information
>         about the context that fragment had in the larger document
>         that is not available to the recipient. The XML Fragment WG
>         is chartered with defining a way to send fragments of an XML
>         document--regardless of whether the fragments are
>         predetermined entities or not--without having to send all
>         of the containing document up to the part in question. This
>         document defines Version 1.0 of the [eventual] W3C
>         Recommendation that addresses this issue.
