I'm trying to integrate this paragraph:

>All X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements must refer to 
>certficiates containing the validation key. However, since multiple

with this paragraph:

>Multiple declarations about a single certificate (e.g., a X509SubjectName 
>and X509IssuerSerial element) MUST be grouped inside a single X509Data 
>element; multiple declarations about the same key but different X509

in a way that is comprehensible, but it's not working too well. Someone else 
want to suggest some text?
