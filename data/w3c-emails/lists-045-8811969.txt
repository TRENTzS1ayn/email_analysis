     This wording is better than what I was coming up with.  But on a
related subject, why isn't the rule about elements for different but
related certificates that they SHOULD occur within different X509Data
elements of the same KeyInfo element?  I realize that it is too late to
impose a MUST rule on this.

Subject:  Re: The X509Data Element clarification...



How about

    Any X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements that
    appear MUST refer to the certficiate or certificates containing
    the validation key.  All such elements that refer to a
    particular individual certificate MUST be grouped inside a
    single X509Data element and if the certificate to which they
    refer appears, it MUST also be in that X509Data element.

    Any X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements that
    relate to the same key but different certificates MUST be
    grouped within a single KeyInfo but MAY occur in multiple
    X509Data elements.

    All certificates appearing in an X509Data element MUST relate to
    the validation key by either containing it or being part of a
    certification chain that termiantes in a certificate containing
    the validation key.

    No ordering is implied by the above constraints.
