In [1] Kent asked, "The current specification also permits multiple KeyValue 
elements in a KeyInfo element.  What does this mean?" Given we've been 
trying to clarify other ambiguities, and with respect to the X509 SKI, 
SubjectName, and IssuerSerial, should we also limit KeyValue to occurring 
once and applying to the validation key, or should we keep the meaning that 
it's simply a "key that may be useful in validating the signature?"

Please respond by end of Tuesday Feb 20th.
