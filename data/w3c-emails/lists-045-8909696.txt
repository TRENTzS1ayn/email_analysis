A KeyInfo element represents information about *a* key, doesn't it?

4.4 The KeyInfo Element, 2nd paragraph:
>> Multiple declarations within KeyInfo refer to the same key. 

Multiple KeyValue elements in a KeyInfo element make no sense
according to this sentence.  If one wants to transfer multiple
keys at once, one should define container element, that includes
multiple KeyInfo elements.
