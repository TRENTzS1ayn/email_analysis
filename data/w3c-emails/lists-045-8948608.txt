I can imagine the key info to back up use of a single key, not just the raw
key.  We already provide for a variety of certificate forms in KeyInfo.  If
you have certificates, you usually need one or more chains of them for the
end certificate to be useful.  You might even need multiple end certificates
on the same key.  For example, you might have my Intel key, with an X.509
certificate issued by Intel IT department and binding my World-Wide ID Number
to that key (WWID being Intel's only unique name for us) -- but in order to
make a security decision on the signed message in question, the DSig might
also need to contain an SPKI certificate (or certificate chain) whose (final)
subject is that key, empowering it in some way.

To me, that calls for multiple elements.
