I don't see why there can't be a signature algorithm that has two
different and mutually non-converable public keys.  Or there could be
some improvement in the format of a key such that it is desireable to
use the new key format in KeyValue but, during a trasition period,
provide the old format in another KeyValue for interoperability.  Or
some other bizarre reason for two KeyValue elements. I certainly admit
that these are pretty far fetched and unlikely but they don't seem
impossible.

While KeyValue is supposed to be a validation key, "certificates" of
various sorts can just be parts of chains from widley known keys to a
validation key.

One possibility is to just be handed a bag of certificates with no
information about which one has a validation key in it. So it seems to
me that most XMLDSIG implementation are going to have to have a
mechanism for trying N keys to see if any works anyway.
