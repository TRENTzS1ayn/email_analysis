Carl: I'm not sure if you argument is for multiple elements in general 
(which is already permitted), or the possibility of multiple KeyValues 
(which we are discussing, and I thought you previously opposed)?

I think I personally agree with Kent's point that given our semantics, you 
would only have one KeyValue: you only have on KeyInfo. Brian mentioned a 
change might damage dependent specs (XKMS) so I went to look at it [1] again 
wondering when this is the case. However, I don't see any of the examples 
using more than one KeyValue within a KeyInfo. I'm presuming the scenario is 
where one does a query and gets a couple keys back, but I presume you'd get 
more than one KeyInfo back. You don't have more than one KeyInfo in a 
Signature because the structure was designed to exchange key information 
necessary to validate, not generic key exchange. This can be easily remedied 
in XKMS or other applications as Kent suggests.
<foo:Keys>
   <ds:KeyInfo>
     <ds:KeyValue>...</ds:KeyValue>
   </ds:KeyInfo>
   <ds:KeyInfo>
     <ds:KeyValue>...</ds:KeyValue>
   </ds:KeyInfo>
</foo:Keys>

Brian: could you give us a specific scenario?

Kent: do you have a schema/dtd in mind that would express this constraint?
