I agree with this 100%.  The schema should remain flexible to accomodate
other uses and the DSIG spec should profile (and constrain) use of this data
structure.  This is what Joseph Reagle proposed, I thought.  There has been
no alternative schema suggested.  Would the text proposed for DSIG purposes
cause problems for XKMS or any other spec?
