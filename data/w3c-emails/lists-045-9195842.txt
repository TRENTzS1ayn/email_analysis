Hi:

The XML-Signature requirements document in
section 3.2 Format mentions

XML Signature must provide a mechanism that facilitates the
production of composite documents - by addition or deletion
-- while preserving the signature characteristics of the cnsitituent
parts.

I will appreciate inputs in terms of a business / real-life situation
to understand this point better.

I am newbie in XMLDSig.

Thank you.
XMLDSig.
