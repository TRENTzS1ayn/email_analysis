To my recollection the participants you mention have made informal
statements at various tiime indicating that it is likely they would
likely support the XMLDSIG Specification, a specification they
participated in formulating.  However, as long as the XMLDSIG
Specification COULD support their requirements if they chose to use
it, the clause you recite from the XMLDSIG Requirements, which is only
a "SHOULD" anyway, is met.

Because it was thought that concrete, real world examples of use would
be a beneficial driving force in the design.  This benefit is not
dependent on such real world uses actually changing to use the
resulting specification.

I don't think the XMLDSIG WG has expressed any view on XForms 1.0 and
I don't see why it should.  I don't think that W3C WD existed at the
time the requirements were finalized.  At this time, I don't see any
reason to revise the requirements document. At this point, if people
see a problem with the specification, they should say what it is
rather than trying to diddle the requirements document. If it turns
out they want a change which is supported by the WG and actually
incompatible with the requirements document, then we can worry about
it.
