Hans,

Our testing has been relatively informal. There's been some peer exchanges, 
as well as tar balls of examples sent to the list that others run through 
their implementation. This is what we've been doing for the purposes of our 
interoperability report [1] -- which will need to be updated once we move 
Canonical XML to REC because the URI for its algorithm will change. So I'd 
recommend trying the tar ball reference in [1], and if everything goes 
smoothly, feel free to create your own with more exotic/boundary examples.
