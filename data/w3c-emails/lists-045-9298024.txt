I'm not an X509 expert (or even novice) but I can speak to the XML issues 
and the spec.

Basically, yes. Though it could include (+,-) as well.

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xmlschema-2-20001024/#integer
3.3.11 integer
[Definition:] integer is derived from decimal by fixing the value of scale 
to be 0. This results in the standard mathematical concept of the integer 
numbers. The value space of integer is the infinite set 
{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}. The base type of integer is decimal.
3.3.11.1 Lexical representation
integer has a lexical representation consisting of a finite-length sequence 
of decimal digits (#x30-#x39) with an optional leading sign. If the sign is 
omitted, "+" is assumed. For example: -1, 0, 12678967543233, +100000.
3.3.11.2 Canonical representation
The canonical representation for integer is defined by prohibiting certain 
options from the Lexical representation (?3.3.11.1). Specifically, the 
preceding optional "+" sign is prohibited and leading zeroes are prohibited.

The natural language part of xmldsig relies upon the [LDAP-DN] reference 
(RFC2253) to say what the content should be a string.

RFC2253 is concerned with strings, not integer:

It does not comply with the most recent schema definition of course. It does 
comply with the June version
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000601/
which was then changed to type integery in the July version:
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmldsig-core-20000711/

This change apparently happened because of discussion in Pittsburgh:
        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2000JulSep/0254.html

I don't recall, perhaps Don or Tom could speak to this.
