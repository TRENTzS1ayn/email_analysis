Hi Joseph/Brian/Hans,

I attach two gzipped tarchives containing some sample signatures
based (hopefully) on the current editor's draft of the spec:

  http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/Overview.html

Relevant namespaces are:

  <!ENTITY dsig "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#">
  <!ENTITY c14n "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xml-c14n-20001026">
  <!ENTITY xpath "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116">
  <!ENTITY xslt "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116">

The first archive contains a few separate signatures that exercise
different basic things (enveloped/enveloping/detached/base 64, DSA,
RSA, HMAC, truncated HMAC); in each case, intermediate C14N is
included.

The second archive contains a more vomitous signature that exercises
local references of the form "", "#foo", "#xpointer(/)",
"#xpointer(id('foo'))", with and without comments, local and
external base 64 decoding, manifests, signature properties,
XSL and XPath transforms including use of the here() function
for an effective enveloped-reference transform. Again, all the
intermediate C14N is included.

As always, these aren't tested beyond the resolution of my eyeball.

All feedback welcome.

Merlin
