Hi Joseph,

Attached are:

  signature-example-dsa.xml - DSA example signature
  signature-example-rsa.xml - RSA example signature
  merlin-xmldsig-fourteen.tar.gz - one signature covering many things
  merlin-xmldsig-fifteen.tar.gz - several signatures covering some things

Namespaces are:

  <!ENTITY dsig "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#">
  <!ENTITY c14n "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315">

Brian and I have had recent interop success; hopefully the namespace
change won't affect that. However, it would probably be a good idea
to check that someone can verify the signatures before we assert
validity.

Merlin
