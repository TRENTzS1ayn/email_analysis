I can't find the reference, but I remember being asked about the ability for 
attributes from external namespaces to be included within the Signature 
element types for extension purposes. For example:

<Signature xmlns="..." xmlns:tricky="..." tricky:not-valid="Tuesdays">
...

Historically, they're hasn't been much support (or a proposal even) for this 
functionality. If there was, I'd have great concerns about it because of the 
interpretation folks would lend to such attributes (as demonstrated in the 
example above). I prefer people make syntactic extensions through the Object 
element, and semantic extensions (what it means and what you are signing) 
via SignatureProperties and Transforms.
