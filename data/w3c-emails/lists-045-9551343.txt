I don't claim to be an expert on the digital signatures specification, but 
my quick reading of it suggests that CryptoBinary is not just any base64 
binary, it is specifically binary that results from applying the 
mechanisms of the digital signatures specification.  If I am right about 
this, then I suggest that keeping the name is appropriate.  We can expect 
the XPath version 2, as well as many non-W3C database mapping systems, 
will support queries based on type name.  By specifically naming the 
digital signature type, you will allow behaviors to be applied to any 
information specifically coded in that manner.  The fact that the XML 
schema validation mechanisms provided no additional direct checking is 
unimportant, I think.  Higher level mechanisms can key on the type name 
and will know what to do.
