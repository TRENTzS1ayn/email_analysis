Thanks for your response Noah. I should've provided a reference, but there 
is really nothing more to CryptoBinary than the schema definition.

It is that simple. It's used as the type for SignatureValue, DigestValue, 
X509SKI, X509Certificate,  X509CRL, PGPKeyPacket, and all the DSA/RSA 
parameters. Consequently, it has to be generic, and given we decided to go 
base64 in xmldsig, it made sense to simplify things and just create a type 
for it.

Even given what I said above, I'd be willing to take this as an argument not 
to eliminate it -- that's the direction I'm leaning towards anyways <smile/>.
