CryptoBinary and base64Binary are not exactly equivalent -- there are
further restrictions on a CryptoBinary because it is a representation of
a single bignum.  From the latest DSIG draft, section 6.4, is this
implicit definition of the CryptoBinary format:

Arbitrary-length integers (e.g. "bignums") are represented in
XML as octet strings. The integer value is first converted to a "big
endian" bitstring. The bitstring is then padded with leading
zero bits so that the total number of bits == 0 mod 8 (so that
there are an integral number of octets). If the bitstring contains
entire leading octets that are zero, these are removed (so the
high-order octet is always non-zero). This octet string is then
base64 [MIME] encoded. (The conversion from integer to octet string
is equivalent to IEEE 1363's I2OSP [1363] with minimal length).

There's no difference in the schema definition, at least as it is today,
but there is a semantic difference.

Thanks for your response Noah. I should've provided a reference, but
there 
is really nothing more to CryptoBinary than the schema definition.

It is that simple. It's used as the type for SignatureValue,
DigestValue, 
X509SKI, X509Certificate,  X509CRL, PGPKeyPacket, and all the DSA/RSA 
parameters. Consequently, it has to be generic, and given we decided to
go 
base64 in xmldsig, it made sense to simplify things and just create a
type 
for it.

Even given what I said above, I'd be willing to take this as an argument
not 
to eliminate it -- that's the direction I'm leaning towards anyways
