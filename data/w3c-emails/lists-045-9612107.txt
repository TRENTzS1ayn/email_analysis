I think the issue here is not so much whether you are using a validating XML
processor, but whether or not the XML processor reads external entities.
Even non-validating processors are required to normalize attributes declared
in the internal DTD subset.  They may, but need not, do the same for
attributes declared in the external subset.

XML 1.0 [1] 5.1 states:  Non-validating processors are required to check
only the document entity, including the entire internal DTD subset, for
well-formedness /.../ they must use the information in these declarations to
normalize attribute values /.../

You may find that your XML processor allows you to disable validating but
still process external entities.  If not, try another parser!
