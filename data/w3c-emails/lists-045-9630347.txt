John,

Joseph pointed me to the XML-DSig WG comments and it seems
that  you're not aware of the latest changes in the
Infoset

From
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2001JanMar/att-0149/00-part

> Information Set provides for Entity and CDATA start and end mark information
> items.

This is no longer true. Entity and CDATA start and end mark information items
were removed from the latest of the Infoset:

The Infoset does no longer preserve the base URI of PIs if you serialize the
document:
[[[
2.4. Processing Instruction Information Items
[...]
[base URI] The base URI of the PI, as computed by the method of XML Base [XML
Base]. If the PI appears directly in the document entity, and the URI of the
document entity is not known, and there is no xml:base declaration in effect,
then the value of this property is unknown. Note that if an infoset is
serialized as an XML document, it will not be possible to preserve the base URI
of any PI that originally appeared at the top level of an external entity,
since there is no syntax for PIs corresponding to the xml:base attribute on
elements.

In your case, one solution would be to encapsulate each PI in a c14n:baseURI
element:
<doc><c14n:baseURI xmlns:c14n="..." xml:base="refer to
extEnt"><?PI1?></c14:baseURI> <e> <?PI2?> </e> <c14n:baseURI xmlns:c14n="..."
xml:base="refer to extEnt"><?PI3?></c14n:baseURI> <?PI4?> </doc>

Philippe
