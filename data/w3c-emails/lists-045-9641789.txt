Since there has been no repsonse from implementors to say that either
they implemented X509SerialNumber with other than integer or that they
want to change their implementation of integer to something else, the
specification will remain unchanged.

(See a few comments below)

Thanks,

(I'm not going to keep going around in circles with you on this but it
is perfectly clear to me that these are not different meanings.  They
are merely different encodings.  There is no significant difference
between "array" and "string".  The difference between binary and
decimal is only a difference in the radix of encoding, not meaning.
The difference between bits and characters is only a difference in
encoding, not meaning.)

(Whoever they are, they have not spoken up.  Maybe they have fixed
