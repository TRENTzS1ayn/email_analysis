In Section 4.4.4 is stated:

  1.. The X509IssuerSerial element, which contains an X.509 issuer distinguished
name/serial number pair that SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253 [LDAP-DN],
However, RFC2253 would only apply to X509IssuerName (which does use a DN), and
not X509SerialNumber (which does not use a DN).
