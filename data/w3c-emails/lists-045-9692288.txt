     AFAIK there is at least one commercial CA vendor who
CHARACTERISTICALLY produces 128-bit or longer serial numbers with values
which do not appear to be sequentially assigned.  If you have an installed
copy of Netscape's browser, and look at the Class 3 Public Primary
Certification Authority from Verisign, you'll see a 128-bit serial number
starting with hex 7D.  I can only speculate how these numbers were actually
assigned - if you're interested you can ask somebody who really knows.
     I can't see any 160-bit values, and you can take that part of what I
told Ken as my vague and unreliable recollection.

Are you certain this hash is used for CertificateSerialNumber as opposed to
using it for
SubjectKeyIdentifier? RFC2459 Section 4.2.1.2 describes such a hash to be
used
for SubectKeyIdentifier.
