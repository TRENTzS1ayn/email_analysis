Hi Philippe,

Thanks a lot for pointing that out.  My comments about the utility of
start and end entity markers were made only 2 days before the newest
draft came out.

It looks like they've decide to address our concern about the base URI
of PIs in external entities by saying simply "It can't be done!" (which
is essentially the same thing I said in the C14N Rec due to the same
limitations in the earlier xpath data model).

I am glad that they've spelled it out so well in the infoset document
because at least it sets a clear precedent about not using relative URIs
in PIs that appear in external entities (however inconvenient that might
be to some people).

However, it is sort of unfortunate that obviously recoverable
information is being lost, esp. when we can point to *real* places where
the information can be put to good use.

Editors:  Is there some reason why entity ref (and cdata) markers got
yanked?  I can understand tweaking features in response to a last call,
but it seems uncommon to make such a substantive change without issuing
another last call.

John,

Joseph pointed me to the XML-DSig WG comments and it seems
that  you're not aware of the latest changes in the
Infoset

From

information

This is no longer true. Entity and CDATA start and end mark information
items
were removed from the latest of the Infoset:

The Infoset does no longer preserve the base URI of PIs if you serialize
the
document:
[[[
2.4. Processing Instruction Information Items
[...]
[base URI] The base URI of the PI, as computed by the method of XML Base
[XML
Base]. If the PI appears directly in the document entity, and the URI of
the
document entity is not known, and there is no xml:base declaration in
effect,
then the value of this property is unknown. Note that if an infoset is
serialized as an XML document, it will not be possible to preserve the
base URI
of any PI that originally appeared at the top level of an external
entity,
since there is no syntax for PIs corresponding to the xml:base attribute
on
elements.

In your case, one solution would be to encapsulate each PI in a
c14n:baseURI
element:
<doc><c14n:baseURI xmlns:c14n="..." xml:base="refer to
extEnt"><?PI1?></c14:baseURI> <e> <?PI2?> </e> <c14n:baseURI
xmlns:c14n="..."
xml:base="refer to extEnt"><?PI3?></c14n:baseURI> <?PI4?> </doc>

Philippe
