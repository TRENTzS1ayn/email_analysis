Hi Philippe,

Actually, the status of the document says it is the 'about to become CR'
working draft that has been created to address the concerns raised in
last call.  There is no indication that another last call will occur
before infoset becomes a CR.

Thus, it would be helpful to know what aspect of last call feedback
caused the editors to remove entity ref and cdata markers.

Thanks,

The document is back to working draft so there will be an other last
call
in the future.
