The problem is not with UTF-8, but with restricted encodings, such as
Latin-1. You cannot convert a document in UTF-8 to a document in Latin-1
and guarantee to keep your CDATA sections.

Please note that you most probably wouldn't want your XML authoring tool
to mess with quite some other things, including whether you use single
or double quotes for attributes, and so on.

The Infoset is not a collection of things that it would make sense to
preserve by an authoring tool. It is very clear that a good authoring
tool will preserve more than the Infoset. The Infoset is about what
is really essential information in the XML document. CDATA is not
part of that.

I'm confused. I thought the infoset expanded them. If not,
having both a start and an end marker wouldn't make sense
at all.
