>
>         This document specifies protocols for distributing and
>         registering public keys, suitable for use in conjunction
>         with the proposed standard for XML Signature [XML-SIG]
>         developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the
>         Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and an anticipated
>         companion standard for XML encryption.  The XML Key
>         Management Specification (XKMS) comprises two parts --
>         the XML Key Information Service Specification (X-KISS) and
>         the XML Key Registration Service Specification (X-KRSS).
