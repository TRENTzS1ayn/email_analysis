      Joseph:

      That this mechanism exists and is fairly simple is certainly good
news for people who want to sign mixed sets of data (some XML, some
straight text or binary).  Could we put a use of this feature in one or
more of the published examples so that this issue doesn't come up again?

As Christian noted, it depends on the URI.

Yes, it directly digests the octets in the HTTP entity-body returned upon
dereferencing that URI.
