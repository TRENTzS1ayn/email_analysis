We can't change the spec, it's a REC and Draft Standard. While we could've 
used such an example with a different media type, fortunately the spec does 
say it can work with any octets, and this example from the spec actually 
does sign octets:

URI="http://example.com/bar.xml"
  Identifies the octets that represent the external resource
  'http://example.com/bar.xml', that is probably an XML document 
  given its file extension.
