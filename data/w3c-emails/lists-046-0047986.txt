Hi Christian,

This is a feature of the c14n spec; see the second paragraph
of 2.4:

  The processing of an element node E MUST be modified slightly when an
  XPath node-set is given as input and the element's parent is omitted
  from the node-set. The method for processing the attribute axis of an
  element E in the node-set is enhanced. All element nodes along E's
  ancestor axis are examined for nearest occurrences of attributes in the
  xml namespace, such as xml:lang and xml:space (whether or not they are
  in the node-set). From this list of attributes, remove any that are in
  E's attribute axis (whether or not they are in the node-set). Then,
  lexicographically merge this attribute list with the nodes of E's
  attribute axis that are in the node-set. The result of visiting the
  attribute axis is computed by processing the attribute nodes in this
  merged attribute list.

This probably isn't aesthetically ideal; however, it doesn't
cause any problems.
