Hi Merlin,

No, that can't be. That's strange. For instance, the exclusive c14n spec 
[1] tells me that subset c14n by selecting elem2 in this document

<n0:local xmlns:n0="foo:bar"
          xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org">
<n1:elem2 xmlns:n1="http://example.net"
          xml:lang="en">
<n3:stuff xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org"/>
</n1:elem2>
</n0:local>

results in this:

<n1:elem2 xmlns:n0="foo:bar"
          xmlns:n1="http://example.net"
          xmlns:n3="ftp://example.org"
          xml:lang="en">
<n3:stuff></n3:stuff>
</n1:elem2>

Given the interpretation below, the xml:lang="en" would have to be also in 
the n3:stuff element. And it isn't. So I would (again) say that the first 
reference of merlin-iaikTests-two.tar.gz is wrong.
