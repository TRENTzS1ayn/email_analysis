Hi John,
hi Joseph,

I implemented exclusive c14n for the Apache package. On my implementation, 
exclusive c14n is SLOWER than inclusive c14n:

   Factor between 1.3 and 1.6

I can verify the signature from merlin-iaikTests-two.tar.gz but one 
reference (the first one fails). This means that I can do reference 
validation on all things which use exclusive c14n. The first reference uses 
conventional (inclusive) c14n.

I re-created the same signature Merlin did on the four IAIK files. This 
signature is attached. HMAC, secret key is the six octets from "secret".


Regards,
Christian
