Do you have a sense of why? In some cases I expect some variances, but this 
is rather surprising. The intent was to simplify a number of things c14n 
processing required such as (1) checking to see if the parent element is in 
the subset on that xml:foo issue we've been discussing and (2) if you have 
a subset in a small document, you don't have to walk up the tree to find 
ancestor xml:foo attributes.
