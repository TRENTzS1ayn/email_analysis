Absolutely right. If you don't have at least one node which works as an 
"anchor" into the to-be-signed document, you can't proceed (well, it'd be 
possible to create nasty hacks which do not only pass the node set 
information to the transform but also the owner document).

For me, +1. That'd be a good addition/clarification to the spec. Empty node 
sets should be an error.
