Well, the main difference between inclusive and exclusive c14n is that in 
inclusive c14n, I can simply output the changes to the inscope namespace 
decls. In exclusive c14n, I also have to check whether a namespace is 
visibly utilized. That's the additional overhead. But I have to reduce this 
1.3-1.6 to a lower level of 1.1-1.2.
