That's probably one of the discussions..

Sure, I'll try sending along something.

That's not correct; repeated xml:* attributes are not suppressed,
they are emitted at every element that defines them.

Whitespace is probably the best example; other examples that (now)
come to mind would be canonicalizing multiple disjoint elements,
node sets that omit parts of the namespace axis, etc.
