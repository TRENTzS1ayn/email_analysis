Hi Joseph,

I think there is one paragraph of the exclusive c14n spec that is
unclear:

Section 3, item 3:
  For every namespace node with a prefix that does not appear in
  the InclusiveNamespacePrefix List, a namespace declaration is output at
  every output element where that prefix is visibly utilized and /that
  prefix and its value does not appear in the nearest output ancestor with
  the same prefix/.

I presume that 'output element' means an element in the node set;
i.e., non-inclusive namespace nodes are never emitted if their parent
element is not in the node set. I presume that 'with the same prefix'
means that the namespace prefix is visibly utilized. And, I presume
that 'does not appear' means that the element does not have a namespace
node in the node set with the same local name and value.

I would suggest, if it is not too late, the following more-explicit text
(which is basically the language from c14n adapted to our needs):
  A namespace node N with a prefix that does not appear in the
  InclusiveNamespacePrefix is ignored if any of the following
  conditions are met:
  1. Its parent element is not in the node set.
  2. It is not visibly utilized by its parent element.
  3. The nearest ancestor element of its parent element
  that visibly utilizes the namespace prefix and is in the
  node-set has a namespace node in the node-set with the
  same local name and value as N.

This is not a change, per se, but a clarification of the text.
If we can't change the text at this stage, maybe this should be
an erratum/clarification. Our current text is otherwise open
to interpretation..

Merlin
