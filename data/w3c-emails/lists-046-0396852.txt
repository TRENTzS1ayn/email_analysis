Yes, so that should mean for every element one tests to see if the 
node.prefix or any of the attributes prefixes are the same as the namespace 
prefix avaible in its axis. I haven't dug deeply but in the small tests I 
can do, this is a neglible difference in performance (and for other 
reasons, exc-c14n tends to be slight faster as the size of the document 
grows.) However, I'll also say I'm not expert at this...
