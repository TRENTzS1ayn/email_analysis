After thinking about it, I think your text is more clear. I should be able 
to get the following into the REC (two small tweaks on your text):

    3. A namespace node N with a prefix that does not appear in the
       InclusiveNamespacePrefix List is ignored if any of the following
       conditions are met:
         1. Its parent element is not in the node set.
         2. It is not visibly utilized by its parent element.
         3. The output ancestor visibly utilizes the namespace prefix and
            has a namespace node in the node-set with the same namespace
            prefix and value as N.
