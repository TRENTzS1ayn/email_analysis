How would one forbid this? We can't stop a user from specifying an XPath 
expression that misses the mark, right? If we said throw an error, that 
would stop the processing of the signature -- maybe there are other useful 
XPath transforms. We could add a processing step that says if the input 
node-set is empty the transform is done.
