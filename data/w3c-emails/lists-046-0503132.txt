3.3 Input and Evaluation Context of Signature Filter Transform

The input required by this transform is an XPath input node-set over the 
input document. If the input document is an octet stream, then the 
application MUST attempt to parse the octets yielding the required node-set 
(including comment nodes) via [XML] well-formed processing. An empty XPath 
input node-set is an error. The XPath evaluation context for the node-set 
will be:
