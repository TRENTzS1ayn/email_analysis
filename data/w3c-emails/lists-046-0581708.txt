Hi Merlin,
hi Aleksey,


OK, my "Y4 does not verify" is a little bit fuzzy. Let's describe in more 
detail where my problems are:

I Merlin's Y4 example, there are 27 References (c14n-0.txt ... c14n-26.txt) 
and the c14nized SignedInfo (c14n-27.txt). The following list refers to 
these indices:

For Apache, I cannot verify 8/27 References:

Reference  1 failed
Reference  2 failed
Reference  3 failed
Reference  6 failed
Reference  7 failed
Reference  8 failed
Reference 24 failed
Reference 26 failed

Reference  0 was OK
Reference  4 was OK
Reference  5 was OK
Reference  9 was OK
Reference 10 was OK
Reference 11 was OK
Reference 12 was OK
Reference 13 was OK
Reference 14 was OK
Reference 15 was OK
Reference 16 was OK
Reference 17 was OK
Reference 18 was OK
Reference 19 was OK
Reference 20 was OK
Reference 21 was OK
Reference 22 was OK
Reference 23 was OK
Reference 25 was OK

DISCLAIMER: But even for those which I can verify, I'm not sure that it's 
correct and that they should verify.

Regards,
Christian
