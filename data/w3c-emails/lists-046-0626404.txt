Hi Merlin,

merlin-c14n-three.tar.gz shows the same failing results:

 0,  4,  5,  9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 25 have 
been validated successfully.

These fail because of the "superflous namespaces" issue which
Aleksey already mentioned:

 -  2
 - 10
 - 19

These fail because I don't output an namespace as
a TEXT node if it's owner element is not document
sub set.

 -  3
 -  6
 -  7
 - 24

unknown reason: I don't know yet why we have differences.

 -  1
 -  8
 - 26

Regards,
Christian
