While they may appear superfluous, according to the letter
of the spec they should be emitted. And, given that this is
an unusual case of little use, I don't think that any
aesthetic concerns are of particular import.

They are not output as text nodes, per se; they are output
as any attribute or namespace node. If you attempt to parse
this directly, then you will get a text node. If you wrap
this in an element declaration, then you will get an
attribute node.

I would suspect because the node set omits all namespace nodes
from the foo:Nothing element (the first instance of the foo:
prefix).

These examples are among those situations where no one
really cares because no one should be producing node sets
of this form; however, interop of the spec, as written,
is relatively important.

And you did ask for them ;}
