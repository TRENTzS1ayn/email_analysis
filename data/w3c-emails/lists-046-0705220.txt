Hi Merlin,

now I know why I has that much problems understanding the spec:

                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I didn't realize that the parent element of the node is the owner element. 
I always read the parent element of the owner element and was confused 
about that.

Joseph, maybe this would be a nice clarification:

s/parent element of the namespace node/owner element of the namespace node/;
