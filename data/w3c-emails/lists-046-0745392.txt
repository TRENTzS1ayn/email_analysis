I added the following sentence to hopefully make it more clear: new 
revision: 1.67

 A document subset is a portion of an XML document indicated by an XPath 
node-set that may not include all of the nodes in the document. /+As 
defined in [XPath] every node (e.g., element, attribute, namespace nodes), 
has exactly one parent, which is either an element node or the root 
node."/+ An apex node is an element node in a document subset having no 
element node ancestor in the document subset....
