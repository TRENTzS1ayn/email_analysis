I have to disagree with you. The Specification you mentioned is C14N
specification and we are talking about Exc-C14N one and it describes the
transform in terms of ns_rendered list. I think that the ns_rendered list
makes a lot of sense and Exc-C14N namespace scheme is much more
simple than the scheme in C14N.  As you can see from this example,
the namespace node is rendered *only* if there is another namespace
node with same prefix and different value. I think this is correct behavior
and we should keep it.
