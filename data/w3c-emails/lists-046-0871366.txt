I am sorry but this document will be rendered correctly:

  <A xmlns="http://example.org/"><B xmlns=""/ ></A>

because when we are processing element <B> ns_rendered has default 
namespace
with a *different* value (href). By this xmlns="" will be rendered for 
element <B>

It does! The only thing is that in this case namespace node is not added 
to ns_rendered list.
