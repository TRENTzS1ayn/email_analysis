No it will not. xmlns="" is not a namespace node. It
is a serialization that indicates the lack of a default
namespace node. The XPath node set represents xmlns=""
as the lack of a default namespace node, not the
presence of a default namespace node with value "".

You're right. Maybe I should say that it mis-handles namespace
nodes (in the node set) on elements (not in the node set) whose
prefixes are not in InclusiveNamespaces.PrefixList.
