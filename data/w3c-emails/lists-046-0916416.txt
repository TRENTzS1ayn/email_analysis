Because xmlns="" is, uniquely, not represented in the node set
as presence of a namespace node, but absence of a namespace
node. As a result, we have special language in c14n that
describes when to emit xmlns="": When the current element
does not have a default namespace node and its ancestor does.

Exc-c14n is specified in terms of c14n with exceptions; i.e.,
it inherits behaviour from c14n. It describes when to ignore
namespace nodes (when they are not visibly utilized), but it
does not describe when to ignore xmlns="" (when the default
namespace is not visibly utilized).

This is why I characterize the problem as I do.

http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n, ?4.7:
  The XPath data model represents an empty default namespace with the
  absence of a node, not with the presence of a default namespace node
  having an empty value

In this example, xmlns="" does not corresponding to a
visibly utilized namespace node; it does not correspond to
any namespace node at all.

I've been completely wrong about this before; feel free to
continue the trend.
