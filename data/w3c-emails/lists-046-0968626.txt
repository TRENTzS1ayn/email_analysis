Donald, the "Additional XML Security URIs"  [1] draft will be expiring in 
July. What should we do next with it? I don't think we've had many requests 
for additions recently. Do you want to publish it as an Informational RFC? 
Another option is to publish it on the W3C site. One could do it as a NOTE, 
or even more informally, just as a document in the date space (e.g., 
/2002/01/foo) as just a staff/administrative thingie. Not good for 
normative references, but it can be useful to applications...
