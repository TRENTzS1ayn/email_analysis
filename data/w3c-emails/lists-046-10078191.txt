Hi,
I am a newbie in the world of XML signatures and webservices security, I was reading a document Web Services Security X.509 Certificate Token Profile document, 
I have a question on the same 

1. What is the difference between PKIPath object and Certificate Path object?

2. When a digital certificate is referred directly a securitytokenreference element is used directly, however when a PKIPath object is used the KeyInfo->    securitytokenreference element is used, why is the difference?

If this is not the right forum to ask this question please guide me to the right forum. Thanks in advance.
