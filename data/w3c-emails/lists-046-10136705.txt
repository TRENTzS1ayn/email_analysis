Folks,
 
A free (trial) xml digital signature application is now available. It allows
users to sign files and XML/HTML forms online. Signed documents are stored
on the server for future reference, cosigning and forwarding. The resulting
signed file is downloadable as a gzipped XML (.sig) and is compatible with
the SecureSign Desktop Document Signer (free viewer is available for
download) for offline viewing and cosigning.
 
Please visit http://www.infomosaic.net/SecureWebsignServerDetails.htm and
click on the online trial link.
The application will download and install a client side component. The user
must have administrative privilege in order for the install to go through.
Currently only Internet Explorer 5.5 and above are supported on Windows
platform.
 
Your comments are welcome.
 
Best Regards,

Manoj K. Srivastava
