Well, there doesn't seem to have been much response to my message, pro
or con, so I'll take that as acceptance and change 1.3(1) of
draft-ietf-xmldsig-xc14n-01.txt from

     1. The XML being canonicalized may depend on the effect of XML
        namespace attributes, such as xml:lang, xml:space, and xml:base
        appearing in ancestor nodes. To avoid problems due to the non-
        importation of such attributes into an enveloped document
        subset, either they MUST be explicitly given in the apex nodes
        of the XML document subset being canonicalized or they MUST
        always be declared with an equivalent value in every context in
        which the XML document subset will be interpreted.
