As a belated aside, I'm not sure there's much the W3C could do. They never 
made any representation to me, (I didn't have contact with them, but heard 
of it from you! <smile/>), didn't ask to be listed on the site, didn't send 
in an interop report. So the W3C can't threaten removal from any of that 
stuff. *If* somewhere they claim they are conformant to W3C (r) 
specifications, perhaps a trademark issue could be raised there [1], but 
that has the potential of them simply removing "W3C" if they aren't 
inclined to do anything.
