There is a discrepancy in section 4.4.3[1] between the schema fragment
and the DTD. The former states that the URI attribute is optional, while
the latter states that it is mandatory. Which is correct? 

I note that the normative schema[2] matches the schema fragment, but
wanted to check. I also checked the errata page, but couldn't see
anything that pertained to this.

Thanks
