Hi all,

I think there is an error in [1], section 4. The second paragraph there
says

  "... The value of this attribute, which may be null, is a white space
   delimited list of namespace prefixes ..."

But the PrefixList attribute is of schema type NMTOKENS, and this type
does not allow for an empty list (see [2]).

However, since Erratum E2 of [3] the problem seems to be solved.
Nevertheless I think that a clarification makes sence. Therefore I suggest
to change the sentence above to

  "... The value of this attribute is a white space
   delimited list of namespace prefixes ..."


Regards, Gregor
