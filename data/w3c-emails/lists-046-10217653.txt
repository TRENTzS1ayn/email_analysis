If I understand, the problem is that NMTOKENS was inapproriate for *two* 
reasons, so does simply tweaking the erratum (instead of adding a new one) 
address the issue?

      This does not permit <ins>"non-zero-length sequences," or</ins> the
      occurrence of the '<code>#default</code>' token in the attribute value
      because of the "#" character.
