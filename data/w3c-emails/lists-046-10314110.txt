How about (using John's text) this proposal, we could cast it as Editor or 
Error I figure...:

E02 2003-11-20 (Editorial)

Section 2.3 Processing Mode specifies the processing model for generating 
canonical output. The specification for the namespace node type reads, 
". . . except assign the local name xmlns to the default namespace node if 
it exists . . ." This "assignment" can easily and incorrectly interprated 
as affecting the namespace/attribute ordering in section 2.2 Document 
Order. Consequently, the text should be corrected to read '. . . except 
write xmlns for the local name xmlns of the default namespace node if it 
exists . . .'


BTW: the errata of exc-14n, the first sentence of the errata has been 
mangled: "The Exclusive Canonicalization Recommendation has been produced 
by the IETF/W3C XML Signature Working.." +/Group/
