Hi Jose,

E04 in excl-c14n has a double 'the'.

E05 in c14n: adverbs are often bad, double adverbs are worse.  Best to remove 'easily and' since 'incorrectly' is sufficient to justify the erratum.

Thanks Joseph,

I had some network problems on Friday, but I committed the errata
changes today[1]. I also fixed the typo on the exc-14n page[2].

I guess we're all set up for now.
