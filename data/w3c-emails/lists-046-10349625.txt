     Iam not sure, whether this is the right forum for this question.
If not please advice, if there is any other appropriate forum for
this question.

     In the web page http://www.w3.org/Signature, I see a
reference to an implementation of XMLDSIG using C
language, by Aleksey Sanin published under MIT License.
Is this is a widely used implementation, by the industry.
Is there any known issue, technical or non technical, in
using this implementation, in a comercial product.

      Appreciate your reply.

thanks
Joseph
