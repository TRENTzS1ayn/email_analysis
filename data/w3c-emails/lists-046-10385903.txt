For some reason the announcement below didn't come through on the
mailing list. This draft revision incorporated the minor change I
previous posted
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2003OctDec/0076.html
that was requested by the IESG as well as an earlier form of more
recently discussed errata.

Thanks,
Donald

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the XML Digital Signatures Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Exclusive XML Canonicalization, Version 1.0
Author(s): J. Boyer, D. Eastlake, J. Reagle
Filename: draft-ietf-xmldsig-xc14n-02.txt
Pages: 17
Date: 2003-12-3

Canonical XML [XML-C14N] specifies a standard serialization of XML
that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's
ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and
attributes in the 'xml:' namespace. However, some applications
require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor
context from a canonicalized subdocument. For example, one might
require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an
XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from
its original message and/or inserted into a different context.  This
requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.

In the body type:

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
