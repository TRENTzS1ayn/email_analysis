I hope this question is not too "newbe-like".

As it seems there are many XML DSig users and they have all
made their own choices of what properties etc. to use.  This is
the dark side of a having a flexible standard :-|

Is there a recommendable way to validate that an XML Signature
follows a certain profile without doing a "me-too" XML Signature
schema?

I have found one way but it is ugly and that is to have a generic
XML Dsig validator and then programatically check that you got
what you consider the "right" set of options.  Besides being
a bit on the complex side, the diagnostics you would get for
PGP keys in an X509-shop is probably not that great.

Although this question is really an XML Schema issue, I have
seen few examples of XML Schemas having this kind of
flexibility.

thanx
