Uuh, it becomes complicated ;-)) I agree on what you say:


If we do 'enforce' that all (relevant) changes in namespace-space become 
visible in the elements where (1) the namespace is utilized or (2) the 
namespace is in the IncusiveNamespaces.PrefixList and 'changes' it's value, 
there's no need to output a namespace attribute if the owner element is 
omitted from the document subset.

I would say: If the owner element (parent?) of a namespace node is not in 
the document subset, the namespace node is not output.

Christian

PS: Yesterday, I asked Merlin (not via list) the following:
