XML Signature recommends a standard means for specifying information
content to be digitally signed and for representing the resulting
digital signatures in XML.  Some applications require the ability to
specify a subset of a given XML document as the information content to
be signed.  The XML Signature specification meets this requirement
with the XPath transform.  However, this transform can be difficult to
implement efficiently with existing technologies.  This specification
defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the development of
efficient document subsetting implementations that interoperate under
similar performance profiles.

This document is the W3C XML Signature XPath-Filter 2.0
Recommendation.  This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and
other interested parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a
W3C Recommendation.  It is a stable document and may be used as
reference material or cited as a normative reference from another
document.  W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw
attention to the specification and to promote its widespread
deployment.  This enhances the functionality and interoperability of
the Web.

This document is a product of the XML Digital Signatures Working Group
of the IETF.
