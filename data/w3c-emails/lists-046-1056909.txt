Hi Christian,

I see what you are proposing but I don't really see why.

Is the justification solely to satisfy what you suggest is the
second purpose of canonicalization (allowing re-parsing)? I
don't think this is a purpose of c14n; the spec says
"The canonical form of an XML document subset may not be
well-formed XML." If the intention of c14n and exc-c14n
had been to guarantee reparsable results, they would have
had express limitations placed on their input. Knowing what
canonicalization is employed, applications can meaningfully
use the input node set without having to reprase.

I agree that unwitting interference with the node set is not
advisable; *however*, I do not think it is without merit. As
such, arbitrarily restricting applications from employing
exc-c14n when they choose to do this does not seem, to me,
defensible.

Worse, silently ignoring the contents of the namespace axis
would seem like a terrible approach because applications,
being familiar with c14n, might not expect this. Were we to
go down this route, I think we should instead state that
an input node set that either excludes an element but includes
part of its namespace axis, or that includes an element but
excludes part of its namespace axis, MUST raise an error.
We would do this because we think it is an error to produce
such node sets.

However; I don't think it is an error and I would be strongly
opposed to any such proposition. C14n and exc-c14n are,
with few exceptions, almost identical, which allows me to
use a single codebase to implement both. Any unnecessary
divergence is just a headache.

As an aside, and returning to what you said a while ago about
multiple application of c14n being idempotent, the spec does
state, in ?2.4:
  Whether from a full document or a document subset, if the canonical
  form is well-formed XML, then subsequent applications of the same XML
  canonicalization method to the canonical form make no changes.

This is, of course, not true!
