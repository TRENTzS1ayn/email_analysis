From a recent Intel pressrelease:

The Intel PXA27x family of processors, formerly code-named "Bulverde," adds a number of new technologies to address the needs of cell phone and PDA users. It is the first product to integrate the Intel Wireless MMX technology, providing additional performance for 3-D games and advanced video while improving battery-life. The new chip also utilizes Wireless Intel SpeedStep technology, enabling significant power savings by intelligently managing voltage and frequency changes similar to the technology used in the company?s notebook processors. 

Also for the first time, Intel has integrated important security features through its Intel Wireless Trusted Platform to provide services such as trusted boot, secure storage of private information and cryptographic keys, and support for common security protocols.

If you have a device that you already use extensively for other purposes, that can connect to various services including to local PCs using WLAN, and this device has a processor of the type above, why would you ever want a smart ID card that only supports a fraction of the other device's ID-related use-cases?
