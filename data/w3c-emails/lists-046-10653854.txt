Panama City, 29th of April 2004. 

We are happy to announce the 0.9 release of NeuClear ID. This is a simple PKI 
and programming model based on XML Signatures. It was designed to support the 
NeuClear (http://neuclear.org) distributed clearing system.

Major new features are: 
* Got rid of hierarchical naming system
* Any xml file with an enveloped signature and included public key is now a 
NeuClear object.
* Identities and Service descriptors are now written in Signed HTML.
* Much smaller API
* New Interactive Signing tool (see link below)

For more info see:

For a quick usage introduction see the Busy Developers Guide at:
