Folks,

I've an internet-draft ([1] for the sacred WG) which is in the RFC
editor's author's 48 state.

It contains an XML schema, which contains the following fragment:

         <import namespace="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
                 schemaLocation="../W3C/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd"/>

The RFC editor pointed out that their schema checker objects to
the schemaLocation value above since they don't have a dsig
core schema at that relative location.

The schemaLocation attribute is however just a hint [2], so the
schema passes using the checker on the w3c site.

 From memory, this is the result of the schema checker I used to
use (in a previous job) which I needed to be able to use offline.

No one's noticed this until now, but then again, I'm not sure
how many people have tried to write code for this protocol (few
at any rate).

So, the question:-

- is it ok as is?
- should I change the value of schemaLocation to use an
   absolute URL, in particular [3]?

I assume the latter is better.

Can you cc' me on any responses - I'm not subscribed to this
list.

Thanks,
Stephen.
