That sounds approriate.

Yes, though if you do use it, the Schema spec says [b] "When a 
schemaLocation is present, it must contain a single URI reference which the 
schema author warrants will resolve to a serialization of a ?schema 
document? containing the component(s) in the <import>ed namespace referred 
to elsewhere in the containing schema document."

A non-working hint doesn't seem appropriate to me, why would you use it?

Yep, the only way it wouldn't is if somehow one interpreted the URL as a 
secure string/identifier. For example, there's some program that will only 
use schemas that when they import from dsig, import that specific string, 
and not the URL. But I'm not aware of any such processing, and the W3C 
never indicated "../W3C/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd" is a blessed 
string/identifier -- unlike other algorithm identifier URIs where we use an 
absolute URI.
