                           A great opportunity for a naval decoration



     What you are seeing , aren't  real ships.  They are models made in scale from my collection. Media length, 90 inchs. Fully illuminated.  The photos of these models at sea , that you can see in my Web, are a technical trick.
More photos in :  www.maquetasdebarcos.com.ar    Have a goud time .
                                                                                                                                           
If you want to be removed from our emails lists in the future, please email mzuker@bariloche.com.ar  with your email address in the subject line.
