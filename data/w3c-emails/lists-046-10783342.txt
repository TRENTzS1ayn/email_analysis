If you do this, than at least the verifier has *something* they can do. 
  The semantics of Manifest seems to fit exactly into your situation: 
you might not be able to verify the original hash, but everything else 
is legit.

This isn't quite the same.  If you omit the URI attribute, than you are 
saying (according to the 4th paragraph of sec 4.3.3.1) that the verifier 
knows what the reference is, and that they will fetch it on their own. 
This isn't quite the same as Manifest.

I'd go with the Manifest.
