Dear All

I don't know whether this was discussed before, but it does impose some
obstacles in our implementation attempts. We are evaluating the use of
XAdES as a tool for record archiving system, since XAdES already
includes some fields for time stamping inclusion. However, the problem
with time stamping is that is it does not fit into XML structure (so
far). So XAdES should perfectly perform when using "detach" signature
type (e.g. file separated from a signature, which can be timestamped
without problem). But what happens when one uses other signature types?
How is a time stamping procedure performed when signature is part of a
(signed) file? Current TimeStamp standard does not recognize an XML
structure and therefore if time stamped, the part of the message must be
taken out, time stamped and put back and then timestamp itself included
in an XAdES structure. It could be performed, but under what
circumstances? Transformations seems to be the first and the main
problem not to mention that the whole procedure without clear process
definition seems pretty awkward, so any suggestions are welcome.

Best regards

Aleksej
