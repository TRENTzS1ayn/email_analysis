Dear Juan,

Thank you for useful links.

As you are saying XAdES includes mechanisms which part of the message is
time stamped, but it is still hard to understand how this can be
performed in case we are talking about signatures as a part of the
document structure. Current timestamp protocols are not capable of
handling parts of XML structures and from the implementation point of
view that is impossible to realize without some basic information on how
a part of the document is extracted for the time stamping purposes. I
imagine the most obvious way to define XML TimeStamp, but how far are we
form the actual standardization? Some proposals are quite impressive,
but so far I see operability of XAdES concerning timestamps problematic.
If anyone can give more information on how to get closer to designing
stages (if there are formal one??) it would be more than welcome.

Best regards

Aleksej
