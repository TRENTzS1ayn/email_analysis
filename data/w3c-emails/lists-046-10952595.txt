Hmmm, this is a good point....In the published version of XAdES, the 
presence of transformations could allow to take out of the computations
the signature.

On the other side, after the interop event, the supporting structure
of time-stamps was proposed to be changed, in order to make things
easier, and in this case, I think that for this case a solution similar for
the enveloped signature computation itself must be selected: indication
that the
signature must be taken out.

I guess that when you talk about "protocols" you are also including the
formats of the time-stamps tokens, not only the response-request, because
I am not sure if this is an issue of the response-request, but of the 
information that accompanies the time-stamp inserted within the document.
The companion information to the time-stamp should solve the problem...
how easily this is done, is another issue

I propose you the following: if you want I can send you the interop XAdES
event
final report pointing you directly to the time-stamp issues so that we can
comment
with more details... perhaps we even could be more specific disscussing
examples...
