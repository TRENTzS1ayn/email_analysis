Hi,

The latest version of the draft defining additional URIs has been
posted. Comments welcome. I hope to go through zero or one edits and
then ask for publication as an individual submission Informational RFC.

Thanks,
Donald

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: Additional XML Security URIs
Author(s): D. Eastlake
Filename: draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-05.txt
Pages: 17
Date: 2004-2-2

A number of URIs intended for use with XML Digital Signatures,
   Encryption, and Canonnicalization are defined.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-05.txt

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to
ietf-announce-request with the word unsubscribe in the body of the message.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-05.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-05.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
