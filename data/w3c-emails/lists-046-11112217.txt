A Certificate's Issuer binds a Subject and its Public Key with a specific 
set of Claims (e.g. Account #, validity period, etc.). The same Public Key 
might be bound in different Certificates (for the same or other Subject) 
to different sets of Claims. So there may exist more than one valid 
Certificate with the same Public Key. Including the Certificate with the 
in the signature makes eliminates the possibility that the Certificate 
might be replaced after signing.

Thanks,
Mike
