Hi Christian, while I appreciate your proposal I agree with all the points 
Merlin made, and these changes would be outside the scope of fixes from 
PR->REC. Even now, I will have to present the argument that the changes we 
made during PR did not affect any results that we previously considered 
correct: they were necessary clarifications to what we intuitively knew we 
wanted to do, but the spec wasn't clear on. Your changes I think are 
substantive, I'd want to sit in CR a little while and spend more time on a 
new interop matrix before we were confident we had a shared and consistent 
understanding of it.
