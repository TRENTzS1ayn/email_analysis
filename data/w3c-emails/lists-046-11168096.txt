Yes, it is very interesting how the marketing mind works,
turning a limitation into a desirable feature.  They're
really good at manufacturing need. :-)

About 10 years ago we had a doc writer who went on to
marketing greatness (someplace else), but the doc writer
had this tendency of occasionally finding a bug then 
writing about it as a wonderful feature rather than 
realizing it wasn't intended.

The particular bug that comes to mind was my own.  I was
doing something that was not quite right with windows 3.1
color palette management and the occasional video card took
note of it.  So, instead of getting a directory menu that was
consistently a steel blue-grey color, this doc writer would 
get a different color every time the program was launched.  
So, into the manual went this long spiel about the wonderful, 
cheery, background color mutation strategy.
Even called it the 'rainbow effect.'

Ironically, the name ended up being appropriate as it described
all the colors I turned when I saw the documentation. :-)
