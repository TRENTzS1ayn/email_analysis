Ok, so aside from typos and bits of cruft I've introduced in editing 
(please let me know) I think we've greatly improved upon the specification 
of the processing.

http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xml-exc-c14n 
 $Revision: 1.72 $ 

1. I tweaked step 3 in the specification to be positive (rules for 
rendering instead of ignoring so as to be consistent wi th everything else.)
2. I gave the implementation its own little section: "3.1 Constrained 
Implementation (non-normative)"
3. In the implementation I broke out the creation of ns_rendered as its own 
(first) step.
4. The last step is now clear with respect to ns_rendered.
