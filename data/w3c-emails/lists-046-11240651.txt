This is a coment concerning

http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/


We have been reading this recommendation trying to understand how to 
make best use of it for signing RDF documents.
We are finding it useful.
We are embedding signatures so formed within further RDF documents and 
ideally wish to reuse parts of your RDF data model:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/xmldsig-datamodel-20000112.gif

However, there does not seem to be a corresponding namespace or RDF 
schema document or ....

If there is such a document, please can you send a pointer. If not, 
please can we have the source code for your gif, that will probably be 
better than nothing!

If there is such a document I suggest that an erratum including the link 
in section 9 should be considered.
