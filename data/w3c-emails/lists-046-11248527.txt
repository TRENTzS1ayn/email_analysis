Dear Pelle,

As we announced some weeks ago, we are curently organising an
interoperability event in the field of security (PKIs and XadES)
http://www.etsi.org/Plugtests/security.htm.

We strongly think that presenting and testing NeuClear XMLSig
during this event could be interresting for you and for the whole
community.

What's your opinion?

Regards,

Muriel SOUVILLE
