Hi Jeremy, it's not much of a data model; it's a simple transliteration of 
the XML syntax into RDF -- versus the richer sort of semantics expressed in 
XML (e.g., [1]). In any case, this work goes back to the start of RDF and I 
don't recall there ever being a schema, and I no longer have the visio 
files, though that might exist in some W3C filesystem somewhere.
