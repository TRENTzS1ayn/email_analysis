Two kinds of information are necessary for human life
on this planet:

(1) Genetic information.  No batteries required.

(2) Everything else, i.e., civilization.  Batteries
    required.


Please be welcome to participate in the 11th annual

     Extreme Markup Languages Conference
-->  August 2-6, 2004  <--
     Hotel Europa

As always, it's a family gathering for
rubber-meets-the-road technical luminaries interested
in doing a better job of supporting civilization.  Come
share your light, and be brightened, too.  You'll be
glad you did, and not only because Montreal in August
is great fun.

Peer-reviewed paper submissions are due  -->  April 16, 2004 <--
