Agreed, things are much more clear. ?3, 4.3.3, 
  "...the nearest output ancestor of its parent element that visibly
   utilizes the namespace prefix has a namespace node in the node-set
   with the a different namespace prefix and value as N."

This doesnt't quite capture it. Either:
  "...the nearest output ancestor of its parent element that visibly
   utilizes the namespace prefix does not have a namespace node in
   the node-set with the same prefix and value as N."
Or:
  "...the nearest output ancestor of its parent element that visibly
   utilizes the namespace prefix has a namespace node in the node-set
   with the same prefix and a different value than N, or has no
   namespace node in the node set with the same prefix as N."
