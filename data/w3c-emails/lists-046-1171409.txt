Hi John,

You're welcome. I think these are all points that you've
explained in detail to me in the past.

I agree. I believe the spirit of the spec is unchanged by
these alterations; we are just correcting its letter.

I would disagree here. C14n does not emit xmlns="" in this
case, and we don't need to either. It is not the canonical
form that will be reparented, but the node set from which
the canonical form is generated. If the input node set is
reparented correctly, even into a document that uses the
default namespace, it will carry its (null) namespace URI
with it; For example, take the following document:
  <Foo />

Reparent it into this:
  <Bar xmlns="http://example.org/bar />

The result will be:
  <Bar xmlns="http://example.org/bar><Foo xmlns="" /></Bar>

And the (exclusive) canonical form, in either case will be:
  <Foo></Foo>
