Why are neither interprations correct? I'm not saying it might not benefit 
from clarification, but the whole of the rule starts to get difficult to 
parse as you've proposed [1] and I think either interpration is correct. If 
specificity is desired, I'd prefer to use the "prefix" [2]. (I've tried 
writing this a number of times... If we go with [1], it feels like we could 
do something to grammatically compact the sentence...)

[1]  no output ancestor has rendered a namespace prefix and value equal to 
those  N,  or the nearest output ancestor of its parent element that 
visibly utilizes the namespace prefix does not have a namespace node in the 
node-set with the same namespace prefix and value as N.
[2]  the prefix has not yet been rendered by any output ancestor, or the 
nearest output ancestor of its parent element that visibly utilizes the 
namespace prefix does not have a namespace node in the node-set with the 
same namespace prefix and value as N.
