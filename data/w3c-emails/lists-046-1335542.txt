As an aside, this xmlns="" problem when inserting an XML fragment into 
another instance is similar to the problems we discovered with xml:lang, 
xml:base, and xml:space [1]. Applications need to take care of of these 
sorts of attributes at the boundary of any subsetting and insertions... 
I've already added Merlin's proposed text to xenc for consideration, shoud 
we also add a line to [1]?

The XML being canonicalized may depend on the effect of xml namespace 
attributes, such as xml:lang, xml:space, and xml:base appearing in ancestor 
nodes. To avoid problems due to the non-importation of such attributes into 
an enveloped document subset, either they must be explicitly given in the 
apex nodes of the XML document subset being canonicalized or they must 
always be declared with an equivalent value in every context in which the 
XML document subset will be interpreted.
nt subset will be interpreted.
