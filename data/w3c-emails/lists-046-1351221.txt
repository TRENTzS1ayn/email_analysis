4.3.1 The CanonicalizationMethod Element
...
 The way in which the SignedInfo element is presented to the
   canonicalization method is dependent on that method. The following
   applies to algorithms which process XML as nodes or characters:
     * XML based canonicalization implementations MUST be provided with a
       [XPath] node-set originally formed from the document
       containing the SignedInfo and currently indicating the SignedInfo,
       its descendants, and the attribute and namespace nodes of
       SignedInfo and its descendant elements.
     * Text based canonicalization algorithms (such as CRLF and charset
       normalization) should be provided with the UTF-8 octets that
       represent the well-formed SignedInfo element, from the first
       character to the last character of the XML representation,
       inclusive. This includes the entire text of the start and end tags
       of the SignedInfo element as well as all descendant [187]markup
       and character data (i.e., the text) between those tags. Use
       of text based canonicalization of SignedInfo is NOT RECOMMENDED.
