http://www.w3.org/ -- 24 March, 1998 -- The World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) today announced the release of  Cascading Style Sheets, level 2
(CSS2), as a W3C Proposed Recommendation. The W3C Cascading Style Sheets
and Formatting Properties (CSS&FP) Working Group has determined that the
CSS2 specification is stable, contributes to Web interoperability, is
supported for industry-wide adoption, and is ready to enter the review
and voting process by the W3C Membership.

W3C Process

Specifications developed within W3C working groups must be formally
approved by the Membership. Consensus is reached after a specification
has proceeded through the following review stages: Working Draft,
Proposed Recommendation, and Recommendation.

Stable working drafts are submitted by working groups to the W3C
Director for consideration as a Proposed Recommendation. Upon the
Director's approval, the document becomes a "Proposed Recommendation",
and is forwarded to the W3C Membership to vote on becoming an official
W3C Recommendation.

The W3C Advisory Committee -- comprised of one official representative
from each Member organization -- submits one of the following votes on
the Proposed Recommendation: yes; yes, with comments; no, unless
specified deficiencies are corrected; no, this Proposed Recommendation
should be abandoned.

During this voting period, the Working Group expects to resolve minor
technical issues and communicate its results to the W3C Director. After
this time, the Director will announce the disposition of the document;
it may become a W3C Recommendation (possibly with minor changes), revert
to Working Draft status, or may be dropped as a W3C work item.

The Member voting and review period lasts approximately 6 weeks.


CSS2

Created and developed by the W3C Cascading Style Sheets and Formatting
Properties (CSS&FP) Working Group, CSS2 is a style sheet language which
builds on the widely implemented CSS1 specification.

CSS2 offers precise control over the presentation of Web pages. It adds
improved printing of Web pages, positioned and layered elements,
improved Internationalization, and a rich WebFont model, including
downloadable fonts. CSS2 can also control voice, pitch, stereo position
and other aspects of how Web pages will sound when rendered to speech.

W3C continues to work with its Members, evolving the Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) language to provide even richer stylistic control, and to
ensure consistency of implementation world-wide.

The CSS&FP Working Group includes key industry players such as Adobe,
Bitstream, CWI, Electricit? de France, HP, IBM, Lotus, Macromedia,
Microsoft, NIST, Novell, Silicon Graphics, and SoftQuad as well as
experts in web design, typography, internationalization and document
publishing.

The CSS2 specification has been produced as part of the W3C Style Sheets
Activity, and is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-CSS2

interoperability and promote the evolution of the World Wide Web. It is
an industry consortium jointly run by the MIT Laboratory for Computer
Science (LCS) in the USA, the National Institute for Research in
Computer Science and Control (INRIA) in France and Keio University in
Japan. Services provided by the Consortium include: a repository of
information about the World Wide Web for developers and users; sample
code implementations to embody and promote standards; and various
prototype and sample applications to demonstrate use of new technology.
To date, more than 250 organizations are Members of the Consortium.
