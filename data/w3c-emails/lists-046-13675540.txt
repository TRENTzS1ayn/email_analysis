ARCHITECTURE

- Announcing SiRPAC - Simple RDF Parser & Compiler 

SiRPAC is a practical tool for parsing and compiling RDF/XML documents to
corresponding triples of the underlying RDF data model. This tool has been
developed at the W3C for quick industry adoption of W3C specifications. The
latest version of SiRPAC, V1.2, conforms to the Resource Description
Framework (RDF) Model & Syntax Specification working draft dated 19-Aug-1998
and Namespaces in XML working draft dated 2-Aug-1998.

USER INTERFACE

- Document Object Model [DOM] Level 1 Specification Issued as a Proposed
Recommendation; W3C Member Review Now Underway

The Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 specification defines the foundation
of the Document Object Model, a platform- and language-neutral interface that
will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
structure, and style of documents. The DOM Level 1 provides a standard set of
objects for representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how
these objects can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and    
manipulating them. The DOM Level 1 specification has been developed by the
W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Working Group, consisting of representatives
from W3C Member organizations and invited experts in the fields of Web
browsers, Web servers, authoring tools, and other document processing tools.
The W3C DOM Working Group has determined that the DOM Level 1 specification
is stable, contributes to Web interoperability, and is ready to enter the
review and comment process by the W3C Membership.

- Updated NOTE: Displaying SMIL Basic Layout with CSS

The 15 June Note by Philipp Hoschka and Chris Lilley has been recently

mapping z-index values from SMIL basic layout to CSS.

- XSL First Working Draft released 

The XSL Working Group, which is chartered to create a style language based on
experience with both CSS2 and DSSSL, recently released the first public
working draft of XSL. W3C issued a Press Release and testimonials from W3C
Member organizations. XSL is a language for expressing stylesheets. It
consists of two parts: 

  1.a language for transforming XML documents, and 
  2.an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics. 

An XSL stylesheet specifies the presentation of a class of XML documents by
describing how an instance of the class is transformed into an XML document
thatuses the formatting vocabulary. The XSL Working Group and the CSS&FP
Working Group are working to create a common W3C formatting model which can
be used to underpin all W3C specifications which expose formatting
functionality. These include HTML, MathML and SMIL, plus of course CSS and
XSL, and in the future SVG.
