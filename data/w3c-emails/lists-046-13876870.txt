Dear friend of W3C,

for your information, please find attached the press release on the CSS1
test suite. Through this announcement, we want to help implementors improve
CSS1 support in their products and will enable Web page designers to verify
the quality of CSS1 support in their browsers. This is the first major Test
Suite to come with W3C Recommendations. With it, we want to demonstrate that
we are not only developing specifications, but also providing tools to
encourage implementations. Other tools provided are listed at the end of the
release.

The W3C Team and I are at your service for further questions - please do
contact me at <jdietl@w3.org> or +33 4.92.38.79.72.

Best regards,

Josef Dietl

   [6]http://www.w3.org/ -- 25 January 1999 -- Following its mission to
   lead the evolution of the Web, the World Wide Web Consortium today
   released a [7]test suite for its Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
   language. CSS is a widely supported style sheet language that
   describes how Web documents (e.g., written in HTML or XML) are
   presented on screen, paper, in speech, etc. The CSS1 Test Suite will
   help implementors improve CSS1 support in their products and will
   enable Web page designers to verify the quality of CSS1 support in
   their browsers. Solid CSS support across a variety of browsers will
   encourage authors to use style sheets. The benefits of using style
   sheets include shorter documents, faster downloads, more attractive
   Web pages, more accessible Web pages, and much easier site management.

   As the first Test Suite to accompany a W3C Recommendation, this
   release is also a milestone for W3C, demonstrating that W3C is not
   only developing specifications, but also creating tools for developers
   so as to encourage interoperable implementations of these
   specifications.

   Today's release of the Test Suite covers [8]CSS1, which is the first
   level of CSS. The Test Suite was crafted by Eric Meyer of Case Western
   Reserve University, Tim Boland of NIST, H?kon Lie of W3C, and numerous
   volunteers in the style sheet community. W3C's CSS and FP Working
   Group members contributed significant vendor experience to the Test
   Suite so that it would be a helpful and real-world guide for browser
   developers.

   "Because of significant vendor input, we are expecting to see the
   effects of the test suite in the upcoming generation of browsers. The
   test suite will result in increased interoperability between CSS
   implementations," predicted H?kon Lie, W3C Style Sheets Activity Lead.

   The test suite consists of nearly 100 pages, each of which documents a
   section from the CSS specification. Using words and images, the pages
   describe how the various CSS features should be rendered.

   Other CSS support tools produced by W3C include:
     * The [9]CSS Validator, which allows authors to validate the syntax
       of their style sheets.
     * The [10]W3C Core Styles, a set of attractive sample style sheets
       freely available on the Web, making it easy for authors to start
       using style sheets.

   Through these tools, as well as the HTML Validator, W3C demonstrates
   its commitment to supporting the deployment of technologies defined by
   its Recommendations. As a next step in this direction, work has begun
   on a test suite for [11]CSS2, the latest level of CSS.
