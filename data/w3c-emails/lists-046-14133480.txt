http://www.w3.org/ -- 8 June 2000 -- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
today launches its Australian Office, based at the Australian
government's Cooperative Research Centre for Enterprise Distributed
Systems Technology (DSTC). Bob Hopgood, Head of W3C Offices, and
Jim Elder, Queensland Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development,
are opening the Office at DTSC headquarters at the University of
Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.

Australia's Growing Internet Presence

Australia is the 6th largest country in the world in terms of Internet
usage. Seven million people, or over 35% of the population, is online,
surpassed only by the Untied States, Sweden, and Finland. With a strong
history of innovation and early adoption of new technologies, Australia
is a natural choice for the creation of a W3C Office.

DSTC to Provide W3C Connection for Australia

As a vendor-neutral, active Member of W3C, and with an extensive contact
network and shared objectives for Web development, DSTC meets the
criteria for W3C Office selection.

DSTC has an established reputation in terms of Web technologies with
pioneering work in the use of both XML and RDF, and participates in W3C
Working Groups. Its distributed nature with sites across Australia gives
it the potential for raising awareness across the country as a whole.

W3C looks forward to a long-term partnership with DSTC leading to a
stronger Australian voice within W3C and a greater awareness in
Australia of W3C's Activities. Liz Armstrong of DSTC serves as Head of
the Australian Office.

About W3C Offices

As part of realizing the full potential of the Web, W3C partners with
regional organizations wishing to further W3C's mission. The W3C Offices
assist with promotion efforts in local languages, help broaden W3C's
geographical base, and encourage international participation in W3C
Activities. W3C currently has Offices in Australia, Germany, Greece,
Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Morocco, The Netherlands, Sweden, Taiwan, and
the United Kingdom.

About the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C]

The W3C was created to lead the Web to its full potential by developing
common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its
interoperability. It is an international industry consortium jointly run
by the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT LCS) in the USA, the
National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA)
in France and Keio University in Japan. Services provided by the
Consortium include: a repository of information about the World Wide Web
for developers and users, and various prototype and sample applications
to demonstrate use of new technology. To date, over 420 organizations
are Members of the Consortium. For more information see http://www.w3.org/
