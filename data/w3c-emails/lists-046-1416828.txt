Hi,

1: I would like to use the way Merlin described in his last mail (the XPath 
expressions select nodes in the input DOCUMENT, but we can only "unionize" 
nodes which have already been in the input NODESET). If this transform type 
comes as a first transform, not many things will change. I think it's a 
good way that a transform cannot re-include nodes which have been omitted 
by previous ones. So I vote: yes (option 2)

2: I think it's an absolute must-have that multiple 
union/subtract/intersect 'steps' can be combined in a single ds:Transform. 
If we force that only one single step can be placed into a single 
ds:Transform, it would make very ugly tweaks necessary in my software if I 
want to optimize multiple steps in a single transformation. This grouping 
should be possible regardless of how the working group descides on the 
above issue. So I vote: a strong yes

3: I did not really understood the algorithm Merlin described, but if he 
sees a way how implementors can make some "tree-labeling" and only a single 
traversal over the tree, this seems very cool.


Regards,
Christian
