I believe that I've unilaterally eliminated anybody's choice
in this matter, for which I apologize.

Attached is, probably not as clear as it could be, my
alternative proposal in more explicit language, along with
interop samples.

Note that intersect/subtract are unchanged from before;
there is just the benefit that multiple ops can be done
in a single transform. However; union is different: It
is effectively applied against just the input node set.
You'll see the language in the spec, along with verbiage 
on optimizing N XPath operations into a single sweep
through the document. This also solves the bizarre null
UNION foo from before.

It's late, so I've checked neither the spec nor the
examples for sanity.
