http://www.w3.org/ -- 27 June 2001 -- The World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) announced the publication of two W3C Recommendations: XML Base and
XML Linking Language (XLink). XLink is a way to allow elements to be
inserted into XML documents in order to create and describe links
between resources, whether internal or external to the original
document. XML Base provides a way to indicate the URI base for linking
in XML documents.

A W3C Recommendation indicates that a specification is stable and
contributes to Web interoperability. W3C Recommendations have been
reviewed by the W3C membership, who are in favor of supporting its
adoption by academic, industry, and research communities.

XLink Provides Flexible Linking for XML

XML application developers are eager to have both the basic hyperlinking
capabilities of HTML, and a range of further capabilities appropriate to
XML documents, including links that can point to multiple resources,
collections of links separate from the resources that they connect, and an
attribute-based link declaration syntax which doesn't interfere with
users' decisions about XML document vocabulary.

XLink supports not only traditional, or simple, links familiar from
HTML, but also extended links. Extended links may be used to connect two
or more resources via a single link, which need not be contained within
any of them. This makes it possible to associate metadata or other
supplemental information with resources without editing them. XLink also
supports richer information about link types and the roles of each
resource that an XLink connects.

XML Base Provides Proven Approach for Base URI Services in XML

One of the requirements of XLink was to support the way HTML 4 provides
linking capabilities in a more portable way. The HTML "base" element
allows authors to identify the base URI of a document, thus making it
possible for an author to make use of relative URIs for external images,
applets, style sheets, and other resources, without compromising
portability. XML Base provides that same functionality for XML
applications, including XLink. As it has been written as a module, it
may be reused or referenced by other applications.

XLink, XML Base Add Depth and Power to XML Family

Together, XLink and XML Base bring the functionality necessary for
robust, rich XML applications spread across multiple documents. W3C's
current work in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) relies on XLink to be
able to reference and display other XML languages, such as XHTML or
MathML.

W3C continues its work in developing the specifications which are core
to an extensible, stable Web architecture. Other Working Groups within
W3C are developing XML technologies that deliver graphics, multimedia,
document transformation, and other essential formats and functions. Both
XLink and XML Base enhance and extend these XML applications and lay the
foundation for future work.

XML Linking Working Group Brings Together Key Developers, IT Leaders

The XML Linking Working Group, which produced both W3C Recommendations,
consists of invited experts from the research community and information
technology leaders from AOL/Netscape Communications; Arbortext;
eBusiness Technologies; Fujitsu; Jamcracker; Metacode; Microsoft
Corporation; Sun Microsystems; and Yomu Corporation.

About the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C]

The W3C was created to lead the Web to its full potential by developing
common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its
interoperability. It is an international industry consortium jointly run
by the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT LCS) in the USA, the
National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA)
in France and Keio University in Japan. Services provided by the
Consortium include: a repository of information about the World Wide Web
for developers and users, and various prototype and sample applications
to demonstrate use of new technology. To date, over 510 organizations
are Members of the Consortium. For more information see
