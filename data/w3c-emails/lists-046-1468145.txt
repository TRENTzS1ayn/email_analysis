Awesome Merlin! I've placed it at:
  http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-filter2/Overview.html
(Contains a *few* editorial tweaks (e.g., adding an XPointer reference) but 
otherwise made good sense on a quick read through.)

I'm happy to update the interop matrix but I then need to remove the 
present sets and reports; I'm sad to loose the sign-xfdl.xml example for 
the performance profile, so a new version of that would be useful.
