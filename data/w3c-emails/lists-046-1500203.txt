Hi Joseph,

The interop examples, including the one for XFDL, need only be reworked.  Is there some reason to delete any of them?

Also, the syntax in 3.2 and the examples in Section 4 will have to be changed, right?

Thanks,
John Boyer

Awesome Merlin! I've placed it at:
  http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-filter2/Overview.html
(Contains a *few* editorial tweaks (e.g., adding an XPointer reference) but 
otherwise made good sense on a quick read through.)

I'm happy to update the interop matrix but I then need to remove the 
present sets and reports; I'm sad to loose the sign-xfdl.xml example for 
the performance profile, so a new version of that would be useful.
