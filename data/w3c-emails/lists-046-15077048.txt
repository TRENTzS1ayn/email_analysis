Hungary's Internet Presence, Industry is Growing

Hungarian economy shows the most dynamic and attractive growth in the
region, especially with respect to information technology and
telecommunication. Multinational companies increasingly establish their
research and development centers in Hungary. This is accompanied by a
strong local IT industry, and a multitude of SMEs (Small and Medium
sized Enterprises), which is arguably the most exciting development of
contemporary Hungarian economy. As a result, Budapest is currently
growing into a major IT center and significant market in Central Europe.

The Hungarian Government recognized the significance of the Internet
relatively early. In 1987, in cooperation with the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences, it launched the first program to establish an information
infrastructure for the entire Hungarian R&D and academic community. In
doing so, Hungary was at the forefront of the development in the entire
region. Today, Web adoption in Hungary is strong. Exciting new
developments, Web applications, services are born every day, bearing
witness of a top-level local development community. For these reasons
and others, Hungary is an ideal site for a new W3C Office.

SZTAKI to Provide W3C Connection and Outreach in Hungary

As a vendor-neutral, active Member of W3C, MTA SZTAKI matches the
requirements of a W3C Office. It is a state owned research Institute in
the field of information technology and networking. MTA SZTAKI is a
member of W3C since 1995, so it is already familiar with the structure
and the activities of W3C.

SZTAKI has well-established co-operations with leading institutions and
firms covering different areas of Information Technology, Computer
Science and Control. The Institute maintains more than 100 contracts
yearly with industrial, governmental, and other partners, including
joint projects with European Union funding. Several successful digital
artistic projects were carried out using different World Wide Web
technologies, shown in national and international exhibitions for
digital art.

W3C looks forward to a long-term partnership with SZTAKI, leading to a
stronger Hungarian voice within W3C and a greater awareness in Hungary
of W3C's Activities. Dr. L?szl? Kov?cs of SZTAKI serves as the Manager
of the W3C Office in Hungary; ?va Megyaszai serves as the Coordinator of
the Office.
