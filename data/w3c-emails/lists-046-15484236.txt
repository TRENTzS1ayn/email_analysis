Five years ago this week, the World Wide Web Consortium first published
Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as a W3C Recommendation.

By bringing a method for creating structured documents and data for the
Web - XML has had a revolutionary impact on the Web and the IT Industry.

XML serves as the foundation for a host of languages and applications,
including these developed at W3C:

* Graphics (Scalable Vector Graphics - SVG)
* Voice Dialogs (VoiceXML)
* Semantic Web Foundations (Resource Description Framework -
  RDF)
    * Web Services and Security (SOAP, WSDL, XML Signature,
     XML Encryption..)
* Privacy (Platform for Privacy Preferences - P3P)
* Synchronized Multimedia (SMIL)
* Mathematical Notation (MathML)
* Device Independence (XHTML)
* Web Accessibility (The XML Accessibility Guidelines)

The expansion of the XML Family of technologies has provided independent
developers and b2b intergrators alike with a toolkit that gives them the
power to develop their own vocabularies and applications that can grow
with their developing needs and requirements, and with the promise of
interoperability.

original engineers of XML, please contact Janet Daly, janet@w3.org, +1
