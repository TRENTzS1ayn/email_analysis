Hi All, 

i have a silly question

you receive (via HTTP ) a document that contains that
PublicKey (signed by the corresponding PrivateKey by
me) then, How can you be able to infer that I signed
the document and no body else modified the document in
between and they signed it.

thanks and regards
Jeong Ahn
