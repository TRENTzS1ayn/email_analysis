Hi...

I don't see any traffic in the archive
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/
but poked around and found that a few people
are subscrbed, and I gather from the group home page
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/
that introductions are in order.

The official blurb on me is...

[[[
Dan Connolly, Technical Staff

        Dan Connolly is the leader of the XML Activity. He
        began contributing to the World Wide Web project,
        and in particular, the HTML specification, while
        developing hypertext production and delivery
        software in 1992.

        He presented a draft of HTML 2.0 at the first Web
        Conference in 1994 in Geneva, and served as editor
        until it became a Proposed Standard RFC in November
        1995.

        He was the chair of the W3C Working Group that
        produced HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0, and collaborated
        with Jon Bosak to form the W3C XML Working Group
        and produce the W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation.

        Dan received a B.S. in Computer Science from the
        University of Texas at Austin in 1990. His research
        interest is investigating the value of formal
        descriptions of chaotic systems like the Web,
        especially in the consensus-building process.

The RDF Core WG seems very near to my research interest:
RDF is a formal description mechanism (or at least: I hope
it will be soon ;-) and this group is chartered to broaden
the consensus around it.

I'm not exactly sure how much time I'll be devoting
to participation directly in this WG, but as
a Semantic Web hacker and an armchair logician,
I'm *very* interested in the outcome of a number
of items on the issues list.

More on those separately... I'm not sure my
subscription request has been processed, so I'm
not sure this message will get to you right away.
When I see this in the archive, perhaps I'll
start in with my positions on a few of the issues.
