Thanks DanC for kicking this off an getting us started.

My name is Brian McBride and I've been technical staff in
HPLabs in Bristol, England for about 5 years.  I have a home
page http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/bwm/.

I've been working with RDF for about a year now.  I've built a
SQL based triple store and an implementation of the Jena Java
API for RDF, which can be found off my home page.

I've really enjoyed the discussions over technical issues with
RDF over the past year, but have been frustrated that we haven't
had the mechanism to officially resolve the issues that have
arisen.  So I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to 
contribute to this working group.

We have some interesting challenges to address, which
include:

  o making RDF easier to understand and more accessible to the
    development community

  o providing a specification with sufficient precision to support
    the development of formal systems, such as those discussed on the
    www-rdf-logic@w3.org mailing list.

  o relating RDF to other XML standards such as XML

  o resolving some hard technical problems

I'm looking forward to it.

Brian
