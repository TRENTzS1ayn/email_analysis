Sounds good, certainly the idea of 'executable specification'.
It reminds me about ISO Standard Prolog (see e.g. the INRIA
ISO Prolog web at http://pauillac.inria.fr/~hodgson/prolog/ )
where the executable specification (the ftp package is at
ftp://ftp-lifo.univ-orleans.fr/pub/Users/eddbali/SdProlog/ )
is a specific implementation of Standard Prolog.
So, all concepts which are implementation defined, implementation
dependent or undefined have received some interpretation.
It's mainly that last point that I wanted to stress, although it
must be possible to write such an executable specification in N3.

Brian, is that informal experiment using an attribute grammar
with an XSLT implementation the one at
http://www.bmcb.btinternet.co.uk/2001/rdf/exec-grammar/spec.xsl ?
