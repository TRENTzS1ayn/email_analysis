Brian,

I fully appreciate the desire, and need, to keep the work items within 
well-managed bounds.

My comments about N3 were based, in part, on my attempts to articulate an 
application (CC/PP) that uses RDF -- I feel that the XML form of 
presentation was very difficult to read for someone not already familiar 
with RDF principles.

But, as you imply, that is not directly a problem for the RDFcore WG, and 
I'll concur that it should not be an assumed activity... unless we find it 
needed or helpful to achieve the group's chartered goals.

...

As for "executable specification", I'm currently unconvinced.  Not opposed, 
just not yet convinced.  I have a feeling that computer-interpretable 
specifications don't often make good human-interpretable 
specifications.  RDF-in-XML being a case in point.  But I'm not religious 
about this and I promise I will listen to any ideas with an open mind.

...

And finally, I think there has been something happening on the RDF-logic 
list recently that hasn't yet made it to the issues list (that I'm aware of 
-- I must re-check the issues list).  This is the relationship between RDF 
and formal semantics, if indeed RDF is to have a formal semantics.  I'm not 
quite sure how to phrase this as an "RDF issue", but I guess I must now 
take a shot at it:

"""
RDF semantics.

Does RDF, of itself, have a formal semantics?  Or is it so general that a 
formal semantics serves little useful purpose?

GK has suggested [<link to my original message>] that it may be sufficient 
and more appropriate to regard RDF as an "abstract syntax", and RDF schema 
as the first steps of a "theory", without trying to ascribe a specific 
formal semantics to the RDF core.  This would then leave the field clear 
for further developments and RDF applications to define required 
"semantics" within a an abstract framework for processing of RDF statements.
"""

Another way to lodge this on the issues list would be to fish out the 
relevant postings from Pat Hayes, Peter F. Patel-Schneider, Drew McDermott 
(and others?)
