Hello!

My name is Pierre Richard and I'm a new member of the RDFCore WG.
I have been working on blahML since 1987, starting at the TJ Watson IBM
research where I wrote YASP, the first full-featured SGML Parser.

My interest in Markup Languages started while working at the ISO WG8 group,
SGML but also DSSSL.  Since, I have conceived and developped many core
technologies applications (XML, XSLT, Java) for the companies I worked with.

I'm currently responsible for XML technologies at Brience Inc. in San
Francisco
and I'm working on several projects for content recognition and
transformation.

Even if I am new to RDF, I feel it already as the missing piece of the
puzzle:
ways for "labelling" content.  My goals in working with this group is to try
to keep the specs enough simple so to be "applicable".

Pierre.
