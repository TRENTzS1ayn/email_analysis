I'm Frank Manola.  I've been on the technical staff at MITRE Corporation
for just under a year, with prior stints at Object Services and
Consulting (a small virtual corporation), GTE Laboratories, Computer
Corporation of America, and the US Naval Research Laboratory.  

My background is in database research, distributed object and agent
systems, and most recently trying to merge these technologies into the
Web environment.  This has involved looking at RDF, and how to both use
it, and relate it to other approaches for representing various kinds of
metadata.  I'm currently working on a project developing Semantic Web
technologies, and have been closely following the discussions on the
rdf-interest and rdf-logic email lists.  I'm looking forward to making
the RDF specification a suitable base for the more sophisticated
applications that these lists have been talking about.
