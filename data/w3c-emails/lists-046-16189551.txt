Hi all, Jan here:

I've been working at the ILRT (DanBri's officemate) for about two years
now. Looking over the issues list again, it all looks frighteningly
familiar - there are things here I've been complaining about for about
that long; time to do something about it, I think!

I tend to oscillate between concerns about formalism and keeping an eye
on potential applications.

Apart from that: hobbyist mathematician and language lawyer; I might
also claim the dubious honour of "longest time working with RDF without
being able to make sense of the serialisation" - pictures being worth a
thousand angle-brackets. :-/
