Short bio:

70s: Wrote image processing programs for mainframes and PDPs
80s: Wrote solid modelling software for PCs and Macs
90s: Managed intranets, extranets and ISO 9000 for a big CAD company
00s: Programming again: now working on metadata-based content management 
     systems.

In my spare time I tinker with HTML, graphics and such with a bit of
astronomy and writing on the side.

I'm new to RDF and related technologies and just trying to consume all
the background material is taking up all my available time.
I'm not new to the problems of structured information transfer (I guess 
I've gone through 2-d and 3-d to n-d and the brink of chaos during my 
career); so anything I can do to help smooth the path to the Semantic 
Web is my pleasure.
