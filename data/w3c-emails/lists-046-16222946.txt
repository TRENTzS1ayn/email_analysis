Hi,

I am the co-editor of the original RDF M+S spec and a member of both earlier
RDF WGs. I was a visiting fellow at W3C (at MIT) in 1996-1997, now Nokia's
representative to the W3C AC and a member of the W3C AB.

At Nokia, I am a Research Fellow at the Nokia Research Center (NRC) as well
as the Chief Scientist for Nokia Venture Partners (a $650M venture capital
fund). I founded NRC's Agent Technology group in 1998 and ran it until the
end of 2000. I have now returned to actually doing research (as opposed to
managing people who do research).

I also represent Nokia in the DARPA Agent Markup Language program (DAML),
including the Joint US/EU Committee on Agent Markup Languages (aka "Joint
Committee") and the DAML-Process subgroup (working on modeling web service
semantics using DAML).

In my previous life I was a Project Manager at CMU Robotics Institute
(working on large-scale logistics scheduling and frame-based representation)
and a Research Scientist at Helsinki University of Technology (working on
production scheduling and frame-based representation systems).

My home page is at http://www.lassila.org/

Looking forward to fixing some bugs in the RDF spec(s). Generally I am
fairly happy with RDF as it is and do not advocate any major surgery (the
patient is not dead and is not even bleeding very badly :-).

Kind regards,

- Ora
