Certainly an RDF usability and adoption issue, in my experience.

In hopes of backlink services, I'll use the name
Brian just gave to this issue:
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qnames-as-attrib-values

The particular solution you propose does break some things, I think...

As I recall from participation in the former RDF M&S WG,
the reason was mostly "we're not sure how that's going to
work in other XML specs, so let's not do in in RDF yet."

That reason has been overtaken by events: XSLT and XML Schema
use qnames in attribute values.

Quite.

No; it would be ambiguous. But I'm interested in
adding new attributes that take qname values.

One cannot.

One must use different attribute names.

I suggest, instead:

    <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/18-rdf-with-qnames#"
             xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#"
             xmlns:eg="http://www.example.org/Set">
      <rdf:Description rdf:aboutQ="eg:Set">
        <rdf:type rdf:resourceQ="rdfs:Class"/>
        <rdfs:subclassOf rdf:resourceQ="rdfs:Container"/>
      </rdf:Description>
    </rdf:RDF>

things I changed

  1. the namespace name. This isn't RDF 1.0 syntax.
  It's convertable to RDF 1.0 syntax (using XSLT;
  we should provide a transformation if we persue this)
  but it's not RDF 1.0 syntax.

  We might conceivably replace RDF 1.0 syntax with this
  syntax, pretending RDF 1.0 syntax never existed,
  but (a) I doubt we will, and (b) until we do,
  it's useful to keep them separate.
  (cf my "namespace squatting: please don't" message
to www-rdf-interest a while ago)

  2. <rdf:type resource="..."> -> <rdf:type rdf:resource="...">
  If you think that the XML Namespace spec specifies
  that these are equivalent, read it again.
     cf. http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion
  I intend to elaborate on this separately...

  3. rdf:about -> rdf:aboutQ
(for lack of a better name).
  We can specify (using, e.g. XML Schema) that this
  takes a qname value. More on using XML Schemas
  to specify RDF syntax separately...
