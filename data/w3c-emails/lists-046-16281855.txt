... and it's not as if there's a shortage of namespace names, eh?

I agree... that was careless of me.

I considered something like this, but wanted to focus on the core idea.

Thought:  using a different namespace and XSLT transformation, maybe 
there's no need to be absolutely conformant to the current 1.0 spec:  in 
"-rdf-with-qnames#" one might say that the attribute value syntax was (say) 
like N3:
     about="prefix:local"
     about="<http://www.example.org/>"

Just a thought.
