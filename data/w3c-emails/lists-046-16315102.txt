Hi,

I have been working for HP as a Visiting Scientist at the W3C 
(MIT) since May, 2000.  I am part of the W3C's Semantic Web 
development team and I am joining the WG as a W3C Team member.

I am interested in building distributed, "smart" applications 
and RDF appears to be a good framework for such systems.  I have 
written two RDF-based services (one is based on SiRPAC and 
the other is based on Jena).  Since I must maintain these systems
as well as the W3C's SiRPAC parser, I am particularly sensitive 
to changes to the specs that will break tools and applications
that are based on M&S 1.0 and the Schema CR.

The issues list (http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/) is
quite large and continues to grow.  I hope the WG can address 
the critical issues in a timely fashion so that we can get on 
with the business of building new, inter-operable applications.

I am looking forward to working with you all.

Art Barstow
