I'd much prefer that the chairs pick a few issues to work
on each week, including this week; and that we resolve
one or two of them at each teleconference, including the
first one, 27Apr.

Let's not spend group time classifying the issues.
I'm happy to delegate that to the chairs
(or folks they want to delegate the task to).

I don't see any mention of test cases in your list.
I hope resolution of each issue takes the form of
a test case.

I hope/expect that test cases will be the core
of our work; for each telcon, I'd like to see
two or three test cases on the agenda; the group
should discuss the test cases and decide their
disposition.

Absolutely!

Yes!

That's all good stuff I'm happy for the chairs to do;
you just tell us which issues are open for discussion,
and we (individually) develop test cases that make
them black-and-white; then when an issue has
been captured in a test case, the chairs should put
the question to the group about which test cases
are deemed to succeed and which ones fail.

Again, I don't see test cases.

I propose that one of the first issues we tackle is
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion
because it impacts lots of running code that I've run
into, and because there's a test case in the www-rdf-comments
archive.

Perhaps it's worth extracting that test case so that
folks can GET it individually with their tools; and perhaps
we need a few more test cases to fully capture the issue.
But I hope that in the 27Apr telcon, we can decide the
disposition of the tests around that issue or some
issue similarly ripe.
