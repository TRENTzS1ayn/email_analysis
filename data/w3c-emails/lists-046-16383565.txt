Mike Dean has made a nice test case for reification at
http://www.daml.org/2001/04/reification/

[although I think that the n3.rdf should look more like

<!--     using base file:/daml/reification/n3.n3-->

isn't it?]

BTW I'm very much in favor of that kind of RDF
(in a new namespace)

Subject:  Re: RDF changes
This sounds like a sensible idea to me.  It would be a useful rough
classification of the issues, along the lines Brian suggested earlier.
For one thing, a formal semantics of just the triple model should be a
relatively straightforward exercise (e.g., using those developed for
DAML+OIL).  It would also be worthwhile to get a more detailed picture
of which existing uses of RDF would be disturbed by which changes.  For
example, how much do existing implementations use reification, and
exactly how do they use it?
