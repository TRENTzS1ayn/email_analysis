Good point.

OK.  Can we also take a look at:

 
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-reification-required

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-empty-property-elements

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-resource-semantics

the last of which is a step towards a more formal core model.
