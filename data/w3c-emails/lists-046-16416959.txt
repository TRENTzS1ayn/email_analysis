That sounds like a good approach.  There has also been past discussion
on rdf-interest about separating model and XML syntax.  Would it make
sense to define a core in terms of graphs, with a simple triple syntax
suitable for formalization.  Then the RDF XML syntax can be defined in
terms of a translation to the simple triple syntax, and so can any
other syntax.

Yes.

I'm hopeful that we can restructure the specifications and the
conceptual
model of RDF along the lines you suggest, without breaking so far from
the current specifications that we would want to rename it, or even
changing the namespace for that matter.
