Yes, sorry - I should have checked with a parser (!) before I sent
it.  Just to repeat, the above was example #2 of what would be allowed
since the Description element was impliclity in the RDF namespace
(with the correction above) and the about attribute could therefore
be interpreted.

(Again using the IETF words for requirement levels from RFC 2119
 http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt.  I propose we use these.)

Deprecation is a stronger alternative to what I proposed but I would
support that as an alternative change.  Something like this:

  In RDF 1.1 namespaced attributes MUST be accepted on input and MUST
  be emitted on output.  Non-namespaced attributes MUST be accepted
  on input but MUST NOT be emitted.  In the next version of the
  syntax, non-namespaced attributes SHALL be rejected RDF 1.1 input.

I have similar tests I used for Rapier to make sure I got this
support working but I also did some adhoc checking with other parsers
and found inconsistencies.  Some more strict ones took the grammar
literally and forbid rdf:resource etc. (this is from memory) which is
a valid interpretation of the spec, if you ignore the M&S examples
which use rdf:about :-)
