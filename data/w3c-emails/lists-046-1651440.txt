I missed the earlier announce I suppose, but I'm cc:ing this call to the 
xmldsig and xenc lists. Both of those specs are dependent on XML1.0 and I 
haven't considered the 1.1 spec closely enough to understand if xmldsig and 
xenc could also work with 1.1 . I hope to think about it more carefully and 
that others in the WG will do the same! <smile/>
