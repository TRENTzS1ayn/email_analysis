Hi,

We discussed:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion

at a Team meeting and we propose:

1. The grammar in section 6. of the M&S spec:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#grammar

 should be changed so that all of the RDF attributes (e.g. about,
 resource, etc.) are qualified with a RDF namespace.

2. Text along the lines of the following should be added to the M&S spec:

  [[
    All elements and attributes in RDF must be namespace qualified
  ]]

Among the reasons for this position:

o It is a myth that unqualified attributes inherit the namespace of
 their enclosing element.   See the Namespace Myths, particularly
 Myth #4:

   http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/03/08/namespaces/index.html?page=2

o XPath support is becoming more pervasive and by using it, finding
 qualified attributes is fairly easy

o Search engines (such as google) would have trouble following pointers
 from one RDF document to another and a simple XPath expression to find
 pointers would help them without having to process all of RDF

o Prefixed attributes work today with most of the deployed code
