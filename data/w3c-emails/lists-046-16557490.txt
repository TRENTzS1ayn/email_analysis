Art,

Thanks for this.  Its good to provide a rationale.  I suggest it would
be good practice for us to try to provide a written rationale for all
the decisions that we make.

The main difference I see between this proposal and the earlier one is
the handling of legacy.

The m&s grammar is clear; attributes such as ID, about etc are
unqualified.  Both proposals suggest that this is changed to require
qualified attributes.

If the grammar were changed as in this proposal, all strictly conforming
RDF 1.0 would not be legal RDF 1.1 (well maybe you could argue that its
legal, but it wouldn't mean the right thing).

The earlier proposal mandates that an RDF 1.1 processor will process 
'correct' RDF 1.0 correctly.  This proposal leaves that decision up to
the implementor.

Do we have any good reasons for preferring one approach to the other?

Will this change impact existing data and specifications based on RDF?

Brian
