this is what I (currently) think about some issues up for discussion:

-> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion
   all of the RDF attributes are qualified with a RDF namespace

-> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-quoting
   introduce rdf:parseType="Quote"
   testcase http://www.agfa.com/w3c/rdf/mn3.rdf
   -> Jena and Sirpac as if rdf:parseType="Literal"; what about the others?

-> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-empty-property-elements
   the value is the empty literal
