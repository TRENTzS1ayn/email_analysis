Hi,

My name is Eric Miller and I'm the Semantic Web Activity Lead for the W3C.

Before joining the W3C, I was a Senior Research Scientist at OCLC Online 
Computer Library Center, Inc. and the co-founder and Associate Director of 
the The Dublin Core Metdata Initiative.  Additionally my responsibilities 
included chairing the W3C's RDF Model and Syntax and Schema working groups 
and in helping shape (along with I'm pleased to say, several people on this 
list... and you know you you are :) RDF into what it is today; the 
foundation of the Semantic Web.

I very much am looking forward to working with all of you to help ensure 
this foundation supports the weight of the future work in the Semantic Web.
