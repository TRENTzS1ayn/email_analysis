Thanks for a very relaxing introduction to W3C. Not difficult at all.

I was so impressed that all the technology worked that I wasn't too
surprised 
that I fell off IRC towards the end and may have missed something.

So to confirm:

I'd like to take the issue:

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-resource-semantics

..and to be at least the editor for:
     
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdf-terminologicus


If anyone has anything to contribute on these two points, please do.
Unfortunately, I shall be away from the office until next Thursday; so
please 
excuse the mysterious silence and lack of response.

M
