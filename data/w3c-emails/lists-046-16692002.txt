With a lot of people being in Hong Kong next week, I propose that we
hold our next phone conference in two weeks at:

  10:00:00 Fri May 11 2001 in America/New_York

which according to:

  http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc

converts to:

  15:00:00 Fri May 11 2001 in Europe/London
  23:00:00 Fri May 11 2001 in Asia/Tokyo
