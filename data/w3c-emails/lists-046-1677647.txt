More specific comments upon reading it more closely:

[[The first character of a Name must be a NameStartChar, but any other 
characters are NameChars; this mechanism is used to prevent names from 
beginning with Latin (ASCII) digits or with basic combining characters.]]

I never understood this discrimination against numbers and wonder if there 
was much demand to finally permit them and it was decided against? (Or 
where did this constraint come from in the first place?)

[[In order to be well-formed, all XML parsed entities (including document 
entities ) must be fully normalized as per the definition of [Charmod] 
supplemented by the following definitions of relevant constructs for XML:]]

Note that "[Charmod]" links to

[[Change "1.0" everywhere to "1.1"]]

FYI: Canonical XML does not emit a version in the presumption that a 
version-less instance is 1.0 . I see nothing here that conflicts with that 
understanding. Additionally, xmldsig and xenc are firmly rooted in XML 1.0, 
so any subsequent comments apply to whether new versions of those 
specifications would have any particular problems with XML1.1 as specified.

[[2.13 Normalization Checking [NEW] ]

No problem here, most all xmldsig and xenc processing recommends the input 
to be in normalized form. "the XML processor used to prepare the XPath data 
model input is required (by the Data Model) to use Normalization Form C 
[NFC, NFC-Corrigendum] when converting an XML document to the UCS character 
domain from any encoding that is not UCS-based (currently, UCS-based 
encodings include UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE, UCS-2, and 
UCS-4)." [c14n]

[[2.3 Common Syntactic Constructs]]

With respect to line-end and white-space characters, no forms of c14n would 
likely to want to canonicalize these as well. (For example, the Attribute 
node serialization [2]).

[2] http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n
Attribute Nodes- a space, the node's QName, an equals sign, an open 
quotation mark (double quote), the modified string value, and a close 
quotation mark (double quote). The string value of the node is modified by 
replacing all ampersands (&) with &amp;, all open angle brackets (<) with 
&lt;, all quotation mark characters with &quot;, and the whitespace 
characters #x9, #xA, and #xD, with character references. The character 
references are written in uppercase hexadecimal with no leading zeroes (for 
example, #xD is represented by the character reference &#xD;).
