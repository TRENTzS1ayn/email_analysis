This is the DOM Working Group last call review for the Exclusive XML
Canonicalization specification [1].

After reviewing the XML Events draft, the DOM Working Group has one concern
regarding XML Base. According to the current draft, xml:base attributes
are ommitted. This can lead to a wrong interpretation of the URIs inside
the document subset.

The DOM Working Group is planning to add an option "format-exclusive-canonical"
in its Load and Save draft [2]. We don't plan to have support for XPath nodes
set serialization on the other hand, only for a DOM node. As a side comment,
for performance reason, it is important for us to include the context only when
it is utilized.

I apologize for being late in sending these comments,

Philippe,
DOM WG Chair
