Hi Rich, we are on the very cusp (I hope this week) of getting IESG 
approval and moving forward. Consequently, the only tweaks we've accepted 
since we entered PR are those that don't upset *any* person, previous 
concensus, instances, or implementations: just small tweaks that  make the 
spec better in everyone's eyes.

To implement your proposal we'd have two options:
1. Add the following to the two element definitions that would then permit 
xml:space and xml:lang
  <anyAttribute namespace="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"/> 
2. Or to enable xml:space but preclude xml:lang:
  <xsd:import namespace="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" 
    schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd"/>
    ...
     <xsd:attribute ref="xml:space" use="optional"/>

I don't see either violating my threshold of slipping it in if others think 
this is a good idea and no one objects. (The first is better IMHO.)

However, if you did this, wouldn't this also preserve the whitespace 
between the ds:Object and the ext:Foo? I'd think that if you're worried 
about the whitespace in ext:Foo, it should have the xml:space, not 
necessarily the ds:Object?
