Apache does ;-))

for (int i = 0;
     i < sig.getSignedInfo().getSignedContentLength();
     i++) {
   System.out.println("--- Signed Content number "+i+"follows ---");
   System.out.println(
      new String(
         sig.getSignedInfo().getSignedContentItem(i)));
}

One (in my opinion big) problem is the following: If I signed some Nodes 
inside a document, the result from de-referencing this is (due to the 
nature of a Reference) a canonicalized NodeSet which means that I only have 
a byte[] array and no longer a NodeSet. So if an application developer 
wants to know whether a particular Node from a given NodeSet was signed, 
this get's tricky cause the software must keep track of all References and 
their NodeSets prior to the last c14n...

Regards,
Christian
