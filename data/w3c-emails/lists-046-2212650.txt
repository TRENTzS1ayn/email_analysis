Ok, I recall that Merlin did object to the level of specificity (comma 
seperated) but even then noted the need for a "token" to represent the 
default namespace nodes. I don't think "" is sufficient with a whitespace 
delimited list because then its awkward to specify, for example, n1 and "" 
: "n1   " . I'm not sure where we lost the default namespace (anyone else 
recall?) but we need to account for it again. Do we coin a token, go back 
to John's commas, or something else? (Merlin?)
