I agree that the schema should be extended to allow somthing like this:

<ds:Object xml:space="preserve"> <a> 
<dontEvenThinkToIndentThatYouBadProcessor />
   <dontTouchMySurroundingSpaces />
</a>


</ds:Object>

Yes, that should (or even must?) be allowed. People should be able to 
protect their ds:Signatures agains wild'n'mad processors who want to 
beautify/indent every XML 'document' they process.

I don't think that this has (negative) security implications, it'll even 
give Signatures to chance to be more stable - especially when you from SOAP 
folks and pipes of SOAP processors doing wild things with the msgs.
