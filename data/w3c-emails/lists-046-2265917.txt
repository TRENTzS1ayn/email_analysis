Hi Joseph,

I objected (and still object) to the algorithm specifying an encoding for
the namespaces parameter when logically it is just a set. I would rather
the encoding be placed down in section 4 (editor's draft) where the
algorithm URI and encoding when used with XLDSIG is described. The
description of the algorithm just needs a set of namespace prefixes
(where a token exists to indicate the default namespace).

As for what encoding to use, I would advocate the encoding that XSLT
already uses, which is whitespace separated namespace prefixes with
#default to indicate the default namespace.

I apologize that I'm coming into this discussion late; I've had low
connectivity during the move.
