I agree with Brian about that this is a good solution if the schema is 
_not_ tweaked.

I am no schema crack, but if the dsig schema cannot be overwritten in a way 
that an application re-defined a ds:Object to contain only Elements (so 
that xml:space would be important for direct ds:Object/text() children, 
then the application developer can put the xml:space='preserve' into every 
element child of the ds:Object:

<ds:Object>
<custom:Elem1 xml:space="preserve"> ... </custom:Elem1>

     <custom:Elem2 xml:space="preserve"> ... </custom:Elem2>
</ds:Object>
