Dear all,
 We have submitted an internet-draft on the XML encoding of SPKI
 certificates. Our goal with it is to promote a discussion within the
 XML and SPKI community of the subject of XML encoding of SPKI
certificates,
 receive comments and feedback and to further evolve it until we have
 something really solid and agreed upon.
 
 The draft presents an schema in detail for SPKI, and discusses the
 transcoding from and to S-Expressions. We also address some open issues
 that need to be further discussed with the XML and SPKI community.
 
 The draft is available at:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-orri-spki-xml-cert-struc-00.txt
 
 If anyone is interested, I can send individually the .pdf version of
the
 draft (easier to print for those with A4 papersize).
 
 Please don't hesitate asking any questions you might have, sending your
 comments and providing us with your valuable feedback.
 
 Best regards,
 Xavier Orri
 
 ABSTRACT
 This draft suggests a standard form for transforming SPKI
 certificates encoded using S-expressions from and to XML documents.
 We present a XML Schema for the encoding and validation of SPKI
 certificates and other SPKI objects such as sequences and ACLs, and
 discuss different possibilities for the transformation of S-
 expressions into an XML document and vice-versa. The XML Schema is
 based on the "SPKI Certificate Structure" [SPKI].
 
 The main emphasis of this document is on the encoding of all SPKI
 constructs under XML. Additionally, this draft provides a short
 discussion on specific possibilities for the transformation of S-
 expression encoded certificates to and from XML encoded
 certificates. The SPKI Certificate Theory is explained in [RFC2693];
 it is not the intention or the objective of this document to address
 certificate design issues.
