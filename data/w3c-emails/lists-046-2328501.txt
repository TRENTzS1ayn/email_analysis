One minor comment is that for c14n our algorithm URIs are:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#WithComments

Whereas exclusive c14n uses:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#
  http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#WithComments

These are inconsistent in the use of a trailing #. If they
are to remain inconsistent, perhaps section 4 should state
'may use the "WithComments" parameter'.

Another is that the schema uses xmlns:dec; 'dec' seems
unrelated.

Attached is an exclusive c14n example signature of dubious
merit.
