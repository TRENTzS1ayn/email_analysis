Looks good. #WithComments doesn't "preclude" serialization of XML
comments; it enables it or somesuch. And the sentence following
the subsequent example should no longer refer to "foo" or "bar".

Also, in the non-normative implementation method, is the second
condition of the 3.1 iff correct? It seems to me that a namespace
node should only be rendered if it does not appear in ns_rendered.
