I guess I would be the first to jump at anybody who confused
bytes and characters in a dangerous way. But here, one or
the other will lead to the same result, because we are only
looking at both characters as well as bytes with values below
128, and in this case, it doesn't make any difference at all,
due to the properties of UTF-8.
