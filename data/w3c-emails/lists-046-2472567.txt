Hi Gregor,

I'm certainly planning to update the draft. Is there anything you'd like added /
updated?

In terms of progressing the draft to something more formal, I've really been
waiting for
further interest. Can I count you in as an "interested party"?

Best regards. Simon

Joseph,

do you know about any plans to update this expired draft or to progress it
to a more formal one?
