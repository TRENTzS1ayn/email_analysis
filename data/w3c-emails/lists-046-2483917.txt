I apologize for the late reply and hope I didn't hold the draft.

I'm still not entirely convinced that is a good thing to exclude the
xml:base attributes from ancestors if the ancestors are not included
in the set. On the other hand, use cases might show that this issue
is not a real one for Exclusive XML Canonicalization so I'm not
opposed to move the WD forward. The Candidate Recommendation phase
would be the good step to test the relevance of the issue and see
if it matters in XML applications.
