This sounds fine. In the text "at the end of this section" it should be
stated, that DName encoding for XMLDSIG is similar to RFC 2253; the only
difference is the encoding of strings in a DName (encoding of RDF sequence
and AVA sequences is done as stated in RFC 2253).

I suggest to replace the text segment at the end of section 4.4.4:

 "
  Also, strings in DNames
  ...
  physical representation of the XML document.
 "

with the folloing:

 "
  DNames (X509IssuerSerial, X509SubjectName, and KeyName if approriate)
  should be encoded in accordance with RFC 2253, except the encoding of
  string values within a DName, which should be encoded as follows:

    * Consider the string as consisting of Unicode characters.

    * Escape occurrences of the following special characters by
      prefixing it with the "\" character:

      - a "#" occurring at the beginning of the string
      - one of the characters ",", "+", """, "\", "<", ">" or ";"

    * Escape control characters that are not XML characters (\x00-\x08,
      \x0B-\x0C, \x0E-\x19) by replacing them with "\" followed by a
      two digit hex number showing its Unicode number.
 "

Regards, Gregor
