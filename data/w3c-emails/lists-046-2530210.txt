Gregor, the editorial aspect has been done in: 
 [
  http://www.w3.org/Signature/Drafts/xmldsig-core/
  $Revision: 1.149 $ on $Date: 2002/01/18 18:59:56 $ 
]

However, it didn't make it into the latest ietf-draft Don sent in. I expect 
we'll still be able to squeeze that bit in before the RFC is published. As 
to the semi-substantive issue (tweaks to the control characters and 
omission of the trailing white space and "physical representation") I 
won't make a change unless the folks active on this thread last time around 
(such as Merlin and Brian) also advocate for the change in time for us to 
accommodate it -- which I can't make any guarantees for since we are trying 
to have this published soon.
