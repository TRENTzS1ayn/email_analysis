I'll agree with Brian too and add, to Christian's comment, that to control
whitespace treatment in the content an app could do the following, for
example, with an enveloping child element.

Perhaps this may be the best solution regardless of our time constraints.
(Note
that whitespace outside the envelope is not controllable the xml:space
attribute
but this may be OK.)

<ds:Object>
<custom:Envelope  xml:space="preserve>
<custom:Elem1> ... </custom:Elem1>
<custom:Elem2 xml:space="default"> ... </custom:Elem2>
</custom:Envelope>
</ds:Object>
