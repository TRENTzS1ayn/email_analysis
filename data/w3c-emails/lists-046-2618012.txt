If your application needs to support Proposed Rec, then
your example DName should be "My\20Name".

However it is likely that this will change in the Rec.
Please also follow the current discussion on clarifying
the encoding of DNames according to XMLDSIG [1],[2],[3],
[4] and its reflection in section 4.4.4.1 of the current
working document [5].
