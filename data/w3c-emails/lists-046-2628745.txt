I beleive all the issues raised during Exclusive Canonicalization Last Call 
have been addressed [1] and will be requesting that it be made Candidate 
REC.

[1] http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/01/last-call-issues.html

I plan on using the following status, and I of course need to put together 
and interop matrix...

   The duration of Candidate Recommendation will last approximately two
   months (April 16); after which it should proceed to Proposed
   Recommendation. Note, this specification already has significant
   implementation experience as demonstrated by its Interoperability
   Report. We expect to meet all requirements of that report within the
   two month Candidate Recommendation period. Specific areas where we
   would appreciate further implementation experience are:
    1. Speed of canonicalziation relative to Canonical XML; it should be
       no slower, is it faster?
    2. Use in application contexts. Does the specified behaviour meet
       application requirements for flexibly canonicalizing document
       subsets if they are moved out of their context? For example, 
       does your application scenario lead to any difficulties in which 
       a subset (e.g., payload) require the use of an ancestor base 
       that is not easily remedied by including xml:base in the apex 
       of the subset?
