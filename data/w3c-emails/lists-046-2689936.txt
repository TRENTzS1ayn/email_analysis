As an update, there hasn't been any movement on the list for substantive 
tweaks. So what I think we are still looking at is as it is specified in 
[5]. I'm still hoping we can squeeze the purely editorial clarification 
(correcting the statement that says it's RFC2253 conformant and creating 
its own little subheading) into the resulting Proposed Standard. If not, 
the W3C REC will have the error too but will have this quickly documented 
in the erratum.
