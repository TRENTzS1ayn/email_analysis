Karl, thanks for this info. I have a few questions.

1. With your present implementation when you sign these three things, do 
you then create 3 references each with an XPointer to the subtree?
2. It's clear we can get very good performance for subtree selection. Have 
any of your scenario' required omission filters? If so, how would you think 
they be best addressed in the future (e.g., 1.1) 
A. Presently we say be careful with XPointers in URIs because of 
implementation issues: XPointer is not widely implemented, not yet REC, and 
we don't quite trust consistent application interpretations of fragment 
identifiers. Should we relax the discouragement of XPointer? (I'd be 
concerned about its lack of wide-spread implementation and status, but is 
the fragment interpretation not a problem in your experience?)
B. Specify a new XPath transform that is at least very fast for subtree 
selection and hopefully faster for omission filters -- I'm not sure how to 
do the latter yet.
3. Since the enveloped signature transform is specified via an XPath 
expression (though it is not required to be the  means of implementing it) 
how do you implement that and how is its performance?
