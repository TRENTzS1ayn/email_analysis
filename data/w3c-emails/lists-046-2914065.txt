Well having a transform such these expressions can be easily expressed 
without character escaping would be one benefit -- much more readable!

How is the relativity achieved? I note you are using "./ancestor" instead 
of "here()/ancestor". In XPtr isn't your context location [1] still 
initialized to the root node?

The motivating scenario was of signing a form whereby I want to sign the 
whole form except a few of the fields where the recipient might enter their 
own information. This isn't easily accomplished via subtrees.

Ok, thank you! Understanding folks deployment scenarios is very useful.
