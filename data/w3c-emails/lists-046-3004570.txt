personally, i do not think that big changes, like introducing new filter
mechanisms, are desirable and technically necessary.
i do not know how stable XPointer really is and what their time schedule
is. however, the use of XPointer as specified in section "4.3.3.3
Same-Document URI-References" is quite OK as far as i can see at the
moment. 
(btw, does step 4 in this section mean that step 4 should be repeated
for each descendant element of E? i guess it should.)
i see that there is a problem with using XPointer in XMLDsig, if it is
not sure when it will become recommendation.
