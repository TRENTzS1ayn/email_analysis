I defer to John, but I presume that once an element node E is processed, it 
doesn't get processed again.

Karl, I'm still not very confident in the progress and deployment of 
XPointer. I'm glad you are able to use it for fast subtree processing but 
the expressions when encoded as URIs aren't very readable and an omission 
filter is not readily expressible. On the plus side, I expect the new XPath 
transform will be smaller, will be trivial to implement given the present 
code, and we can advance even faster than the exc-c14n spec.
