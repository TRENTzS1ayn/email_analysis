There are still some open speaking slots for the
security track for D-day at the WWW conference.
The emphasis for D-day is on actual implementation
experience and hard core developer-to-developer
talks.

For more description about D-day, please see

http://www2002.org/devday.html

Feel free to make a proposal as suggested.

Thanks!

Rags
