All -

In Reference to 4.4.4

"The X509IssuerSerial element, which contains an X.509 issuer distinguished
name/serial number pair that SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253 [LDAP-DN], "

RFC2253 doesn't tell us how to make a string representation of a serial
number (only attribute types and values). Does the working group put
constraints on the format of the actual serial number (e.g. HEX or Decimal?)
or is this considered out of scope?
