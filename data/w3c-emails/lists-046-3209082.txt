The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'XML-Signature Syntax and
Processing' <draft-ietf-xmldsig-core-2-03.txt> as a Draft Standard,
obsoleting RFC 3075, currently a Proposed Standard.

Group.  The IESG contact persons are Jeffrey Schiller and Marcus

    portions of an XML structured document. It can also provide a
    mechanism for an XML document to provide a digital signature for
    information which is not directly contained within the XML document
    itself.

Implementation Report

    implementation report available at the IETF Web Site (http://www.ietf.org)
