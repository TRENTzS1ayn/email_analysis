The sentence you cite is misleading (Joseph: should this be added to the
errata document?); it should rather say

  "The X509IssuerSerial element, which consists of an X.509 issuer
   distinguished name (SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253 [LDAP-DN]),
   and a serial number."

In the schema, you can see that the serial number has to be of type
xsi:integer.

   <complexType name="X509IssuerSerialType">
     <sequence>
       <element name="X509IssuerName" type="string"/>
       <element name="X509SerialNumber" type="integer"/>
     </sequence>
   </complexType>

Regards, Gregor
