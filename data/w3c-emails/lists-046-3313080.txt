I tweaked the errata to make it clear that its the DNAME that is serialized 
according to our DNAME rules:

http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xmldsig-errata
E01 1.Section 4.4.4 The X509Data Element: The first two bullets of list 
item "1" should read, "the encoding of the distinguished name SHOULD be 
compliant with the DNAME encoding rules at the end of this section."
