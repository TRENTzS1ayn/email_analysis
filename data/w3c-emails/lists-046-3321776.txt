Hi all,

while playing arounf with Xalan/Xerces, I found a - hm problem? - with 
XPath. I read in a document which contains something like this:

<element>
previous sibling text
<![CDATA[
    text in CDATA
]]>
following sibling text
</element>


and use Xalan to select all Nodes by using the c14n-with-comments expr: 
(//. | //@* | //namespace::*). In the resulting NodeList, there is only one 
text node (the previous sibling). The CDATA section and the following 
sibling do not show up in the result. In the bug-report I opened for that 
[1], there is stated by the Xalan developers:

  "So when you run an XPath against a DOM and
   return text as a DOM node, we return the
   _first_ such node in the contiguous text,
   whether it's Text or CDATASection. It is
   the caller's responsibility to check whether
   additional text follows, if that's relevant
   for your application."

So actually, I don't know whether this is right. Any opinions? I guess this 
is a problem that can have many of the Java based implementations?

Regards,
Christian
