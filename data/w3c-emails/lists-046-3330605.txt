hi,

i just had a look into the XPath standard. i think it is a clear bug of
Xalan.

in "5.2 Element Nodes" one can read
... 
The string-value of an element node is the concatenation of the
string-values of all text node descendants of the element node in
document order.

and "5.7 Text Nodes" says
Character data is grouped into text nodes. As much character data as
possible is grouped into each text node: a text node never has an
immediately following or preceding sibling that is a text node. The
string-value of a text node is the character data. ...


even my common sense tells me that everything else does not make sense.

regards

  Karl
