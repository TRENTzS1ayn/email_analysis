There are definitely some incongruities between xpath, infoset, and dom and 
that should be improving in the future, but as you allude to, that's not 
terribly helpful in the present. However the two big rough spots that I'm 
aware of seem addressable. The first being in c14n: some DOM 
implementations (particular those based on "level 1") don't have proper 
namespace axis nodes. Most of this can be addressed by separating the 
namespace attributes out of the attribute list and creating one's own 
namespace axis. This present issue is tricky with respect to understanding 
the issue, but once that is done I think, as Philippe mentioned, one can 
emulate XPath (or the level 3 "wholetext" DOM) by sucking up nodes until 
one reaches the appropriate boundary. Neither of these are pretty, but they 
don't aren't unsurmountable.

I can certainly undertake to respond to any issues related to the specs and 
forward requests on, but I'm not sure what one can do with respect to Xalan 
since I'm not closely involved with that work. But I think there are a few 
implementors here using Xalan, so perhaps they could share their 
experiences or come up with an approach?
