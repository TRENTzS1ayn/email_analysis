Have you read the XML Digital Siganture standard? All XML digital
signatures do is bind some data to a key.

If you have some digital rights management system, presumably
involving encryption and/or various "copy protection" kludges, XML
digital signatues could be used to authenticate control information
for such a system. Signatures would be a small, but important, part of
the overall system.
