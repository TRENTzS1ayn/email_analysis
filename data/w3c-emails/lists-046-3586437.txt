Is there a test suite of signature documents that can be used to verify a
vendor's XML Signature SDK implementation for compliance with the
recommendation?  How do we know that any particular vendor's API will
validate a signature that was created by any other vendor's SDK?

I'm trying to choose a vendor's Toolkit/SDK for use in our application.
I've been burned in the past by vendor's not fully implementing a standard.
I'm interested in having a way to test a vendor's SDK and ensure they have
fully implemented the standard.
