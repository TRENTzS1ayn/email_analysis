Dwight,

Take a look at http://www.w3.org/Signature/2001/04/05-xmldsig-interop.html 
for a matrix of interoperable implementations. The test messages we used 
are downloadable from that page:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2001AprJun/att-00%2033/01-merlin-xmldsig-sixteen.tar.gz 
and

Best,

Ari Kermaier
