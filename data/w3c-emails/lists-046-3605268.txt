Ari,

Thanks for the help here...seems like I asked a dumb question.

I noticed Verisign is on the front page for XML Signature but not in the
interopt grid.  Does the grid need to be updated?

Microsoft's testing was done on a pre-release version of DotNet.  Is
Microsoft planning to update their results now that DotNet is released?

The email from Brian LaMacchia
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2001AprJun/0050.html)
from Microsoft says that: XPointers '#xpointer(/)'is No and XPointers
'#xpointer(id("ID"))' is No.  But the grid says Yes for both.  What happened
there?

Dwight,

Take a look at http://www.w3.org/Signature/2001/04/05-xmldsig-interop.html 
for a matrix of interoperable implementations. The test messages we used 
are downloadable from that page:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2001AprJun/att-00%2033/

and

merlin-xmldsig-fifteen.tar.gz

Best,

Ari Kermaier
