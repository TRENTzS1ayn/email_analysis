My take on that was that the rational intent of exclusive C14N was not to
emit such a namespace.

One reason is simply the difficulty of computing such a fact. If I had used
an XSLT example with attribute values being XPath expressions then precisely
which namespaces are being used there is non-trivial to tell. I suspect if
one wanted to supported XSLT in the full, (including element content) then
the question of which namespace prefixes were being (invisibly) used may
even be Turing complete!

I found the choices made in the two specs on this issue quite
understandable.
