The grids main purpose was to demonstrate the specification could be read 
and use to create an independent implementation. If folks send me new or 
updated info I will include it, but as it says, "The following information 
is the best assesment of the Editors/Chairs for the dated namespace and 
does not necessarily represent the latest state of any given implementation 
over this or later specifications.?"

I suppose that question is best answered by MS.

I think he told me later it was supported but I didn't (for lack of a URI 
or mistake) didn't update the link to the new email. If Brian corrects me 
I'll be happy to link to that info.
