      Harada-san:

      May I ask whether your difficulty with the examples is the absence of
non-ASCII characters in the example DN's in 4.4.4, the absence of the
escapable characters from those examples, or the fact that the example
certificates are truncated to very short lengths?  RFC 2253 says that the
encoding of DN's is UTF-8 (of which ASCII is a subset), and the heuristic
given is fairly clear, although you're supposed to encode DN's in XML by
using the same character set as the rest of the document.
      An ASCII example with escapable characters would be:
<X509IssuerName>CN=J. Random Nerd,  O=Dewey\, Cheatham\, \+ Howe,
             L=Nowhere, ST=AK, C=US</X509IssuerName>

      I can't easily give you non-ASCII UTF-8 characters in this medium.

Subject:    Are there DName encoding samples?


Hi,

 I implemented the DNames encoding in 4.4.4 The X509Data Element.
But I feel uneasy because there are no DNames encoding examples in the
recommendation.
 Does anyone know documents of encoded DName?
