Ok, I've added libxml to [1] and added a column for it in the interop [2].

I'm not yet satisfied with the interop tests for lack of a good framework. 
Some folks use dsig which is very appropriate but others aren't using that, 
and folks have written it in different languages with different APIs so a 
language specific testing framework doesn't seem to work well. (Plus, I'm 
not that experienced with serious interop yet.)

Hopefully someone will send a nice big interop set with different XML 
instances, XPath expressions, and parameters that tests screw cases. Worse 
case, I'll send a manual set when I get the time.
