Joseph:

 

Regarding esoteric node sets, a clear note of warning to applications and users should indeed be quite sufficient.

 

The error thrown in this case is indeed from ?3.4.3, specifically from the paragraph that you identified.

 

My point about serializing was simply one of perception and focus, and wasn't a deep one. It was expressed that "canonicalization is just a method for writing node-sets". Well, for starters in SCC14N node-sets are rather incidental, as infosets are the focus. Further, an XPath node set still always carries around behind itself the full underlying tree against which the nodes in the set are actually interpreted; this tree and related derivative information is (often) lost in the transcription through a canonicalization algorithm such as c14n, exc-c14n, or scc14n. Thus, it has never really struck me at all to think about canonicalization as "just a method for writing node-sets". The issues I can see are related, but certainly not equivalent, and I don't see great utility in equating the two, even conceptually. That was all that I was alluding to; nothing profound.

 

It is certainly possible to enumerate and characterize the causes of the fatal errors in scc14n, though we haven't specifically done that yet. In particular, well-formed namespace-conformant schema-valid XML that validates against schemas in which all embedded languages can be appropriately understood per ?3.4.2 will not so fatally terminate.

I'm willing to document the issue (proposed text will follow). With xmldsig 

and xenc we've given great flexibility to applications, particularly via 

the transforms mechanism so calling out issues that one needs to be aware 

of is important.

I'm glad that we generally agree that these "esoteric scenarios" are not 

compelling scenarios. I'm satisfied if your approach is to throw an error 

(at first I misunderstood and though you considered them important to 

support) and if we continue to support them but point out that such 

nodesets must be constructed with care, as we already do in other cases.

 

So I undersand your specification better, I have two quick questions.

 

1. The error you throw in this case result from section 3.4.3 [1]?

2. I'm not sure how you disagree with John with respect to "serializing" a 

noteset. Your input is an infoset (either as parsed or converted from an 

XPath nodeset) and you serialize. You do serialize it in a specific way, 

and one of those ways is that you throw fatal errors given characteristics 

of the input Infoset. Is this characteristic the one that leads you to 

state you are doing more than serializing infoset items? Also, is it 

possible to simply describe input which fails to trigger fatal errors? For 

instance, will SCC14N always work over all well-formed XML -- that  might 

be schema valid, or might not?

 

[1] 

http://www.uddi.org/pubs/SchemaCentricCanonicalization-20020213.htm#sec-Specification-Xform-ns-normalize

 

If info is an element or attribute information item whose [namespace name] 

property is not no value, then let a be that namespace declaration 

attribute in the [normalized namespace attributes] of some self-ancestor of 

info where the [normalized value] property of a is identical to the 

[namespace name] property of info (if no such a exists, a fatal error 

occurs. This can occur, for example, if all element information items in 

the infoset are omitted, but some attributes are retained.). The 

[normalized prefix] property of info then exists and is the [local name] 

property of a.
