Thank you, I understand.

Ok, with your assurance and a quick re-review of the Schema spec I'd agree 
that schema shouldn't touch the infoset items at all, just the schema 
augmented items. (If XSV did this, then I presume it was in error.)

Ok.

I don't want to be misunderstood: I'm not protesting your inaction. I feel 
that if anyone comes up with an approach, I'd like to see it as a small, 
separate spec that is vetted by the larger community.
