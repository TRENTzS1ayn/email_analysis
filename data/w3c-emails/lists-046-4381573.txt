FYI:
I tested my C14N and Exc-C14N implementation (http://xmlsoft.org) using 
the same test file (exc-signature.xml in 
http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/02/01-exc-c14n-interop.html).
The test program loaded the document once and executed (exc-)c14n 
10000 times on PIII-900 + Linux 2.4.18 (the time for loading and 
parsing document is *NOT* included) with following results:
  
   C14n: 4550 [ms]
   Exclusive C14n: 4500 [ms]

There were no visible difference in doing c14n with or without comments.
The program was compiled using gcc-2.96 using w/o optimization 
(debug mode).

Joseph, please remove question marks for libxml on iterop report 
(http://www.w3.org/Signature/2002/02/01-exc-c14n-interop.html) since it
does support "#default" prefix and the performance does exceed c14n 
performance.

Thanks,

Aleksey.
