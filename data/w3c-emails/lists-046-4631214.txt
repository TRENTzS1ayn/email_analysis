I agree that this seems to be where the consensus is headed. I'm not aware 
of any standing opposition to set operations though there is still some 
confusion: Christian asking about what exactly Merlin is proposing [1], and 
my confusion about multiple transforms operating on the *original* 
document, not their preceding transforms output [2]. So before we have a 
call or resort to a poll I'd recommend we gather our thoughts and first 
reflect these changed in the document. Then we can further discuss as 
needed.
