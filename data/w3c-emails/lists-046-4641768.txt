To answer 2, in case it's not clear from my last message (which hopefully
addresses 1), the XPath expression is evaluated in the context of the
input document and then the result is applied to the input node set.

I think, as an aside, that a sequence of XPath, XPath filter and Enveloped
signature transforms can thus be reordered without altering the resulting
node set.
