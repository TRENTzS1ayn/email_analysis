Subject: New Erratum E04 (Was: NFC)

As a result of this thread, I've added an erratum to the xmldsig REC:

http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xmldsig-errata#E04
E04 2002-03-20 (Clarification)

6.5 Canonicalization Algorithms states for canonicalization with and
without comments, "The two algorithms below perform text normalization
during transcoding [NFC, NFC-Corrigendum]." While it is true the output of
these algorithms will be in NFC it is not because they do the normalization
themselves, but because "the XML processor used to prepare the XPath data
model input is required (by the Data Model) to use Normalization Form C
[NFC, NFC-Corrigendum] when converting an XML document to the UCS character
domain from any encoding that is not UCS-based..." [XML-C14N, 4.2 No
Character Model Normalization].
