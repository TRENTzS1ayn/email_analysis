Joseph,

please find attached four additional test cases for 
C14N and EC14N. 

Each test file is XML and contains:

  - The XML to be filtered with an XPath Transform according
    to XMLDSIG

  - The XPath to be applied to the XML

  - The intended output of canonicalizing the result of the
    XPath transform with C14N, together with annotations what
    the test case should show

  - The intended output of canonicalizing the result of the
    XPath transform with EXC-C14N, together with annotations
    what the test case should show

So, the following steps are necessary to use the test cases:

  1. Get the bytes of the test case file

  2. Apply a XPath Transform with the appropriate XPath 
     (specified in a comment in the test case file)

  3. Apply C14N and EXC-C14N respectively to the result of
     the XPath Transform.

  4. Compare the result of C14N and EXC-C14N respectively
     with the intended result shown as comment in the
     test case file.

Liebe Gruesse/Regards,
