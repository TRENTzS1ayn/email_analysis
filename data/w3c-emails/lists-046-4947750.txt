Dear Chairs,

On behalf of the DOM Working Group, I am pleased to announce the
publication of the DOM Level 3 XPath Last Call draft.

This document provides simple functionalities to access a DOM tree using
XPath 1.0.

The review period ends on May 1, 2002. Send reviews before the review
period ends to the public mailing list www-dom@w3.org.

W3C Working Draft 28 March 2002

     http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20020328


We explicitly invite comments from the following Working Groups:

- XSL
- XML Query

Of course, all Working Groups are more than welcome to send feedback.

The DOM Working Group agreed to move the document to Last Call during
its weekly teleconference, without objections:
