These are minor editorial comments for your Exclusive XML
Canonicalization Proposed Recommendation [1]. Apologies, these were due
about 10 days ago. If they are too late to be useful please ignore.

s/W3C membership/W3C Membership/
s/The Names in XML Recommendation/The Namespaces in XML Recommendation/
(or The namespaces Recommendation)

There are six occurrences of "node set" and four of "nodeset". I am not
sure but think that would be "node-set" with a hyphen. (The XPath
Recommendation has one "Node Set" in a heading, the rest "node-set".)

In 1.1, I guess you have nodes marked up as code and elements as em.
If that's right, I would say element <em>E</em> in paragraph 8. That
paragraph also needs an ending period after "prefix."

There are two occurrences of "xml namespace" and one "XML namespace".
If you need lowercase, can the xml be code, or could all three be "XML
namespace"?

    XPath node-set, that is an octet sequence,
maybe could be either:
    XPath node-set that is an octet sequence
or:
    XPath node-set, that is, an octet sequence,
(not sure there)

In 1.3 item 2, visibly utilized could be <a
class="link-def" href="#def-visibly-utilizes">visibly utilized</a>

s/the following XPath expression/the following XPath expression:/
s/presense/presence/
s/thestate/the state/

s/whitespace delimited list/white space delimited list/
or change the other:
s/a white space separated list/a whitespace separated list/

s/in in/in/

First person could be hard to translate.

In 6. Keywords, "S. Bradner. March 1997." appears twice.

In 6. URI, there is an extra space in "RFC 2396 ."

In 6. XPath, "eds." could be omitted and the names could be J. Clark
and S. DeRose to match your other references.
