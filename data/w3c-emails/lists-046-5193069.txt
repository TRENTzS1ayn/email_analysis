Could be nice, but to be honest, none of the tools I use resolve XInclude, 
so I simply regard them as dangerous annoyances.  As I don't use XML 
Signature at this point, its ability to deal with XInclude in ways that go 
beyond Canonical XML's understanding does very little good for me at present.

Because Canonical XML doesn't require resolution of XIncludes by itself, I 
can't simply demand "Canonical XML" and expect to get XInclude-processed 
XML, so Canonical XML remains a nice theoretical but generally useless spec 
so far as I am concerned.
