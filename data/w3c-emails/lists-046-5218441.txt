The XML Signature XPath Filer2 spec[1] is in Last Call, however, since we're 
tweaking/improving something that already exists, and the tweaking we did 
was fully informed by implementation, I'm not expecting any comments, and 
if I get two more interop reports, I might even "skip" Candidate REC. 
Presently [2], we have reports from Christian and Merlin, any others?
