Susan, thank you for the comments, the resulting document is [1]. For the 
Working Group: the draft status has also been updated to reflect that the 
document has been approved for publication as a Recommendation, which 
should happen later in July. We're not anticipating a lot of press 
activity, but if folks (particularly implementors) are interested (e.g., 
testimonials or referrals if there are press calls) please contact Janet 
Daly.

    These are minor editorial comments for your Exclusive XML
    Canonicalization Proposed Recommendation [1]. Apologies, these were due
    about 10 days ago. If they are too late to be useful please ignore.

Thanks!

    (or The namespaces Recommendation)

Fixed.

    There are six occurrences of "node set" and four of
    "nodeset". I am not
    sure but think that would be "node-set" with a hyphen. (The
    XPath
    Recommendation has one "Node Set" in a heading, the rest
   "node-set".)
    
Fixed.

    In 1.1, I guess you have nodes marked up as code and elements as em.
    If that's right, I would say element <em>E</em> in paragraph
    8. That
    paragraph also needs an ending period after "prefix."

Fixed.
    
    There are two occurrences of "xml namespace" and one "XML
    namespace".
    If you need lowercase, can the xml be code, or could all three be
    "XML
    namespace"?
    
Fixed.

        XPath node-set, that is an octet sequence,
    maybe could be either:
        XPath node-set that is an octet sequence
    or:
        XPath node-set, that is, an octet sequence,
    (not sure there)
    
"as an octet sequence"

    In 1.3 item 2, visibly utilized could be <a
    class="link-def"
    href="#def-visibly-utilizes">visibly utilized</a>
    
Ok.

    s/the following XPath expression/the following XPath expression:/
    s/presense/presence/

Ok.

    s/thestate/the state/
    
(don't see that)

    s/whitespace delimited list/white space delimited list/
    or change the other:
    s/a white space separated list/a whitespace separated list/
    
"what space"

    s/in in/in/
    
Ok.

    First person could be hard to translate.

Interesting, "While such choices are consistent with other XML 
specifications and satisfy the Working Group's application requirements..."
    
        We provide this example to caution
    could be:
        This example is provided to caution
    
    In 6. Keywords, "S. Bradner. March 1997." appears twice.
    
Fixed.

    In 6. URI, there is an extra space in "RFC 2396 ."
    
I don't see it.

    In 6. XPath, "eds." could be omitted and the names could be J.
    Clark and S. DeRose to match your other references.

Ok.
