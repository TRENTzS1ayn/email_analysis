I've tweaked the text in [1] to the declarative stance. As I'm also prepping 
the spec for publication I've moved all the "node set" to "node-set" and 
updated the References, if anyone thinks this is not insufficient (or folks 
want pseudo-code) please say so ASAP. (The Last Call ends on this Thursday 
and I will publish a new version next week, the question is should be it a 
Candidate REC (and give it another 3 weeks in that stage if we expect other 
implementations) or Proposed REC (save ourselves a little time)).
