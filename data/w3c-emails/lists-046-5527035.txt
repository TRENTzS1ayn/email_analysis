Hi Guys,

I have a basic question to ask....is FSML a rival technology to that of XML
Digital Signatures. I understand that FSTC is holding patents on signing
documents electronically and FSML is the specification written by them. In
the light of this, is XML Digital Signatures not an infringement upon the
patents held by FSTC?

I would appreciate for any clarifications from you.

Thanks,
Kalyana
