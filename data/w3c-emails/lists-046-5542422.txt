This is good stuff. In time folks will be able to cite a REC form of these 
nice little specs, instead of a profile of a stale CR.

Subject: Last call announcement for XML 1.1
Date: Thu, 11 Jul 2002 09:02:10 -0500
From: Paul Grosso <pgrosso@arbortext.com>
To: "w3c chairs" <chairs@w3.org>

The XML Linking WG announces Last Call on the following
three drafts:
   XPointer Framework [1]
   XPointer element() Scheme [2]
   XPointer xmlns Scheme() [3]

These drafts, in combination with the working draft
   XPointer xpointer() Scheme  [4],
provide basically the same functionality as the XPointer CR
draft[5] of 2001-09-11.  The only new functionality is to
allow XML Schema declaration of ID-type attributes, in
addition to DTD declarations. Primarily, the XPointer
draft has been factored into multiple documents so that
XPointer support will be easier to implement than as a
monolithic specification.

The decision to go to Last Call is minuted at [6].
The last call review period ends July 31. Comment should be
sent to www-xml-linking-comments@w3.org.

Unless the review uncovers substantial problems, the next step
will be to recommend the documents for publication as Candidate
Recommendations or Proposed Recommendations, depending on the
level of implementation experience. (The framework draft, in
particular, may avoid a second CR period because of its
simplicity, the way that a number of other W3C specs
rely only on the functionality from XPointer it provides,
and because of existing implementation experience.)
