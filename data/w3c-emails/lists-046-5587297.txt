Hi All, 

I have a question please;

 
( XML Signatures are important because they maintain the XML data format after signing occurs. This contrasts a traditional digital signature which is represented in a binary format such as PKCS#7. )



My questions are: 

1-the "signature value" represented in the xml signature isn't PKCS#7 "binary format "? 

2-Where is the time-stamp "horodatage" ,it exist?



thanks and regards

Jacques
