It is not. You sign a digest of a xml structure containing digests of 
documents you want to sign. This signature value is then included in 
<SignatureValue> in the xml-signature file.

I've got the same question - how to include, in a standard way, a time 
stamp in the CMS format? As a SignatureProperty, or what? Or maybe there 
is some XML time-stamp specification?

PS
Time-stamp according to rfc#3161 is not presented in pkcs#7 format, but 
in CMS format (modification of pkcs#7) - see rfc#2630.
