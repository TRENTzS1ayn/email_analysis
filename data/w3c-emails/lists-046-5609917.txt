Yes, and this value is the base64 encoded representation of one (in case of 
RSA) or two (in case of DSA) integers. These integer values are 1:1 written 
to the signature value (the spec describes exactly in the DSA section how 
the both integer values are prepared into a single octet sequence).

The W3 did not (yet?) create a spec how timestamps (or other extensions) 
have to be used in conjunction with XML Signature (guess that XKMS uses 
sort of timestamps internally). The european ETSI did create a spec how to 
create qualified signatures using XML:

2001-09-25: Standard ETSI TS 101 203 - XML Advanced Electronic Signatures 
(XAdES) <http://portal.etsi.org/sec/el-sign.asp> by cruellas@ac.upc.es. 
This draft standard specifies the XML format for Advanced Electronic 
Signatures satisfying the requirements defined in the European Directive 
for Electronic Signatures, and with long term validity. The standard can be 
found in STF178Task3Draft.pdf 
<http://portal.etsi.org/sec/STF178Task3Draft.pdf>.
