The specification has moved forward; the correct link is now
http://pda.etsi.org/pda/home.asp?wki_id=12532. Unfortunately you
have to register before being able to download, but they ask only
for an email address. I have contributed to this standard; so if 
you have any questions, feel free to ask.

A similar specification exists for incorporating useful properties
into CMS signatures. See http://pda.etsi.org/pda/home.asp?wki_id=12533.
