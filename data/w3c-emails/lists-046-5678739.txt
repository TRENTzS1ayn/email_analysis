Congratulations and thanks to everyone that has contributed to these 
specifications! Next steps? See if we can get one more interop report on 
the XPath Filter2, publish it as a Proposed Recommendation in August, and a 
Recommendation soon afterwards.

   Canonical XML [XML-C14N] specifies a standard serialization of XML
   that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's
   ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and
   attributes in the "xml:" namespace. However, some applications require
   a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from
   a canonicalized subdocument. For example, one might require a digital
   signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will
   not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message
   and/or inserted into a different context. This requirement is satisfied
   by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.

   XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying
   information content to be digitally signed and for representing the
   resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications require the
   ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information
   content to be signed. The XML Signature specification meets this
   requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can be
   difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This
   specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the
   development of efficient document subsetting implementations that
   interoperate under similar performance profiles.
