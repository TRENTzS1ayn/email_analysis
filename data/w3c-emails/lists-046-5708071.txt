RFC3075 includes the recommendation:


"We RECOMMEND that resource constrained applications that do not
implement the Canonical XML [XML-C14N] algorithm and instead choose
minimal canonicalization (or some other form) be implemented to
generate Canonical XML as their output serialization so as to easily
mitigate some of these interoperability and security concerns."


We actually have devices that are resource constrained and need to do
minimal canonicalization (as part of UPnP), but the way this
recommendation is written, it suggests that the constrained device
control its output.  In fact, if we have two devices, one powerful
and doing C14-N and one constrained, it is the powerful one that has
to make sure its output is canonicalized.

BTW, we would like further guidance about minimal canonicalization
from the dsig community, if anyone has it to offer.
