We are using XML DSig to sign SOAP commands for UPnP.  Each SOAP
command is an XML structure.  We aren't signing documents but rather
messages (or parts of messages, to be more precise).

In that case, you have a sender and a receiver.  If the sender is
powerful, it is generating the signature and controlling its output,
but it has no reason to use anything but C14N.  However, the receiver
is limited in CPU power (and possibly memory) and needs to
canonicalize the incoming message in order to verify the signature. 
That's the one that can't afford C14N.
