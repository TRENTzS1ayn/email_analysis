I am not familiar enough with UPnP, but from what I have seen, it seems
quite possible that there may be intermediaries who have to do some XML
processing before forwarding the SOAP message to the validating entity.  If
this is the case, you cannot guarantee that the canonical form sent is what
was received.  Maybe Carl can clarify.

sender is free to even output canonical XML, so that the receiver already
get's the canonical form. In that special case, there would be no necessity
to c14nize because it is already done.
