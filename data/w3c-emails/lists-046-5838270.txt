If you can constrain your process such that you know no intermediaries are 
introducing particular sorts of changes, you might be able to go the 
minimal route. However, if your using SOAP, I don't think that likely and 
you're having to "detach" a SOAP message from the header, and you'll need 
octet based means (and alignment to worry about) for this...
