Yes.

We thought we could get away with Minimal, but found disagreement
over whether the bytes on the wire could have pretty-printing white
space.  That's why I went looking and found the note that I sent to
start this mail thread.  The observation I wanted to offer this
mailing list is that unlike the way RFC3075 was worded, if you have
any constrained devices in your network, then all devices in the
network need to output C14N.
