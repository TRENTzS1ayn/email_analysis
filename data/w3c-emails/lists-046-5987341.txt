I still can't say I undestand since you still seem to have your own 
signature scheme (and use say the first signature is, " composed of the 
elements: attachment.messageId, attachment.id, fileSize, createdTimestamp, 
signedWithName, realSignedTimestamp, originalName, contentType, rawData, 
preText, and postText and ipAddr." How do you know that?

Regardless, I might have a sense of your larger application, and this 
pseudo-example demonstrates how might one do such a thing with XML 
Signatures.

The following is a message with a header, body, and two attachments. Two 
signature is included, the first is specified and contains two references: 
one to the first attement, and another to the associated Signature 
Properties. If you want to sign the *actual* attachment (instead of the 
attement element iwth id = "a1") you would need a transform that isolates 
the element content (e.g., XPath). You could further decode the base64 data 
in that element content, as decribed in:
