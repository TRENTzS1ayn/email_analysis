Hm, I'm not sure whether I understand it right. What do you understand under the trem "sign"? If "sign" is the DSA or RSA operation of the signing process, you *never* sign the message directly. What happens is that the message is digested and this digest is signed. In XML Signature, the hash of the message is collected in an intermediary object, the ds:SignedInfo and this is again hashed and DSA'ed. The signing process always involves a cryptographic hash function.

Signing "real data", i.e. signing the message directly is not such a good idea as it opens the algorithm to some attacks, especially if you use plain RSA (which would be a very bad idea).
