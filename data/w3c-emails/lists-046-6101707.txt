Hi,

 This is the report of our processor for the XPath Filter2 Interop Report
test vectors.

 In the present, our processor is included in the
"Interstage Apcoordinator Enterprise Edition ????????????????????? V5.0L10"
    http://interstage.fujitsu.com/jp/v5/apc/
(Sorry, I cannot find the English version.)
 But it is not supported XPath filter2 in the above version.
 There is another way for you to get our processor freely,
but I myself cannot tell you it publicly for security reason.

Regards,
Kazuyuki Harada
