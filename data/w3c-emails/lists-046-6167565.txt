Maybe I'm off topic, but I'd wish to ask are going to work on it for 
"academic" purpose only (es: to show that an XAedes is builtable or to 
show that you are Digital Signature guru </smile> ... ) or is there at 
the moment in Spain real urgent interest in signed & trusted Xml .... or 
better ...

I'd wish to hear from all tuned on this ML : What are  the current 
feelings in your country or of your clients about signed & trusted Xml 
(eventually encrypted) ?

In my personal experience (Italian only based): "Cool, I'd like, but 
until I don't see the word Recommendation on both the "rfcs" (and I 
think in XPath filter too) I'm not interested ! " .
