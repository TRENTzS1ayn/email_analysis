Well after a little misunderstanding beetween me and Christian I think 
it's better to reformulate the question:

Six mounths after becoming Recommendation, what's the situation of Xml 
Dsig on the IT market ?
Is it accepted, understood, loved, hated ?
Are there any real life projects what are signing with implementations 
of it and are able to be real-world interoperable ?
Or are there only ~15 implementations that work on test vectors ?

I'm interested in news from the field , not next steps to solve some 
open question (that can be found here [1] ).

Last week I was informaly talking with a system integrator that was 
thinking about XmlDsig as a "pure" translate of  PKCS#7 in Xml (I 
suppose he intended the .p7m file ).
