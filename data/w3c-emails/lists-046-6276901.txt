Fabio,

The Austrian federal government will use XMLDSIG as the signature 
format in the concepts which will be employed for all future
e-government applications offered to enterprises and citizens.

Currently both applications on the client side and on the server
side for generating signatures, validating signatures and citizen
authentication are under development and will be deployed in the 
near future.

Regards,
Gregor
