Hi Aleksy,

Independent of the technical merit of the proposal, the spec is already 
rather mature/baked. The Candidate Rec period formally ends today and I'm 
trying to schedule the Proposed Rec review -- though vacation schedules are 
tricky. So, for any new functionality, I'd want to hear *very* strong 
consensus that this was essential; if so, does the change necessitate 
recycling at Last Call, a new CR, a new namespace/identifier? And is the 
delay worth it? (We're in that stage where even reasonable and modest 
proposals have a very high bar to leap! <smile/>)

On the technical issue, in your example I'm not sure why:
  <dsig-xpath:XPointer 
    Filter="subtract"> xpointer(id('foo'))</dsig-xpath:XPath>
is all that superior to:
  <dsig-xpath:XPath 
    Filter="subtract">id('foo')</dsig-xpath:XPath>
There might be some more exotic expressions where it's a little easier, but 
even so, I'm comfortable with a REQUIRED reliance upon a normative 
reference to the XPath Recommendation; I'm less comfortable with a reliance 
on the old (abandoned) XPointer Candidate REC, or the new Working Drafts. 
(In fact, this is inappropriate going back to the maturity issue.)
