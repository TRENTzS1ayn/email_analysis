Hi, Joseph!

I found that using XPointers instead of XPath in case of XMLSec/LibXML 
gives
about 10% validation time decrease for the sign-xfdl.xml file from the 
XPath 2 filter
interop tests suite. So I thought that it'll be interesting to include 
this functionality
into the spec. However, you gave a very good reason why this is a bad 
idea right now.
May be it would be interesting to do it when new XPointer spec is ready.

With best regards,
Aleksey
