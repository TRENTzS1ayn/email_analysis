As was done with Canonical XML, Exclusive XML Canonicalization Version 1.0
and XPath Filter2 when it is a Recommendation will also be published as
Informational RFCs. These will be put through the IETF side and you will see
some messages on this list culminating, hopefully, in the RFC publication
notice. Since these are intended to be the same in content as the W3C
Recommendations, it should all go pretty smoothly.

Thanks,
Donald
