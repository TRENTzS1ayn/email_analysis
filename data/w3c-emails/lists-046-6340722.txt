Hello All,

I came across something that wasn't quite clear to me in the XML Signature
Recommendation.

Consider Section 4.3.3.2 in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/

Next consider Case 1 and Case 2 below:

Case 1: <Reference URI="#frag1">....</Reference>

Case 2: <Reference URI="xpointer(id('frag1')"> ..... </Reference>

Consider:

<Object Id="frag1"> <hello> world </hello> <!-- today is cool --> </Object>


The spec clearly says that Case 1 should Reference a node set without
comments, but for Case 2, it does not clearly say that comments should be
preserved or stripped (although comment preservation is implied).

Is this clear somewhere else, or am I missing something?

Regards,
