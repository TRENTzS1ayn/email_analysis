Thanks everyone -

The paragraph logic as written doesn't necessarily imply Christian's
conclusion. Assuming #1 and #2, #3 is not necessarily true if one were to
read the XML Signature Recommendation alone.

Is this a big deal, nope - but it could cause interop problems if
Christian's conclusion isn't followed by every implementor. We came across
this at RSA while in development of some XML Signature tools and the
question was posed to me.

My point is largely academic. I think the consensus is correct: XPointer
fragment references include all referenced child nodes with no further
qualification. It just doesn't explicitly SAY these words. Not a big deal.
Carry on :)


1. "if the URI is not a full XPointer, then delete all
    comment nodes"

2.  "Therefore to retain the default behavior of stripping
    comments when passed a node-set, they are removed in
    the last step if the URI is not a full XPointer."

3. *If* it's an XPointer, comments are not removed.

Regards.

4.3.3.3 states:

   "if the URI is not a full XPointer, then delete all
    comment nodes"

and

   "Therefore to retain the default behavior of stripping
    comments when passed a node-set, they are removed in
    the last step if the URI is not a full XPointer."

So *if* it's an XPointer, comments are not removed.
