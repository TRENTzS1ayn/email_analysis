Hi Blake,

I agree that the spec did not tell the other side of the fact in great detail. What I personally learned from these W3C specs (ds, c14n, exclC14n, xenc) is that the spec must be seen in conjunction with the repective mailing list archives (which can be a bit frustrating when you need unambigous advice).

Joseph, maybe this is a candidate for the erratum?


Regards,
Christian
