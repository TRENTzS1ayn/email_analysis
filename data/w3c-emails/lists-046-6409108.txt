You also need to understand XPointer selection (which includes comments) in 
the context of xmldsig, and I agree it's an easy issue to get confused on, 
that's why we have have (at least) points #1 and #2.

Correct.

Right, step 5 of 4.3.3.3 .

Right, explaination of step 5 in 4.3.3.3 .

"The last step is performed for null URIs, barename XPointers and child 
sequence XPointers. It's necessary because when [XML-C14N] is passed a 
node-set, it processes the node-set as is: with or without comments"

This doesn't say that an XPointer *doesn't* remove comments by default but 
you won't find anything in that spec that says it would. I'm not sure a 
clarification is necessary, but if someone wants to explicitly propose one 
we can consider it -- though it sounds if Blake is satisfied.
