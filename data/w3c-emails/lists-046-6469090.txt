XML-Signature XPath Filter 2.0
W3C Proposed Recommendation 27 August 2002

   This version:
          http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-xmldsig-filter2-20020827/

Abstract

   XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying
   information content to be digitally signed and for representing the
   resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications require the
   ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the information
   content to be signed. The XML Signature specification meets this
   requirement with the XPath transform. However, this transform can be
   difficult to implement efficiently with existing technologies. This
   specification defines a new XML Signature transform to facilitate the
   development of efficient document subsetting implementations that
   interoperate under similar performance profiles.

Status of this document

   This document is a Proposed Recommendations (PR) of the W3C. The
   IETF/W3C XML Signature Working Group (W3C Activity Statement) believes
   this specification incorporates the resolution of all issues and its
   specification is sufficient for the creation of independent
   interoperable implementations. The exit criteria of two or more
   independent implementations that interoperate under a performance
   profile has been satisfied as documented in the Interoperability
   Report.

   W3C Advisory Committee Members are invited to send formal review
   comments to the W3C Team until 24 September 2002 at
   xml-dsig-review@w3.org. The public is invited to send comments to the
   editors and the public mailing list w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org (archive
   ). After the review the Director will announce the document's
   disposition. This announcement should not be expected sooner than 14
   days after the end of the review.

   Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on the
   Working Group's patent disclosure page, in conformance with W3C
   policy, and the IETF Page of Intellectual Property Rights Notices, in
   conformance with IETF policy.
