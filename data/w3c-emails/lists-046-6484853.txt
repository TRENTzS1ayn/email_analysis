Nathn,

In general, whether or not you apply canonicalization depends on the type of
URI and the transforms. Assuming no explicit transforms, if the URI="" or
URI="#foo" where foo is arbitrary, then you will use canonicalization to
create a canonical physical representation of the referenced resource. 

If the URI is NOT URI="" or URI="#foo", then no canonicalization occurs, the
resource is treated as octets. That is, unless there is an explicit
transform that requires the resource be interpreted as a node-set.

If you have a node set and you do not "manually" c14n by an explicit
transform, the default c14n is applied which is (inclusive) c14n omitting
comments.
