Joseph,

one thing. When I wrote all this c14n code, my limited brain had a hard work. In order to allow other people to have a little easier job, I've included a ZIP with html files for the interop page. The HTML files are similar to the c14n-x.txt files from the test vectors (Y1..Y4), but they highlight the input node set to the transforms and what was the input to c14n.

There exist four different styles to indicate how a given node is treated.

(1) A node which is in the node set is labeled using the INCLUDED style.

(2) A node which is NOT in the node set is labeled EXCLUDED style.

(3) A namespace which is in the node set AND in the
    InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList is labeled using the
    INCLUDEDINCLUSIVENAMESPACE style.

(4) A namespace which is in NOT the node set AND in the
    InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList is labeled using the
    INCLUDEDINCLUSIVENAMESPACE style.

If you could add it to the interop page?


Christian
