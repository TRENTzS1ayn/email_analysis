Thanks Christian, now linked from the page. One question though: "highlight 
the input node set to the transforms and what was the input to c14n." You 
examples are of the output though, right -- not the input? The actual 
document says "Output" and the explaination says, "nodeset of the given 
Reference before it is canonicalized" but you have a computed 
SignatureValue? So I'm not sure what exact stage the output represents.
