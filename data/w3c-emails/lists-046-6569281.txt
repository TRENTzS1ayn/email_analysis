Imagine you have this:

<document>
   <someData>
   <ds:Signature>
      ...
      <ds:Reference URI="">
         <ds:Transforms>
            <ds:Transform Algo="envelopedSignature" />
            <ds:Transform Algo="exclusiveC14n" />
         </ds:Transforms>
      </ds:Reference>
   </ds:Signature>
</document>

In that case, <document> and <someData> are highlighted in white as they are included in the node set while ds:Signature and the descendants are grey (as they are not in the node set).

The HTML displays the full document (including comments and all that stuff), but only the result of subsequent node set operations (before the set is converted to octets) is highlighted.
