"IRI References" Are these defined anywhere else? I think it makes sense to 
define such a thing (so we don't have to keep repeating it in every spec), 
but I'm not sure if it should be defined in the namespace spec, or if "IRI" 
is the best term... maybe "iURI"...

Does the fact that xmldsig is not designated mean you are already confident 
that the introduction of Namespaces 1.1 will not affect canonicalized forms 
of XML? Or that new versions of those specifications (and XPath even) are 
needed to accommodate the change? Do you expect NS1.1 to be used with 
XML1.0, or only XML1.1? On quick review, I believe that because of the 
existing normative references, and the change that a namespace also applies 
to attributes (section 5.1) this would require new versions of XPath, 
c14ns, and xmldsig.
