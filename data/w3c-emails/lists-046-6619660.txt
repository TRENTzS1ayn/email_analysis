The XML Core WG welcomes feedback from all groups.  The omission of xmldsig
shouldn't be read to imply much of anything (other than I'm required to have
a list of groups from which we request feedback, and that's the list I dug
up from somewhere else).

Namespaces 1.1 is expected to be used with XML 1.1.  Other than various
errata, Namespaces 1.1 really only adds the ability to "undeclare" a
namespace, and I doubt it would require any change to XPath et al.

I think you are misunderstanding "the change that a namespace also applies 
to attributes."   The wording change in section 5.1 (see Erratum NE07 at [1]) 
clarifies that the attributes in a start tag that contains a namespace 
declaration are also within scope of that namespace *declaration* (aka the 
prefix-to-namespace name mapping).  This has always been the case; this
erratum is merely editorial and does not change anything about what 
namespace the attributes are in.  Specifically, "default namespaces do not 
apply directly to attributes" (Section 5.2).  [Perhaps section 5.1 would 
more properly be titled "Namespace declaration scoping" or "Namespace 
prefix-to-namespace name mapping scoping".]
