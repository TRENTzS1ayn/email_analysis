In the course of using the new XPath transform and schema validating a
signed document, I encountered schema validation errors from the
Xerces-C 2.1 parser when I pointed it at the schema that's documented in
the specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-filter2/).

Specifically, the choice to declare the Filter attribute values as an
enumeration of NOTATIONs rather than strings is causing problems,
because there are no <xsd:notation> elements that declare the three
values of the enumeration.

It's also worth noting that NOTATIONs are QNames, which means that a
namespace has to be specified along with the local names. By spec, the
schema declares them to be in the XPath2 namespace, which is fine. But
note that the samples in the spec document use conflicting forms in
which sometimes the default namespace is
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-filter2/ and sometimes it isn't, and yet
the Filter attribute values are always unqualified in the samples.

Both these issues go away if xsd:NOTATION is converted to xsd:string in
the schema, which would seem to be ok, but that's not what's in the
document right now.

Am I missing something?
