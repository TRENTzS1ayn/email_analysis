Hi Bilal,

In [1] you state, "When a user wants to sign an XML document, there is a two 
step procedure. First, the user digests the XML file to be signed and 
produces a digest value. Secondly, the user signs both the XML message and 
the digest with the user's private key."

Actually, the user creates a manifest (i.e., SignedInfo) of references to 
the objects being secured and their digest values. This manifest itself is 
then digested and cryptographically signed. The first digest captures the  
"fingerprint" of the files being secured. The second digest is over the 
first set (and retains their import) but also includes security information 
(such as the signature algorithm). This value is then bound to a private 
key via a cryptographic signature algorithm.

The two important points here are that:
1. The two step: digesting the digest values is an easy way to collectively 
process a collection of resources.
2. A cryptographic signature is a computionally expensive procedure that 
binds some data with a private key. Applying this procedure to the data 
would be expensive and unnecessary. For the purposes of signature, I can 
"sign" the data's digest value just as well.
