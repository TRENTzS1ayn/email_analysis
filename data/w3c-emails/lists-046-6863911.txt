I understand both of these example, in which the namespace is
eitehr explicitly declared in the Signature element or inherited,
but the XML DSIG DTD states the following:

   <!ATTLIST Signature  
    xmlns   CDATA   #FIXED 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#'
    Id      ID  #IMPLIED >

And #FIXED means that if the xmlns is omitted, it will take the value of
specified above.  This would lead me to believe that the xmlns attribute
does NOT explicitly need to be included or inherited.  Although this does
disturb me.  Can anyone set me straight?

Thanks!
Terence
