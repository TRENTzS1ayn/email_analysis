I guess that there is a bit confusion between the XML Information Set and 
the serialized form of XML: Given a document which does *not* explicitly 
specify the xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#" in a <Signature> 
element. If you parse this document, the namespace NODE *is* there, even if 
you don't see it in the serialized form (which is only octets). But the 
node (in the XPath data model) MUST be there.

My personal opinion is that it's a bad idea to omit namespace declarations 
from an XML instance and to hope that the gaps are filled by a validating 
parser. Omitting things (like default attributes) and then creating 
signatures is not that nice, because a signature should be explicit on what 
was signed.

The DTD above is included in the dsig spec as during the creation of this 
spec, schemas were not fully finished.
