To reswap in the context, I went back and had a look at this thread:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2002AprJun/0293.html
and the answers still seem reasonable, but let's have a look! <smile/>

I agree with Christian that (1) the abstract representation 
(XPath/Information Set) item will always be associated with the namespace, 
and (2) that it isn't good to rely upon implicit defaults. However, one 
qualification on the XML Schema point. While we started out using a DTD, we 
did migrate to using schema's (because of these and related problems with 
DTDs) and, as the REC says, the schema is  normative, not the DTD. 

We wanted to clearly place these element types in a namespace, but we didn't 
want to dicate exactly *where* those declarations have to appear. (For 
example, to accomodate your example in which the declaration appears in a 
ancestor). The best way we could represent this in the DTD was to use 
#FIXED.
