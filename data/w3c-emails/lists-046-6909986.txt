Christian:

Excellent point.  As you point out, the presence of the xmlns attribute
in the Signature element in the Information Set vs the serialized version
means different things.  

If it happens to be ommited in the serialized (marshalled) XML,
that does NOT exlude it from the Information Set.  Although I agree the
ommission
would be considered a poor practice.

Regardless, the presence or absence in the serialization is irrelevant
in the context of the actual signature since the Signature element is not
actually
hashed, only the canonical version of the SignedInfo is subject to the
crypto.

Thanks for making me realize that my question was one primarily of style and
not
cryptographic significance!
