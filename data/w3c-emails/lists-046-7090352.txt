The RFCs specify that leading or trailing spaces in Distinguished names are
escaped with \20, and the 00-1F are always escaped, but is it invalid if an
escaped space appears in the middle of the string?

That is:

" o=My Org "

is supposed to become:

"\20o=My Org\20"

but should:

"\20o=My\20Org\20"

therefore be required or allowed or rejected?
