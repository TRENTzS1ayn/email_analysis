In order to address concerns with spam and public archives, the W3C has made 
a nifty tool available that I'm going to move to for these lists. This will 
allow us to avoid spam and for me, as admin, a bounce resulting from that 
spam for every list I own, some forged emails, and to avoid demands that 
email be removed from archives.

The difference is that when you post your *first* message after the new tool 
is turned on, you will have to agree to have that (and subsequent) messages 
go to the list and be archived. After that, same as it ever was!  If 
interested, more info is at:
