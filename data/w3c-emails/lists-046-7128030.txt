OASIS Members Propose Digital Signature Services Technical Committee.

OASIS members have proposed a new Digital Signature Services Technical
Committee to develop techniques to support the processing of digital
signatures. According to the proposal, the DSS technical committee will
define an interface for requesting that a web service produce and/or verify
a digital signature on a given piece of data and techniques for proving
that a signature was created within its private key validity period.
