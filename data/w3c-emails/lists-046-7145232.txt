Someone recently pointed out to me that the W3C XML Signature Recommendation 
contains the following references, which contains a location that no longer 
works:

DSS
  FIPS PUB 186-2 . Digital Signature Standard (DSS). U.S. Department
  of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology.
  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips186-2/fips186-2.pdf

It appears that in October 2001 FIPS186-2 was updated with an appendix that 
contains some constraints and recommendations with respect to security 
concerns:
  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips186-2/fips186-2-change1.pdf

However, the XML Signature Recommendation was published in February of 2002. 
I know the original link worked at that time. I don't know when the 
original specification was removed, what NIST's 
obsoletion/deprecation/revision policy is, nor what the removal means 
except that we now have a bad reference.

What do people think? Should we:
1. Ask NIST to maintain the URI, but update it saying that that version is 
obsoleted by a new revision?
2. Let it be?
3.. Add an erratum to our own specification?
