Sorry, I was not aware of that. We are retaining 'shorthand pointer'
as the normative term, but now define it using:

    A shorthand pointer, formerly known as a barename, consists of
    an NCName alone.

Please let us know as soon as possible if this is unsatisfactory, as
we are scheduled for a PR review this coming week. 

Thanks,
