Joseph,

A nice and useful document!

Considering that the need for such views and clarifications could be
extended to French speaking readers, we've published a translation on
XMLfr (respecting the usual rules for W3C translations and expressing
your point that this document is not official but personal thoughts):

http://xmlfr.org/w3c/2002/10/xsec-refactoring.html

Thanks!

Eric
