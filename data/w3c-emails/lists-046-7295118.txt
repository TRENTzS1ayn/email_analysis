Abstract

      XML Signature [XML-DSig] recommends a standard means for specifying
      information content to be digitally signed and for representing the
      resulting digital signatures in XML. Some applications require the
      ability to specify a subset of a given XML document as the
      information content to be signed. The XML Signature specification
      meets this requirement with the XPath transform. However, this
      transform can be difficult to implement efficiently with existing
      technologies. This specification defines a new XML Signature
      transform to facilitate the development of efficient document
      subsetting implementations that interoperate under similar
      performance profiles.

Status of this document

      This document is the W3C XML Signature XPath-Filter 2.0
      Recommendation. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and
      other interested parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a
      W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as
      reference material or cited as a normative reference from another
      document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw
      attention to the specification and to promote its widespread
      deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of
      the Web.

      This specification was produced by the IETF/W3C XML Signature
      Working Group (W3C Activity Statement) which believes the
      specification is sufficient for the creation of independent
      interoperable implementations as demonstrated in the
      Interoperability Report.

      Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on
      the Working Group's patent disclosure page, in conformance with W3C
      policy, and the IETF Page of Intellectual Property Rights Notices,
      in conformance with IETF policy. At the time of publication, there
      are no declarations specific to this document.

      Please report errors in this document to w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org
      (archive).

      The list of known errors in this specification is available at

      The English version of this specification is the only normative
      version. Information about translations of this document (if any)
