Hi Andrew,

Not directly.  All of the text in an element is gathered as one text node as far as Xpath filtering is concerned.  Your application is free to put this extra information into the message element before signing, though.

Yes, I just want to sign part of one xml elementary element instead of
the whole element. But I'm not sure whether XML Signature standards
permit this.

Thank you, Christian!

Andrew
