Subject: [OASIS members] XACML public review


On behalf of the co-chairs of the TC, I am pleased to announce that the 
OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Technical 
Committee has voted unanimously to approve its XACML 1.0 document as a 
Committee Specification.

The XACML TC also voted to begin the process of moving the specification 
to an OASIS Standard by initiating a 30-day public review period with 
respect to the XACML 1.0 Committee Specification, in accordance with 
Section 2 of the OASIS Technical Committee Process document 
(http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/process.shtml).

The public review period extends from
      Friday, November 8, 2002, until
      Sunday, December 8, 2002 (inclusive).

The specification and accompanying schema documents may be found at
