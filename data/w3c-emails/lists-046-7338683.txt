Peoples,

I have been doing some stuff on using the Apache DOM parser and XSLT engine (C versions) to build an implementation of the XML Signature standard.

One thing of interest has just come up around XPath and the here() function.  In particular the XPath implementation is used as a basis for XSLT and only allows External functions (such as here()) to be installed if they are namespace qualified.  Which means that it won't process the here() function when it is presented as an NCName.

Given their are at least two definitions of here() (Signature and XPointer - both currently with the same semantics) should XML Signature define the here function as part of the DSIG namespace?

Cheers,
    Berin
