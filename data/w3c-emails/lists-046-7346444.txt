Hi Berin, I haven't encountered this issue before. You are right that the 
function is a QName:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#NT-FunctionName
  [35]   FunctionName   ::=  QName - NodeType 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#ns-qualnames
  [6] QName ::=  (Prefix ':')? LocalPart

At this point, I'm not sure how we would do that, but since the semantics 
with XPtr are the same -- something we coordinated on -- does your 
implementation also require the xptr:here()?  In the future, I think this 
is something folks should be cognizant of, but it's not causing an interop 
problem presently is it?
