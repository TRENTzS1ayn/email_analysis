Hi Joseph,

Thanks for your comments. They are much appreciated.

I had edited the published version of the article within a few days of
receipt of your comments. However I didn't notify you and the XML Signature
list of the edits in the article. That was a mistake. Please excuse me for
the same.

The problematic paragraph has been changed from:

When a user wants to sign an XML document, there is a two step procedure.
First, the user digests the XML file to be signed and produces a digest
value. Secondly, the user signs both the XML message and the digest with
 the user's private key.

to read as follows:

When a user wants to sign an XML document, there is a two step procedure.
First, the user digests the XML file to be signed and produces a digest
value. Secondly, the user signs a reference to the XML message and the
digest with the user's private key.

The change is in the third sentence where the words "both the" have been
replaced with the words "a reference to".

The article can be viewed at:
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/09/18/c14n.html

I hope it serves.

Bet regards,
Bilal
