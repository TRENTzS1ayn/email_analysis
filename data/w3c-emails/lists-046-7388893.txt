The PrefixList is defined to be of type NMTOKENS, but the # character is not allowed according to the XML rule for NmToken.

This can be fixed in one of two ways:

1) Change from NMTOKENS to CDATA

2) Change from # to :

The latter approach is reasonable because namespace prefixes do not contain a colon.  This would allow us to keep the NMTOKENS content model.  However, according to Joseph Reagle, the use of #default is designed to profile XSLT.
