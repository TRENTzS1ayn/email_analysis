Yes, I agree too.  The DTD says CDATA, but should the schema be
xsd:string, or should it be the longer and more precise content
specifier I posted yesterday?

I agree with Joseph that we should fix the DTD rather than changing
the name "#default" since this influences already existing implemen-
tations of EC14N.
