Interesting question, from the text my initial reading is that an "implicit 
same-document reference" is not precluded. If fact, I'd expect this might 
be common in the context of implicit references.

While an interesting question, is this motivated by an actual example? I'm 
wondering about the interop implications of this. For example, if I had a 
signature with an implicit reference to a node-set, the first transform  
might require a node-set for processing. Is this a problem? I don't see how 
as the other side is already expected to know what the initial object is 
(i.e., node-set).
