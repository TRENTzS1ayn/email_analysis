Hi Joseph,

The prime motivation is that two XForms editors independently said they were curious why the DSig group did not use the more formal specification.  Since it is possible to precisely say what we mean, I had no technical answer.  But if the answer is consistency with XSLT's definition, then I would be fine with that.

A secondary motivation is that, while I don't see a really good reason for being more precise, a fairly lengthy amount of implementation experience has shown me that the decision to be less precise often has a way of coming back to provide some really painful experiences.  Still, in this case, the fact that we are somewhat constrained by people who have only DTD and not schema provides some reasonable justification for not going that extra mile.  Consistency would be another reason (i.e. if such a level of precision does not match what was done everywhere else in the DSig related products, then it's probably not a good idea to introduce that in this one case).

What is the motivation for the longer/precise defintion? My preference is 
not to create a new data type in the errata, but just rely upon string 
since that what schema and xslt seem to do for their "#foo" tokens.
