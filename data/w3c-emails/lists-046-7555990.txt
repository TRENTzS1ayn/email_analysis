These types of discussions have been considered by lawyers and technologists working within the American Bar Association. To summarize views as a lawyer:

Proof of origin is established by a digital signature. Where XML is signed, this function is performed by XML DSIG.

Proof of non-tampering is established by the same source.

Proof of content can be further established by a trusted timestamping authority.

Proof of intent (the subject of this posting) is best determined from the social and human context rather than any automated means such as a certificate non-repudiation bit. To add to the ideas of the posting, how does one distinguish an autograph from a signature intending to bind a person to a document, either in the paper world or the electronic world? The answer is look at the content. What was said? But that is not a signature function, it is a legal construction issue based upon the objective expression of human intent, indicating the posting is really off-topic for XML Signatures.

The last piece of the puzzle is to bind the human identity of the subscriber to the private key which was used to sign the XML. This establishes the identity of the person over and above the machine or network location of the machine or device which was used to sign.

In the eNotary TC of LegalXML Oasis, this issue is being vetted with a goal to creating a syntax that can be included within the signed XML data or an X-509 certificate extension (or both) in order to provide a shorthand way to express equivalent or disparate registration procedures employed by various RA's and their legal significance in machine readable ways. This is intended to enable relying parties to "mix and match" brands and types of certificates in order to perform their due diligence and reduce their own liability in connection with certificate usage.

With these points covered, XML digital signatures can be made a perfectly appropriate means for creating electronic signatures on XML data for any and all legal purposes.

Best regards and holiday wishes to all.
