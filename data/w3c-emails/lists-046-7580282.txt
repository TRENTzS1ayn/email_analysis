Very.  With its References model, a single signing ceremony can cover
as many "external" items (XML and opaque bytestream), as needed in order
to achieve the necessary legal requirements.

Personally, I've given up worrying about impossibilities like digital
non-repudiation.  Since a scrawl on a faxed letterhead can be a binding
contract, in case of dispute it can always come down to human intent.
