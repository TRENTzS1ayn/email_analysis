Alexey,
 
I am quite sure that "1. normalize line feeds" means what you can read
in XML 1.0 Second Edition in
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-line-ends
 
Right, John?

Liebe Gruesse/Regards,

Subject: line feed normalization in C14N


Hi, All!

I have a question about line feed normalization in C14N. The spec says
that :

    http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#Terminology

    -  All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding
characters removed during 
    line feed normalization)   
    
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#DataModel 

    If an XML document must be converted to a node-set, XPath REQUIRES
that 
    an XML processor be used to create the nodes of its data model to
fully represent 
    the document. The XML processor performs the following tasks in
order:

1.normalize line feeds 

2.... 

During discussion in xmlsec mailing list we came up with two
possibilities:
    1) All '\r' characters from the document should be removed when
document is parsed 
    by XML processor.
    2) All '\r' should be converted to "&#D;" by the parser.

I would appreciate if someone can clarify this part of the
specification.

Thank you in advance,
Aleksey Sanin
