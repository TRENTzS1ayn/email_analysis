Gregor,

Thanks for your response! I would also think this way but I am confused by
the following quote from C14N spec:

    -  All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding 
characters removed during
    line feed normalization)  

which makes me think that '\r' characters are deleted and not replaced. 
I was
also told that Microsoft .NET implementation deletes '\r' characters 
(and this
caused incompatibility with xmlsec).


Aleksey
