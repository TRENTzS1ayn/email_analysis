Tamura-san,
We also found a problem.  Signatures contained in a SOAP message like this:

<soapenv:Envelope 
xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" ...>
   <SOAP:Header xmlns:SOAP="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" ...>
   </SOAP:Header>
   <SOAP:Body xmlns:SOAP="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" ...>
   </SOAP:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

Did not work.  We had to use the exact same NS prefix:

<SOAP:Envelope xmlns:SOAP="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" ...>
   <SOAP:Header> ... </SOAP:Header>
   <SOAP:Body> ... </SOAP:Body>
</SOAP:Envelope>


I think this is related to the C14N problem Aleksey reported.
What do you think?
