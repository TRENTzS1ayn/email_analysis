I just have had a look at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718, and found
two problems, one of them i18n-related.


1) encoding underspecified?

The exclusive canonical form of a document subset is a physical 
representation of the XPath node-set, as an octet sequence, produced by the 
method described in this specification.

This does not at all say what the encoding is. Is this UTF-8? If yes,
where is this specified? If no, what is the encoding? Is the reader
supposed to go check elsewhere?


2) what is 'visible'?

The document says "namespace nodes that are not on the InclusiveNamespaces
PrefixList are expressed only in start tags where they are visible and if
they are not in effect from an output ancestor of that tag."
The word 'visible' turns up only one more time, again not in a defining
context. Readers probably can work out what 'visible' is supposed to
mean from context and examples, but that's not how a spec should work,
I guess.


Regards,    Martin.
