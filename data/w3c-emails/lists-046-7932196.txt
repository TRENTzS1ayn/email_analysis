Martin,

It sounds like you're reading the Introduction, rather than the Specification
which is in Section 3 of the document. Section 3 begins "The data model,
processing, input parameters, and output data for Exclusive XML Canonicalization
are the same as for Canonical XML [XML-C14N] with the following exceptions",
indicating that encoding (along with everything else) is as defined in C14N,
i.e. UTF-8. Also in Section 3, the handling of namespaces nodes is specified
using the term "visibly utilized", which is clearly defined in the document. I
guess the paragraph in the introduction uses "visible" as shorthand for "visibly
utilized". The supporting and non-normative sections of the document are a
little loosely worded, but the spec is, while quite terse, pretty well defined
IMHO.

Ari
