I found that very clear.
IIRC exc-c14n defers to c14n which specifies UTF-8,
I'll check ...
"The exclusive canonical form ...

is as defined in the Canonical XML Recommendation [XML-C14N] except ..."


and following the link
UTF-8 is in the first bullet point in the definition of canonical form in 
section 1.1.

Once again I found that clear: #def-visibly-utilizes is the anchor.
I suppose the reader is meant to link visible and visibly
