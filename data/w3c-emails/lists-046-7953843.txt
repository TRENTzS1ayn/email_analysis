Hey Martin, one has to chase it a bit:

| http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#sec-Specification
| The data model, processing, input parameters, and output data for 
| Exclusive XML Canonicalization are the same as for Canonical 
| XML [XML-C14N] with the following exceptions

| http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#ProcessingModel
| The XPath node-set is converted into an octet stream, the canonical 
| form, by generating the representative UCS characters for each node in 
| the node-set in ascending document order, then encoding the result 
| in UTF-8 (without a leading byte order mark).

I suppose we should've been more careful with those terms and linked to the 
following definition:

| http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#def-visibly-utilizes
| An element E in a document subset visibly utilizes a namespace
| declaration, i.e. a namespace prefix P and bound value V, if E or an
| attribute node in the document subset with parent E has a qualified name
| in which P is the namespace prefix. A similar definition applies for an
| element E in a document subset that visibly utilizes the default namespace
| declaration, which occurs if E has no namespace prefix.

Basically, does any of the subset actually need that namespace?
