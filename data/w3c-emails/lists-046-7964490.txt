It means this:
     for all xmlns:XXX in the element
        IF xmlns:XXX not already in output with the same value
        and (one of the element's attributes uses the XXX namespace 
prefix OR the XXX prefix is in the PrefixList)
        THEN
             output the xmlns:XXX declaration
        FI
      END FOR
