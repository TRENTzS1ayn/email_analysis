Thanks to you and others for pointing this out. This seems to be okay.

Given the terseness and precision of the specification, it seems to me
a bad idea to use both 'visible' and 'visibly utilized' with the same
meaning, even more so as it turns out that 'visibly utilized' is already
defined before 'visible' is used.

I guess it wouldn't hurt to fix this in an erratum.
