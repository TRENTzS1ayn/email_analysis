This is what I did above... Oh, there's probably a terminology issue 
involved? A canonicalization algorithm *is* a transform. It's a transform 
that's understood to create a canonical form without incidental variances 
(under some applications definition of "incidental"); these particular 
types of transforms can be applied against SignedInfo as well -- while 
generic multi-step transform processes can't. So with this said, what 
exactly did you mean?

But, if I understand correctly, you don't want to require schema validation? 
(Otherwise, SchemaCentic c14n might be worth consideration?

No, just a heads up that if you include the DTD/schema within one of your 
own, you should use the corrected version.
