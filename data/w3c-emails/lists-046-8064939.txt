I'm not sure this would be a good thing, as it would pretty much require 
vendors to implement both.  I prefer the URI, and suggesting including 
XSLT as a non-normative appendix.  Advanced tricks like joseph mentioned 
(lookahead for common XSLT transforms) can be ipmlemented by recognizing 
  the transform uri.
