Oh he--.  This points out a slippery slope.

As it says, exclusive canonicalization is meant to address issues that 
come up when a signed message is packaged/enveloped.  Since the 
SignedInfo element itself is subject to the same package/enveloping 
issues, then one might want c14n-excl on  the SignedInfo element. But 
since you can't do arbitrary transforms, then each time you want to 
mix-and-match, you have to define a new URI that represents that 
combination.

Ugh.  Kiss interop goodbye.
