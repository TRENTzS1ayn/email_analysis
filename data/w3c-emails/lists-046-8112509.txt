Ah, so   http://www.w3.org/2002/11/sm-c14n-foo is defined as:
  1. http://www.w3.org/2002/11/sm-c14n
  2. http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#

I don't feel too strongly about that, though I think I prefer the 
explicitness of the two steps such that people don't end up have two 
different ways to express the same thing...
