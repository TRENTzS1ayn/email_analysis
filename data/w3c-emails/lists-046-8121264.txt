I feel like I understand Marc, but I'm not following you Rich.

This is true. However I don't think any of the conditions in [1] apply to 
SignedInfo. So SOAP Message Canonicalization would never have to be used 
over a SignedInfo.

Even if SOAP Message Canonicalization needed to be used against SignedInfo, 
then that argues for a single URI. But I don't see how that affects 
interop.
