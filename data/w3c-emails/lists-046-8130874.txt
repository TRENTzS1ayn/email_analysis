Sorry, I'll try again.  I agree that &dsig:SignedInfo is unlikely to 
ever need soap-c14n.  But Marc mentioned defining a new URI that is a 
combination of two other c14n methods since SignedInfo doesn't take a 
Transforms element.  I was just pointing out that if this becomes common 
practice, we're gonna be in trouble, interop-wise.

Make sense?
