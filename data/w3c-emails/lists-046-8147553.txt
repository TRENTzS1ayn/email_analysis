No, I disagree.  If you make it a URI then it is easy for XSLT folks to 
recognize that URI and call the built-in transform.  It is also easy for 
code-based folks to call their built-in subroutine. If you make it a 
transform, then both folks will have to do some serious work (e.g., 
canonicalize!) the transform to see if it's the special-case applies.

The simplest thing for all implementors is URI with non-normative 
transform as an appendix.
