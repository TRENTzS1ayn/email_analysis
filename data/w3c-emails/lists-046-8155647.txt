I think we may be having a terminology problem here. What I meant by 
'casting the soap-c14n spec as a transform' was to remove the 'and then 
do exclusive c14n' step from the spec text (leaving the textual 
description of what to do to the SOAP message infoset) and discuss it 
instead in terms of a DSIG transform. I'd still assign a URI to the 
resulting algorithm.

An actual XSLT could be included in a non-normative appendix as a 
example implementation.

Make sense ?
