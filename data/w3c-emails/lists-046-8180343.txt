The OASIS Digital Signature Services Technical Committee (DSS TC) was
established to develop techniques to support the processing of digital
signatures.  Our charter and additional TC information is available at
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dss/.  Our deliverables include:

1.  an XML-based protocol, including a time stamping protocol, providing a
method or methods of proving that a key was used during its validity period,

2.  a SOAP binding for the protocol elements in 1), 
3.  a WS-Security profile for the elements in 1), 
4.  an interface for a digital signature creation web service, 
5.  an interface for a digital signature verification web service. 

The TC is currently gathering use cases and requirements which will guide
our work and help us decide from among a number of current input documents.
Because our work is closely related to the work of the XML Signature WG,
this group was seen as a potential source of both use cases and
requirements.  Thus I would like to invite members of the XML Signature WG
to submit any relevant use cases and requirements for a digital signature
creation or verification web service, or for a time stamping web service, to
the OASIS DSS TC.

OASIS members can submit use cases and requirements to the DSS TC's private
email address.  Non-OASIS members can use our public comment list.  Either
list requires that you be a subscriber in order to post messages.  Mailing
list information is available at
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dss/#mailing.  If you do not wish to
subscribe to either of these lists, feel free to send them to me at
robert.zuccherato@entrust.com and I will make sure that the TC gets them.

Thank you,

Robert Zuccherato
DSS TC Chair
