Correct.  SOAP does not ever depend on schema validation, though 
applications of SOAP may choose to validate.  SOAP does in certain places 
describe the semantics of a message without attribute "A" as being the 
same as a similar message with some particular explicit value for 
attribute A.  This equivalence is NOT normatively explained as resulting 
from defaulting by a schema.

I think not, for the reason stated above.  The equivalence classes for 
SOAP messages are not in general defined by schema.
