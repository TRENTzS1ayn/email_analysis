All,

Please find attached a new version of the SOAP message canonicalization 
specification. This implements the suggestion to recast the algorithm 
as a transform to enable composition with existing and future 
transformations and canonicalization methods.

The current plan is for the XML Protocol WG to publish this 
specification as a W3C Note and then possibly move it onto a 
recommendation track, subject to the group being suitably rechartered, 
in the future.

Any further comments much appreciated.

Regards,
Marc.
