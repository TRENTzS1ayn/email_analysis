OK, will do.

I don't intend to imply that it could be used as a  
CanonicalizationMethod, perhaps the sentence should be reworded as:

"It is always used in conjunction with a CanonicalizationMethod (e.g.  
XML Canonicalization [XML C14N] or Exclusive XML Canonicalization [EXCL  
C14N]) and may also be used in conjunction with other Transform  
algorithms1."

Does that make it clearer ?

Hmmm, I see your point. I was using canonicalization in its broader  
sense. I'd prefer to keep the current name but I could probably live  
with something like "SOAP Message Normalization (soap-n11n)" - I think  
'Identity Transform' could be confusing since it would imply that  
nothing is changed which is true semantically but not lexically.
