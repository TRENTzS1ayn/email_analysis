I think the bit that is confusing me is you are using the 
'CanonicalizationMethod' element name, so I read that as it can be used 
with that element. If you replaced 'CanonicalizationMethod' with 
'canonicalization algorithm' that source of confusion goes away! <smile/>

Message Normalization sounds good to me.
