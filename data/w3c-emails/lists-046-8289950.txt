This email is notice that a Chair of the xmldsig WG has received information 
from Tom Gosner of DocuTouch/NetUPDATE about a patent claim that *might* be 
relevant to our completed work. 

Such information should *not* be sent to the Chairs but to the appropriate 
parties/lists as specified by IETF/W3C process. However, Mr. Gosner has 
failed to make these disclosures as I requested on December 17th. 
Consequently, I'm disclosing the little information I know (below) in the 
context of the following policy:
   Neither the [8]IESG/IETF or the [9]W3C take a position
   regarding (1) the validity or scope of any intellectual property right
   or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation
   or use of the technology, nor (2) the extent to which any license
   under such rights might or might not be available.
