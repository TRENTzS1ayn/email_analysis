   Are there any GUI based tool, which will produce
a XML document which signs a set of binary files,
by producing an XML document, which has references
to these files.

   www.w3.org web site lists a bunch of toolkits. But
what Iam looking for is a GUI based tool.

    Iam not sure whether this is a right forum for
such questions. If not, my apologies, & please let me
know if there is any appropriate forum.

thanks
Joseph
