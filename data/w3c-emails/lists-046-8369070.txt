Many implementations actually provide more than one of the differnet 
forms in the same signature.  Yes, the certificate includes all the 
other data, but it requires a fairly heavy-duty ASN1/DER parser. 
Breaking out the alternate "lookup keys" is just "friendly," as it were.

That's a local trust issue, and depends on your implementation and
