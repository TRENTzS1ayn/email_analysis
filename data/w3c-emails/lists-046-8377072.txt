     Since the signature value on the signature node only covers the
signed info element, the individual x.509 elements present in the
key info is not signed at all. In that case, how can these values be
trusted, unless it is cross verified with x.509 certificate.

       Wont it be possible for a hacker to intercept the XML document
and add these individual x.509 elements which is not consistent with
x.509 certicate and change the signed info as he pleases.
