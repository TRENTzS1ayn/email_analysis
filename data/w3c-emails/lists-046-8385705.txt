Right, you don't trust them.  You either use the info as lookup keys 
into your own set of keys/certs that you do trust, or you use the cert, 
etc., information in the signature, and validate it up to a trust anchor 
(CA) that you do trust.

If you just naively accept whatever credentials are in the certificate, 
then all you can do is *verify the signature.*  The process of 
determining if you trust the identity of the signer is often called 
*validating the credentials.*

Both things must happen.  XMLDSIG defines the semantics of verification; 
validation is a local policy and implementation issue.
