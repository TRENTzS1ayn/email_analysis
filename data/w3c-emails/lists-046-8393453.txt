Well, IMHO this is an other case of what Joseph calls
"the "Frankenstein Complex" [1].
X.509 elements could  contain "signed object" in some PKCS way (PKCS#1 
if  I rember well), but we dont' want to know about ASN.1 stuff, it 's 
(probably) a XKMS task ... so we could only infer something on the 
validity not on the trust of a signature.
