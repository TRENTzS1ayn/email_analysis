That's what I mean.

I do not believe that two random business organizations will find each 
other through a third-party directory and starting doing business.  It 
will either be a closed trading organization (various marketplaces), a 
risk/trust service like Identrus, or similar.  In which case, all 
parties will just have the root of their umbrella organization, and 
everyone will cache certs for the "Level 1" CA's as they find them.

Only if you think it's gonna happen.  I don't.  At best, dynamic 
discovery will happen within the enterprise behind the firewall 
underneath a single trust domain.  On the public Internet?  Never.  Who 
will assume the liability for (among other things) fraudelent identity?

Loosely coupled, tightly contracted.
