Signature validation might be performed by a third-party service that 
has no knowledge of the signer identities; separating authentication 
from authorization.  Perhaps it might help if you think of validation as 
a tri-state: trusted, untrusted, and indeterminate.

unsigned data in its operations, and that can be hacked.  I agree.  But 
that's irrelevant here.
