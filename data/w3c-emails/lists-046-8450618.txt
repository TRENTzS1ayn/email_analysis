I think the current focus is more on interoperablity than on attack 
prevention.  "I know we don't have a global interoperable PKI, so here's 
everything I can think of to send you so that you'll be able to validate 
the signature.  We'll use SSL across organizational boundaries to guard 
against something editing KeyInfo elements."  I know that we tend to see 
more signatures with both X509Certificate *and* X509IssuerSerial than 
without.

But that's my opinion, and no more valid thans yours.
