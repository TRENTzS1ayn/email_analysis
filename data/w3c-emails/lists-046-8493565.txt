I'm not sure what you mean by "based on", but if one accepts Francois's 
interpretation -- these chars are already excluded -- does anything have to 
change in c14n? The c14n for a text node takes the string value of the 
XPath text node and escapes '#xD', '<', and '>', but if these are precluded 
characters from the start, they wouldn't have appeared in an XPath text 
node, right?
