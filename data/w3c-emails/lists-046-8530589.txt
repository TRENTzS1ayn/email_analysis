Hi Jacques,

from what I see, the document you cite is from July 1997. I don't know what 
Mr. Kaliski and Mr. Kingdon want to express by saying "basis".

(1) XML Signature relies on X.509 certificates for representing --well-- 
X.509 certificates.

(2) It does *not* use PKCS#7 as message syntax format.

(3) If you look at <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/#ref-PKCS1>, it cites 
PKCS#1 as XML Signature uses RSA, but that's all.

Kind regards,
Christian
