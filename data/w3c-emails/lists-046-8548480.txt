I suppose if you wanted to you could argue that there is some sort of 
logical equivalence to an X509Data element with certificates and CRLs in 
it and a PKCS#7 structure but that is pretty feeble.

There is also the pkcs7SignedData element defined in 
draft-eastlake-xmldsig-uri-03.txt but that is quite explicitly not part 
of any W3C Recommendation.

Thanks,
Donald
