Two comments:

1) I don't think this has anything to do with the CharData production in XML
1.0 being confusing or not.  It looks like an ugly bug in Xerces which
misinterpets U+201A as illegal because its memory representation (in UTF-16
or UTF-32, presumably) contains the byte 0x1A.  I hope this bug does not
extend beyond the part of the code that checks the CharData production...

2) [Process] This doesn't concern the xml-editor list, which is not a
discussion list, anymore, so I removed it from the recipients.
