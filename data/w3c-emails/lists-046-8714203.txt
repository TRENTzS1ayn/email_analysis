Subject: Draft XACML Profile for use of XMLDSig
Date: Friday 28 March 2003 10:08
From: Anne Anderson <Anne.Anderson@Sun.com>
To: w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org
Cc: XACML TC <xacml@lists.oasis-open.org>

Colleagues,

The OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC
has drafted a profile for the use of XML DSig with XACML schema
instances (policies, authorization decision requests, and
authorization decision responses).  The profile tries to be
consistent with the SAML profile wherever possible.  This profile
has been through two rounds of TC review, and we are now seeking
comments from a wider community.  A copy of the draft profile is
attached.

Please send comments either to xacml-comment@lists.oasis-open.org
or to Anne.Anderson@Sun.com

Thank you,
Anne Anderson
