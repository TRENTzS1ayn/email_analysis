It's rule 3, with an earlier sentence in mind, "A similar definition applies 
for an element E in a document subset that visibly utilizes the default 
namespace declaration, which occurs if E has no namespace prefix." I can 
see where you got confused; however, as hard as I try I can't easily 
reformulate rule 3 to include this caveat every time the term "prefix" is 
used without making it completely unreadable. Consequently, I propose this 
imperfect eratum with the expectation that should a second revision ever 
issue, we'll need to maybe introduce a new defined term or re-structure 
these rules to better express our intent:
