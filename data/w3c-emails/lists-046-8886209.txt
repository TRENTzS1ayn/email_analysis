Thanks Joseph, for adding the erratum.
But as you said, it would be nice to restructure the rules to include
the same, especially because this is an issue with the core part of the
specification.

Suggestion : I think, merging the same with rule-3 may not be easy,
but of course you can add a separate rule.

Thanks once again,

regards,
Sijo
