Hi Andrew,

Cited from [1]:

 3.3.13 integer
 [Definition:]   integer is .derived. from decimal by fixing the 
 value of .fractionDigits. to be 0. This results in the standard
 mathematical concept of the integer numbers. The .value space. 
 of integer is the infinite set {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}. The .base
 type. of integer is decimal. 

I conclude from this definition that  the schema type integer can
be used to hold integers of arbitrary length.

Liebe Gruesse/Regards,
