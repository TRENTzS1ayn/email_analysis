Hi,
The answer to this question may be in the XML signature documentation, but I
could not find it.
I am a bit confused as to what parts of the signed document are exactly
canonicalised. Section 4.2.1 states that the "CanonicalizationMethod is a
required element that specifies the canonicalization algorithm applied to
the SignedInfo element prior to performing signature calculations".

But what about the method being applied to elements prior to digest
calculations. Would not a slight variation in the bits of these elements
(the reason for the canonical transform) produce different digests? Are the
elements, for which digests are calculated, also passed thru a canonical
transform prior to digest calculation?

Thanks,
Tarun.
