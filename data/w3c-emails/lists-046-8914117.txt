That's correct. Canonicalizing SignedInfo is all the
CanonicalizationMethod is used for.

You need to read up on the data pipeline. Remember, the data retrieved
from the URL in the Reference is passed through any Transforms and, even
more important, subject to default transformations on its was to
becoming the octet stream that is digested. If the URL is, for example,
an "ftp://" URL or something else that returns an octet string, no
conversion is neede and the data just gets directly digested. On the
other hand, if you have a same document reference, like "#foo", then
that reference yields an XPATH node set which must be serialized into an
octet stream before it can be digested. This serialization process
defaults to using Canonical XML. If you want some other canonicalization
in this case, you need to specify it as a Transform.
