Hello Joseph,

I have removed the RDF Core WG and the I18N IG because this doesn't
really concern them.

It wasn't intended as a requirement, just as an idea.

Yes, that's the idea.

Well, I don't know all the cases and how they might work. But it may
turn out that this is the easiest way to pass the information.
Just handing over a file is much easier than handing over a file
and some other information for which there might or might not be
a defined format.

Which he still might have to do if my idea is not established as a convention.
