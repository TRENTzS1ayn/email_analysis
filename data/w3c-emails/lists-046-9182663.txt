Mark is correct about ECMAScript improvements. ECMAScript edition 3 is and 
will be for some time the current standard. There will be an add-on 
standard, ECMAScript for XML, that will add some language upgrades outside 
of its immediate scope, but no Unicode/I18N improvements.

However, the committee has considered the issue and decided, like Java/ICU 
and certainly many others, that it would be too disruptive to support 
supplementary code points with anything else but UTF-16 (up from 
effectively UCS-2). Most of the necessary work was done on this path but 
has been suspended now.

In addition to Java/ICU/ECMAScript, there are many other examples for 
16-bit Unicode, even on Linux. OpenOffice, the whole KDE/Qt stack, Opera, 
Mozilla, SAP, MacOS X, the Xerces XML parser suite implementing the 
standard XML DOM API, all use 16-bit Unicode, and many if not all support 
supplementary code points now. So far, I was counting Python, too. I need 
to follow the URL below.

My understanding is that the ECMAScript Unicode improvements have been
effectively put on hold, due to the loss of one of the leading
contributors due to the Netscape layoffs. I'm cc'ing Markus Scherer in
case he can add anything on that topic.
