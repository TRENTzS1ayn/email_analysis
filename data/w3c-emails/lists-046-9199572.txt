Hi Martin and others,

Whether the c14n spec is "incorrect or needs further qualification" regarding this character sequence issue is debatable to me.  It depends somewhat on the connotation of 'further qualification', which in the sentence comes across as 'almost incorrect' or 'partly mistaken'.

There is nothing mistaken about what c14n does.  It produces a canonical form for XML. Canonicalization in general is about picking one specific way of doing everything.  Regarding encoding, we picked one way: UTF-8.  We made this choice in part because encoding is part of the definition of XML 1.0 according to the Recommendation itself, so we wanted to pick one way of doing it.  We chose UTF-8 because it was the most supported encoding, as guaranteed by XML 1.0 itself.  We also made this choice because we wanted as a requirement be able to use the output of a canonicalizer as the input to a canonicalizer, thereby allowing statements like c14n(doc)==c14n(c14n(doc)).

Right now, you are discussing the use of other encodings because it is logically equivalent in your application context yet more efficient to do so, not because there is anything incorrect, in whole or in part, with the method by which the current c14n achieves its primary goal.

The fact that comparison of the UTF-16 encoding of an XML document might be equivalent to the UTF-8 encoding is an implementation detail.  As long as the implementer can guarantee that what they are doing is completely equivalent within the application context to comparing the results produced by C14N, then the implementer can choose to implement in this fashion.

I'm not seeking the addition of a new definition. I don't think it would
be appropriate to add new definitions without starting a new WD-REC
cycle, and I don't think this is important enough to do this.

I guess it comes sufficiently close, the 'further qualification'
seems quite adequate.

The current text is slightly problematic because it says 'without concern
for its encoding' and then goes straight on to mention UTF-16. UTF-16
indeed does not deal with octets, but it is still an encoding.
Also, this version of the text doesn't mention abstract modeling anymore.
It might also be better to replace 'may require' with 'may be better
served with'.


Regards,    Martin.
