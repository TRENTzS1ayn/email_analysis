Dear all,
 
we would like to report interop of a XML signature implementation for
Windows operating system (written entirely in C++). SETCCE has several
products and solutions based on XML signature and we have also provided
a demo of XSign product, which enables creating and verification of XML
signatures in Windows environment. Other solutions are e-business
oriented mainly developed for the purpose of business electronic
document (e.g. e-bill, e-contract...) generation, exchange, management
and archiving. Please feel free to explore our web site www.setcce.org
for more information. We would appreciate if a link to SETCCE's homepage
on W3C's XML signature site can be provided.
 
Best regards
 
Aleksej Blazic
