Hi,

I am a bit confused on how a RetrievalMethod with a URI of say 
'#myid' should be handled, could someone point out my error.

The spec says the URI is dereferenced as per a Reference URI. 
Section 4.3.3.2 says the result is the identified element + all 
descendants excluding comments. So, if no transforms are 
specified we have a nodeset of the identified element and its 
descendants. 

Section 4.4.3 then says the result for KeyInfo's that have an XML 
structure is an XML element. Clearly this is not the case for 
this example. Does this imply only certain forms of 
RetrievalMethod can be successfully processed, if so how do you 
determine what is valid and what is not. Perhaps the intent is 
that you use Type attribute to perform some form of validation 
on the result to see if matches your expectation for such a key?

I also noticed that the only test cases I have seen for this are 
supplying the key as an octet stream. Is this an indication that 
this scheme is not really used for keys in XML form?

Thanks,
Kevin
