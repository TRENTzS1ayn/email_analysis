Hi Aleksey,
 
The section that has the remark you don't like is 2.3, not 3.2.  
 
Section 2.2 identifies the information set derived from the input.  Section 2.3 provides the processing model that says what to write out based on that information set.  Specifically, the 'namespace nodes' bullet point you don't like is in a context which says "The text generated for a node is dependent on the node type and given in the following list:".
 
Taken in this context, the bullet point seems to make sense.  The bullet point is not intended to be taken out of context and moved to the prior section where the sorting of the input is described.  For the purpose of output, we assign the local name 'xmlns' because it would be clearly wrong to output for the default namespace attribute an empty string followed by an equal sign and a quoted URI.  Further, the text you quoted even clarifies what is going on by reminding the reader that, on input, the XPath data model uses an empty string for the local name.
