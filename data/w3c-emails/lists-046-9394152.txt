The issue here is not that the text is wrong, but that it can be made 
more explicit.  I'll note that I got it wrong (and I've done two 
implementation of C14N and EXC-C14N), as did Joseph, who helped with the 
Python implementation that is referenced on the W3C web page.

It may be as simple as adding "recall that" inside the parenthetical 
about XPath that appears in the bullet.  Or changing the parenthetical 
that appears at the end of 2.3 to explicitly reference XPath.

If you feel it's not worth it, then oh well:  at least this thread is 
now in the searchable open literature.
