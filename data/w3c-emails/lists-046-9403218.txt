Hi, John!

Your explanation makes perfect sense and this is exactly how I 
understood the
spec when I wrote the code. However, in both sections (sorry for 2.3 -> 
3.2 confusion :) )
we are talking about "local name of the default namespace node" and this 
might
confuse people. Thisis why I think that it would probably be a good idea 
to put your
explanation in the eratra and clearly state that section 2.2 describes 
local name
for default namespace node for sorting purposes and section 2.3 says how 
to render
local name for default namespace node.
