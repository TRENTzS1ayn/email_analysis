I believe Jose Kahan (copied) has now assumed Joseph's responsibilities wrt
XML Signature.

Hi Rich and Aleksey,

It couldn't hurt to add a clarification.  Given the way it was read, if I
were to write the sentence again now, it would seem that the best fix would
be to

change '...except assign the local name xmlns to the default namespace
node...'

to '...except write xmlns for the local name xmlns of the default namespace
node if it exists...'

Rich's suggestion to add 'recall that' to the parenthetic would also help.

Up to now, Joseph has graciously helped with getting a clarification added
(I don't have access to modify the errata document).  Joseph, are you still
able to do this?

Thanks,
John Boyer

Hi, John!

Your explanation makes perfect sense and this is exactly how I
understood the
spec when I wrote the code. However, in both sections (sorry for 2.3 ->
3.2 confusion :) )
we are talking about "local name of the default namespace node" and this
might
confuse people. Thisis why I think that it would probably be a good idea
to put your
explanation in the eratra and clearly state that section 2.2 describes
local name
for default namespace node for sorting purposes and section 2.3 says how
to render
local name for default namespace node.
