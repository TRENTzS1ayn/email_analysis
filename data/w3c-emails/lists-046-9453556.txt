Section 1.3, point 1, in Exclusive XML Canonicalization says that if you
have some XML you are performing this on which needs some inherited
attributes like xml:lang which are declared in higher nodes, you have
to import these yourself to the apex of what you are canonicalizing. It 
has been pointed out to me that you should also be able to import such 
attriubtes to lower level nodes, rather than the apex, as long as they 
still encompass what they need to affect. This is pretty minor but I 
think it is correct.

Thanks,
Donald
