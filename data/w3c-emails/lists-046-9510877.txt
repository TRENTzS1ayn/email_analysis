John:

Thank you for your confirmation of my tentative suggestions. I greatly respect your opinions and work.

<johnboyer>Thanks!</johnboyer>

Were the tests with InfoPath conducted solely with client side PKI signatures?

<johnboyer>Yes.</johnboyer>

To the extent that servers can sign data on behalf of signers either via an XKMS type of architecture, or a single key for a group of users, could either InfoPath or Xforms use of security for XML forms be facilitated by such an architecture? Are they compatible with such an architecture?

Are such server based signatures compatible with PureEdge's proprietary solution? (Cf the DSS TC of OASIS).

<johnboyer>
Well, the InfoPath solution only seemed to allow you to set up 
data-only client-side PKI signatures, and XForms 1.0 has not yet 
addressed integration with digital signatures.

As for server-side generation of signatures, let me begin by
saying that signatures really tend to be more valuable to the
verifier than the signer. This is because most systems are set
up to be point of contact with individuals as signers and a company
as the verifier.  Since the company/verifier is the one running the 
server, it is too self-serving if the verifier has significant
control over the signature generation process.  This is why 
companies tend to use a 3rd party as a certificate authority,
for example.  The problem we are talking about now is another
manifestation of this issue.  If a signature only signs data,
then the verifier's hands are not clean, so to speak, because it 
is possible to change what the user saw after the signature is
generated.

Regarding server-side signature generation, the verifier may use 
3rd party software to create the server-side signature systems, but 
if that software is doing the actual cryptographic calculations
on the verifier's server, then the signer's private key will appear 
in the clear in server memory at some point.  Unless special hardware 
is installed to prevent this or unless the system calls out to a 3rd 
party web service for signature generation, the verifier can still get 
their hands on a signer's private key material. It is true that the 
3rd party software tends to make it harder to do so because the signers' 
private keys are not in the clear in the permanent storage, but it is 
still easier to get the key material than it would be by integer 
factorization.  As the value of the protected transactions increases, 
the volume of such transactions decreases, which seems to make reliance 
on laws pertaining to common practices of a business less tenable.

I've said all of this mainly as a qualifying context for answering
your final question.  Suppose you do have a 'good' system of 
server-side signatures that somehow provides the verifier a level
of plausible deniability regarding tampering (such a system is 
feasible, so the supposition is not degenerate). Then, I see nothing
to prevent that system from using the additional PureEdge
methodologies to secure portions of a form and to prevent partial
form signing from creating additional security risks. 

The main issue is that InfoPath is not architected to be extensible
in this way.  Although the XForms working group has yet to formally
consider signature integration, I believe XForms is more likely to be
easily extended to allow a host language to apply the PureEdge
methods.  Whether the methods are applied by server-side code or
client-side code will likely be up to the implementation.  XForms
typically does not distinguish where certain functionality gets
implemented, so long as it has the specified behaviors (i.e. meets
the defined requirements).

The big problem for XForms is that it is designed to be hosted by
another language, so if the host language has difficulty locking 
down the attributes we want to secure with the PureEdge methods,
then an XForm will be out of luck simply because of the language
used in the host envelope.  We want to position XFDL as a secure
host language for XForms because we think it will be much harder to 
write securable XHTML, in part because of properties of the language 
itself and in part because of expected flexibilities in the 
rendering environment itself (a web browser).

Can you clarify what you mean in that context by a "basic signature"?
