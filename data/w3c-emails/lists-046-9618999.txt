Is there no way for you to group them under a common parent element?

        Subject:        What is the best way to handle the case where you 
would end up with too many references in a digital signature?


If I have an XML Document, where I need to sign say up to two hundred 
different elements (different parts of a very complex form for example),
I think I will end up with up to 200 references, in the SignedInfo or 
manifest, whereever we decide to put them.
We did think about using an XPath expression, but that would get too large 
and performance might be an issue I think.
 
What is a good way to handle such a scenario?
 
Thanks,
