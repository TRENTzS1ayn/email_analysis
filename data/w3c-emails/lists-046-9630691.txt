No. The way our forms are structured, I don't think that can be the
case.
I thought that I had found a solution myself by adding a unique
namespace for the cells, but it was shot down by the developers more
familiar with the
inner workings of the form then myself. The reason being that some
elements can be signed by more then one signatures, say for example when
you have a form that would be signed by an employee and also a manager.
There may be some common elements that both of them sign.

Is there no way for you to group them under a common parent
element?

If I have an XML Document, where I need to sign say up to two
hundred different elements (different parts of a very complex form for
example), 
I think I will end up with up to 200 references, in the
SignedInfo or manifest, whereever we decide to put them. 
We did think about using an XPath expression, but that would get
too large and performance might be an issue I think. 
  
What is a good way to handle such a scenario? 
  
Thanks,
