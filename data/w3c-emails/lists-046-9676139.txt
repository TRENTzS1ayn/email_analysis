Can you modify your data so that a single simple XPath expression will
find all the elements, or most of them?  (For example, are they all in a
single namespace?)

If not, the only hope you have of making it efficient is probably to write
an XSLT transformation with as many XPath's as needed, and hope that the
XSLT processor can parallelize or otherwise stream its searches.

/r$

PS:  We do that; see URL's below. :)  But I really can't think of any
other advice.
