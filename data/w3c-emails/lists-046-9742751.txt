Hi Gino,

My first impression to your question would be: "Why choose XML Signature 
to begin with?"

XML Signature is great for situations where XML data must be selectively 
signed based on XML document
subsets. The situation that you have described doesn't immediately point 
to a multi-hop signing environment with
multiple intermediate signers.

Alternatively, if you are in a situation where you want to authenticate 
function calls (e.g. a 'true' XML-based
Web Service enviornment), you are 'stuck' with the W3C XML Signature in 
some form another (either the raw standard
itself or its use in WS-Security Core).

What types of document artifacts do you need to authenticate? Are these 
function call 'representations' or documents of some format?

Of all the XML Security standards, XML Signature is certainly the most 
mature, but there are some important security concerns to be careful of, 
especially with regards to transformations.
