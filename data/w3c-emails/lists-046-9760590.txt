I would say 3D-Secure is a prime example of widely used protocol based on
XML-Signature.  Since 3D-Secure is all about credit-card processing, you
might want to take a look at it.  One can extend 3D-Secure to support the
kind of transaction you described.

Timeline might be a little longer than six months, but direct hardware
support for 3D-Secure is coming.  For example, a chip that can parse,
encrypt, decrypt, canonicalize, sign, and validate XML would be very useful
as well as marketable since the market has started to realize that
XML/Crypto combo throw a wrench into Google-like approaches to scalability.
