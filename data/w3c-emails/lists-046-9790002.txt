It was not pulled out. It's in the current official spec you can 
download from Visa's website.
Moreover, I know that several people (including myself) contacted Visa 
guys about this
problem but the response basically was "we don't care".

I haven't seen the code that does this but I bet that it generates N 
random bytes, base64 encodes
them and result string is called "ID attribute". Of course, such strings 
could not be used as ID
attributes (may start with number, may contain '+', etc.).
