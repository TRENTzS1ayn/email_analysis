I must have missed that.

I think they care to a degree, but they probably decided that it wasn't
important enough to change the spec at this point since most 3D-Secure
implementations do not use validating parsers.  They should have issued a
'heads-up' message to implementers so the problem can be contained for
future fix though.

If so, then I think there might have been some security concern raised that
mandated use of random IDs.  If so, then they should have at least replaced
ID and IDREF in the DTD with CDATA.
