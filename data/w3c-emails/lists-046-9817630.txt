I am not sure I understand your point about validating parsers. The 
reason why there are resrtrictions
for ID attributes are exactly the same as why there are restrictions for 
the variable names in all known
to me programming languages. ID attribute might be included in a complex 
XPath/XPointer expression
and you have to be able to understand what "123+123"  means: is it "123" 
+ "123" or this is an ID attribute.
