In other words, interop doesn't matter as long as you comply with their
spec.  That's a lousy attitude.  If I weren't in polite company, I'd use a
more fecal term. :)

That's what they did -- their attribute is defined as CDATA.  But then
they use that attribute as the target of a dsig:Reference/@URI attribute,
and that's non-conformant.  According to the XPointer spec, "barewards"
must be XML ID's, not XML CDATA. Several of us took a bit of time to
explain this, including pointing to the relevant specs.  They're attitude
is "oh, well."  Or, less charitably "too bad."  It's a fairly small fix,
just limiting the alphabet used to generate the attributes, and their
unwillingness to fix it is surprising.

Perhaps you could also mention this to them -- your voice might get more
attention then some others.  And you might want to mention to the hardware
folks you alluded to that they should be careful about burning
non-complaince into their silicon. :)  Perhaps they could accept broken
signatures, but makes sure that the reference targets they generate are
compliant as XML ID attributes.
