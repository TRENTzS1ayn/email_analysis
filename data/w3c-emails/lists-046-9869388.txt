Unfortunately, I no longer have direct influence on the 3D-Secure protocol
and don't know who their XML expert is at this point.

Re hardware folks, I'll do what I can but I can't promise I'll jump up and
down over this.

IMHO, these issues are of little importance to Visa, issuers, and merchants
because there are not enough incentives for them to correct these problems
at this time.  Why in the world would a merchant want to pull down their
system for even ten minutes so XML experts can sleep at night?

Yes, I am guilty of having a bad attitude.  Maybe I got infected...

Best,
