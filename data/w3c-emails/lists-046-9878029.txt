If you think that all possible code to support 3D Secure is already done 
and nobody
working on this these days then you are wrong. Just search xmlsec 
library mailing list

        http://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/

and see how many guys run into this problem in the last couple months. 
And as someone pointed
out, the security implications of this error are not clear.

Anyway, I think that Visa can invent *any* protocol they want. The only 
problem I have is that
they state that this protocol is based on XML, XPath, XInclude, XML DSig 
and so on. As we already
agreed, this is not the case. They just need to remove mention of XML 
DSig from their papers and
everyone would be happy :)
