Why did they use XML to begin with? 

Don, scratch Rich's suggestion -- why don't you just tell them to
base64-encode SET, wrap it in some angle-brackets, and carry on as
before. ;-) What the hell is the point of using XML specs if you don't
intend it to interoperate? 

As someone who already has hardware that does XML crypto, I'm
unimpressed that special breaking of the standard is required for
either hardware support or security.

Aleksey, actually, that's a good suggestion -- maybe the W3C would like
to take this up? 

To the original questioner, this whole thread should provide much-needed
confirmation that XML DSIG is so mature, that a whole bunch of people
are already cranky about some implementations not being properly
compliant, and others have had time to develop a bad attitude. That's a
mark of a mature standard!
