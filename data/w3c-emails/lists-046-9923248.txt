Thank you for your answer, Blake.

whatever ... as usual, the business gives not clear & changeable requirements :) ... or better still, it's very dangerous taking them as final ...

in effect, this is not a requirement and I'm a strong believer in minimal implementations. Actually, evaluating XML Signature makes sense here if there are strong advantages in implementing all 'plumbing' related to sign/verify a general XML element ... something like: sign this element given my profile  ... verify this element, given sender's profile. Then, since this is an implementation of a standard, features such as the ones you mentioned could be eventually simpler to support in the future ... By contrast, there are (also) the disadvantages you mentioned.
