Thank you for your answer, Rich.

Yes ... and we belonging to the community of lazy programmers, appreciate a lot this. Other side, this should be one of (many?) packages inside the application, maybe another one for WS. In addition, legacy systems require their own framework :) ... moreover, developers and designers usually don't maintain the system, that should be virtually  maintained by (bank) clerks usually not skilled in such standards/implementations/frameworks. For these reasons, a unique framework/implementation at least for WS, XML Signature and XML Encryption should be suitable. Finally, details concerning  other banks platforms are simply not provided; hence joining to a standard makes sense since, if they work over .NET insetead of Bea WebLogic, for instance, they can be compliant without a maior revision of their middleware :) ...

This is very good for scalability, reusability and other non functionals concerns (maintenibility?); and I find this an interesting idea ...
