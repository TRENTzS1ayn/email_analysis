Dear all,

I write these few lines to comment you that ETSI has organized
a *free* event where current developers of XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic
Signatures) tools will have the occassion of making 
interoperability tests and discuss on the specification.

Should any of you being involved in the development of tools aligned with
that specification and interested in sharing development experiences, 
you can take a look to the following URL:

Best regards

Juan Carlos Cruellas.
