Hi,

Here's a quick summary of principles that seem to have
survived the day's discussions. 


 1) The GRAPH is the central concept for RDF, not its expression
    in a serialization syntax.
 2) There can be more than one graph in the world
 3) There are multiple serialization syntaxes
 4) N-triples is a serialization syntax for a graph
 5) There can be more than one n-triples document in the world
 6) Each n-triples document containing a legal sentence in the
    n-triples BNF represents a graph
 7) Concatenating n-triples documents is not the same as merging
    graphs. There may need to be some rewriting to avoid name
    clashes between anonymous nodes.

Ron
