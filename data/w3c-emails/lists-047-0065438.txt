I did not get to make a presentation on MusicBrainz at the F2F, 
however I did feel it was important that I share with you the 
top issues that Rob Kaye, the head of the MusicBrainz project, 
had while working with RDF:

  - Make RDF specs easier to understand

    The spec focuses too much on the serialization. The BNF directly
    in the spec is useful, but really misleading. The focus of the spec
    ought to be more on the graph that is created, rather than the
    serialization of that graph.

  - Provide more guidelines for creating vocabularies
        o What should be specified as part of a vocabulary?
        o Provide a sample vocabulary!
        o Should/must a vocabulary have an RDF Schema?

  - Provide a syntax that isn't as verbose
        o It should also be more intuitive. I think Sergey Melnik's
          approach seems reasonable:
          (http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/syntax.html)

    - Do you have any tips on how to write a vocabulary spec
      for inclusion into IETF spec? Drew Streib @ freedb wants to use
      MM for CD lookups and he wants to push this through the IETF.
      Has this been done before for an RDF vocab?
