Hi Aaron,

Thanks for this.  I'm sorry you couldn't stay for the full time.  The short
presentations did get squeezed into the last 45 mins or so of the meeting.

It does occur to me that it might be a good idea to tidy up the list from
the flip charts and any other contributions such as this folks would like
to make into a consolidated list.  To do that would require two actions:

  o folks who have knowledge of direct user experience with RDF, to
    summarize the top issues users had to the list - as Aaron has
    just done for MusicBrainz

  o someone to volunteer to make the summary

Brian
