There are limitations in various implementations that deal
with URIs... e.g. most HTTP servers only accept a few
kilobytes in the request header line in order to prevent
denial-of-service attacks.

But there's no limit on URIs per se.


This was recently discussed in uri@w3.org... er... I thought
it was, but I can't find it out.
