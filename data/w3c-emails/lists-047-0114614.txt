Sergey - would you please send to this list the document
that you presented on the morning of August 2?  I tried to
capture the document while I was scribing but I am certain
that I missed some of the text:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Aug/0007.html

[My apolgies if this request is included in the f2f action
list.]

Thanks,

Art
