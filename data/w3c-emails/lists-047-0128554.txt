No, but it does mean that any RDF 'interpretation' must have at least 
one property in it. You can't just have a set of resources with no 
properties.

I don't really know why I put this condition in, it was a kind of 
knee-jerk mathematical reflex. It could be taken out without doing 
any damage. Maybe I will take it out, just in case someone wants to 
define a property-less interpretation for some obscure purpose.
