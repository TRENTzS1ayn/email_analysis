I shouldnt have used the L-word. The issue is, is it expressed in the 
RDF somewhere, or not? If not, then my next question would be, how 
then is it being conveyed between the people who are 
writing/publishing/reading this RDF? If the RDF can only be 
understood by virtue of some other content represented somewhere else 
in some other format, then it seems to me that (1) it - the RDF - 
isn't doing its intended job of representing Web content in 
machine-processable form, and (2) there really isn't any point in 
anyone using RDF at all, since we could convey the content using HTML 
(as everyone does now) on the same basis, ie so that it can be 
understood with the help of 'external' conventions about meanings - 
in the case of HTML, those might include the conventions of all the 
world's natural human languages.

Ah, but you can say the same about math logic. It's that "knowing 
what they are"  that is supposed to be provided by publishing the 
content in RDF (or KIF, or DAML, or whatever.)

I agree (Well, particular SET of interpetations, in general). There 
is implicit knowledge even in the use of RDF itself, eg the fact that 
the middle thingie is supposed to be a property. But part of the 
utility of having a model theory is that it focusses on the content 
that is explicitly encoded in the RDF syntax; the part that is 
explicitly stated by the RDF itself; and all the rest. The rest has 
to be conveyed some other way, maybe by a kind of human coder's 
conspiracy to wriote code on the basis of a shared assumption.

But now, go back to the example, where someone is publishing some RDF 
to the world in general in order to attract flower-buying customers. 
Where is the extra meaning (about the flower-trade specific URIs used 
in the RDF) encoded? Since this is being published to the world in 
general, it had better not rely on any flower-trade-specific 
assumptions, or else someone in some other trade might misinterpret 
it in some potentially dangerous way. We can hardly assume that the 
URI itself encodes anything about flowers in particular. That seems 
to leave the RDF.

Well, thats a reasonable position, but how do you reconcile it with 
the idea of world-wide broadcasting of content?

No. The global uniqueness is of the name, not of the interpretation 
of the name. I don't think that URIs as a class have *any* general 
implicit knowledge attached to them, in fact. (URL's do, but that's 
not a kosher term any more, I gather.)

Not in any absolute sense, but each formal langauge chooses a place 
to draw its line, and those lines are all quite clear (though not all 
in the same place.)

Well, RDF/DAML hardly push the boundary. In expressive power they are 
way behind conventional logics or Krep schemes that have been used 
for years in AI and database technology. But I digress....
