To each his favorite way to digest, I guess.

Yes, I guess, though if someone ever wanted to extend RDF to allow 
some kind of triple-schema that had infinitely many instances, then 
it would be convenient to identify it with that infinite set of 
triples. Since the MT doesnt actually require finiteness, I'd rather 
not include it as an explicit condition in the absence of a pressing 
reason to do so.

Yes, though again not strictly required by the MT.
