we actually see that
  {{:s [ rdfs:subpropertyOf :p] :o} log:implies {:s :p :o}}
    a log:Truth; log:forAll :s, :p, :o.
gives the same "cwm -think" result as
  {{:z rdfs:subPropertyOf :p. :s :z :o} log:implies {:s :p :o}}
    a log:Truth; log:forAll :s, :p, :o, :z.
but *not* the same result as
  {{:z rdfs:subPropertyOf :p. :s :z :o} log:implies {:s :p :o}}
    a log:Truth; log:forAll :s, :p, :o; log:forSome :z.

it could/should be similar for the case of rdfcore 'facts'
(the things behind log:implies)
