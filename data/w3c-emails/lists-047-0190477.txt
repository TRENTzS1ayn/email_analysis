RDFCore,

On monday night there was a major power outage at MIT, and this has
taken down a number of W3C services, most importantly our mailing lists
and mailing list archives. 

The main W3C Web site should still be accessible, since it is also
served from our French and Japanese mirror sites. If you have trouble
reaching http://www.w3.org/ this is probably DNS-related, switching to 
http://web3.w3.org/ should work. The lists.w3.org Web service is not,
however, mirrored, and so remains inaccessible for now. The RDF IRC
channel at irc.openprojects.net 6667 (#rdfig #rdfcore) are unaffected by
the situation at MIT.

It is taking some time to get electricity restored; I believe the
current expectation is that we'll have power later in the (US) day. In
the meantime, mail is being queued up on W3C's other servers and will be
delivered to the lists when we're back.

As a stopgap, I have extracted all the email addresses from the WG
Members page, adding the non-w3.org addresses for myself, DanC,
Eric(*). We can use this as an ad-hoc To:/CC: list (copying the 
w3c-rdfcore-wg address for archival) while waiting for things to get fixed. 
 
Sorry for the inconvenience,

Dan

(*) Brian, does Art have an HP address? could you pass this on...
