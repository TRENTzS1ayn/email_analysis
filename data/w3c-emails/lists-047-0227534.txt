RDFCore,

In the light of this week's power and email / mail archive outages, Brian
and I have decided to cancel tommorrow's RDF Core WG meeting. Let's use
the time to get working on all the new action items.

We have had relatively little technical discussion on the WG list[1] since
last week's F2F, and I've just heard that the Cambridge/MIT area is
suffering a 2nd (unrelated) wave of power blackouts. In this light, we
felt that a telecon wouldn't be the best use of everyone's time. Although
the meeting is cancelled, let's all keep up the momentum from the F2F. Brian has
identified a list of actions from the face to face, and these have been
added to the meeting page[2]. Let's get stuck into some technical
discussions again!

Regarding our email list and archive, I believe it is now stable. I am
unsure as to whether there are any message from mon-thu that were sent to
the list but haven't yet been distributed. If you have sent mail and are
unsure as to whether it was successfully distributed, please check
the archives at [1].

Dan
