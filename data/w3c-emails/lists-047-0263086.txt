I expect to be out of circulation for the next three weeks, and unable to 
attend the teleconferences or participate in other activities during that 
period.

 From the F2F actions, I note that I am actioned to participate in a task 
force to investigate DAML use of data types.  I'll try and catch up on the 
relevant docs in the meanwhile.

(I'm also not fully caught up on the mailing list postings, as I've been at 
an IETF meeting this week.)
