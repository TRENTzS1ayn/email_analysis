Here's one I did:

   http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-message-rfc822-xml-01.txt

(This draft is currently expired, but still online (as of today).  I do 
intend to refresh it and complete the spec when some other work comes to 
fruition -- real soon, I hope.)

You may note that, in this case, I've focused on presenting the XML and 
brining in the RDF as an "afterthought".  It was very easy to sell this 
approach to one of our developers for inclusion into a product.

There is one problem with this that I think will be difficult to resolve to 
the complete satisfaction of all:  addresses are URIs, but presented as RDF 
literals.  It is my belief that, at this time, it would be very difficult 
to sell the idea of using rdf:resource= in this context.  (I would hope 
that, in due course, we could use an RDF schema with an xsdt:anyURI data 
type on the literal value and some inference rules to knit the graph 
together, but that would be outside standard RDF.)
