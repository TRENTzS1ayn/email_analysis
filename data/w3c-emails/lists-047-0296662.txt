Looking back, I find it hard to imagine what we might have done to achieve 
a better result than we did ... (which I think was very good).

A nit-picky point might be to get the room layout and facilities organized 
before we expected to start, but I'm not sure that was really possible 
under the circumstances.

On the positive side:
- focusing on a big blocking item for a good part of the first day, and 
returning to it briefly on the second day seemed to work spectacularly well.
- I thought the introductory "scene setting" presentations were very useful 
(in a first face-to-face).
