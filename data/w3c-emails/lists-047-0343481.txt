To: rdf core<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>

I had an action from the face to face to propose a structure for the documents
the WG is to produce.  Below is a strawman for discussion.

Brian


Objectives
==========

 o Provide precise, formal specifications of the RDF abstract model,
   the RDF/XML syntax, RDF Schema and RDF vocabularies

 o Provide understandable, readable, approachable explanations to users
   of RDF and RDF Schema.

Target Audience
===============

The audience for these docuements can be broken down as follows:

 o Managers etc who want to know what RDF is about and whether they
   should be using it.

 o Authors of technical books on XML, the semantic web etc.  The role
   of developing tutorial material for the bulk of developers is filled
   by the folks who write these books.

 o Higher layer semantic web standards designers who will build more
   expressive capabilities on top of RDF.

 o Tool builders who design and implement tools that use RDF.

 o Data modellers who will design new data models using RDF.

 o application developers

Principles
==========

 o Strong separation of explanatory material from the hard core
   specifications.  Only the hard core specifications are normative.

 o Use of formal techniques in the specifications where possible.


Documents
=========

Overview
--------

Purpose:  High level introduction to RDF and guide to other documents.
          All that a manager needs to read to understand broadly what
          RDF is trying to do without getting into how it does it.
          Answers questions like "What is RDF?", "What would my
          organisation use it for?", "Where does it fit into the
          family of XML, metadata and semantic web specifications?",
          "What do I read next?" and "What is defined and how can
           it be extended?".

Audience: Everyone with any interest in RDF.  This is the  first document
          a newbie reads.  It's the only document someone needing only
          a high level view of what RDF is and what its for should need
          to read.

Size:     2-3 printed pages

Status:   Non-normative

Style:    Short, concise, readable.


Tutorial
--------

Purpose:  A tutorial introduction and explanation of the RDF specifications.

Audience: The primary target audience for this document is the book author.  
          The main goal of this document is to make the specifications
          accessible to the book writing community, so that they can fill
          in the gaps and write complete tutorials in their books.

          This document will also be used by those who eschew the books and
          and want to figure stuff out for themselves from the
          specifications.

Coverage: Sections covering all aspects of the RDF specs including the
          abstract model, the RDF/XML syntax, RDF Schema and basic
          vocabularies such as reification and containers.

size:     approx 20-30 printed pages

style:    explanatory

status:   non-normative


RDF Model
---------

purpose:  Formal specification of the RDF abstract model.

audience: Higher layer designers, tool builders, authors

coverage: Graph model, n-triple representation, model theory,
          n-triple formal grammar as non-normative appendix

size:     < 10 printed pages

style:    Formal

status:   normative



RDF Schema
----------

purpose:  Formal specification of RDF Schema

audience: Higher layer designers, tool builders, authors

coverage: type, Class, etc and their model theory
          Vocabularies - reification and containers and their model theory
          XML Schema data types
          links to test cases

size:     < 20 pages

style:    formal spec, no explanatory material

status:   normative


RDF/XML Syntax
--------------

purpose:  Formal specification of the RDF/XML grammar and its
          transformation to a graph.

audience: Higher layer designers, tool builders and authors

coverage: relationship to XML, grammar, transform to graph,
          links to test cases

size:     < 10 pages

style:    formal spec, no explanatory material

status:   normative


Test Cases
----------

purpose:  Machine executable illustrative test cases which illustrate
          various aspects of the specifiations.  Not exhaustive.  Not
          a validation test suite.  Explanatory examples.

audience: All except managers

coverage: everything

size:     ?

style:    machine executable with comments

status:   normative  (@@??)
