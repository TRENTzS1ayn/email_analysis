I think this represents a reasonable starting point for structuring the
material, provided we don't take the descriptions too literally.  That
is, I think we can use this as defining rough targets for the different
types of material we need to produce, and in the case of the Overview a
rough length target, so we can think about actually writing.  However, I
don't know that I'd want to spend a whole lot of time discussing much
greater detail about the documents, because I often find that when I
actually start to see the material my ideas about how much is needed,
and how to organize it, change.  

A couple of additional comments:  

1.  I suspect many of the page estimates are too low.  

2.  I'm suspicious of *too much* separation of explanatory material
("Tutorial") from the specification of the RDF model and RDF Schema. 
This is one place where I'd want to actually be looking at some
material, in order to decide whether the specification was actually
going to get across to people or not.  While I appreciate the desire to
avoid mixing normative and non-normative material (as well as the desire
to avoid confusing people with too many detailed examples), nevertheless
we need to shoot for specifications that our target audience can
actually read and understand.  (For example, a potential "explanatory"
section of the specifications that might be very useful, based on the
history of our WG discussions, would be a section whose title was
something like "virtual specifications: things you may be reading into
the specifications, but that aren't actually there.")  Also, I wouldn't
think that having a "tutorial" would necessarily rule out having
explanatory material in the specifications themselves;  I generally
think of a "tutorial" as having a different approach than a
"specification", even when the "specification" contains a lot of
explanatory material. Perhaps a thorough cross-referencing scheme
between the two "kinds" of documents would alleviate many of the
potential difficulties.
