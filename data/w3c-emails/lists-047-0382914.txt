This is certainly useful for making me think about the structure
of this pile of work...
Hmm... somehow I got the impression that your structure
would include a schedule.

In particular, I'm interested to know which of these
documents is intended as an editorial revision/clarification
of the RDF 1.0 Recommendation, and which are new
work products (i.e. not already W3C Recommendations)
that need to go thru last call and
Proposed Recommendation...

Hm... I expected to see something like:

o clarify the RDF 1.0 spec

in the top-level list of objectives.

I agree that's a desireable list of audiences to reach.
Whether it's feasible, I'm not so sure. I'd certainly
need to see a schedule before I could say whether I believe
it or not.

I'm all for formal techniques. Separating stuff isn't nearly
as important... especially if it results in lots of
readers having to swap back and forth between documents to grok.

What you describe here is traditionally provided by
way of an Activity Statement. The activity statment
four our work is

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Activity

but it's not a very good fit for what you're describing.
But it's not very consistent with other activity
statements, which are much more of the manager's overview:

[[[
Activity statements provide an executive overview of
     W3C's work in this area, while the XML Home Page
     points to highlights, events, specifications, discussion
     groups, software, and other resources.
]]]

--        Extensible Markup Language (XML) Activity Statement
http://www.w3.org/XML/Activity
Sat, 21 Apr 2001 07:52:10 GMT

It wouldn't be unprecedented for an exective overview to
be a separate document from the activity statement, though.
e.g.

  XML in 10 points

Looks good. The XML Schema Primer, while technically non-normative,
is always cited right next to the normative parts 1 and 2; and
it's the document I actually recommend that folks read in order
to learn XML Schemas.

Why would n-triples go here?

Maybe it's necessary as an editorial device, much the way
BNF is used in the XML spec. but I wouldn't expect
it to be "normatively specified" as part of RDF.

Especially not if this "RDF Model" is intended as an
editorial clarification of the RDF 1.0 Recommendation.

Oops... I was reading too fast. I see you're already
headed in this direction.

Schedule: for release next week. ;-)

Reification and containers go here? That's sorta sticky/tricky
w.r.t. endorsement/review process.

Hmm...

I wonder if we could look at this document as sort of a second
part of the tutorial.

i.e. RDF tutorial, Part I: for when somebody else designs the
vocabulary(ies) and you're just filling in the instance data.

 RDF tutorial, Part II: making new vocabularies

Oops... you're not talking about tutorial stuff here.

Hmm...

I'd be happy to see test cases integrated here as examples.

I don't know whether it's worthwhile to make the test cases normative;
we don't have much precedent for that.

But I do want to see the test cases released as a whole; I expect
this will trigger implementors to check their work, starting
a feedback loop that results in more consistency/interoperability.
