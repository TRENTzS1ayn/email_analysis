Actually, when asked, I said that no, if I had been required
to make up explicit URIs in all cases, my applications would
not have gotten done/developed/deployed.

I stipulated that, theoretically, I could, perhaps, have made
up and managed distinct URIs for all the relevant things,
but I was clear that practically, I needed Prince nodes
to build apps.
