I'd rather not take that approach. I'd rather that the model
theory were a model theory for all of RDF, no more, and no less.
I don't want to give the impression that folks should tinker
with the core model theory when they introduce new vocabulary.

New vocabularies should just be specified as constraints
on the core interpretation structure, not changes to it.

Why? It seems to me that IEXT(rdf:type) completely captures
the notion of 'class'. Anything we want to say about 'class'
can be said by way of IEXT(rdf:type), no?

ICEXT(c) is just the set { x: <x,c> \in IEXT(rdf:type) }, no?
an IC is (at least) the set { y: exists x where <x,y> \in IEXT(rdf:type)
}
right?

yup... you say as much later in the document:

| >> <x,y> is in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) iff x is in ICEXT(y)
