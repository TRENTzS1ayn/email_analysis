I guess that counts as dissent.

I think maybe I should raise my hands to be the cause of this difficulty.

The original messages raising the issue

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2000JulSep/0015.html

raised questions of change management of schemas suggesting a need
for facilities for deprecating classes and schemas and properties
to indicate 'obsoletedBy', 'supercedes' etc.

I conflated this issue with the one you raised in

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001JanMar/0047.html

on the grounds it would be better to consider both at the same time.

My reading of the situation is that the original issue raised by Jonas
has been closed.  I suggest you propose some new text for the working
draft to address the issue you raised.

Are you dissenting from the decision to close this issue?  If so,
on what grounds?
