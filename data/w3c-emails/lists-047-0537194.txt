Before breakfast at the F2F, various people were discussing the term 
"anonymous nodes" and considered this misleading and slightly confusing... 
The conversation then went to something like "the nodes formally known as 
anonymous nodes" to "the nodes formally known as prince" which then Brian 
turned to "prince nodes".

I think "prince nodes" are to rdfcore as "pumpkins" are to the original RDF 
M&S.  Perhaps a simple place holder until we figure out a better name for this.

I think this also should be a lesson to all of us, not to have meeting 
before coffee is served. :)
