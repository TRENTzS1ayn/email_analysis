I'm sending this simply because Brian once said that anything referred
to in the telecon should be out there 24 hours beforehand and its
getting close...

Having discussed this with Brian and Graham, I've anticipated the
resurrection of 
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-terminologicus (which I
recall was with me at one point) and have started tinkering with
Graham's glossary doc (last seen at
http://public.research.mimesweeper.com/RDF/RDFTerminologyConcepts.html).

I have a long way to go (it's up on the ramp and is being taken apart at
the moment as you'll see) but the introductory notes might be worth
opening to comment.  I attach the very preliminary hacked version of
Graham's doc.
