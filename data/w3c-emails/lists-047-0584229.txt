Minutes for 2001-07-27 below. I'm terribly sorry for the delay. I was
working from a rushed 1st pass at them which I tried to do in aeroplanes
and hotels prior to the F2F. Scrapping that and starting over proved
quicker. --danbri

Discussion details....

-------

Preparing for the f2f (10 mins):

Review the updated F2F page at:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20010801-f2f/

especially objectives, agenda and required/recommended reading.

ACTION 2001-07-27#3 - Brian - Update f2f page to point to Pat's model theory



Review draft response to DAML+OIL Joint Committee:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0355.html

 - detailed discussion was postponed until after the F2F


Issue rdfms-xmllang (5 mins):

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xmllang

Review proposal at:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0293.html

Discussion:

 brian: any comments on my note?
 martin: of 3 test cases, mine showed no interest in
      xml:lang issue. We found it wasn't a major block to implementation.
      This is reflected fairly in Brian's summary.

 brian: I propose "xml lang as defined in m+s is useful. would be wrong to
change ntriple and model theory until we've considered
        parseType=literal"
 (general approval, though noted that Sergey was not present)


Review status of #rdfms-identity-anon-resources (10 mins)

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-identity-anon-resources

"This is a key issue for the f2f.  We need to have a framework to
approach it."

brian: we've seen 160+ msgs. Where do we stand on this?

jos: In my opinion, we (I?) have clear view on this, from Pat's doc.
 ... pat has collected all the different positions and
unified them in one nice document. Perhaps not final but at least tangible.
The StrawDog doc of yesterday
(ie. the first revised draft of the model theory doc,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0399.html )

brian: is that the general view?
pat: Frank's msg summarised a number of alterantives pretty usefully

frank: two sub-threads here. Getting straight what the interpretation of
anonymous nodes will be. And also deciding what to  do whether have URIs or
not.

Jos: we at least have description of the tradeoffs now

pat: what the model theory does, is make the alternatives clearer, but
doesn't decide between them.
...someone has to decide which way to go. Either way makes sense; i've no
strong feeling.

brian: the thing worrying me. I can't see a framework for how we make that
decision

pat: i volunteer in time for my f2f presentation, to draw up list of pros
and cons of the two main alternatives and their utility. Everything I can
think of in a little table.

ACTION 2001-07-27#4 - Pat - create table of pros/cons for model theory for f2f



Review status of #rdfms-uri-substructure (10 mins):

brian: sergey proposes resources should be identified by pair of strings not URIs
 I feel torn by this; I'm drawn to it, but feels like a fundamental shift
from Web Architecture. Using something other than URis to identify things beyond our scope?

Sergey's proposal: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0270.html

(postponed)


Review status of #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure (10 mins):

bill: i'd like to send a big doc to list shortly
...not to sure how far we can get by sying parseType=Literal parses to
Infoset until we know what existing M+S says. I quite like the infoset
proposal but not sure if that's in scope.

aaron: ...even something that could be converted into an infoset, eg.
something with namespaces etc attached so the needed info is captured

bill: ...section 2 suggests we simply treat literals as strings. then you
get into M+S and realise literals implicitly a structured object, xml:lang
etc, language like "is part of the literal"
...I won't be at f2f, would like to see discussion of literals as infoset. I
think probably a godo thing

pat: i agree, merely being strings is too restrictive

jos: agree, recommend people look at TimBL's design issues on Interpretation
Properties

bill: if you take RDF's simplest "hello world" Ora example, _what does that
mean_ ?
...a literal is something that denotes or evaluates to itself? eg. if you
have foo:creator = <some infoset>, do we mean the infoset created it? Or
rely on the application semantics?
...is the string itself the creator versus the thing denoted by the string



Review status of #rdfms-graph (10 mins):
(postponed)


responses to Pat's Model Theory:

pat: a question w.r.t Ntriple. Is the sense of the group that Ntriple will be offered
to world as a sort of standard notation for rdf? or just for us? or
undecided?

bill: last week i think we said it'd go in as an appendix

brian: ntriple started off as a way of doing test cases; a concrete syntax
for representing triples for machine processing, comparing results etc
...i've been suggesting / asking the question, can we make nntriple like the
core of all these specs; defining syntax in terms of transform into ntriple,
and model theory over ntriples?

pat: makes sense to me; i'm from a tradition that prefres textual language

brian: we're not proposing this to the world as a mechanism for
interchanging RDF

pat: ok, makes sense


brian: we're not doing it as "a new syntax"; enough to do, already running
late so don't want to do things beyond charter

aaron: but if we happen to do one "in passing", nobody'll mind?


[some discussion of URIs and notion of meaning of a URI being common across
all interpretations?]

pat: issue is whether interpretation works over all universes
...danger of using up all names at once
names exist for a single interpretation

brian: one does lose something... can we get it back?
...without going the whole way...
can we represent the relationship between interpetations?

brian: (to pat) Is there way of representating the specialness of URIs, ie
that all interpreations need to treat URIs as constrained w.r.t. what they
denote, without making the grand claim that there is just one
interpretation.

pat: only thing currently is that literals mean same thing
in all interpretations. All other URIs are open; mean one thing in one
interpretation, other in others.

frank: do you distinguish between web uris and other uris

pat: no

danbri: that seems right to me. No fast line between 'web' and real world
resources. Books, java classes, telephones etc

frank: things named 'on the web' seem at least to have some constant
interpretation. Other uses of URIs for non webby things don't seem so
consrtained.

pat: one way to talk about this is to talk about two theories, documents,
sets of rdf, being or sharing ...
...the web would be some shared core of interpretation; one big world-wide
interpretation. Those URIs that have a common meaning that everyone accepts.


aaron: reminds me of reminds me of http://www.w3.org/Architecture/state

frank: there's a belief that if its on the Web, everybody shares it

pat: I know URL is no longer an encouraged term, but the URIs machines use
for getting web pages... have a fixed interpretation


Next meeting - 10am PST, 1st August 2001, Sebastopol
