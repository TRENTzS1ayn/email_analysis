Discuss the strawman document structure: (15 mins)

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0038.html

Goal - identify issues and concerns.  So far we have:

  o we need to get started and see the material before getting into
    lengthy theoretical discussions

  o how much 'explanatory' material should the spec have

  o which are we revising/clarifying and which are new work products

  o timescales/resources

  o don't make folks read two documents

  o do we need an executive overview

  o where do n-triples fit in the spec

  o moving containers/reification may cause problems with review process
    (what problems?)

Propose we take a shot at a first draft of a core model spec based on
the current M&S document merged with the appropriate sections of the
model theory.


Model Theory (10 mins)
 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/att-0051/01-RDF_Model_Theory_postF2F.html

Goal - discuss initial responses
     - identify how to move forward


Issue #rdfms-glossary  Martyn (10 mins)

Goal - decide what we are doing about the glossary and assign actions.


Issue #rdfs-transitive-subProperty (10 mins)

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty

Review Jan's message

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0031.html

Propose that the ancestor/parent example clarifies why sub-properties
of transitive properties need not be transitive.

Propose that someone be actioned to close this issue using that example
as an explanation.


Issue #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure (10 mins)

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure

goal - identify an owner for this issue
