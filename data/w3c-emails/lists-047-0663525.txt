[It's even better now with the exercises, so let's try]

[...]
> Exercise: Calculate the truthvalues of the triples

> b b b
> c b a
> in this interpretation.

c a c false
b b b false
c b a true

> More advanced exercise: Write six distinct triples in
> this vocabulary and define another interpretation which

six distinct triples (true in the given interpretation)
  a b c
  b b c
  c b b
  a a c
  c a a
  c a b
and the interpretation
  IR={1,2}; IP={1}
  IEXT:1->{<1,2>}
  IS:a->1,b->1,c->2
gives only true triples
  a b c
  b b c
  a a c

[...]
> Exercise:  Consider the RDF graph defined by the following triples:
> _:x a b
> c b _:x
> _:x a c
>

false
(triple 1 and triple 3 can not be both true)

> How about the graphs formed from just the first triple, and from
> just the last two triples?

both true
