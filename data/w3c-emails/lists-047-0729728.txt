Right, thanks, that was an incomplete-editing bug, I will fix that.

Right again. I meant that the triples came from two different graphs, 
ie one triple came from one graph and another triple came from a 
different graph, but they share an anonymous node in the merged 
graph.  I will rewrite this more carefully to avoid misinterpretation.

Thanks for feedback.
