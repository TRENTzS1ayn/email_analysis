This isnt QUITE completed yet, as noted. I should squeak in if I get 
time tonight to work on it.  Also email feedback already suggests 
some desireable changes which I will do before *next* week's telecon

>ACTION 2001-08-01#2 Brickley - Get Model Theory Introduction Slides online

If online means public, I would suggest NOT doing this as the MT has 
now changed. If people think its useful, I could re-do the slides to 
reflect the new model theory. Let me know if this is worth doing (it 
wouldnt take long)

>ACTION 2001-08-01#3 Pat Hayes Include example in model theory slides

Done. I did that during the F2F .

There is a note on this topic in the new  model theory draft, but I 
could rewrite it as a separate (short) document.

>ACTION 2001-08-02#15 Pat Hayes Discuss cycles in rdfs:subClassOf and
>rdfs:subPropertyOf with DAML folks and report back to us.

I raised this on the DAML telecon on Tuesday but there wasnt time to 
get proper feedback. I should have much more detailed feedback by 
next week. One quick comment: some DAML folk feel that making cycles 
illegal would be OK only if there was some way to say that two 
classes were equal.

>ACTION 2001-08-02#15 Sergey Melnik Discuss reification alterantives with Pat
>Hayes.

Yes, we need to do that. Sergey, wanna have lunch some time soon?
