It's part of the meeting record: we need to capture a copy of the MT as
presented on day 1. This will be useful for future historians, biographers
etc...

The .html version I generated during the meeting was at a duff resolution,
I'll do another that's legible during my flight back to bristol.

BTW if my trip home is as delayed as it was last time, I risk missing the
meeting. If all goes according to schedule I should be back in bristol
just in time for the call.
