OK, this (and Dan C's comments on the model theory) prompts a larger 
question I have for everyone: how separate/separable are RDF and 
RDFS? Should we regard them as essentially one integrated language, 
or as two languages, one an extension of the other?  Or is RDFS just 
one particular RDF vocabulary?

More particularly, why are rdf:Property and rdf:type defined in the 
RDFS documentation? And why do Bag, Seq and Alt have an rdf: prefix 
but Container has an rdfs: prefix?  Why is Literal prefixed with 
rdfs: but Statement with rdf: ?
