I agree that it would be great to avoid the need to deal with the model
theory when defining new vocabularies. However, I'm afraid that
model-theoretic extensions (in terms of additional interpretation
functions etc.) could be necessary, as the latest, wenn someone tries to
define the first-order logic as an RDF-based language (right, Pat?).
Once FOL is defined on top of RDF, other people could specify the
semantics of their vocabulary by relying just on the FOL vocabulary and
the interpretation defined for FOL.
