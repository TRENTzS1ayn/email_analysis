In Pat's impressive document I note the following:

As far as I can tell the following two graphs (which I represent in a
bastardized ntriple) entail one another:

G1:
<a> <b> <c>.


G2:
<a> <b> <c>.
_:x <b> <c>.


Have I understood this right?
If so, is this desired?

I am a little confused at the moment about it ...

reading _:x <b> <c>. as existentially quanitifed then it seems trivial that
G1 and G2 entail one another, whereas the interpolation lemma seems to be
false.

I might follow up on this later.

Jeremy
