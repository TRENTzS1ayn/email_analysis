I just see that we have a bug in our stuff...
for
  _:x <b> <c>. |=> _:y <b> <c>.
we assert LHS and query it with RHS
and i think we should query with
  {_:y <b> <c>} log:forAll _:y.
and then there is a match found with
  {_:x <b> <c>} log:forSome _:x.
(i have to think about that, and try...)

What I learned via one of the RDF lists is
  "the wise searches for the truth
   while the stupid thinks he found it"
so I think you are very wise!
