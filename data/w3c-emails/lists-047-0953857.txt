that 'last condition' seems to refer to a part that I can't find
(but it is repeated and so it is clear what is meant here).

fully agreed with that, after all anonymous nodes are like 'blank' node tokens
(as you write later on)

We tested that (with Euler) and (after correcting a NullPointerException)
it seems to be ok
Suppose E is pat1.nt
  _:x <b> <c>.
  <d> <e> _:y.
and E' pat2.nt
  <a> <b> <c>.
  <d> <e> _:y.
then we get

so E does not entail E' (but E' does entail E)

I would go for "to allow  'subclass loops', as assumed by DAML+OIL"
