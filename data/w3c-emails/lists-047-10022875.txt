I think I would be in favor of an approach where we have an "inner" core and
an "outer" core, but completely purging the spec seems *very* dangerous.

Yes, but it also buys potential non-interoperability, when folks start
reinventing their own ways of doing containers etc. I am not against anyone
inventing new schemes, just that there ought to be one that's "preferred" to
ensure some baseline interoperability. I do not believe that just having
triples and nothing else constitutes interoperability.
