We are talking here about DanC's (excellent) testcase
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-abouteach/test1.rdf
(issue http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach)
I was trying to find out the required N-triples result
for this testcase which is indeed the required output of
an RDF parser (so 'solution' was meant in the sense of
the required N-triples result of a testcase).
