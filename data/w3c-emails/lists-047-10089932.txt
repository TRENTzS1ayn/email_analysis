This is one situation where the backwards-compatibility issue Ron raises
is very pertinent. People are using containers already - reorganising
the RDF documents (and our mindsets) into "layers" is a great idea*, but
containers must stay. It may be hard work (I wasn't expecting a
cakewalk) but suddenly producing a normative document that says "there
is no core definition of what the RDF you've been using means" is
ridiculous. It doesn't do anyone any good.

* as in, anything that eases the clarification and understanding of RDF
by the world at large has got to be a good thing.
