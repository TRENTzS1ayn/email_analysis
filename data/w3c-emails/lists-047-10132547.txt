Excellent example. Parsers should not be required to know anything about
the schema they're parsing, I think; particularly if RDFSchema is
considered to be in a state of flux.

I think you mean
    _:genid <rdf:_2> "11" .
for that last triple.

In which case, this seems a simple definitive answer.

It seems to me from a pragmatic point of view that the <rdf:li> forms
are likely to be machine-generated. I'd not be too concerned if your
pathological example here generated

    _:genid <rdf:type> <rdf:Bag> .
    _:genid <rdf:_1> "1" .
    _:genid <rdf:_2> "2" .
    _:genid <rdf:_1> "?" .

- if we decide that this is not a legal set of RDF triples, then your
last example is simply not legal RDF.

Keep it simple (and implementable).
