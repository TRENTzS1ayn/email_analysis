I agree with your proposal, although I do not understand your test case
results. You write:

I think you mean:

  _:genid <rdf:type> <rdf:Bag>.
  _:genid <rdf:_1>   "1" .
  _:genid <rdf:_10>  "10" .
  _:genid <rdf:_2>   "11" .

is that correct?

Personally, I want to see the rdf:li syntactic mechanism completely
deprecated/removed at some point. But this is a good step there.
