Yes, no more special cases than that, please.

In particular, this rule can be implemented straightforwardly
using XPath; something like: count(previous-sibling::rdf:li).

yup.

(by "ducks" you don't mean "does not answer", right? it
*does* provide an answer in that case, right?

  _:genid <rdf:type> <rdf:Bag>.
  _:genid <rdf:_1>   "1" .
  _:genid <rdf:_2>   "2" .
  _:genid <rdf:_1>   "?" .

That's an inconsistency, since _1 is functional
and "?" <> "1". But inconsistency isn't a syntax issue.
