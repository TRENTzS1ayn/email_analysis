Its time to plan the agenda for the face to face meeting on 1st and 2nd Aug
2001.

I'd like to solicit suggestions from the WG regarding:

  o what you'd like the meeting to accomplish
  o what you hope to get from the meeting
  o things you'd like to see scheduled during the meeting

Send them to the list, or to me and I will do a summary.

Brian
