Let me give an example. We expect to find RDF statements on many
webpages and in many online data sources. Specific applications
typically consider only a subset of all available data (e.g. certain
domain, certain set of trusted servers, certain vocabularies, etc.) I
was trying to convey the idea that meaningful semantics exists only for
such limited datasets, whose boundaries are determined in a particular
application context. It probably would be inappropriate to refer to the
set of all webpages on public servers when say defining the semantics of
rdf:type.
