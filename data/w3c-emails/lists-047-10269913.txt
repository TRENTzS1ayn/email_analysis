-- primer/tutorial/examples, incl intro to URIs, XML, namespaces
-- perhaps an extended primer, including
suggesions on how to do n-ary stuff,
things versus their names, etc.

materials to draw from include [1,2,3]

-- Abstract syntax (i.e. what's common between
RDF/xml and n-triples)

-- existential/conjunctive semantics
-- <rdf:Description><dc:title>xyz</dc:title></>
means "there exists something with title 'xyz'"

cf [2]
and n-triples2kif.pl

-- RDF/xml syntax: bare bones plus
abbreviations: typednodes, attribute/element stuff, etc.
specified using XSLT and/or XML Schema

-- literals and datatypes
xml:lang, parseType="Literal"
(eventually: XML Schema datatypes)

-- schema:
-- housekeeping: label, comment, isDefinedBy, ...
-- inference: type, subClassOf, subPropertyOf,
domain, range, ...

-- collections (for what they're worth ;-)

-- reification (there be dragons ;-)
ID on propElt, aboutEach, bagID

-- rules.
er. ahem. getting ahead of myself a bit ;-)
