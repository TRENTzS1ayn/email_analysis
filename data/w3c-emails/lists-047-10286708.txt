This whole distinction between ID and about is trouble
waiting to happen.

RDF may be embedded in messages (like SOAP) that might not have
a url of any sort. In this case, the distinction between id and about,
and
the proposal to use "#" which is based on the idea of anchors all lead
to nothing but trouble.
