That argument alone, maybe. But RDF containers differ from thumbnail,
foaf:mbox, dc:title etc in that they are (like RDF itself) a generic, data
structuring convention. One of many, no doubt. They're cross-domain,
unworldly things.

Let's agree to leave them in a spec somewhere (my vote: rdf schema), since
we'd be pushing our charter to do otherwise. A more interesting thing to
argue about is what the new simpler core-of-the-core-of-the-core part of
the specs might actually look like. I guess that'd open up new issues
which maybe it's time to have a crack at...
