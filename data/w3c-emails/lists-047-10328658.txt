Last september (seems so long ago!) Leigh Dodd's wrote a nice piece on
xml.com summarising some of the discussions at the time, particularly
w.r.t. the (then new) issue list and my strawman 'model only' document.
This might be a useful backgrounder for any partitioning discussion,
particularly for WG members who didn't follow www-rdf-interest back
then...

re-reading http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Sep/0074.html
and nearby, I'm rather happy with the progress we're making, when compared
to the uncertainty of last september.

The "model only" document that I prototyped (via crude hacking of the M+S
spec document) is IMHO a reminder of the potential for simplicity:

BTW, after I took scissors to the M+S spec, this is what happened to the

I don't want to slip into a premature discussion regarding partitioning
the _specs_;  I think you're right to encourage a discussion of problem space
partitioning first. I do think though that there is value in having a
description of the RDF 'formal model' (aka 'abstract syntax' etc) in
isolation both from any  specific XML encoding and any specific set of RDF
properties and classes.
