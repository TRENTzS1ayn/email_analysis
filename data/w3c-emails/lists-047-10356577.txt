Agreed.

I think this was the meaning of my garbled comments during the conf call
a couple of weeks back. Surely, XML:Base will come at us as part of the
underlying XML base even though we can argue against recommending it for
stand-alone RDF. I wouldn't vote for the last option if it denies
embedding in a `mixed-namespace context'. We do need to recognize those
things which are `beyond our control'.
