This could be useful for expressing the syntax.

The current version of RXP can output an XML serialization of a
document's infoset.

I have written a couple of stylesheets that operate on this
serialization.  One converts it to HTML tables which gives you a nice
way to display an infoset.  The other converts it to RDF confirming to
the RDF schema described in http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset-rdfs.

You can find both RXP and the stylesheets at

  http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html

Much as I would like to do the same for the PSVI, I don't have time
at present!
