This is not my intuition on this. I'm thinking purely of a graph-based
RDF model (for the nontechnical meaning of "model"). It has nodes; some
of those are labelled with URIs, some are not. The latter are
"anonymous resources". Two distinct anonymous nodes may be in
equivalent relationships with other nodes in the graph; this does not
make them graph-theoretically equal.

Summary: an anonymous node has its own "model-specific identity". Two
anonymous nodes in an RDF graph may have "the same content" but still be
distinct.

Forgive me, but if that is the case (and without adding additional
triples), could you show me what the serialised RDF for each case looks
like?
