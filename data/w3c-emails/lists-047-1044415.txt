It is my opinion that since the grammar refers to an unprefixed 
'type', and we have disallowed that irregularity, this 
irregularity should be removed also. It is likely that 
processors dealing with valid documents (i.e. prefixed with 
rdf:) will already be in line with recent RDF Core decisions. I 
think we should also remove the irregularity that causes type to 
correspond to a resource and not a literal, thus simplifying the 
grammmar, with little impact on backwards compatibility.
