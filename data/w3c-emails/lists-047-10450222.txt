I concur.  This was an issue we were wrestling with for CC/PP.  I had 
thought that xml:base would help there, but that's not so clear now.

(The problem is, I suspect, not so much one of interpreting rdf:id='foo' as 
equivalent to rdf:about='#foo', but how to interpret any labelling of the 
form rdf:about='#foo'.)
