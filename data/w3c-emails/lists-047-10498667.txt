While I'm picking off low hanging fruit... I'll take a stab at summarizing
the discussions around:

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-aboutEach-on-object

Of course, this may be effected by the resolution of
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach. Who is working on
this one?

cheers,

- steve

Now that we are getting on a roll resolving issues, I'd like to keep the
pipeline reasonably well stocked.  So I'd like to call for volunteers to
own
the following issues:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-aboutEach-on-object
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-nested-bagIDs
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach
