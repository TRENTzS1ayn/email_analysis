I agree with Guha. As to me, I'd get rid of rdf:ID altogether, or make
it deprecated.

With respect to this and other syntax issues, I'd like to remind of the
"roundtrip" test, which have been raised many times on RDF Interest: an
RDF tool must be able to parse, serialize, parse, serialize etc. without
loss of information, i.e., on every parse, exactly the same set of
statements is produced. Notice that after the first parse, rdf:ID will
be necessarity replaced by rdf:about, since the model does not
intrinsically capture the information about its origin.
