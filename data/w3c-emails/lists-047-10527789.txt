If
  <rdf:Description rdf:ID="foo"/>

is defined to be equivalent to, i.e. represents the same triples as:

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo"/>

and the round tripping test is defined to be that XML/RDF before
represents the same triples as the XML/RDF after (i.e. model
equivalence) which I think is the test that you suggest,
then this solution passes the round triping test.
