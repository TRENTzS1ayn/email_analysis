I regret to report that when I first implemented RDF syntax,
I completely missed this exception for rdf:type. My
XSL-based RDF parser does as Aaron suggests: treats
rdf:type just like any other propAttr.

  http://www.w3.org/XML/2000/04rdf-parse/

lemme check sax2rdf... bad news; it gets rdf:type wrong too:

$ python2 ../cwm.py --rdf typeAttr.rdf --triples
 
   
<file:/home/connolly/w3ccvs/WWW/2000/10/swap/test/typeAttr.rdf#Animal>    
<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> "http://example/xyz" .


typeAttr.rdf:

<rdf:RDF
xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
    <rdf:Description rdf:ID="Animal" rdf:type="http://example/xyz"/>
</rdf:RDF>
