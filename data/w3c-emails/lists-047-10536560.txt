This is right. However, by endorsing rdf:ID and rdf:about with relative
anchors we embark on potentially unpleasant issues like e.g. HTTP
redirect, support in RDF editors etc. In HTTP redirect, we'll need to
specify precisely which URL will be assigned for the namespace, the
original one, or the resolved one. Furthermore, if you are using an RDF
editor, it has to maintain an additional flag with each "local" resource
plus the URL of the page. This distinction becomes essential when you
want to store the content at another URL and assert that it "moved from
<previous URL>". If the editor cannot distinguish relative and absolute
references, it will blindly replace <previous URL> with a relative
reference resolving to the new page. Moreover, if the distinction
between relative and absolute URLs is required, the parsers will need to
support it as well.

I'm trying to make a point that this issue is closely related to
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion, which
has been resolved in favor of "in doubt be precise".
