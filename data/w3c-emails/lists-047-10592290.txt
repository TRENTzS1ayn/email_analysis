Well for one, #foo isn't a valid ID, and for another, Brian's 
proposal is to declare these equivalent.

My two cents: I don't think it makes sense to have two different 
things in the language that mean the same thing. It causes 
confusion (witness the issue itself) and encourages applications 
to use it from application-only semantics that will be blind to 
RDF parsers (witness PRISM). I still think we should either 
deprecate one or add a model representation to it.
