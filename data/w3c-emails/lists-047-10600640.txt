Typo: This should be </foo:Bar> (note capitalization)

Can you please run these tests through SiRPAC/CWM before 
submitting them next time. That should catch these silly typos.

Can you elaborate on why this is? I believe it is because of the 
functional container properties thing, which we as a working 
group have not yet made a decision on to my knowledge (do they 
only apply to containers or any resource?).

I'm not sure that this is specified in the M&S (perhaps this 
should be an issue) but it's certainly not a good idea to make 
something both a class and a property. Let's not have a test 
case that does this, please. Especially since rdf:li is a 
special syntactic element -- I do not think we should allow it 
to be used in this way.

Typo: This is invalid XML.

Typo: The last <rdf:Description> should be a closing tag.

Otherwise, the test cases look pretty good.
