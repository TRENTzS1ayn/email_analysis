I don't know what you mean by resources "originating" from a URI 
but it is my understanding that all resources are identified by 
absolute URIs and not relative ones so these flags need not 
exist in the model.

Also note that N-Triples requires the use of absolute URIs, and 
it was my understanding that parsers should also generate 
absolute URIs.
