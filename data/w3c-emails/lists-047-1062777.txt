Unless "little" = "no" impact, I'd have to disagree here. The propAttr
stuff is there as an abbreviated shorthand; certainly making rdf:type
attributes have a literal interpretation completely removes their
usefulness. Dave's idea of including rdf:subjct and rdf:property makes
some sense in the light of this; I don't think that you can't handle
rdf:object in a similar fashion is too much of a problem (it's a
convenient shorthand, nothing more).
