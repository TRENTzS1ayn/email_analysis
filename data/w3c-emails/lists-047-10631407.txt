To clarify, the parsers will need to explicitly flag each generated
resource as originating from an absolute or relative URL. Do we want to
introduce these extra "flags" as a part of the model?

In my opinion, while relative URLs are very useful for HTML, they may be
harmful for RDF (discussed a lot on RDF Interest).
