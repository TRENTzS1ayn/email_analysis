I still don't understand. Why do parsers "generate" resources? 
How do resources "originate" form URLs?

It is my understanding that only absolute URIs identify 
resources. Relative URIs are simply abbreviations for absolute 
URIs which must be resolved through use of a base URI. An RDF 
document without a base URI is meaningless -- have you ever 
opened up an HTML page in your browser without a URL?
