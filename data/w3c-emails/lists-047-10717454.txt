If you just want to check the syntax of an n-triples file,
I suggest one of the little perl ditties I made up:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/n3-simple.pl
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/n-triples2kif.pl

But it sounds like you want to check that two n-triples
files are equivalent, or convert from n-triples to RDF/xml
and back, in which case you'll need something like cwm
or Euler or a little time hacking in prolog ...

or from CVS

  http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2000/10/swap/

ArtB managed to install it an took notes on what it takes...
Art, have you made that publicly readable yet?

TimBL runs cwm on a Win2k machine, I think.
