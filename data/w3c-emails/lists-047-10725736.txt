I certainly hope not. At least, this is not the way I use 
anonymous terms. I imagine anonymous terms being equivalent to 
stating "a term with these properties" not "all terms with these 
properties". If two people in a room call out that they're 
thinking of something gray...

:Person1 :thinkingOf [ :color :Gray ] .
:Person2 :thinkingOf [ :color :Gray ] .

... we cannot conclude that they are both thinking of elephants, 
or at least of the same thing. One may be thinking of the New 
York Times and the other of his office building.

I think you are smushing prematurely.

And the current XML still doesn't have a way to say:

_:a :property _:b .
_:b :property _:a .

nor

:x :property _:a .
:y :property _:a .

If anonymous nodes are part of the abstract syntax (which we 
seem to have implicitly agreed upon through our acceptance on 
N-Triples), then this is an issue.
