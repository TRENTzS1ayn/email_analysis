I'm adding container support to an RDF parser tonight...
it sure is nice to have a pile of test cases to work
with.

But this one looks totally bogus. Did we really
endorse this one? If so, would somebody show me the record?

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.nt

why aren't e1 and e4 treated the same way?

Also... this test involves reification; did
we consciously decide how reification works here?
