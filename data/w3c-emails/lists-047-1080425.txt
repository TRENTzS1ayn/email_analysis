test005 sure looks squirrelly too... <rdf:li> gets
special treatment when it's a typednode?

Ugh... that was evidently on purpose...

  rdf:li elements will be translated to rdf:_nnn elements
  when they are found matching either a propertyElt (production 6.12)
  or a a typedNode (production 6.13).

I guess my implementation will raise a "not supported"
exception in that case; I don't see sufficient value
to implement this.
