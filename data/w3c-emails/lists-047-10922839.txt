Well, by definition (as I understand these things) it's only a resource if 
it has a URI.

The fact that something can have a URI (and anything can, right?) doesn't 
mean that it's got one. (Not every mail message has a Message-ID header, 
from which the mid: is derived.)

 From a practical viewpoint, having a URI but not knowing what it is 
doesn't seem to be significantly different from not having a URI.

Because (by my lights) a CC/PP profile may be some data that doesn't have a 
URI.  Which (by your lights) means that it cannot be valid XML hence not 
valid RDF.

I don't.  That sounds to me more like a religion, or act of faith, than a 
state of affairs.

More important, I think, than the lack of a contradiction is a sense of 
common understanding (which, also, is an act of faith...).
