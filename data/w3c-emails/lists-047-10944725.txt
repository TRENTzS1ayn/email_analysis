I think you've slightly overstated the case there,
but the argument holds even the way you've phrased it, so...

Suppose I say that it does. There's no argument to
refute me, is there? i.e. there's no reason not
to adopt this as an axiom.

Those messages can be named just like all the things
that aren't mail messages at all can be named.

But this isn't an issue of practical viewpoints; it's
an argument of architectural constraints -- or rather,
lack of them. So the difference is significant.

You trust that I have a birthday even though you don't
know it, right? By the same token, it seems easy
enough to accept that resources have URIs even though
those URIs aren't always specified.

We disagree on that.

Well, that's how architecture and mathematics work, no?

i.e. by the same token, nothing compells you to agree that
2+2=4, nor that the DNS has a unique root.
But it follows from generally accepted axioms,
so you do agree, right?

Alas, it's true that a lot of folks think of the Web
as HTTP+HTML. They speak of "the Web or email or ftp"
when they should say "HTTP or email or ftp, all of which
are part of the Web." The telephone system is also
part of The Web, as is IRC etc.
cf rough notes
  http://www.w3.org/2001/01/rtriw44
and running code
  http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/telagent/

I agree that this common understanding is somewhat lacking
and important to achieve; I plan to spend considerable
effort developing it over the next few years.
But meanwhile, the 10 year history of the Web
is evidence that this axiom is useful; can we agree that
for the purposes of the RDF spec, every document is in the Web?
