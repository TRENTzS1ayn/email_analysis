I have a test harness set up to do this for a number of recent 
implementations. It outputs in the format for Dave Beckett's RDF 
Parser Tests. Do folks feel this is useful? What would be the 
best way to present this data?

While trying to set this up, I find that some of the tests are 
401 Forbidden. Also, misspellings like:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-
tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-lements/

should be deleted.

Thanks,
