There was some related discussion in the telecon
this afternoon, and I was kind of unable to explain
my point...(I'm really hopeless in that respect)

The thing about anonymous nodes is that they
are ***variables***
if they would be constants, we would be able
to identify them with ***URI constants***
Now they are actually existentially quantified
variables, something like: there exists an _:a
or (using existing vocab): this log:forSome _:a
So I think we should say that *explicitly*
is the testresults (and in the model theory)
(the general case?)
