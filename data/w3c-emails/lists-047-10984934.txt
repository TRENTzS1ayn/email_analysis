Let's call this something X.  At this stage, I discern 3 possibilities:
(a)  X has no URI
(b)  X has a URI, but I don't know what it is
(c)  X has a URI and I know what it is

For performing a computation (in our case, interpreting a relative URI), I 
see no practical distinction between (a) and (b).  So, yes, I can adopt 
this as an axiom, but the inference rules I use to decide possible 
computations may need to be adjusted as a result.  (Previously, I had 
assumed that if X had a URI I could find out what it was.)

I generally regard "architecture" as a means to achieve a practical end.

OK, so we probably need to frame this discussion in terms that we agree about.

Not entirely, I think.  One adopts a viewpoint that yields a desired result.

I dispute "nothing compels":  life in the modern world would get pretty 
tough for me if I rejected the notion that 2+2=4.  And accepting a unique 
DNS root helps me access Internet services.

I think it's quite reasonable to think of the Web as being more than just 
HTTP+HTML, without necessarily accepting that it's omnipresent.  It's 
pretty easy to accept the web as a whole range of things that happen on the 
Internet;  for me, it's something of a stretch to also include the weekly 
groceries or the plants in my garden.  Sure, you can do this, but I think 
that when a concept is allowed too much free reign it loses its potency.

I'd say it's useful to develop the idea that the Web can relate to non-Web 
things, rather than say that everything is "in the Web" without distinction.

Be careful what you wish for...

I'll accept that every document, every collection of data, *can* be 
assigned a URI, which I think is sufficient for the purposes of the current 
discussion.  In my response to Danbri on this topic I said:

[[[
Maybe we might say that a relative URI is meaningful only if there *is* a 
URI (per 5.1.1-5.1.4) relative to which it can be evaluated?
]]]

This phrasing could be tightened up somewhat.  You might also want to say 
something about how to interpret a relative URI in RDF if there is no known 
base URI.
