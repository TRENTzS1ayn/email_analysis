To: rdf core<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>

I took an action to draft a partioning of our problem space.

RDFCore: A base abstract syntax and a semantics for it.  The abstract syntax
is equivalent to n-triple (can n-triple be that abstract syntax).  Nothing
more - does not include type, containers, reification.

RDFSchema: Schema as currently conceived.

Vocabularies (aka standard library): Reification and containers

RDF/XML: Syntax considerations only.  Defines the language using some
suitable mechanism (not necessarily BNF) and defines (formally?)
a transform from RDF/XML to n-triple.

With RDFCore, Eric's suggestion to set a goal of having draft document
to discuss at the face to face is an excellent one.

With an eye on the calendar, would it be possible to move forward on
any of the other areas in parallel?

DanBri - do you think that progress can be made on schema, or is it
too dependent on the core?

On the syntax front, would it be possible to investigate how best to
specify the language and its transformation to n-triple?

On the vocabularies front, can we make progress with reification based
on Frank's questions or should we wait till the core is further along.
