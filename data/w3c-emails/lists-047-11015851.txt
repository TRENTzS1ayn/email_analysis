Yep. I'd be inclined to call it RDFModel, to avoid confusion with the WG
name. I hope we don't come to regret the choice of name for this group!

I'd love to get an RDFCore-branded revision to the RDF Schema document
underway, since we have some known fixes floating around. We made RDF
Schema pretty independent of the RDF Syntax; and I hope there aren't many
points where RDFCore issues mean we can't progress Schema. The only things
that come to mind is the use of rdf:ID and worries about the use of '#'.
But those dependencies shouldn't paralyse us from making progress.

While our understanding of the best spec partitioning may evolve, I would
like to have go-ahead from the group to churn out another revision of RDFS
for consideration by the group. I could certainly get RDFS back on track
for internal-to-working-group publication before the face to face; whether
we want a proper W3C Tech report publication prior to face to face I
don't know.

How about I try to get something done for working-group eyes pre-f2f and
we see how it looks?
