I have long since come to regret the choice of the term "model"
in the RDF specs.

How about the term we already have: Framework, i.e.
for the abstract syntax and its semantics:


Resource Description Framework (RDF).

Following on that...

Describing Classes and Properties in the Resource Description Framework
(RDF)
Containers for the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
Reflection in the  Resource Description Framework (RDF)

(is "reflection" ala Java reflection less scary than reification?
Is it a misnomer?)

An XML Syntax for the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
or
Writing Resource Descriptions in XML

Surely everybody is invited to draft stuff, right?
i.e. nobody has any "write lock"s at this point, do they?

I'm especially interested to see tutorial/primer stuff.

At this point, it doesn't look like a question of group resources
per se; drafting is more of an individual thing. I intend
to try to draft some stuff; if it works out, I'll propose
it to the group. If I run into too many open issues, I
can just tell the group that.
