Hi Jos,

With regard to the recent discussion with Jan, I think there might be
some miscommunication.  What I think than Jan is saying is that, given
the model:

  <http://descr1> <http:/prop> _:anon .
  <http://descr2> <http:/prop> _:anon .

it is not possible to express this exactly in the RDF/XML syntax.

The reason is that the only way this can be done is to assign an ID
or a URI to the anonymous resource.  That 'resource' then ceases to 
be anonymous.  In effect, it is no longer a variable.  Try 
translating the above n-triple example to RDF/XML and you will see 
what I mean.

Reading your message again, maybe I get an inkling of what you are
saying.  We are talking here about what is an anonymous resource.
We have been saying that it is an existentially qualified variable.
I have been understanding that to mean that it denotes some specific
resource with certain properties, i.e.

  _:anon <rdf:type> <rdf:Class> .

says there is some specific resource, _:anon, which has type class.
Is that what you would call a 'constant'?  Ah.  This is beginning
to make sense to me.  If it were a constant, then you wouldn't
mind at all that a URI had been assigned to it.   That would not
change its nature.

I think you may be saying that what I thought of as a variable
is not really a variable.  It does not bind to multiple values.
Instead it represents a single value (constant) though I don't
know what the value is.   Hmmm.  Now consider:

   5+x=1

Is x a variable?  No.  Its an unknown, until I solve the equation.
Have we been calling anon resources variables, when we should have
called them unknowns?

If what I previously thought of as a variable, is not really a
variable, how would you explain what a variable is, without
having to refer to concepts defined in a logic layer above
rdfcore?

This is really very interesting.

Have a good weekend.

Brian
