I was talking about the RDF Schema spec that I'm co-editor of with Guha.
There are relatively few open issues against that spec; most of our
worries appear to be with Model, Syntax and tutorial/primer. I was
proposing a cycle of edits to get a successor document to the RDF Schema
1.0 CR doc out before the group, so we could take stock from there.
