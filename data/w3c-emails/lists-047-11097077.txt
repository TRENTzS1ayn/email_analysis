I've never seen a clear definition of this 'stricter' sense. The phrase
'something you can get at via the network' doesn't seem even to be a rough
approximation: we have URIs for all kinds of things, isbn:, tel:, urn:,
java:, etc. I'm not sure why we would want to define our notion of
'resource' with special reference to a computer network. Is the intuition
is something like 'those things in the domain that can be named with RFC2396
identifier strings'? Is there anything more we can say about those things?

Can you propose a definition? I agree that there is a need to
make some distinction here, or at least to couch the specs in a way that
more carefully distinguishes an object from its name(s).

'Object Description Framework'? Catchy :)
