Well, you did a pretty good job of making one up:

in particular, absolute URIs, without fragments,
from RFC2396.

There isn't much more that I intend to say about them;
some folks, though, have suggested that they're disjoint
from properties, though; i.e. that dc:title can't
be both a thing that you can HTTP GET *and*
an RDF property. We need better terms just
to have a coherent discussion with such folks!

And as Roy Fielding pointed out, RFC2396 itself
uses 'resource' only in the stricter sense;
he (among others) haven't bought in to the
way the RDF spec uses the term.

Ugh... I didn't make the connection to the title...
nor to the acronym 'RDF' itself.
