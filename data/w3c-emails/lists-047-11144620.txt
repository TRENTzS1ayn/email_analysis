Indeed. Things that need particular discussion about whether they
are in the core model are:

 xml:lang     http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xmllang
 object type
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes
 subject type http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literalsubjects

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literals-as-resources
              http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach

The first column are things that came from David Megginson's implementation
experience with DATAX and RDFFilter[1]. Being based on such experience means
they must, IMHO, be seriously considered. I urge people to read his
brief message:
[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Feb/0090.html
The second column are issues we already have that seem relevant to his
points.

In addition, we also have issues about identifying contexts:
         http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-graph
         http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-contexts

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-identity-of-statements
which seems to me to be a necessary part of the model.

I don't think these all have to be settled before we have some
draft core models to compare, but they will have to be by the time
we have a last call core model.

Various other issues point out places where our choice of core model will
have a drastic effect on allowed solutions to higher-layer problems,
and can provide sanity tests to compare alternative proposals for the
core model:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-identity-of-statements
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-formal-semantics
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-quoting
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-logical-formalism

It would be nice if, before a bunch of us go off and propose different
cores, we decided on some of the requirements they must meet.

Ron
