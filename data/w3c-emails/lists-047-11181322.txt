Except 'can be' is pretty floppy: the only criteria for having an RFC2396
seems to be 'first come, first served'. There are more namable objects
than RFC2396 identifier strings, so not everything gets to have one. The
vast majority of things that might be named with RFC2396 have nothing
to do with the Web, Internet, TCP/IP etc. Would you ever say of some
object, 'sorry, this isn't the kind of thing that is allowed an RFC2396
name'? I've not yet found any criteria that'd support such a rejection.

Understood.

Is there much more you _could_ say about them, as a whole...? What is it
to be 'name-able' by an RFC2396 absolute URI? I can just about understand
what it is to be a thing that has been _named_ by an RFC2396, but to be
the 'kind of thing that might be so named' seems a nebulous property.

You've mixed up a rather popular subset of the RFC2396-namable things, ie
http:-named things, with the larger population which includes tel:, java:,
isbn:, urn: etc etc., ie. lots that can't answer HTTP GET messages.

very true!

I agree with Aaron here: RFC2396 at least claims to take a pretty broad
view of 'resource':

rfc2396: [[
Resource
         A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar
         examples include an electronic document, an image, a service
         (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a
         collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network
         "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
         books in a library can also be considered resources.
]]

I'm not sure how, if at all, this differs from your....
