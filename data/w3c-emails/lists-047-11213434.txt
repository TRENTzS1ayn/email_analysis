I don't agree that anonymous nodes should be part of the abstract
syntax, and would suggest to consider this issue when cleaning up the
model. I'm convinced that (sufficiently) uniquely generated resources
serve the purpose better than "anonymous" resources (for instance, in
the example above you really might want to know whether Person1 and
Person2 are referring to the same unknown gray thing). Explicit
existentially qualified variables are IMO out of scope of our work.
