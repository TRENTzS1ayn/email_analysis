I disagree: it is critically important to distinguish between well known,
public URI names for things and ad-hoc generated placeholder IDs that have
been dreamt up by an RDF/XML parser. Unless the abstract syntax (or
whatever we call it) maintains that distinction, we risk getting into a
terrible muddle.

do you really mean this last claim?
I suspect you meant that all parsers should assign a predictable genid
given a common RDF/XML description mentioning a resource. 'all parsers
should assign the same genid to the same resource' would be magic, since
many times parsers won't have that information accessible.
