Dan,

just to provide a pointer, a whole while ago I proposed an algorithm for
doing exacty that "magic". A summary of the proposal can be found at
http://nestroy.wi-inf.uni-essen.de/rdf/sum_rdf_api/ under "URI
generation for anonymous resources" (by Peter Hannappel and Reinhold
Klapsing). I believe, if needed, this algorithm can be tweaked to
eliminated the problems wrt using XOR (as pointed out by Brian long
ago).

I still think anonymous resources first need to be resolved as a model
issue. Then, we can move to the syntax. BTW, well-known public names
introduce another danger, which can be even more malicious that
generating ad-hoc URIs: if I'm using danbri@w3.org as an identifier for
Dan's email address, and (mis)using for identifying Dan himself, I can
get into a worse trouble as compared with using two ad-hoc, not as
well-known, but sufficiently unique URIs that allow me to distinguish
that I'm dealing with two separate entities. When I have two different
resources, they still may turn out to represent the same thing. In
contrast, if I'm using a single resource for representing several
different things, I'm in a bigger mess.
