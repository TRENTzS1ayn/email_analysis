Maybe needless to say again that I have
another IMO, but as our DanC says:
  "He Who Does The Work Makes The Rules"
  (and you do work a lot, wittness your
  GINF work which we apply with-IN AGFA
  as AGINFA or A-GINF-A or AG-IN-FA)
and per fundamental human right
  "Anyone Has The Right To Fail"
i would be more than happy to fail and
have a better alternative, but saying
that things are out of scope is not
quite convincing.

I think about a core as being round,
so what's up/down? (more like in/out)
I think there is at least a part
of logic IN the core (maybe EC logic).
I also agree that declarative
programming is indeed a big step,
but in the last 100 years we can
find incredible contributions via the
work of Gottlob Frege, J.A. Robinson,
Pat Hayes just to name a few.

So I wait for your arguments.
