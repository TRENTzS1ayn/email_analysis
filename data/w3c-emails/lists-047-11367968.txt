When I raised this issue in the RDFIG session of the W3C tech plenary 
earlier this year, the response (as I understood it) that TimBL gave at the 
time was that the sets of Web resources and RDF resources are not 
identical.  My reading is that Web resources (i.e. those identified by URIs 
-- without fragments) are a subset of RDF resources (roughly, anything 
denoted by a URI+optional fragment ID).

It seems to me, then, that an RDF resource identified by UTI+fragment must 
be distinct from a view of a Web resource similarly identified, because the 
latter must depend on the MIME type of a retrieved entity.  (Though in some 
cases there may be a strong correlation between these.)
