Sergey,

I vaguely remember this being raised, and must say I have deep reservations 
about that approach.

Right now I cannot say exactly why I think this is a problem, and I won't 
fight the case here, other than to note that I might object later if/when I 
can crystalize my concerns.

(Part of my objection is that any mechanism that is based on merely 
statistical uniqueness (i.e. digest-based) has no place in the core of the 
RDF framework.  In an appendix to RFC 2938, I have calculated some 
probabilities of collision using MD5;  the numbers of digest values in use 
does not need to be astronomically large (c. 10^18 or so) before the 
probability of collision becomes quite significant.  Applications may 
choose to take such statistical chances, but I don't think a fundamental 
technology framework like RDF should do so.)
