That (and other similar things), without asserting the statement whose 
provenance is provided.

But also, it has been suggested (by TimBL and others) that reification can 
be a basis for defining extensions to the basic RDF semantics, such as 
extension to full FOL.  Based on discussions in RDF-logic, I understand 
this can only work if these new extensions have clear syntax extensions 
w.r.t. the RDF core.  Which I think means that reification, if it is to be 
used as a "hook" for such extensions, must itself have a distinguished 
place in the syntax of RDF.

Otherwise, I think that any of these "extensions" to RDF must be completely 
different languages that happen to have a passing resemblance with RDF 
(i.e. we cannot be sure that expressions conforming to the core RDF syntax 
still have the same meaning).

...

All this is predicated on the idea that reification is retained in 
approximately its current form.  It may be that this group decides that a 
different approach is called for (there have been numerous suggestions that 
there are more elegant ways to achieve the same ends).

In any case, I think the RDF core should try to anticipate some ways in 
which richer semantics can be introduced.
