OK, that's also what I actually started to do
last friday when I wrote
  I have recently experimented with
  implicit scoping, but I think this is
                  ^of existentially quantified variables
  not a scalable approach.
but maybe I gave up to early...
You see, it's a bit like declaring variables
in programs (local scoping, lexical scoping,...)
I will further investigate this, and come back to you
