Brian,

I'd just like to reiterate some of the arguments for making reification
a built-in feature (possibly as an optional layer):

- in M&S, reified statements need to have a URI. It looks like they
should be unique, but nobody wants to deal with uniqueness, but still
some sort of URIs need to be assigned, so we end up having to deal with
different URIs denoting the same statement etc.

- in M&S, we need a specific vocabulary to express/use reification.
Reification could be defined without relying on vocabularies.

- as defined in M&S, reification is extremely verbose and clumsy both in
APIs and in the syntax, and very few people are using it as suggested.
However, I personally believe it is a useful feature when introduced
correctly and compactly, and it can be easily handled in APIs and
databases as an intrinsic model feature.

Finally, (s1 p1 (s2 p2 o2)) looks nicer in the abstract syntax...

Sergey
