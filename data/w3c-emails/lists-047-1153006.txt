Hmmm.  Yes, I've got a problem reconciling the notes from the on screen
document.

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20010801-f2f/ericsdoc.txt

and the logs

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20010801-f2f/2001-08-02.html#T19-15-15

The on screen document makes no mention of the action to describe how to 
add to RDFS and says that we expect higher layer languages to handle this
problem, in which case I'm not sure we would have asked Jan to figure
out how to add it (I presume to RDFS).

This also links up with Aaron's suggestion that we should show how this
can be done with DAML+OIL.

Can anyone help clarify?

As its in the log, I've added to the minutes, an action on Jan  to provide
an explanation of how sub-classing containers could be added to RDF Schema.
We can consider at the telecon whether this is in fact the right action.

Brian
