I, for one, would find it easier to follow these discussions if we
distinguished the "reification" that is currently defined in the M&S
(which involves creating multiple triples, rather than nesting the
triple that is to be reified) from alternative notations like (s1 p1 (s2
p2 o2)).  I agree the latter is much nicer, but I didn't understand,
when Sergey said that reification was a useful feature, that he was
referring to a different way of doing it, until I got to the last bit. 
(Now all we need to do is be precise about what it's supposed to
mean...)
