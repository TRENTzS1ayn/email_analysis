I don't understand "need to have a URI" here. RDF M&S allows us to
describe lots of things that don't have URIs (though they may in-principle
be namable with URIs...). Can you explain the sense in which reified
statements "need" to have a URI? Or "have" for that matter: do you mean
that we can't represent reified statements without assigning a URI to
them?
