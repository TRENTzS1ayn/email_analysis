Re: Brian's test cases at:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/

Test 1: fine (although a note that ntriples definition needs expanding
to include "\n" and "\r" in WS)

Test 2: yes.

Test 3: yes, although this is simpler than test 2 (and subsumed there?).
Suggest you change foo:Bar in test 2 to a normal bag.

Test 4: yes (with a lamentation about the last alternative of production
6.12 again)

Test 5: ye-e-es*. I'm not going to quibble about this because it's truly
a corner case.

Test 6: yes. (the last case is horrific though :-) )

Test 7: yes.

Test 8: yes.

Error case 1: yep.

All looks fine to me (with provisos noted above).
