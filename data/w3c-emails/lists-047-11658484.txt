Note that the grammar suggested for comments was

     comment::= ws* '#' string eoln

where I assume ws = white space. So your example above
would not be a legal comment.
Given that '#' can appear in the URI-like thingies
RDF uses, I would be very uncomfortable allowing any
non-whitespace characters in front of it. We want software
dealing with that format to be as simple as possible.
But comments are a valuable mechanism, so some provision
should be made for them.
