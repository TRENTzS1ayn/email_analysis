Brian,

I get a hint from Ron's post earlier that he feels we should solve all
the outstanding issues and THEN cleanse the 1.0 spec in light of our
conclusions. I might have misread his message.

I don't know what other people think but I feel our ability to continue
to take each issue and hold conflicting opinions right to (and sometimes
beyond) their resolution bodes ill for the complete clarification of all
issues. Certainly, I don't think we'll have covered enough that way by
the F2F.

Reading the partitioning ideas (either as aspects of definition or as a
possible document set), I have greater confidence that we can reach
consensus faster if we have a clearer ground to work on.

Particularly, I vote for including a tutorial/inspirational
document/partition which deals with the local and inherited semantics
(my favourite theme) before (in some sense) the core model document.
[DanBri's document ( http://www.w3.org/1999/11/11-WWWProposal/thenandnow
) is an example.] I'm not that confident that we can all agree on what
it should say however! It would be good to discuss this in Sebastopol.

I also vote for reification to be floated up to layer 4 or more. I go
along with Frank's comments (and his mental division...) that
reification as expressed doesn't seem to be cutting it for most people's
purposes (deferred assertion, attribution, etc.). If the semantics and
the core model are really firm then reification, I am sure, will be much
easier to deal with as a purpose rather than an abstraction.
