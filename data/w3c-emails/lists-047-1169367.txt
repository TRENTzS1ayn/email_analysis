What happened (as I recall it*):


The conversation had previously mentioned punting class-contextualised
constraints to web-ont.

We moved onto strong typing for container subclasses.

Danbri said there hadn't been much call for this; at least, nobody
seemed to be making huge noises about missing it (although everyone
seemed to think it would be nice).

At which point I piped up to say that you got it for free with the
c-cont.constr.s if you included one small addition (a superproperty to
the "rdf:_n"s).

Brian asked me to summarise to the list the details of this, which is
what I sent in that message that spawned this thread (citing the wrong
action point by mistake).

We then closed the issue since we're not looking at adding this to RDFS
and I was expecting a pointer to my message as a "where this will
come from in future work" addendum to the issue.
