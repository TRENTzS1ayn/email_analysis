Personally, I don't think namespaces are part of the model and 
to add them would really break backwards compatibility. RDF 
talks about individual resources, which need not exist in any 
"namespace" other than the Web itself. Think of this document:

<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 
xmlns="http://rdf.example.org/#">
  <rdf:Description>
    <foo>bar</foo>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

and

<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 
xmlns="http://rdf.example.org/#f">
  <rdf:Description>
    <oo>bar</oo>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

These documents are currently equivalent, you seem to propose to 
change this. In the case of Protoge, namespaces are an 
application-specific addition to the model and should remain 
that way.
