right, and that is actually a dynamic thing, when
anonymous resources 'move' under the scope of univ.
quant. variables, they suddenly become more precise
(via extra descriptions) and as such they can
also be unified/resolved in a more precise way

case: 'the intersection point of 2 straight lines'
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/simulteq.axiom.n3
where the 'influence' :foo is suddenly :bar

I think that a 'resource description' via such
anonymous nodes offers a least power 'framework'
