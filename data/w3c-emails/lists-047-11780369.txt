 From something that Pat was saying in RDF-logic 
(<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2001May/0071.html>), I 
thought that maybe quotation was NOT a necessary feature for RDF.

I'm still not entirely clear what is the difference between using quotation 
and truth functions vs modal operators, but it seems to me that the latter 
approach places some constraints on the things to which modal operators 
apply (unlike quotation/truth function which seems to be more of an 
any-expression-goes approach, which I suppose would be more difficult to 
capture logically).
