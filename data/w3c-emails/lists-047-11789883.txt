I think that it would be more precise to say that reification is _encoded_ 
using rdf:subject, etc..  The _definition_ of reification still seems to be 
an undecided issue.

It also seems that some vocabulary-based semantics depend upon the use of 
more than one vocabulary item in concert:  an idea that I think is 
typically captured by "syntax".  (At this point, I refer you to my other 
message in this batch.)
