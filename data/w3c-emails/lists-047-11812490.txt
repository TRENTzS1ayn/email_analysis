The fact that a resource that is the subject of a reification quad in some 
way stands for the statement with the given subject/predicate/object.   I 
think that there will be, at a some level, an interpretation function that 
maps resources thus represented to some aspect of the interpretation of a 
statement.

I'm not sure how to express this, but I have some vague ideas bumbling 
around in my head.  Hopefully they'll settle into something more concrete 
that I can offer.
