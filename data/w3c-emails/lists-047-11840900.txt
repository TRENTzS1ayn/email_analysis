Yes, I do. Note that 2.2.3 is under the heading "Basic Syntax" 
(section 2.2) and that in the formal model the M&S makes it 
clear that:

p is the expansion of the namespace-qualified tag name 
(Generic Identifier) of E. This expansion is generated by 
concatenating the namespace name given in the namespace 
declaration with the LocalPart of the qualified name.

So this is the only reading that makes sense to me.

While I believe that the spec confuses schema and resource, it 
does seem that the model does not deal with the namespace issues 
(nor does N-Triples for that matter).

Note to Brian: We are getting into the issue

Would you like to bring this on the table?
