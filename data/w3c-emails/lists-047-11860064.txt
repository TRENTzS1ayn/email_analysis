There are the original proposal from Dan Connolly and more recently Art's

No - a triple in n-triple is a character string.  Rather different from m&s.

I completely agree with that principle.  I think that we can define
n-triple without a notion of type.  You think that's not possible.
How about we try, and if I'm wrong, I'll buy you a beer in Sebastapol?
