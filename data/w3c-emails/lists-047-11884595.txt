Thanks.

I agree that the *syntax* is a character string (as defined by the BNF),
but I don't think that quite captures the *semantics*!  And I thought in
the base layer we were defining an abstract syntax *and semantics*.

That's fine (right or wrong, I expect to have a few beers in Sebastapol
and maybe buy a few for other people too)!  I just want to make sure
(see above) that any "definition" adequately covers the semantics too. 
I'd be interested in seeing what you have in mind;  my ideas about how a
type system would work aren't all that well worked out anyway. 
(Actually, I can imagine a model-theoretic semantics that uses subsets
of the domain of discourse rather than actual types, so if that's the
sort of thing you have in mind that could work for me, depending on some
of the details about what goes in higher levels).
