I've updated this to close the action I had from the last meeting
recorded in the IRC logs at
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2001-08-17.html#T14-37-59

  RDF/XML Syntax Working Draft - Internal Draft V1.16
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/

However, this *really* should be on w3.org

I do want to point it out to the XML Schema Interest Group in this
form, I assume it is OK to do so at this address.

Dave
