A better understanding of what the basic intuitions are that people 
want to clarify and preserve in 'fixing up' RDF.  RDF seems to be 
many things to many people, some are more ambitious than others, and 
I think they are not all compatible, so we need to make some choices. 
We can't possibly keep everyone happy.
