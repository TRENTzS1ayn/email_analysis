You guys at db.stanford really do all think alike, don't you? :-)

While I agree with your overall theme here, it seems to go beyond the 
remit of RDFcore, as it requires a basic change to the language.

However, what you say about semantics isnt exactly right. After all, 
one *can* give a model theory for FOL, which is about as global in 
scope as one could imagine (way larger than the mere Web, for 
example.)
