What does that mean? Suppose there are two such triples, in fact. Is 
that illegal RDF? Inconsistent RDF? Deprecated RDF? Perfectly fine 
RDF, but not interpretable as a container specification? Imply that 
that's not a collection resource after all? Or what?

In general it would be better if these 'voice-of-God' assertions were 
clarified somewhat in the M&S .
