But if there are documents on the web with content, then some of that 
content might be about things that are not 'on the web'.  There is no 
way around that, and it would be dangerous to build in any assumption 
to the contrary. For example, it might be very important to know 
that there is no information on the web of a certain kind (because 
you  might want to conclude that you need to find it out by some 
other means.)
