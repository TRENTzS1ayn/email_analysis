For some reason, several people seem to be unhappy about the above side
remark of mine. If it does not make sense, well scrap it.

If you mean Stefan, we do have lots of opinionated discussions on many
RDF-related issues. However, I'm glad that we look consistent from the
outside ;)

I'm happy to hear that layering is not a hopeless venue. I'd very much
appreciate your help along those lines, since several of the RDFCore
members including myself are far from being experts in formal logic. I
apologize in advance for many things that I will be arguing for that may
not make sense.

In particular, I hope you could find time to summarize the approaches to
reification extensively discussed on rdf-logic (Brian called for a
summary on that issue a couple of days ago). That would be a great help,
especially for the F2F.
