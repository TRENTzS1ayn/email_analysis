Well, I can refute you to my own satisfaction just by looking around 
my office at the books on the shelves.

Other than it is obviously and immediately false, no. However, that 
is usually a pretty good reason to not adopt an axiom.

They CAN be named, but (1) naming is not giving a URI to, and (2) 
even if they could be named, most of them havn't been, as a matter of 
fact. And some things couldnt possibly be named, by the way.

But I know that every human has a birthday. I would guess that you 
own a shirt, but Im not absolutely certain; and I have no idea if you 
own, say, a VW beetle. Whereas I *know* that some email messsages 
don't have a URI.

No.

These are usually classified as necessary truths because they follow 
from mathematical principles, ie by definition. Nothing about the web 
follows from mathematics.

The web uses the phone system, but it does not include it. I do 
actually speak on the phone from time to time.

No, we cannot. I refuse to accept as an axiom something that I know 
to be false and, moreover, I know to be false because I can make it 
false in a few seconds by writing something with a pen on a piece of 
paper.
