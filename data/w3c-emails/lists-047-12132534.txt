Really? Looking at all the books on my shelves I notice that 
they all have URIs. In fact, most of them are kind enough to 
print it on the back of the book -- why here's one now:

urn:isbn:059600110X

Oh, you mean my copy? Why it's at:

http://aaronsw.com/books/id?urn:isbn:059600110X

No you don't. You can't show me anything that doesn't have a URI.

And thus you're speaking over the Web, no? The Web is the set of 
things that have a URI. Your telephone has one, see the tel: 
scheme.

How can you show that it is false? You simply cannot show me 
something that does not have a URI.
