I think it's worth acknowledging that rdf:Bag and rdf:Seq are two 
constructs whose intended purpose is different, but whose formalized 
semantics probably are not (other than whatever can taken from the name 
change).

Lacking a general equivalence test for RDF containers (and I think the RDF 
core does lack such) then I don't think it's possible to capture the 
*intended* difference between rdf:Bag and rdf:Seq.

Pat:  agreeing with what I think you're saying about the semantics of these 
things, I think there is a "legacy" issue here:  even if rdf:Bag and 
rdf:Seq are, for semantical purposes, pretty much interchangeable at this 
level of interpretation, there is software out there which will impose 
further semantics.  I hope and expect that once the RDF core is stabilized 
and well-understood, further developments will allows us to capture and 
formalize these differences.
