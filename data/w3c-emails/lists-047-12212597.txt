Fine, and I hope they have 'triple' Trapist beer...

I find your testcase
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.rdf
and it's desired n-triples result
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.nt
very helpful in thinking about r9n (r+9letters+n)
and I'm trying to work out some 'rules' examples.
