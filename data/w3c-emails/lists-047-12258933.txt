Well, logically they seem to be like existentially quantified 
variables, yes. But you CANT unify distinct existentially quantified 
variables (validly) !  They would be distinct skolem constants, which 
do not unify in general. (They do if they are existential variables 
bound by the same quantifier, but then they would be the same skolem 
constant :-)
