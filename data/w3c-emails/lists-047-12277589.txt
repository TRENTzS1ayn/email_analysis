For the record, my proposal did not include a distinction 
between schema and vocabularies. However, I would not be against 
it as long as there is a clear semantic distinction about the 
contents of each.

I'm not sure what you mean by "moving forward". I'm all happy to 
move forward, and as quickly as possible, but I do not thing it 
is a good idea to begin writing/designing these parts without 
resolving the extremely important issues that will have major 
effects on them. I don't want to get into a situation where 
we've built an abstract syntax with literals and then we decide 
that they're really "data:" URIs.

So let's resolve these issues, please.
