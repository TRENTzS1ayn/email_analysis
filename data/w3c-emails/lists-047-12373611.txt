Hmmm, there's something I'd like to better understand here.

Consider something like:

    child(fred) & ( exists(Y): parentOf(Y,fred) )

Now, as I understand, Skolemizing this would yield something like:

    child(fred) & parentOf(Y,fred)

I guess that you're saying that in this expression Y binds to a single 
instance of fred's parent, even though we expect there to be two possible 
such bindings.  So the logical expression does not, of itself, uniquely 
define the binding, even though there may be only one in any instance of 
the expression.

Some problems, it seems to me, call for enumeration of all the possible 
bindings (including problems of the kind RDF is likely to be used 
with).  E.g. Who are fred's parents?  Should I conclude that such problems 
cannot be fully specified within the framework of FOL?
