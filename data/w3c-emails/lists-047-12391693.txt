Brian,

I have two things to suggest, (one of which overlaps what you have already 
suggested).

1.  Spend a *little* time discussing some 'meta' issues.  Firm up what we 
want to be our deliverables as a group.  Agree and clarify how the group 
will work to resolve the outstanding issues in the form of those deliverables.

(Background:  since the group started, I feel as if there has been a whirl 
of processes which sometimes seem to be only vaguely related to what I 
would expect to be the outcome of this group.  I'm sure these processes 
have been introduced through appropriate group consensus, but I am finding 
that it is often not clear to me what is actually happening.  (The volume 
of the mailing list doesn't help here.)  So part of what I am calling for 
is a clarification of the steps we expect to go through to reach our 
deliverables.)

There is one way in which I might be able to help:  at the last CC/PP F2F 
meeting I used a "mind map" tool to capture and organize information about 
our work going forward.  I thought this turned out to be particularly 
useful in guiding the group's subsequent progress.  The process would most 
usefully be interactive, using a large monitor or projector so everyone can 
see the structure as it develops.

2. I have recently managed to pull together my thoughts about reification 
and semantics, and the process has helped me to clarify some issues in my 
head.  If my offering is felt to be useful (in terms of not being utterly 
clueless, and being constructive towards our goals) then maybe we can 
refine it and nail it down as a key element of the RDF core definition.

...

And in another message, Aaron said:

This suggests to me that there might be some value in reviewing the 
outstanding issues and noting where there might be dependencies, and noting 
where things can proceed in parallel.

...

In summary:  I'd like to come away from this meeting with a clear view of 
the group's strategy for achieving its deliverables.
