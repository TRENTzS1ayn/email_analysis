I agree strongly with Graham's suggestions

Definitely, I'd love to see a roadmap in place so that we know 
how what we're doing now stretches on into what we will do 
later. I think it's good to nail confusion or vagueness down and 
increase our strength as a group.

Ooh, a great idea. I have software on my computer (OmniGraffle) 
that makes it very easy to make a Directed Labeled Graph. I can 
hook it up to the projector/monitor so that we can begin to 
sketch out our plans and ideas. And when we're done we can 
convert it into RDF.
