To: RDFCore WG<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>

In the 2001-06-22 telecon we decided to start prioritizing the issues to
enable a more effective F2F. I'd like to ask all WG members to express
their preferences. I'll try to compile a summary of the contributions.
Please try to justify briefly the reasons for the suggestions. If
possible, assign the issues to the partitions of [1] or categorize them
in some custom way.

I'd like to start with my preferences. I am suggesting the following
top-level partioning of the problem space (reasons in parentheses):

1. Scope and methods
   (RDF is expected to serve as a foundation of the Semantic Web, we
have to address that)

 1.1 Extensibility path

  - how can RDF be extended incrementally in a well-defined fashion
(later WGs)?
  - how can other languages (incl. logics) be built on top of RDF?

 1.2 Definition mechanisms

  - how is a model feature (reification etc.) or vocabulary defined?
  - what formal approaches are used? (BNF, tree automata, model theory
etc.)?

2. Abstract syntax and semantics of the core
   (most fundamental issue of [1] since it may have a significant impact
on other items)

  - e.g. definitions of layers like 1-3 of [2]
  - borrow abstract syntax for a human-readable syntax?
    (we need a human-readable one early out to communicate effectively
on say Schema and
     vocabulary issues)

3. RDF/XML syntax

4. Schema and other currently built-in vocabularies (e.g. containers)
   (goes last, since I think there are more advanced languages around
like UML, DAML-OIL
    that serve the purpose better)
