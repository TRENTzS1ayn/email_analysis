Thanks for doing this Brian, I think it'll be a big help. Some comments:

mime-types-for-rdf-docs:
I don't think this is an abstract syntax issue, although I'm not really
sure where it fits. If there's no better place for it then we can just
leave it here.

I also believe the following issues are in scope for the Working Group:

rdfms-literals-as-resources and rdfms-literalsubjects:
A large body of implementation and user experience shows the 
need for these
issues to be clarified. I think that there is certainly room for
clarification of this within the charter of the Working Group.

rdf-equivalent-uri's:
Experience with the DAML specification has shown equivalence 
to be a useful
and perhaps even essential property. It's absence from the 
schema spec is,
in my opinion, an error.

Thanks,
