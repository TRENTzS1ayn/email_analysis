  Brians F2F agenda proposal
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0394.html

  General agreement we need to define what we want to accomplish in
advance, not when
  we get there. Some concern that there is a lot to tackle. Concern was
expressed about
  the timing w.r.t the SWWS [1]. Do we miss a half day of the Symposium or
a half day of the WG
  meeting?

  ACTION: 2001-06-22#1: sergey: Talk to organizers about scheduling of
talks.

  A number of people pointed out we need to tackle the core stuff
(foundation, big picture,
  meaty technical issues, etc.) Proposal that three key areas need to be
addressed before the meeting:

  1. Which issues are in scope?
  2. What are the partitions?
  3. What are the dependencies between the issues?

  ACTION: 2001-06-22#2: Brian: Draft up these three points and post to
list.

  Eric suggests we all prioritize the issues to focus the group better. Dan
pointed out there
  are already partitions laid out in
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/

  ACTION: 2001-06-22#3: All: Post priorities with reasons
  ACTION: 2001-06-22#4: Sergey: Summarize priorities that are posted

  More discussion on partitioning (see chat log). Discussion on schema.

  ACTION: 2001-06-22#5: DanBri: Get a draft of RDFSchema to the group.
  ACTION: 2001-06-22#6: DanBri: start activating issues on RDFS

  The URI for Dan's edits-in-progress WG internal copy is:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/Schema/20010618/

  ACTION: 2001-06-22#7: Brian: Do a writeup of the containers proposal.

  More discussion on the F2F. 20-30 people expected to come.


Issues:

  Out of time. Did not cover any of the ISSUEs listed.


Date of next meeting:

  One week, 2001-06-29. Same time, same place.
