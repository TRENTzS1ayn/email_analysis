Yet Another; this only does ntriple graph matching - I'm intending that
it be used for running conformance tests.

Currently it produces lots of output and only understands
s p o .
(ie, WS between o and '.') and won't like WS in literals. Nevertheless,
it's reasonably speedy.

Can someone else have a look at this and see if it does what I think it
does?

You'll need a C++ compiler that understands STL.
