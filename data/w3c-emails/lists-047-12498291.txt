I was fairly careful to say "RDF document," meaning RDF
expressed in RDF/XML syntax.

This discussion is about relative URIs, which are
(at least by my reckoning) a syntactic gizmo.

I'm not sure what you mean by definitive.

To restate my position on this issue:

* each RDF document (in RDF/XML syntax) denotes
a set of triples (that can also be expressed in n-triples
format). The terms in the triples are
*absolute* URIs or anonymous thingies.

* the rdf:ID="abc" syntax is little more than
syntactic sugar; it has the same impact
on the set of triples as rdf:about="#abc".

I say "little more" rather than "no more" because
there's a constraint that no two elements may
bear the same value in their rdf:ID attributes;
this constraint is somewhat valuable in detecting
mistakes.

* rdf:about="#abc" is also syntactic sugar;
it's short for ABSURI#abc where ABSURI is
the absolute URI of the XML document that you
were parsing (if that's unknown/unspecified,
so is the absolute form of #abc, and hence
so is the set of triples that the document
denotes.)
