Again: *for the purposes of the RDF spec*. The thing
you write with a pen on a piece of paper is not in
scope of the RDF spec. Unless you happen to be scribbling
RDF on a piece of paper; but even then, if you regard
it as an RDF document, I'm asking that you agree
that it has a URI.

The reason is that this is the way the XML specs work.
There are two coherent designs:
(a) an XML document's base URI is intrinsic
to that document. We speak of "the base URI
of a document." If you copy some <stuff/> from
one place in the Web to another, the result
is a different XML document.

(b) an XML document may be paired with a base URI,
but that base URI isn't intrinsic to a document.
The same <stuff/> appearing at different addresses
in the Web is the very same XML document.

The XML specs (XPath first, I believe, then Infoset, schema,
etc.) use design (a). Since the choice is arbitrary,
as far as I can tell, it would be silly for RDF to try
to use (b).

[I'd rather not continue, in this forum,
the philosophical discussion
about which things have names and which things
can have names etc. Sorry I started it.]
