I put it close to #rdfms-fragments as they seemed to me to be related.

I'm a bit confused by this one Aaron.  Whilst I'm not arguing (yet) whether
these are in or out of scope, they don't seem to be about clarification.
Is there any doubt that as far as m&s is concerned:

  o literals are not allowed as subjects
  o literals are not resources

Which is maybe not how some folks would like it to be.  If we considered
introducing this change, do you think we would need a syntax change to
represent it?  Of course, anyone can now use data uri's now if they want to.
We don't have to do anything to support that.

I try to avoid using words like 'error', but I have long felt that such
a facility would be useful.  I remember Mike Dean commenting at the
Boston f2f that equivalence was "something that should get implemented
early".
