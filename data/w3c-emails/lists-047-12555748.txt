I do not see either of these stated in the spec. M&S says:

 pred is a property (member of Properties), sub is a resource
(member of Resources), and obj is either a resource or a
literal (member of Literals).

but it never says that literals and resources are disjoint in 
any normative portion of the document (to my knowledge, after a 
quick search).

No, I do not think a syntax change is necessary. This is simply 
a change to the abstract syntax.

Yes, apologies if I offended anyone with the term error. 
However, I feel strongly that this is a useful facility.
