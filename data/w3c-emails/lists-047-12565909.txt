Very nice!

It has a few special cases that I don't think are necessary
(e.g. rdf:value is just another propertyElement/propertyAttribute,
and rdf:Description is just a typedNode) but other than
that, it seems to be quite a compact and precise description of
the RDF syntax.

Is there an online service ala XSV that checks documents
w.r.t. this sort of schema? let's see if I can find
one by following my nose from the namespace name...

Ah.. that's even easier to read.

Production 4 is ambiguous, no?

4.type description = 
             rdf:Description[
                     idAboutAttr?,
                     bagIdAttr?,
                     propAttr?,
                     propertyElt*
             ] |
             typedNode

<rdf:Description/> matches both alternatives, no?

As I say, I don't see any need to special-case
rdf:Description in the grammar.

And I must have been mis-reading the other syntax;
I don't see the rdf:value special case here.

Where is the definition of the literal type? I don't
see any use of the 'any' type.
