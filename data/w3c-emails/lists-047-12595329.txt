With respect to F2F priorities, I would say (using Brian's words):

(1)agreed an abstract syntax with at least the expressive power of
   n-triple and defined its semantics
(2)decided how we will define RDF/XML (BNF, XML Schema?, DTD?, other)
   and its transformation (XSLT, other?) to n-triple
(3)resolved all outstanding issues with RDF schema
