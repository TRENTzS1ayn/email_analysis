If we take this reading of the syntax, then the presence of
rdf:Description asserts an rdf:type relationship between the described
resource and an rdfs:Class called rdf:Description.

I've seen nothing in RDF elsewhere to support the claim that RDF defines
such a class; M+S is pretty clear that the rdf:Description construct is
pure encoding syntax.

If we were to decide that such a (goofily named) class exists, would it
be something like a subclass of rdfs:Resource?  Your proposal seems to
make the rules for our XML encoding syntax simpler at the cost of making
the resulting structures more complex.
