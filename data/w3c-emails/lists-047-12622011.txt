Logically, names and top-level existentially quantified variables are 
effectively identical. If they are not effectively identical in RDF, 
the difference must depend on some aspect of RDF that goes beyond the 
usual model theory. No objection to that, but I would like to know 
what that aspect is so that we have some chance of capturing it in a 
formal semantics.

The issue over whether Person1 and Person2 are the same person is 
really not to do with anonymity as such, but with equality 
(identity). If the language has some way to say that two different 
names denote the same entity, ie some way to say a = b, then this 
issue is relevant and needs to be got clear. If it doesn't have any 
way to say that, however, then there really isnt any point in 
haggling over this matter. It will make no real difference to the 
language, since any interpretation that satisfies a set of RDF 
assertions could be extended to a similar one with a unique names 
assumption that also satisfies it.
