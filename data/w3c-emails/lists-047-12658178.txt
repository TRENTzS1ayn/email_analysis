Sergey, can I use your message as an excuse to raise another basic issue.

I gather that 'resource' means 'entity', ie anything is a resource. 
In this picture, then, the resources are the things in the universe 
that RDF is talking about, ie that RDF expressions refer to.  But you 
use a terminology in which the resources do the referring, ie the 
resources are REPRESENTING entities, rather than being the entities 
that are represented. So again, I am confused what is meant. When you 
talk of resources representing entities, what kind of things are 
'resources', and how do they represent?

BTW, I agree about the complexities that arise from the idea of 
'public names', and the need to get these into the open. This is the 
place, IMO, where an RDF semantics is going to need most work.
