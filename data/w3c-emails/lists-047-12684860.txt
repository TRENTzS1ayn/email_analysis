Im not sure that makes sense. Quotation, or something similar, could 
be defined without vocabularies, indeed (you just need a quotation 
syntax), but quotation alone doesn't really give you the full power 
of reification, since it provides no way to reason about the reified 
statement: all you can do is to exhibit it, you can't get at its 
'parts' without some kind of particular meta-language vocabulary.

Well, the XML syntax for RDF is all extremely verbose and clumsy, so...?

True, but don't get that confused with (s1 p1 '(s2 p2 o2)). (Is the 
inner triple mentioned or used? Reified or a subexpression?)
