No, they did not conform to the W3C rules for URLs, and the files are 
not accessible on the Web. (They are on a Zip disc in my desk 
drawer.) Not all file names are URLs. File names have been used long 
before anyone thought of URLs.

URIs are not even well-defined, as far as I can tell (apparently, 
unicorns have URIs, for example) ; and in any case we were talking 
about URLs.
