Right, it is a mistake to be too much of a TightASS about everything.

I thought the point was that in the base, the sets (classes, 
whatever) are needed to give the semantics, but are not directly 
referred to by anything in the language (rather like the universe of 
discourse in FOL) , whereas in Schema there are expressions which 
indicate (denote, whatever) the classes directly. If that impression 
is correct (;-/) then it would make sense and in fact would be a very 
natural kind of 'layering'.
