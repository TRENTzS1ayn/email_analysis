I agree. In fact if there was some way to 'nest' assertions in RDF, 
it would be a vastly different and greatly improved language. 
Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, that cannot be feasibly done 
within the confines of the basic RDF 1 model (ie without introducing 
some changes in the basic triples idea, such as N3's {'contexts'} ) 
other than by using something like RDF containers, which have exactly 
the verbose and clumsy translation that Sergey doesnt like. Drew 
McDermott and Jon Borden and I have been trying hard to do it, but we 
can't see how.
