Sorry for the confusion, I'm having trouble expressing the last 
sentence. How about:

"That is, all parsers should assign the same genids to the same 
anonymous resources in the same document."

Or better, that all parsers generate the same triples for each 
document. This does a number of things:

  - It gets the notion of anonymous resource out of the abstract syntax
  - It makes parsers interchangeable
  - It allows triples to be compared with a simple sort/diff
