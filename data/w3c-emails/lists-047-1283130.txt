I was actioned to make a new version intended to be a group working
draft; and this is part of the way to that.  There are enough
disclaimers to note the status.  The previous version was the private
document with no W3C-style.

At some point the W3C style and WG references have to be added; this
is that point.

I also think it is important to link to the issues that caused the
changes, and I still intend to record that.

There is no need to make the latter changes at this stage since it is not
even an RDF Core WG working draft and even if it was, would not be
normative.  This is a suggested analysis, which I will be adding to.

Fixed, also for the Resource case.
