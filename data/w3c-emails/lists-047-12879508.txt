I haven't looked at all of them in detail, but I see
several that look broken to me. Is there some
explanation for the design that results in these
results? I don't see it at a glance.

hmm... having rdf:li turn into rdf:_nn outside
of rdf:Bag/Alt/Seq looks like a design change, to me.

It's interesting, but can we reasonable expect implementors
to have gotten that from the original spec?

This looks broken to me.

Really? "rdf:li is not allowed as as an attribute"
Why not?
