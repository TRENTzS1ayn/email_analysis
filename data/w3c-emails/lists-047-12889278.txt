Ah, now I see what you mean. Yes, I agree with (a) over (b), though I 
really don't like that way of putting it, ie "every document is on 
the web", as that suggests a much hairier metaphysical claim. I would 
rather say, RDF only talks about documents with a URI, or is 
restricted to documents with a URI.
