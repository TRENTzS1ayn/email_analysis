Right. And I thought that 'resource' meant the same as 'entity', and 
therefore a literal would be a resource. In fact everything is a 
resource. (If this is false, can anyone point me at a definition of 
'resource' which explains how to distinguish non-resources?)

?? Surely a change to the abstract syntax is likely to require a 
change in any concrete syntax ??

I agree. However, equivalence usually means 'having the same 
referent' or '....same denotation'. So unless we have the notion of 
whatURI's denote reasonably clear, we probably won't be able to get 
equivalence clear; and if we do, it will be semantically trivial.
