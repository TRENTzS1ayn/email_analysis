Yes, I think you are right that it does not state explicitly that they
are disjoint.  In reading the spec I ascribe some information to the
fact that m&s calls out that an object can be either a resource or a
literal and says only that subject is a member of resources.  Whilst this
may not be a mathematically precise statement that resources and
literals are disjoint, it seems pretty clear that it was the intent
that they are and that subjects may not therefore be literals.

I would agree with you that this could be made more clear.  But I'm
not sure this is what you are suggesting.

Could you give an example of using the current RDF/XML syntax to
represent a literal as a subject.
