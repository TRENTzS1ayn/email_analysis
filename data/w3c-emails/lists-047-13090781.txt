As per my ACTIONS from last friday's call, draft minutes at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0422.html
[[
  ACTION: 2001-06-22#5: DanBri: Get a draft of RDFSchema to the group.
  ACTION: 2001-06-22#6: DanBri: start activating issues on RDFS
]]

...I hereby open two RDF Schema issues:

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-domain-and-range
[[
rdfs-domain-and-range: Should a property be allowed more than one
rdfs:range property? What should the semantics of multiple domain and
range properties be?
]]

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-domain-unconstrained
[[
rdfs-domain-unconstrained: The rdfs:domain and rdfs:range
constraints for rdfs:domain are missing from the RDF Schema for RDF Schema
]]


As a notice of progress towards my other RDF Schema ACTION, a reminder of
the URL for the (unstable; live edits) WG-internal draft in progress,
which I'll be working on over the next week:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/Schema/20010618/

Here's the plan:

 - activate the issues (DONE; I'll update the Issue list shortly to make
   this clear)

 - discuss on w3c-rdfcore-wg: I'll send issue summaries around shortly

 - when the dust settles on the mailing list and a wrapup is agreed in our
   weekly telecon (I expect domain/range to be
   relatively clear cut, and the other issue was simply an editorial
   ommission) I'll make a frozen snapshot of a Schema draft that embodies
   whatever we agree).

 - upcoming: we'll open more RDF Schema issues following this, depending
  on the rate of progress with these initial issues. Based on discussion
  from the RDF Interest Group lists (www-rdf-logic, www-rdf-interest,
  www-rdf-calendar...), feedback from DAML+OIL folk and others, I propose we
  queue-up 'rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes' and 'rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf'
  as next on our rdfs todo list. Pointers to implementation experience with
  these (and any other) issues are always welcome; Brian or I will add
  these to the Issue Tracking doc.

cheers,

Dan
