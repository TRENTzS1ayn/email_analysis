AHA!  I see what y'all mean by 'unification' and why I wasnt 
following it. You are talking about what logic calls equality or 
identity. Unification (in logic and logic programming) means making 
two terms the same by substituting terms for (universally quantified) 
variables in the syntax. Equality doesnt make two terms or names the 
same as a syntactic operation, it just asserts that the (different) 
terms or names denote the same thing, by asserting an equality 
statement of the form (= termone termtwo) (in our case that would be 
done by rdf:equivalent, I assume). So if two different URIs 
(anonymous or not) are talking about the same thing, then it would be 
correct to assert an equality or equivalence using them and it would 
be correct to infer anything that was asserted about one of them 
about the other one.  But all that is not the same as *unifying* 
them. Once you unify two expressions they are the *same expression*, 
not two expressions talking about the same thing.
