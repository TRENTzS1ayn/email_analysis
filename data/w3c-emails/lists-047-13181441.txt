For what its worth, a related issue (whether or not to insist that 
literals were disjoint from 'abstract values') arose on the DAML 
c'ttee and was hotly debated. Eventually, the description logicians 
won the day by claiming that to not keep them apart would render many 
DL inference efficiencies hopelessly broken. The problem seems to 
arise when one can have class definitions that depend on the values 
of literal expressions in any but a few carefully controlled ways (eg 
by cardinality constrainsts) since that could lead to the inference 
process needing to solve arbitrarily difficult equations over 
semantic spaces corresponding to literals.

Just a data point that may be relevant.
