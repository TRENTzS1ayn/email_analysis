A SAP would help here (such a hot weather...)

OK, let's take e.g. the following piece of RDF
(which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext.n3)

/////
:s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2].
:s0 :p3 :o3.
\\\\\

and onother one (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-rules.n3)

/////
  {{:u :is [ :p1 :x; :p2 :y]. :u :p3 :z} log:implies
{:u :is [ :p1 :x; :p2 :y; :p3 :z]}} a log:Truth; log:forAll :u, :x, :y, :z.
\\\\\

then the query (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-query.n3)

/////
{:s0 :is :z} log:forSome :z.
\\\\\

will result in (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-result.n3)

/////
 {:s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2].
  :s0 :p3 :o3} log:implies
{:s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2; :p3 :o3]}.

:s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2].
\\\\\

so there is some kind of changed 'extension of objects'
(there must be some link with SKIF here)

OK, we have identified an anonymous node by its content
in the sense of
  a (not *the*) thing which has as 'least common'
  certain descriptions
and it is kind of 'by value' (not 'by reference')
but is that a problem?
