Really? I've always interpreted this to mean that Literals are a 
subset of resources -- I'm not the only one, TimBL seems to have 
too:

<q cite="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/cwm.py">
class Literal(Thing):
     """ A Literal is a data resource to make it clean

     really, data:application/n3;%22hello%22 == "hello" but who
     wants to store it that way?  Maybe we do... at least in 
theory and maybe
     practice but, for now, we keep them in separate subclases of Thing.
     """
</q>

Looking at the code he also seems to store them this way, 
although it's not exactly clear.

No, I'm suggesting that we make Literals a subset of Resources.

Well, it depends on how we define the abstract syntax. I'd 
suggest something like:

<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 
xmlns="http://rdf.example.org/#">
<rdf:Description rdf:about="data:text/plain;Chicago">
   <startsWith>C</startsWith>
</rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

become:

<data:text/plain;Chicago> <http://rdf.example.org/#startsWith> 
<data:text/plain;C> .

The XML syntax need not change for this.
