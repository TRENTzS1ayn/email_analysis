But that's the case only for *some* interpretations;
using the formula in existentially-quantified
form, before skolemiziation, *all* interpretations
that satisfy the bookseller's database satisfy
the query; i.e. going from one to the other
is a valid inference.

No, it's a problem of logic: going from
(title item34 "f a")
to
(title sk1 "f a")
is not a valid inference; but going from

(title item34 "f a")
to
(exists (?x0) (title ?x0 "f a"))
is.

exactly.

Yup; that's what I'm saying when I claim that

_:g0 <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title> "Fractals Everywhere" .

can be writtein in KIF as

(exists (?x0 )
  (PropertyValue http\:\/\/purl\.org\/dc\/elements\/1\.1\/title
     ?x0
     "Fractals Everywhere")
)

aka proving a theorem of the form "there exists...".
