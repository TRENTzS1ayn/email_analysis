Well, I would, but I gather that means proposing a resolution
including test cases, and I don't see how to represent this
issue with test cases of the sort we've been doing;
this isn't a question of what n-triples you get from an RDF
document; it's a question of what the n-triples (specifically
the _:xyz terms) mean.

My position is represented by my n-tripes2kif.pl code; i.e.

_:x <...prop> "val".
means the same thing as
(exists (?x) (...prop ?x "val"))

i.e. to resolve this issue is to decide the formal semantics
of RDF. I guess I can work with Graham on this abstract
syntax and formal semantics stuff. [Graham, please let's
keep reification outa there.]

btw... in consideration of owning this issue, I reviewed
the discussion linked from the issues list, and the
case against digest/skolem URIs is made pretty well in:

in sum: we could, perhaps, encode all the information
about an existentially quantified term in some
sort of hash, but it would have to be a hash of the
whole formula/document, not just of the triple(s)
in which the term appears. And to do that is
at least very costly and constraining on implementations,
if not paradoxical/impossible.
