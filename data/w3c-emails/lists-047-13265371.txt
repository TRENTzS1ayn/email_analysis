Avoiding an onerous implementation burden by winnowing the spec is not
something we get the opportunity to do very often :-)

I feel much the same way about the potential of stating equivalence
between two resources being written in to a level I can't just ignore.

Handling anonymous resources is tricky, but it's not too tricky.
Some brief notes about it here:
http://ioctl.org/rdf/discuss/anonymous
...although these are a bit old now, and deal with the impact on an
imperative API (as opposed, ferinstance, to anything prolog-based)
