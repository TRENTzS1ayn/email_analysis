Right.  Now I see what you are getting at.  This is:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literals-as-resources

Creative interpretations aside, this is a change to the model
described in m&s, but it is a pure simplification in that it removes
something from the abstract syntax and changes nothing of the 
interpretation of what is left.  If it can be made to work, then
any model according to the more common interpretation of M&S would
be isomorphic with one using data uri's.

So on the procedural question, I'm persuaded - we should consider this
one.  Is anyone willing to write up a proposal?  It will need to cover
questions like, given a literal - what exactly is the uri a parser should
produce, questions of equality and equivalence (is <data:text/xml;A> the
same as <data:text/plain;A>, effects on implementations (do they have
to allow for larger URI's?)
