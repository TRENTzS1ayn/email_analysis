I'm not sure that data uri's are in fact isomorphic with literals as
defined in m&s.  Consider:

<rdf:Description>
  <foo:bar xml:lang="en">weekend</foo:bar>
  <foo:bar xml:lang="fr">weekend</foo:bar>
</rdf:Description>

With literals this would be:

  _:a <foo:bar> "weekend"-"en" .   (I've invented this syntax for lang attrs)
  _:a <foo:bar> "weekend"-"fr" .

with data uri's it would be:

  _:a <foo:bar> <data:text/plain;weekend> .
  <data:text/plain;weekend> <xml:lang> <data:text/plain;en> .
  <data:text/plain;weekend> <xml:lang> <data:text/plain;fr> .

The later is not isomorphic with the former.
