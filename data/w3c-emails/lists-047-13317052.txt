Who said it had to be this way? The outcome is dependent on the 
results of the xmllang issue, but I don't believe it's a stretch 
at all to see:

   _:a <foo:bar> <data:text/plain;lang=en;weekend> .
   _:a <foo:bar> <data:text/plain;lang=fr;weekend> .

or some other, similar syntax to do the same thing.
