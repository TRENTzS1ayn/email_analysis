I have put together a proposed resolution for 
rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about in hopes that we may 
resolve the issue in this weeks telecon.

** Resolution

Use of rdf:ID is equivalent to use of the equivalent rdf:about 
attribute, obtained by prefixing the # character and 
URI-encoding non-ASCII characters.

The following phrase and other similar text is removed from M&S 
specification as an error:

The ID attribute signals the creation of a new resource

This decision is based on section 6 of the specification which states:

The ID attribute, if specified, provides the URI fragment 
identifier for c.

along with a large body of implementation experience.

** Test Cases

The text of the resolution, along with a set of test cases are 
available at:
