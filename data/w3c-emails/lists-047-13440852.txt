Yes, with one proviso:

Some semantics depend on an interpretation of more than one triple used in 
concert.  Following the style of attaching interpretations to syntax 
productions, it may be necessary use a "model syntax" that is more complex 
than the minimal syntax needed to describe N-triple.

Otherwise, I fully agree that everything can be based on a concrete, 
parseable representation that we call N-triple (an important property of 
which is that, modulo trivial matters like statement ordering, there is 
only one way to represent any given RDF graph).
