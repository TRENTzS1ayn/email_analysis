REVIEW MINUTES OF FACE TO FACE MEETING 1-2 AUG 2001 (10 mins)

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20010801-f2f/


ISSUE #rdfs-transitive-subProperty (10 mins)

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty

This was discussed last week but we did not formally make a decision.

Propose that Jan's message

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0031.html

demonstrates why sub-properties of transitive properties need not be 
transitive.

Propose that this issue be closed using Jan's example as an explanation.


TECHNICAL PLENARY

> W3C has announced the date/location of our next five-day All Group
> meeting: Feb 25-March 1 2002 - Cannes, France.

Do we wish to plan for a face to face at the plenary?

Propose that we do, that we should ask for a Mon/Tue slot, that
we should allow observers, that we should be disjoint with webont.
Are there any groups we would like to scheduled close to?


PROCESS FOR WD PUBLICATION

Review what we need to do to get the WD's published?

SYNTAX WORKING DRAFT

Review 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0130.html

and discuss next steps


TEST CASES WORKING DRAFT

Review

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0118.html

and discuss next steps


RDF/XML Syntax - reifying using XML attributes only

With reference to Dave Beckett's message

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0106.html

Do we wish to make a distinction between ISSUES and EDITORIALS.

ISSUES arise where the meaning of the spec is uncertain.

EDITORIALS arise where the meaning of the spec is certain, but is 
misunderstood.

Is this an ISSUE or an EDITORIAL?


Next telecon - 10am Boston time, 31st August 2001.
