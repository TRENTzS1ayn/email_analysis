ISSUE  rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity, rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema
       Brian McBride (10 mins)

 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity
 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking#rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema
 
Resolve that the container specific productions (M&S Section 6, productions
6.25 to 6.31) and any references to them be removed from the grammar.

Resolve that rdf:li elements will be translated to rdf:_nnn elements
when they are found matching either a propertyElt (production 6.12) or a
a typedNode (production 6.13).

This change is made because:

 o the container specific productions in the grammar are redundant and
   add nothing to the language.  

 o The container specific productions fail to recognise subclasses of
   container. 

 o The current specification is unclear about how to process rdf:li
   elements which are not propertyElt's recognised within a container
   specific  production.

An advantage of the decision is that rdf:li elements can be used to
number members of sub-classes of containers.

There are test cases in:
 
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/

This closes these issues.
