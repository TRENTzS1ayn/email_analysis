Hey, you should be in Florida, 98F and 100% humidity, even the buildings sweat.

Just as an aside: that universal quantifier is scoped by the outer 
pair of { }, ie it is entirely inside the document 
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-rules.n3, right?

What indicates that this is a query? (Is there any syntactic distinction?)

Not just a quibble, because in many usages, calling something a 
'query' effectively inverts all its quantifiers, so that an 
existential in a query is like a universal in an assertion. If you 
are following this common convention, then the log:forSome, while 
logically correct, is potentially misleading: it is 'functionally' 
exactly like a universal, so that the :z variable can be bound to 
anything. (In Gentzen terminology, it is on the other side of the 
sequent, so all the intro/elimination rules are inverted. In LP 
terms, the goal is negated and then you test for unsatisfiability.) 
Notice it would be a logical error to skolemise an existential *in a 
query*; a query isn't being asserted.

No, you are just doing conventional reasoning here, with universals 
in the axioms (assumptions) and existentials in the goals (queries, 
conclusions) , both of which mean that all variables can be freely 
matched to anything. All your quantifiers are 'universal' in this 
sense, and all their scopes are local to their documents; nothing 
projects or extends from one document into another, but since the 
variables are all universal, they can be bound to terms (names) 
occurring in other documents.

(All of this assumes that all the documents are talking about the 
same universe, so it is kosher to just smurge together assertions 
from different sources and draw conclusions from them as thouh they 
were all in one document. This is probably too naive a perspective 
for the entire web; but that gets us into a minefield which is beyond 
the scope of this WG.)

I think that your use here of universal quantifiers goes way beyond 
RDF. All your variables are universal.
