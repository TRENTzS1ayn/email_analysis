You beat me to it.

If "model" means the set-of-triples abstract graph syntax, the answer 
is surely yes, in the m&s. If it means 'domain of semantic 
interpretation', the concept of 'anonymous' isnt really defined, but 
there would be no harm in letting nameless things be in the domain; 
that would be the usual logical convention. (If you insist not, so 
that everything has a name, then there is an implicit closed-world 
assumption on any vocabulary, which would make RDF reasoning sharply 
nonmonotonic, which is probably a mistake.)
