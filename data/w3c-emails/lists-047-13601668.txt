Graham, I have a strong worry about doing this in the revised 
standard.  "used in concert" is just a way to say that there is a 
syntactic construction which is not in fact explicitly encoded in RDF 
content.  It would mean that the criteria for wellformedness were not 
explicitly represented in the syntax, unless we introduced some new 
syntax (not just some new syntactic classes) to actually encode the 
ranges of these 'larger' structures. In effect, it allows for 
arbitrarily complex syntactic specifications to be smuggled into the 
RDF model invisibly. To call the n-triple encoding 'parsable' is 
misleading, if some of those 'parsings' are not in fact in conformity 
to the syntactic classes to which the semantics is attached.

Look, here is a universal parsable syntax for all of the world's languages:
<expression> ::= <unicode-char>*
but we wouldnt normally say that this is parsable in any useful sense.
