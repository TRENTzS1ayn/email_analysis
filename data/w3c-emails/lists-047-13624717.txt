all,

I mailed Brian earlier today to say I've been off sick today and expect
more of the same tommorrow; my apologies for missing the meeting and for
delay with my Containers-model and RDF Schema action items.

hope the meeting goes well,

Dan

ps. I have an action to get a new version of RDF Schema to the WG; my
effort-in-progress is at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/Schema/20010618/
but since I don't consider this frozen for circulation yet, the [action]
for this should continue.
