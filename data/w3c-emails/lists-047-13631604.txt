I'm with you here Ron. The literals as resources looks nice, but
probably needs postponing until RDF 2.0.

PS. on a related note:

What's just as nice is an RDF database that can generate "shadowing"
resources for literals (potentially, on the fly) - Danbri and I've been
knocking this idea around the office for ages:

<data:...> <literalhack:shadows> "foo" .

- the idea being that you can use relationships on the shadowing
resources (literalhack:hasSubstring) to express query constraints.
Initially I was using anonymous resources for this, but the data: uris
seem a more logical choice.
