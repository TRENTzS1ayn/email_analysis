No...

Yes; the scope of _:x is the whole list of triples,
not just one. My example was bad; to be more clear, it converts:

_:x <mid:p1@example> "val".
_:x <mid:p2@example> "val2".
_:x <mid:p3@example> _:y.
_:y <mid:p4@example> "abc".

to

(exists (?xx ?xy )
 (and 
  (PropertyValue mid\:p1\@example
     ?xx
     "val")
  (PropertyValue mid\:p2\@example
     ?xx
     "val2")
  (PropertyValue mid\:p3\@example
     ?xx
     ?xy)
  (PropertyValue mid\:p4\@example
     ?xy
     "abc")
) )

But it is true that you can't use that term ouside
the document; that's a sense in which these
things are anonymous: the syntax doesn't give
them a name in the web-wide scope.

I neglected to include a pointer:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/n-triples2kif.pl

and I'll excerpt a bit to be precise about what I
mean by "n-triples" and "KIF":

#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# converts n-triples to KIF
#
# USAGE:
#  perl n-triples2kif.pl <foo.nt > foo.kif
