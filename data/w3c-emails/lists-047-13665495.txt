Please let's not go into a tangent about tractable reasoning.
My point is that this very common usage of RDF, describing
something you want, is not possible if RDF parsers skolemize
away all the existentials; i.e. if the abstract syntax
of RDF doens't have existentially quanitified terms in it.

When you say "True", it seems that you are agreeing
with the my position on this issue,
namely, from my message of Mon, 25 Jun 2001 02:44:47 -0500 :

| So an RDF document with anonymous nodes is *not*
| interchangeable with a skolemized version of that document.

It also seems that you agree with me on this issue
when, in your message
of Thu, 28 Jun 2001 10:56:44 -0500, you write
| >In the current RDF specification (that we are chartered to clarify),

At least a few people in the WG are of the opinion
(when last I heard from them) that the parsers can
just make up constant names/URIs
for all the anonymous nodes in an RDF document without
substantially reducing the utility of RDF; i.e. that
we don't need the _:xyz construct in n-triples at all.

No, not in this use case:
* I, book buyer, can't state that, because I
do not know that the book that I want is
known, to the bookseller, as item34, when
I make my query.

* the book seller can't validly infer that
if the query comes to him/her in skolemized form.

I don't care how much computational horsepower the bookseller
brings to bear on this problem; their inference engine
had better not deduce from

       (title item34 "f a")
and
       (title sk1 "f a")
that
(= item34 ski)

because it's not a valid inference.

I'm saying that RDF must be able to express

(exists (?x) (title ?x "f a"))
so that booksellers can deduce from
(title item34 "f a")
that they have a book that meets the description of the buyer.
