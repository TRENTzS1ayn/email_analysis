That's beside the point...

I don't have any particular thing in mind when I place such
an order. That's how orders work: "if you have any things
that meet these criteria, I'll pay you $35 for one of them."

Er... that's an existential, not a universal, right?

A prolog query
author(X, "b"), title(X, "f e")
is a request to prove the theorem

(exists (?x) (author ?x "b") (title ?x "f e))
right? and the query results are proofs; i.e. substitutions
of the variables that show that it's satisfyable.

That's how queries work, right? They're existential formulas,
and the job of a query engine is to give proofs, by
example, of the theorem. This is completely traditional, no?

Several books might match my query, but I specify how many
I want in the order.

No, I disagree.

The bookseller can conclude that he has a book that
matches your description iff your description is stated
as an existential. If your description is skolemized,
there's no valid inference that allows him to conclude
that he's got a book that you want.

But it only has that denotation in *some* interpretations;
valid inference requires that *all* interpretations work.

But what's going on in the implementations of RDF that
do this (i.e. emit generated URIs for anonymous terms,
as if these generated URIs were in the
document in the first place) is all happening in the
same language.

So perhaps it's a misnomer to say that they're doing skolemization.

[...model theory stuff that I sorta followed...]

I don't think I want to go into that E/E' stuff until
I've seen your response to my clarification about
orders/queries being existentials.
