On the contrary; the pointer is there just so that
folks like yourself can follow it and share the
background I have and join the discussion.

This is the second time somebody has apologized
for responding to a message that I sent to this
group. Hmm... I hope everybody
feels welcome to give their two cents on any issue...

I have said more: I've said I'm interpreting them as
existentially quantified. I my research, I have
found that this is fairly traditional; from 1996:

[[[
2.2 Existential Quantifiers

[...] the meaning of 

 
<citation>
<title>On the pulse of morning</title>
</citation>

is not, in general, merely "The title is On the pulse of morning" but
something more
like "(There is an object, described by this record, and) the title (of
the object
described by this record) is On the pulse of morning." That is, there is
an implied
existential quantifier inherent in the existence of a metadata record,
and there is an
implied argument for each metadata element, viewed as a logical
function.

This is also the way it works in "conceptual graphs",
these days advocated by John Sowa by also written
about by Pierce as far back as 1909.

see

[[[
4. A person is between a rock and a hard place.
[...]

Following is the KIF representation: 

(exists ((?x person) (?y rock) (?z place) (?w hard))
        (and (betw ?y ?z ?x) (attr ?z ?w)))
]]]

Yes... the issue (#rdfms-identity-anon-resources) is
whether these assertions are all ground (i.e. use
only logical constants) or whether, in RDF, one
can assert the existence of something without naming it.

No, RDF isn't as expressive as KIF. RDF doesn't have
free variables nor universal quantification.
And as folks have pointed out, there are some formulas
like
(exists (?x) (title ?x ?x))
that can't be expressed in RDF 1.0 syntax.
