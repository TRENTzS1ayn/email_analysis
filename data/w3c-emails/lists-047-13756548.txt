OK, just allowing the point. It is of considerable practical importance.

I disagree. I think that this common usage, if it really means what 
you are saying it means, isn't in fact an existential at all. Im not 
yet quite sure what it is.

No, I was agreeing with what you said above (that

If all the reasoning using RDF is strictly valid, I think that is 
true. It may be slightly more 'dangerous' to use skolem names, in 
that it may encourage an invalid (but not unreasonable) usage, but if 
that is the case then we ought to get that out into the open and 
maybe change the semantics to make it valid.

I didnt say it would be easy to infer, only that it would be 
expressible. I agree that the bookseller couldn't validly infer that 
without some extra knowledge about uniqueness. The constant being a 
skolem constant or not isnt really important, other than if it really 
is a skolem constant that you generated then the bookseller couldnt 
possibly know anything about it other than what you tell him. Skolem 
constants are indistinguishable from nonskolem constants as far as 
the logic is concerned.

Right, but hes in the same position if you tell him an existential. 
He can't infer (foo item34) from (exists (?x) (foo ?x)) either.

BUt if that description is just a bare existential, then they still 
can't infer that the one they have is the one you want. There might 
be several of them satisfying the existential.

If you want your order to mean "I want ANY book matching this 
description" then its not an existential: its a universal. I think 
this is what Jos DeRoos is doing with anonymous nodes as well, by the 
way. I have no beef with this, as long as we are clear what we want 
the anaymous nodes to mean.
