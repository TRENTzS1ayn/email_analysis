its scope is the outer pair of { }
document scope would be
  this log:forAll :u, :x, :y, :z.

you are right, there is no syntactic distinction
it's just that such documents should not be 'asserted'

we follow that convention

right, we don't assert and should not skolemise an existential *in a
query* and maybe look for a syntactic distinction

They *could* have a name, but we just don't care about giving them
a name, but instead infer with terms represented as descriptions
and we think those terms *could* stand for 'some things' (certainly
not for 'all things')

Well, if we can make 'sound arguments' out of that 'smurge together'
what would be wrong about that?

also the variable [ a :Person; :hairColor :black]?

ps I don't know yet the true nature of anonymous nodes...
