I've tried hard to follow this conversation, and since my KIF 
isn't too good and my logic worse, I've been trying to 
transcribe it into the little of N3 I understand. What I follow 
you to be saying is that an anonymous node has forSome 
semantics, which is reasonable with Notation3's usage:

this log:forSome :x .
:DanC :wants :x .
:x a :Book ; :title "Fractals Everywhere" ... .

In other words, Dan wants a book. The book he wants has the 
title "Fractals Everywhere".

However, for Dan Connolly's bookselling example requires forAll 
semantics:

this log:forAll :x .
:DanC :wants :x .
:x a :Book ; :title "Fractals Everywhere" ... .

Or: Dan wants all the books with the title "Fractals Everywhere".

I don't think you can really have it both ways. The forSome 
interpretation seems to be pretty standard, and not exactly 
inconsistent with what we've been calling skolemization. In 
other words:

{:x a :Book ; :title "Fractals Everywhere" ... } log:implies { 
[ a :Book ; :title "Fractals Everywhere" ... } .

Or: If x is a book with the title "Fractals Everywhere" then 
there exists a book with the title "Fractals Everywhere".

Sorry if this isn't useful at all,
