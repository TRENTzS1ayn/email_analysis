Yes, that was the interpretation I'd been assuming as well (see my
message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0326.html)

I was assuming the latter.

I agree with everything you've said above, except I have a tiny quibble
with the initial "no". Part of the problem, it seems to me, is sometimes
we seem to be talking about what literally is or is not in RDF, and
sometimes we seem to be talking about what is in a presumed translation
of RDF into logic, based on an interpretation of RDF as making
assertions (I discuss this in my earlier message too;  I think it's the
same interpretation you described earlier).  The "quibble" has to do
with the fact the extract from the KIF spec says that the interpretation
of the KIF syntax (free variables in this case) depends on whether it's
being used in a context that uses the syntax as an assertion, or in a
context that uses the syntax as a query.  What was confusing me about
some of the interaction you were having (and the reason I cited this bit
of the KIF spec) was the introduction of queries and querying into the
discussion.  As I noted in my earlier message, the initial M&S example
of anonymous resources:

"The individual whose name is Ora Lassila, email <lassila@w3.org>, is
the creator of http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila." 

hasn't the semantics of a query.  It's an assertion that a given
individual exists (that I don't happen to have a name for).  It's not an
invitation for a processor to go off looking for a matching individual. 
If you look at the equivalent graph in the M&S, there isn't any
"variable" to represent that "individual";  there's just a resource
without an identifier.   So I don't understand how queries come into
this.
