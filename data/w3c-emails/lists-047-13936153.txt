My understanding of 'anonymous resource' is that an RDF/XML file mentions,
but does not name by URI, some Web resource. I'm at a loss as to how this
could be merely XML-syntactic: if the information isn't in the XML file, it
isn't going to be accessible to parsers and consequently any RDF "model"
(aka graph... whatever...) generated by the RDF parser is also going to
mention but not name those same RDF resources.
