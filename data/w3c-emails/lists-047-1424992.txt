Art,

This is terrible news.

I haven't had a chance to work out a coordinated response with Dan; I'm
sure he'll reply independently.  But here's my take.

You are not an HP representative on the WG, you represent the W3C team
and as far as I'm concerned you are still a member of the W3C team (anyone
who thinks otherwise, please go on vacation) and are one of their
representatives on the WG.

I do not intend to accept your resignation until we have had a chance to
first ensure that you did not offer it based on a misunderstanding and
secondly figure out if we can work out a way that will enable you to stay 
with us.

You are an important member of the WG.  You have long experience of RDF, both
practical and theoretical.  You have a key role to play in developing the
new specifications, not least your work on n-triples, the test cases and
more just this week on the strawman test cases draft.

Can I ask you please to put this on hold till we see how things work out
over next days.

Brian
