Thanks for writing these up Mike. Note that they're available online at:

04-27.html

A few corrections/comments:

Dave Beckett pointed out to me that Jos de Roo was not present, and thus
could not have volunteered to own rdfms-empty-property-elements. He said
that Jan Grant volunteered to take it. (I'm inclined to believe him since
they were sitting in the same room as I recall.)

Also, I've noticed inconsistent usage of URIs for the issues list. I'd
always seen it referenced as:

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/

until Brian recently referred to it with a "Overview.html" on the end. The
minutes all contain the Overview.html bit. I suggest that in the future we
standardize on the former version, so that search engines, etc. can generate
backlinks.
