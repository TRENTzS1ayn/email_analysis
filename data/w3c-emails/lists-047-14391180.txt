We discussed this to some extent at the face-to-face. In cases such as these
I think that it's important for the RDF to be reified. Humans can understand
that the statement "this is baloney" invalidates the rest of the message,
but machines don't. In RDF, if you say something, you say it. It's as simple
as that. If you don't mean to say it, then reify it.
