Hi Aaron,

Thanks for this Aaron.  I will of course include a pointer to your draft on the
issues list - I should have done that before, and we should regard this issue as
'active' at the moment.

Reading the original mail mesage that raised the issue, the reason why an RDF
mime type is thought to  be required is to support content negotiation.  Do you
believe that this is the only motivation, or are there others that we should
capture?  The current characterization of the issue in the IL document isn't
very clear.  Would you be able to write some words describing the problem that
could be included there?

How closely related do you feel the #rdfms-fragments issue is to this one. 
Should they be merged and treated as one?

The points that Frank has raised are substantive; I'm not sure that the
rdfms-assertion issue is going to be easy to deal with.  For example, you say
that the 'sender' is asserting any RDF statements 'sent' to be true.  Who is the
sender, e.g. in the case of RDF embedded in your home page?  Your isp?  When
this issue was raised at the rdf-interest f2f, there was a suggestion that such
assertions should have consequences in law, e.g. if they are libelous - how does
one determine exactly what has been said in a way that will work in court? 
These are deep waters.  What do you think of following Frank's suggestion and
separating the mime-type issue from the assertion issue?

On a more general note, are there any other pre-cooked proposals for dealing
with any of the issues that anyone is aware of.
