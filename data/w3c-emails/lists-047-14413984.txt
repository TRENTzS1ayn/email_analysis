Summary: RDF/XML files have no mime type. This causes problems in the many
applications that use/require mime types including: HTTP content
negotiation, linking from HTML documents (with the type attribute), for
identification of content (in HTTP, SMTP Content-Type headers) so that
RDF-processing browsers (like Mozilla) can treat it properly and for
compatibility with the many other applications that use mime types.

rdfms-fragments, I have only recently realized, is being used to identify
two separate issues. The first, which can be resolved in the mime type
specification, is the meaning of a fragment identifier on an RDF document.
The second, is the issue of what a fragment identifier identifies in
general, and how this changes based upon content negotiation. However, this
does not mean that any of these issues can be merged -- they are merely
related. In fact, I think it would be best if rdfms-fragments was separated
into two issues.

Personally, I wouldn't mind terribly. I simply thought that I should include
that bit because it was in Dan Connolly's original draft. I suppose that Dan
will have something to say when he gets back from Hong Kong.
