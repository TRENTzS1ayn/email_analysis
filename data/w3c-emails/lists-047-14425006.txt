In those cases, one option is to use application/xml or
application/octet-stream or whatever. Aaron, I suggest
adding something to that effect in the spec. i.e.
"use of this media type means you're asserting it. If
you don't mean to assert it, use some other applicable
media type such as application/xml or application/octet-stream."
or something like that. Also note that they can
quote/reify it...

Well... an attached RDF document is reified in a sense... i.e. quoted,
with respect to the mail message itself.

If the top-level MIME type of the mail message is RDF, then the
sender asserts it. For attachments, like for RDF embedded in
other XML vocabularies, the meaning of the RDF is subject to
the rules of the embedding mechanism. Perhaps we should
specify that attachments
with Content-Disposition: inline are asserted, but
Content-Disposition: attachment are not.
