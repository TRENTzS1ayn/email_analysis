That sounds fine to me.  I thought your paper on interpretation of 
containers was very good.

I'd like to see rdf:aboutEach removed from the core, being a feature that 
exists in the XML syntax without any corresponding representation in the 
RDF graph.  (If still needed, I would expect it to be re-introduced in a 
syntax-only document.)
