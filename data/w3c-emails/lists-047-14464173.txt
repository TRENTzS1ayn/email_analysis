Interesting idea, but...

I'm not absolutely sure about this, but I think this goes against the 
spirit of the MIME spec.  (I.e. using the MIME type to actually modify the 
semantics of the content;  I know this happens in practice to some extent, 
but my understanding of the MIME content-type design was that it is 
intended to be used at the level of choosing a suitable processor for the 
content, and that the MIME type information would not necessarily be passed 
to the receiving application.)  If you want to pursue this, I could ping 
one of the MIME authors and get a view on this.

[Later]

I just realized that this "MIME-dependent semantics" is already with 
us...  in the fragment identifier interpretation, so I guess this isn't 
really an issue.  I'll think about it.
