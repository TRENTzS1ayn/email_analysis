There has been some suggestion that:

"top-level" RDF statements are asserted in the context in which they 
appear, and that reification, rather than being a mechanism for quoting, 
might be viewed as a syntactic device for nesting RDF statements in other 
RDF statements.  The effect is close to the current situation, but might 
help to resolve some of the semantic issues that have been raised.  The 
reference to "context in which it occurs" avoids the issue of having to 
assign provenance when it isn't known.

(I'm not convinced this is the right way, just raising it.)
