Referencing the "context in which it [top level RDF] occurs" may avoid
the issue of having to assign provenance when it isn't known, but I
think we need to say more clearly how provenance is assigned when it
*is* known.  For example, we need a precise definition of "context", in
the sense of this container of top-level RDF.  As far as assigning
provenance is concerned, all we have now (I think), is the "Ralph Swick"
example, in which you reify the statement, and then make statements
about it.  This doesn't illustrate assigning provenance to "top level
RDF" (or if it's supposed to it's not clear about it).  However, one way
of reading the beginning of Section 4 of the M&S is that the reason for
reification is to turn a statement into a resource, since you can only
make statements about resources.  If a collection of RDF statements is
*already* a resource (has a URI), then you can make statements about the
collection without physically reifying the statements.  On this reading,
if the author of a Web page (in HTML) has also embedded some RDF to
describe the contents, the author could (for example) also include some
RDF "about" that page identifying herself as the author, using the
page's URL to identify it.  The PICS example (section 7.6) in the M&S
shows another way to do this.  I repeat:  I think all this needs to be
defined in the M&S, not in definitions of MIME types (as important as
these may be).   

A couple of related points regarding PICS:

1.  Appendix B makes it clear that descriptions of a resource may be
located separately from the resource they describe, and retrieved from
that separate source.  It is important that the provenance mechanism be
able to correctly distinguish between who really made the assertions,
and where they happen to be coming from (e.g., the "service bureau"), if
the alterative mechanisms described at the top of Appendix B are going
to be semantically equivalent.

2.  The provenance mechanism must deal not only with who made the
assertions, but other descriptive attributes like the time they were
made.  Again, the mechanism must correctly distinguish between when the
assertions were originally made, and when they happen to be sent on this
particular access.
