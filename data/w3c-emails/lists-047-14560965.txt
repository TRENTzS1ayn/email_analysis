Yes, that why its scheduled early.  We need a clear working model for how we
understand resources.  But I'm hoping to avoid a philosophical death spiral
on this one.  We need a model of resources that is sufficient to enable us
to progress.

Its exactly this sort of confusion that we need to clear up.  I don't
believe there is a question here, though there does tend to be some
confusion about this.  For example, RFC 2396 is quite clear that a resource
is NOT the bit sequence (or actual atoms).

Lets try and stay away from the legal stuff if we can.  The law is for
lawyers - we are writing specs - not Acts of Parliament, Bills for Congress,
or whatever the equivalent is in your locale.

Hmmm.  Might be a good idea to start with whatever definitions already exist.

Where?  How authoratative are they?

Resource is a term widely used in the internet and on the web.  Lets be
careful about confusing everyone by having an incompatible definition.

What I'm hoping for here is something pretty simple that can serve as a
foundation on which we can build.

I recently tried to articulate the working model that I use and it came
out something like this:

  There is a set of resources R.

  Each member of R is identified by a URI by which I mean:

    r1.uri == r2.uri <=> r1 == r2

  i.e. two resources are identical if they have the same URI.
  two resources with different URI's are different resources.

  There is a set E of entities.  Entities are things like web pages,
  numbers and trees in the park.

  There is a mapping D : R -> E.  i.e. there is mapping which maps resources
  to entities.

  There is a notion of equivalence.

  Two resources r1 and r2 can be mapped by D to the same entity.  In that case
  we say they are equivalent.

    equiv(r1,r2) <=> D(r1) = D(r2)

  and finally:

    D((p,s,o)) <=> D(p)(D(s),D(o))

I present this, not because I claim it is correct, it doesn't deal with frag
id's
for example, but to suggest a language in which we can be clearer about
what we mean.
