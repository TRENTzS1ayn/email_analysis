Er... where? I don't see that in the glossary entry you excerpted.

entities. Think of the case of a resource being a person;
an entity representing the state of a person might be a photo
of the person. Clearly the person doesn't represent the photo.

but the "argument from definition" wasn't an argument
from definition; it was an argument from BrianM's
working model.

I don't understand this notion of resources representing
entities.

It's focussed, yes, but I don't follow the reasoning.
