Actually, I think Martyn only slightly misquoted the M&S glossary entry
for "resource", the crucial piece here being the first sentence:  

"Resource:  An abstract object that represents either a physical object
such as a person or a book or a conceptual object such as a color or the
class of things that have colors."  

If you take an "entity" as being a physical object, then you have
Martyn's reading that resources represent entities.  In fact, as Dan
points out, this seems backwards, assuming a (at least one) common
understanding of "represents":  the M&S glossary seems to say that a
resource (an abstract object) can "represent" a physical object, whereas
a common understanding of "represents" would say that abstractions don't
"represent" physical things;  instead, physical things represent
abstract things.  Complicating the definitional problem is that Section
2.1 of the M&S talks about resources "being" (not "representing")
things, e.g., "A resource may also be an object that is not directly
accessible via the Web;  e.g., a printed book."  Note that this doesn't
say a resource may "represent" such an object, but that it may "be" such
an object.  Those aren't the same thing. 

Further contributing to the confusion is the definition (or lack of
same) of "entity".  In an earlier message, Dan gave us the definitions:

Unfortunately, I doubt if the definition of "entity" as used in rfc2616
is that same as that intended in rfc2396.  For example, where rfc2396
says "The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of
entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that mapping
at any particular instance in time", I can't see "entity" here referring
to "the information transferred as the payload of a request or
response", since there may be no such information to transfer (the
resource may not be network-retrievable).  Note also that TBL's "Generic
Resources" paper at http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Generic.html says "A
"resource" is a conceptual entity".  It seems to me that "entity" is
used in a rather generic sense in rfc2396 (and I think Brian's model is
getting along in the right direction where "entities" are concerned),
but this all needs some fleshing out.  

Bottom line:  I think we need to decide on a coherent picture of
resources, URIs, the things in the physical and network "worlds" that we
want to say things about, etc., and come up with good words** to
describe that picture, somewhat independently of the various specs we
have in hand (but trying to be as consistent with them as we can, in
order not to break things).  I suspect rfc2396 would be a reasonable
starting point, but there's stuff about "entities" and "conceptual
mappings" to be filled in, among other things.  I seem to recall the
Topic Map folks using some concepts making related distinctions (not
necessarily more clearly expressed, unfortuately).

** Actually, we need a mathematical-logic-style formal specification,
the "good words" being its natural language correspondent
