I actually learned (not in school) that
  r1.uri == r2.uri => r1 = r2
but not the other way around
so *each* uri denotes/identifies *a* resource
but *a* resource could be denoted/identified by * (0 or more) uri's

[[[entity
     The information transferred as the payload of a request or
     response. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of
     entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as
     described in section 7.

]]]

so the mapping of a triple resource is equivalent with ???

That's indeed very useful!
