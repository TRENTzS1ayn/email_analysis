I believe the issue referred to is:

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes

and I think it should be considered that the DAML program has already
developed a solution to this issue in their most recent DAML release.
Perhaps the DAML work could be linked to from the issues list?

(Brian, please also note that this issue writeup includes a broken link to
Dan Connolly's document.)
