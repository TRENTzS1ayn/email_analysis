I think this is a mistake -- there are many pages which return the same
entity (the same set of text) but we cannot assume from this that they have
equivalent resources. To do so would be a grave mistake.

The entity returned may vary over time while the resource stays the same.
Just because at one point in time they return the same entity does not mean
that they always will.
