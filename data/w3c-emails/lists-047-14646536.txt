Sorry for responding so late, your mail got lost in my inbox somehow...

Anyway, the result from the telecon[1] felt even fudgier to me:

    RESOLVED: We'll strongly recommend the use of namespace qualified
    attributes, and allow but deprecate unqualified attributes.

Afterwards, DanC asked[2]:

    stronly deprecate"???? I wonder what that means. Does the test pass or
    not?

I think that if we decide to come up with some system of conformance to the
new spec, unqualified attributes should not conform, but I think the
practice should be noted and processors should be allowed to support it for
backwards-compatibility.

Hmm, this tightrope-walking bit is tricky.
