maybe not if we talk about set-of-entities
which could go like:

  there is a set of resources called R
  there is a set of uris called U
  there is a function f:U->R
    for all u element of U there exists a r element of R such that f(u) = r
    (or we could represent a resource r as a skolem function of it's uri u)
    so u1 = u2 => f(u1) = f(u2)
    so u1 = u2 => r1 = r2

  there is a set of set-of-entities called S
    (s element of S is meant to represent the possible states of a resource)
  there is a function g:R->S
    for all r element of R there exists a s element of S such that g(r) = s
    for all u element of U there exists a s element of S such that g(f(u)) = s
    so u1 = u2 => s1 = s2
