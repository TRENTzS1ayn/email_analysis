Will do.

The history of this 'trick', I have since discovered, is that Chris M 
is an old friend and colleague of Ed Zalta (they were in grad school 
together) and that indeed Aczel's mind was active somewhere in the 
background, as was apparently Dana Scott, who Ed also partly credits 
for this idea. The explicit use of the thing/extension distinction 
and a mapping between them is partly inspiredin Chris by a 
philosophical taste for nonextentionalism, but apparently arose as a 
technical device which Aczel used before grasping the anti-foundation 
nettle.  Ed has been using a similar device in his evolving 'abstract 
entity logic' (I think I have the name right) for similar reasons.

Oddly enough, I came to this stuff exactly the wrong way round, by 
first reading Aczel, then trying to convince Chris that it was the 
most suitable basis for a model theory, then being persuaded that 
this device was less controversial but could do all that was 
required. I still prefer the direct use of the Aczel theory, but the 
world doesn't seem to be ready for that yet.

Right, I noticed that bug later. Now fixed.

Much of the current text is written for the WG and will be taken out 
from anything normative. Also I will try to keep a better separation 
between the MT, intro/explanatory material, and 'further discussion' 
which includes all the stuff that is in fact proof theory.

We could do that, but I would prefer to keep the MT attached to the 
RDF graph itself, and keep 'semantic' issues separate from issues of 
how to map from serializations to the graph. That keeps a lot of 
issues sharply clear that otherwise seem to generate a lot of heat 
and no light.
