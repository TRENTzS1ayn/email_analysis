From most XML processing APIs, this is indistinguishable
from
<random:someProperty></random:someProperty>

That's clearly an empty literal, no?

I don't see why; is there some inconsistency in the
way this is implemented? Oh... the problem is in
the spec: "3. (same as rule 3 above) If E is an empty element
(no content), v is the resource whose resource identifier
is given by the resource attribute of E."

That seems like a bug.

That seems completely broken.

(null? that's not different from empty, is it?)

Yes, that's how I think I implemented it...
(copy Jan's test case to a file... testing...)
Oops! the RDF parser in TimBL's swap stuff doesn't
grok at all. But I think that's just a bug.

Anyway... I'm attaching Jan's example (and cloaking
it as HTML) to make it accessable by HTTP from
the WG archive.
