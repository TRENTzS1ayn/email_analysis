Hi,

I'm Bill de h?ra, participating as principle on behalf of InterX.

At InterX I'm  working on building agent-centric web systems and
services on top of programmable proxy servers. I also represent us on
the Sun JSR expert groups for Java Servlets/JSP and Java Agent
Services. I've been tinkering with RDF on and off for a few years now
as a user and tool maker. I'm convinced it can enable a stable basis
for web architecture and how we build heterogeneous and late-binding
software systems on that architecture. 

3 goals:

- - clarifying existing and future recommendations

- - making RDF and serialised forms production ready

- - ensuring RDF is not sidelined by worse is better formalisms


It's a privilege to be working with you.

regards,
Bill
