I'm not sure of the context but SiRPAC (W3C version) has a 
command line option (-bag) and the online service has a 
checkbox that causes the parser to do this part of the M&S 
spec:

 [[
  The Description element itself represents an instance of a Bag 
  resource. The members of this Bag are the resources corresponding 
  to the reification of each of the statements in the Description. 
 ]]
