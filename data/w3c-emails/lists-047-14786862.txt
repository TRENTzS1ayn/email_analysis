Exactly right.  I may be at fault here for overloading the term.

I understand there was at one time (1st Apr 19xx) an RFC including a
mime type for matter transfer.  All I could find in a google search
was a reference to a Simple Matter Transfer Prototol.

You have expressed it very well.

There are several such 'model theories' if that is the right term that
will work for us.  I picked this one as it seemed to me most consistent
with M&S.  However, I'm more concerned that we have agreed on one, than I
am about any particular one.

That may well be true :(.  The reason for introducing equivalence was not
so that we could mechanically decide that two resources are equivalent, but
so that our model could represent equivalence.

There isn't anything particularly deep here, its just about what we call
things.  Web principles state that we can't rely on there being one true
URI identifying a particular entity - e.g. tree in the park.  Anyone is
free to define a URI to name this tree.  So we have a choice:

  - Resources have more that one URI
  - each URI identifies a different resource, but we have the notion
    of equivalence classes of resources

I felt that the latter is closer to M&S and RDF.
