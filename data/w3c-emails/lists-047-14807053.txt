I agree.  I don't particularly care what we call the concepts, as long
as they're there, and we gain general agreement on what they are.  In
particular, I think that our "model" (to overload another term) needs to
account both for the "real things" (the trees in the park) *and* for any
electronic things people may keep on the Web to represent those things
(the payloads).  That is, assuming the use of URIs (as currently
intended) as pure identifiers, we want to be able to talk about both the
things the URIs "ultimately" identify, and the things that may be
accessed on the Web when/if these URIs are plugged into Web browsers and
other user agents.
