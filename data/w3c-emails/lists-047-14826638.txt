_Modify_ the semantics? The media type *tells* you the semantics, no?
After all, "choosing a suitable processor for the content"
provides the "real-world connection" ala...

I certainly do want to persue this.

But the MIME spec has been around long enough that its
meaning is as much defined by the way it's understood and practiced
in the community as by what the MIME authors think.
But I'm happy to have their view on this issue
if it's convenient.
