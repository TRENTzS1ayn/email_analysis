1. At this moment we don't use RDF M&S 1.0 defined containers
   as we have enough support via [] descriptions (e.g. DAML lists)
   and {} contexts (e.g. statement sets).
   NB [] and {} are N3 (see http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html)

2. At this moment we don't use the RDF M&S 1.0 reification feature.
   We understood the need for subexpressions (e.g. to model Horn clauses)
   and found the rdf:parseType="Quote" giving good support.

3. Description-without-about (anonymous node description) is used a lot.
