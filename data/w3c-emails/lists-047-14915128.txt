It may annoy philosophers, but from the POV of writing an RDF DB,
"URI=resource"* is a reasonable (or at least commonly-held) viewpoint.
The nomenclature is bound to lead to philosophical debate; it comes down
to this:

- whatever we use as identifiers in an RDFDB is conceptually mapped onto
"the real world" by some imterpretive function
- which side of the function the things we refer to as "resources" live
is unclear; in fact, it might be used colloquially to refer to "ur" or
"entity" and the meaning derived from context;
- deriving meaning from context is fuzzy and can lead to confusion.
