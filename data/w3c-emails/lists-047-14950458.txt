I'm working on something like this for CC/PP, and have come up with the 
following:

   <rdfs:Class rdf:about='&ns-xsdt;integer'>
     <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Integer value</rdfs:label>
     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource='&ns-rdfs;Literal'/>
     <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
       This class is used to represent any CC/PP attribute value that
       is an integer number.
     </rdfs:comment>
     <rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource=
         'http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/xmlschema-2.html#integer'/>
   </rdfs:Class>

where &ns-xsdt; expands to the XMLschema datatypes schema URI.

I think they should be left for the logic layer work (DAML+OIL, etc.)

I think this is out of scope for RDFcore.
