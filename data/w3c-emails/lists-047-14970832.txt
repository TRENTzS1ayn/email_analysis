I'm a little concerned about the direction of this talk of entities and 
resources.

I thought the URI spec was fairly clear that:

(a) a resource is a "conceptual mapping"

(b) an entity is a "bag of bits"

I took Brian's stab at a formalism as being a way to say that the 
"conceptual mapping" that is a resource can be represented as a function 
that returns an entity.

So, to me, it seems completely wrong to say that a resource can *be* an 
entity, even when there is only one entity associated with a resource.  (By 
"associated with", I mean that can be returned by the function 
representation of the resource.)
