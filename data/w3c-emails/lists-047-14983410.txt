I'm going to have to agree with Dan in this situation. For now, let's use
the definitions defined by HTTP and the other relevant specs. DanC reviewed
this in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0021.html

These definitions have served us well for a rather long time, and I don't
think that RDF needs any modifications to these definitions.

I suggest we use our teleconference time to deal with test cases and their
dispositions. Other discussions are more appropriately held on the email
list -- I've found it much more effective.

If people are confused with the definitions currently used the Web
architecture specs, I suggest they take their questions to a more
appropriate forum (uri@w3.org comes to mind). Let's keep this list more
specifically to RDF issues.
