Actually, the URI spec says:

<q cite="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt"
         The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of
         entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that
         mapping at any particular instance in time.
</q>

To me that seems to indicate that an entity can be more than a bag of bits.
The HTTP spec, however, seems to use this narrower definition of a "network
entity".

<q cite="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">
   entity
      The information transferred as the payload of a request or
      response. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of
      entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as
      described in section 7.
</q>

DanC, you may want to link these definitions into the Architecture/Terms
document for later discussions.
