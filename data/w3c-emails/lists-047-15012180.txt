Pat,

Since http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/ is public
and since I'm reading them from time to time, I came across
http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/0387.html
In there, I found (among other comments)

   [[[
   It might be salutary and useful if the RDFCore were to spend some
   time listening to what the ontologists want, instead of telling them
   what they can have.
   ]]]

Since I am a member of the RDFCore WG I'm more than glad to listen
to the ontologists. So what do the ontologists want?
