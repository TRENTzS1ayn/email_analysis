Looking over this again, I think this should be changed to:

    Parsers MAY accept the about, id, etc. attributes in
    unqualified form on input but MUST NOT emit them on output.

Why would we want to make an additional rules for "existing parsers"?

Also, do we define how parsers should interpret unqualified attributes? If
so, how should one process this testcase (as raised by Jason Diamond on
rdf-interest):

<eg:Class about="http://foo">
  <eg:property>bar</eg:property>
</eg:Class>
