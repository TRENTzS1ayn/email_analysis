As one of the ontologists, I have quite a number of concerns with RDF,
which I have mentioned several times.  I think, however, that Jonathan
Borden did a great summary of what I want, namely:

[...] strip out all the stuff from RDF that no one agrees on (such
as reification). Start with a simple but rock solid foundation, and  
add concepts in only as absolutely necessary.

I would also add that I want a firm meaning for everything in RDF, and that
includes things like bags and alternatives, if they stay in.  (I am of the
strong belief that bags and alternative do not have any reasonable meaning
provided by RDF.)
