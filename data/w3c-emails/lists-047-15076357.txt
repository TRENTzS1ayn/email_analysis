I can't speak for the ontologists, since I am not one.
But I can speak for my company's use of references to
elements in controlled vocabularies. We will have
lots of statements such as
  <dc:subject rdf:resource="http://example.org/NAICS/1234"/>
which is a reference to a (hypothetical) node in the
NAICS industry sector classification system.

We need to be able to tell certain things about these
statements, such as whether a human has reviewed them,
or whether the code was explicitly added or implicitly
added because it was a broader term of an explicitly
added code.

One way of accomplishing those needs would be through
reification, although the current reification approach seems
overly cumbersome. Perhaps others can suggest other ways
of fulfilling those requirements.
