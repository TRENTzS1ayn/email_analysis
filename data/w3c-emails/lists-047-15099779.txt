Aaron,

I acknowledge that the RFC2396 definition doesn't specifically limit an 
entity to being a "bag of bits".  For the purpose of the current debate, 
that didn't seem to be the key issue ...  what I was trying to emphasize 
was the distinction between the "conceptual mapping" and the things denoted 
by that mapping.  I.e. that resource != entity.
