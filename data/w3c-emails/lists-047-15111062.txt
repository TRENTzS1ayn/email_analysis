So am I. The intent of a content type is to describe what sort of content
is present. Anything more is really beyond the purview of a content type.

This usage doesn't exactly parallel any field we've previously defined, but it
isn't all that far away from a content-disposition. Specifically, a
content-disposition could be defined to mean "this is asserted to be true and
you should handle it as such".
Also note that the concept of storing storing other metadata like file names as
part of a content-type (specifically, a content-type parameter) has been
roundly rejected over time. I don't think this sort of metadata is
significantly different. The long standing whine about not being able
to dispatch off of content-type parameters or content-dispositions no
longer holds water either.

Now this description really does smell like a content-disposition. And the
SIP folks have no problem defining new content-dispositions for this
sort of stuff; the W3C shouldn't either.

>Does this seem like a reasonable use of MIME types to you?

No, it doesn't.
