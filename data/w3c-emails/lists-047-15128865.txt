Certainly being able to quote statements/triples is useful ... indeed a
practical requirement.

For example I've suggested a quoting syntax for triples using an XPointer
extension triple(predicate,subject,object):

http://example.org/your-document.rdf#xmlns(dc="...")triple(dc:subject,
ex:foo, <http://example.org/NAICS/1234>)

This yields a URI which can be discussed as needed.

The paper: http://www.openhealth.org/RDF/RDFmediatype.html

some of this still needs to be fleshed out.

Your comments would be appreciated.
