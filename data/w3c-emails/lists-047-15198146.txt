My contribution.

The two aspects in question seem to be:

Containers - so far there has been no use for them in the applications
we're writing. This is probably a result of the relative flatness of the
incoming data. The RDF we encounter is very simply structured,
literal-object stuff.

Reification - likewise, has played hardly any part though that may
change shortly as we build some second-level structure on the flat base.

Rather boring input from the real world.
