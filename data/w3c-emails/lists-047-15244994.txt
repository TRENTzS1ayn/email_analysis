Perhaps this is something we could do off-list, since familiarity with RDF
was supposed to be a pre-requisite for joining the WG:

<q cite="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter">
Working Group members will need to be familiar with the RDF Model and Syntax
Specification, RDF Schema 1.0 Specification, and other related XML
specifications (particularly XML Schema), and will ideally have
implementation experience with RDF-based applications.
</q>

I don't think our valuable group time should be spent on this.
