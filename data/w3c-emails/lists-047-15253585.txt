Yes, that makes sense, but your test results don't agree...

Huh? According to the rule that "a namespace prefix MUST
be used for these attributes" above, this test input is
bogus; it doesn't conform. Let's send the message
loud and clear, right now: if your RDF data uses
this form, we don't plan to support it. Fix
it.

Let's release an XSLT thingy that will do the upgrade
for you. Let's help folks migrate. But let's
not burden the future with this mistake from
the past.
