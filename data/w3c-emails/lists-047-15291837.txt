Funnily enough, the test cases I've made so far doesn't include
aboutEach or aboutEachPrefix since I want them/expect them to die.

I suppose I should attach the current test-cases work-in-progress.
The entire suite seems to utterly fail on all parsers I've tried due
to the bare 'li' and '_2'.  Makes me wonder if those shouldn't be
included in the list I mentioned above.

The second set of tests would be the same as the attached; but with
rdf: for all the attributes.  I think all the parsers handled that
when I quickly tried it.

NOTE: Test cases are work-in-progress; I've not checked the triple
counts are right yet.
