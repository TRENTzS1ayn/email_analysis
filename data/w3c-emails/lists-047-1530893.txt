Not sure what 'object type' refers to here. Are we talking about 
syntax or about interpretations? If the latter, are we assuming that 
resources *cannot* have literal values? If so, I will need to revise 
the MT somewhat.

7-bit?? Yech. Tr?s malhe?reux. Why not use UTF-8 ?

Wait a minute. The subject is a URI, not a Resource, right?  The 
Resource is what the subject (a piece of syntax) denotes, not the 
subject itself.

For what its worth, about the only requirement from the MT is that 
literals must be clearly distinguishable from uriRefs (or URIs). Just 
allowing arbitrary charstrings wouldn't cut it, therefore.

Sounds good to me.
