I believe this is incorrect. The words in M&S apply to attributes/elements
beginning with the string "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" -- rdf:
attributes begin with the string
"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" and thus this requirement does
not reply to them. I suggest section 7 of your proposal be removed.

Otherwise, the proposal looks quite good.
