Jason Diamond recently commented[1]:

    An aside: I'm not on the WG but is it possible to subscribe to rdfcore
    without being able to post? I had no idea that you'd been discussing
    this issue to death on that list. The archives are public but it's just
    not as convenient for me as using my own mail client.

I think that this demonstrates the need for keeping better communication
with the Interest Group. For my part, I've been linking to the chat logs and
minutes of our teleconferences on the IRC scratchpad[2]. However, I
understand that only a small portion of the interest group reads the
scratchpad consistently. Perhaps we should provide the contents of the
scratchpad by email...

Certainly, a big help would be to open up subscription on the list to the
public. Ralph, Eric, is this possible? Currently the amount of traffic on
this list is small enough that I think that most of the interested RDFIGers
can handle the additional email load.
