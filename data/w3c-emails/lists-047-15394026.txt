Excellent, I'm happy to remove those from the list so I would like to
amend item #1 in 
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0087.html
to be:

  1. The current RDF/XML syntax uses the following attributes
     in the syntax (from my reference at
     http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/notes/concepts.html )

     List of RDF attributes (henceforth The List)
       about aboutEach aboutEachPrefix
       ID bagID resource parseType 

     The remaining concepts are not in the list because:
       Seq Bag Alt Property Statement
 - these are rdfs:Class-es and can never be used as attributes
       RDF Description   
 - syntax only things that have no current use as attributes
       li _<n> subject predicate object type value
 - not allowed to be used unprefixed according to the grammar

Aside: Actually
  rdf:subject rdf:predicate rdf:object rdf:value
are not explicitly in the grammar BNF or discussion, but implicitly
by being properties and thus matching 6.14 propName.

rdf:value is only ever used in examples - Fig 14, 15, sec 7.4
examples - and is thus only implicitly defined as a property.

rdf:subject, rdf:predicate and rdf:object are defined as properties
in the formal model.
