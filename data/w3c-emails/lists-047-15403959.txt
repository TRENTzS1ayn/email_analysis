No - the original issue had a specific question which I refered to, quoted,
and answered in my message:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0088.html
I was not answering the different issue above.

I feel that removing this existing syntax is too much of a change,
although I did give my misgivings about its function and clarity in
my message.

In IRC later, Aaron noted there was a way to do what he wanted
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2001-05-17.html#T22-06-32
which was also in the original issue description
