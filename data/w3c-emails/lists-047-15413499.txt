Yeah the reference in the discussion part is wrong - I'll remove it -
but the original item I feel holds:

  7.  Unprefixed attributes not on The List have no meaning in RDF
     and MUST NOT be used to generate statements.   Processors MUST
     also skip the element containing such attributes and generate no
     statements for the entire XML element and content.

This is to explicitly say what is implict in the the BNF - unprefixed
attributes have never been allowed in RDF/XML grammar.  I've gone a
bit further to say what to do when they are seen so that there is
so consistency in handling them.  This means that all namespace
element/attribute prefixing is covered.
