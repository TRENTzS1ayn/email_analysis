I'm glad that was cleared up (as I'm glad I read to the end of the
thread before raising it). This is looking fine.

`The List' is rather short now but still I wonder what is to become of
`aboutEach' and `aboutEachPrefix'

`Funnily enough, the test cases I've made so far doesn't include
aboutEach or aboutEachPrefix since I want them/expect them to die'

... and Graham Klyne in

I agree with these gentlemen and in the light of the quote in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0074.html, it
seems well within the charter to urge these out of the base
specification.
