At the risk of starting YA thread on reification, I would appreciate 
it if the editors of the M&S REC and the RDF Schema CR would shed 
some light on RDF and reification in general and the reification 
discussion occuring on the RDF logic list:
 
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2001May/0031.html

In particular, I would like to know:

o Why was reification added to RDF?

o What can be done to solve the problems that are being discussed in 
 the above thread?

I realize that Guha has agreed to address:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-reification-required

but I'd like to hear the other editor's perspectives on reification.

I hope others in the WG will find the editor's historical information 
useful.
