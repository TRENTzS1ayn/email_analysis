The above of course is an error because it violates:

 [6.12] propertyElt    ::= '<' propName idAttr? '>' value '</' propName '>'
                         | '<' propName idAttr? parseLiteral '>'
                               literal '</' propName '>'

- a propertyElt with a parseType="Literal" attribute can only
have an ID attribute.

However, I'm wondering if you were trying to differentiate the
following as being illegal syntax by [6.12]:

 a.  <random:someProperty rdf:parseType="Literal"/>

and the following as being legal:

 b.  <random:someProperty rdf:parseType="Literal"></random:someProperty>

My take on [6.12] is that a. is not legal and b. is legal.  If
this is true, I don't understand why there is this restriction
and would propose that both be legal.
