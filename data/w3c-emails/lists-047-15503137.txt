I do not think that this extra step is necessary. Take the innocent mistake:

<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="..." xmlns="..."
<rdf:Description title="Issues" author="Dave Beckett">
  <type rdf:resource="http://example.org/#image" />
</rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

The type information is still perfectly valid RDF. This "skip the element"
provision was added to ensure forwards compatibility with new
elements/attributes. Since (I hope that) RDF will not add any more
attributes which are allowed unprefixed this provision is not necessary.

Also, I too agree with Dan Connolly and would like to see the MUST changed
to a MAY, so that processors may accept the incorrect version of the
language for backwards compatibility, but it is not an accepted portion of
the language.
