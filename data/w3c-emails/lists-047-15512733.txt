  [14:23:56] _mdean
       i haven't yet finished comparing the DAML concerns to the RDF
issues list, but i think they capture the simple
       issues -- there has also been a lot of discussion (particularly
this week) on www-rdf-logic dealing with
       higher-level issues (reification, minimalist RDF, etc.)

       ACTION ITEM: frank to agree to provide references to this work

The "frank" in these notes (the one who accepted the two action items)
is me (frankM, I suppose), rather than "frankb" (so he doesn't get
saddled with items he didn't agree to do!).  If we could just use
URIs...
