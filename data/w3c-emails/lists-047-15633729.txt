I'm not following you here Dave.

  <rdf:Description>
    <foo:bar rdf:ID="rs">foobar</foo:bar>
  </rdf:Desscription>

is clearly legal and the rdf:ID attribute defines the URI of the refied
statement the property represents.  The question that arises is whether

  <rdf:Description>
    <foo:bar rdf:resource="http://foo/" rdf:ID="rs"/>
  </rdf:Description>

is legal, with again the rdf:ID attribute defining the URI of the reifed
statement.  It does seem a bit irregular to allow the use of an rdf:ID
attribute to identify the reifed statement in the case where the object
is a literal, but not in the case where it is a resource.  And strictly
speaking, the grammar does not rule it out as the rdf:resource attribute
matches the idAboutAttr? in the production and the rdf:ID attribute
matches the propAttr*.
