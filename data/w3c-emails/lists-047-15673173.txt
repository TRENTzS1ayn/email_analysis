from the minutes of the 2001-05-18 teleconference:
> ACTION ITEM: Frank Manola agrees to summarize what the the logicians
> (www-rdf-logic) like to see in RDF and provide references to issues
> regarding clarification of RDF semantics, removing the extraneous
> parts of RDF / modularizing RDF, etc. by early next week.

What I had in mind when I made the comment about there having been prior
discussion was (mainly) the following messages (which hopefully can
serve as entry points into some of the more detailed discussion):

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2001Apr/0037.html
where Peter F. Patel-Schneider described "A Personal View of Changes to
Make in RDF and RDF Schema to support good representational practices",
including:

> 1/ Stick to a single purpose 
[involving removing collections and reification]

> 2/ Don't grab all content

> 3/ Make RDF Schema monotonic

> 4/ Semantics
[provide a good semantic foundation]

Jonathan Borden's overall summary was also pretty fair:

> To broadly summarize: strip out all the stuff from RDF that no one agrees on
> (such as reification). Start with a simple but rock solid foundation, and
> add concepts in only as absolutely necessary.

Much of the discussion on the "What do the ontologists want?" thread was
effectively additional illustration, motivation, and discussion of these
points (and other related points, such as the need to clarify URIs and
resource semantics).  

Obviously, some additional digestion is necessary, but this ought to be
a start.  It's also worth noting that in some cases a *choice* is
necessary, i.e., "either do X or do Y, but don't try to do both" (with,
however, additional comments about the actual value of RDF if it becomes
purely X or purely Y).
