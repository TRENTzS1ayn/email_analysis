Without disagreeing with anything Frank has reported, my view of much of 
the debate is that it is narrowing down to an issue of RDF semantics:

- does/should/can RDF core convey any useful semantics?
-- (a) If so, they should be formally specified.
-- (b) If not, we should be clear that RDF is simply (abstract) syntax.

This begs a definition of semantics, and since the logicians seems to have 
spent much more energy answering this question, it seems reasonable to 
accept their definition (i.e. model theory).  I'll post a separate message 
"Model theory for programmers" which is my take on what this means, which I 
offered to someone else in an offline discussion about this matter.

If RDF does not have any semantics, then reification as a concept is 
meaningless (at this level).

If RDF does have semantics, then what is reification?  Is it quotation, or 
something else?  (I have formed an opinion that the purposes of reification 
are served by something less logically exotic than quotation [1].)

...

Dan Conolloy has posted a summary of some work by Sergey Melnik that 
attempts to define a model theory for RDF [2].  There has been some 
debate.  The direction looks positive to me, but has not reached a clear 
conclusion.
