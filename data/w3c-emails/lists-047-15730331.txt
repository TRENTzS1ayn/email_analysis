I think thats exactly right Art.

The question is whether the spec *should* allow:

  <rdf:Description>
    <foo:bar rdf:resource="..." rdf:ID=",,,"/>
  </rdf:Description>

not whether it does allow it.

What I've seen so far is an answer that says the spec doesn't allow it.
I feel that doesn't fully answer the issue raised.
