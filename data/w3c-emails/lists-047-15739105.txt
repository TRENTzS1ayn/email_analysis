I agree with the gist of your suggestion, Graham,
but before anybody creates a new issue, I consider
this to fall under an existing issue:

  "Summary: The grammar in the RDF 1.0 spec is informal and
  should be replaced. Something based on XML Schema should be
  considerd."

  -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-formal-grammar

Has that issue reached sifficient priority that we
should attack it?

Art, if you'd be willing to own that issue, I'd be
willing to work with you on it.

But I'm also happy for a few other issues to be
addressed first; I have a ways to go before I'm
ready to suggest a replacement for the whole RDF
grammar.

Quite; if we use XML Schema and/or XSLT for our formal
grammar, we get that for free (more or less).
