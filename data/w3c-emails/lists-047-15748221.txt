I know that Dave seems to feel differently about this, but I see a simple
solution to this and empty property elements:

 - Define an empty property element to be an empty literal
 - Define an id and a resource to be the reification of the statement

So simply:

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo">
    <bar></bar>
</rdf:Description>

becomes:

<#foo> :bar "" .

and

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo">
    <bar rdf:ID="#baz" rdf:resource="#bat" />
</rdf:Description>

becomes:

<#foo> :bar <#bat> .
<#baz> rdf:subject <#foo> ;
       rdf:predicate :bar ;
       rdf:object <#bat> .
