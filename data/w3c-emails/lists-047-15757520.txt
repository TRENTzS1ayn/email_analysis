This is too vague - please fill in the namespace URIs; are they both
to the RDF namespace URI or not?

  Aside: I would ask people give full RDF/XML examples that contain
  URIs and preferably, validated if they are to demonstrate legal
  points - I'm trying hard to do this.  I also don't want RDF/N3 used
  to explain RDF/XML in this forum - it confuses issues and moves the
  discussion to what RDF/N3 means rather than RDF/XML.

Either way, considering 'title' and 'author' - some parsers will
assume they are rdf: concepts due to implementing XML namespaces
wrong (the rdf: on rdf:Description does not pass to the attributes)
and hence could skip the element as it contains unknown RDF
attributes.  Other processors might do all sorts of strange things
creating bare 'title' properties or maybe documentURI#title
properties.

By writing a paragraph like the above, all this is precisely clear -
unprefixed attributes continue to not be allowed.

the type element is legal but since the outer container is
interpreted differently, there is no guarantee that it would be
processed, since the rdf:Description element might be skipped.

We already agreed this - there will be no unprefixed attributes in
RDF/XML.

We discussed that subsequently during the meeting and agreed to make
the stronger deprecation point - deprecated now (SHOULD NOT) and tell
the developers so that they know it will be removed and forbidden
(MUST NOT) at next REC which is probably a year away.

In summary, based on what existing tools do and for consistency, item
7 remains a good answer.
