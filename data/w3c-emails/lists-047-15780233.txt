We *can* do these things - i.e. changing the RDF/XML syntax but we
need good reasons.  Neatness is one but I feel it isn't strong enough
to counterpoint breaking existing parsers; make no mistake - this
would be a change in the meaning.

I feel we should be making changes additions, removals, modifications
that break existing code only if absolutely necessary for important
reasons such as removing ambiguity.

In this case we can write a better explanation of what is already
allowed in the syntax and there is already a way to do what is
required - make the property statement and give an ID for the reified
statement, so there is no requirement for any new syntax.

If this was RDF/XML syntax version 2 (no backwards compatibility
required) then we wouldn't be starting from here.
