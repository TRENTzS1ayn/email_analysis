Sorry for not being clear, I can never remember the RDF namespace
(especially offline) and hate typing it. (Hmm...) The idea was that the
default namespace was Dublin Core (oops, author should have been creator --
sorry).

I'm using RDF/N3 to display triples, since it's a language that's easy to
understand and has a parser. I'm trying not to use any of the advanced and
unclear features of N3 like reification.

I understand this -- what I don't see is why we can't state that they MUST
be ignored, rather than destroying the whole chunk of RDF that contains
them.

I do not see what this refers to in your proposal. What I was talking about
was exactly the opposite:

<q 
cite="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0087.html">

3.  On input, processors MUST accept unprefixed attributes from The
    List on any elements.  These attributes must be processed
    as if they were written with a prefix as defined in #2.

</q>

This MUST should be changed to a MAY, so that processors need not accept
documents with unprefixed attributes. RDF itself should remain strong,
continuing to state that "A namespace prefix MUST be used for these
attributes...".

I don't see that from your message.
