because:
  1. They are already forbidden by the existing grammar rules - you
     must have namespace-qualfied properties.

  2. Existing systems handle them in different ways (die, use them
     wrong, ignore them)

  3. They have no meaning in RDF since they have no link to URIs.

  4. To clear up that RDF uses namespaced-prefixed
     elements/attributes only, so non-namespaced attributes are
     obviously non-RDF and hence the meaning of RDF elements such
     attributes is totally undefined.

     If there was a situation where non-prefixed attributes were
     wanted to be transferred in RDF/XML it would be better done
     using prefixed attributes and the namespace URI to define the
     new terms.

This is different issue.  I was talking about the rewording that I
would be doing after the meeting based on the notion of 'deprecation'
as discussed - giving developers due warning of things that would be
going away.

Your quote refers to a different thing that Dan Connolly asked for -
changing MUST to MAY in item 3 and in the minutes of the meeting we
were both at, it was recorded I agreed to do this:


  [[
  DaveB reflects Dan C.'s comments about using the term "must" and
  suggests changes to "may" in describing solutions to this problem.
  ...

  The notion of 'deprecation' of previous work was discussed...

  Resolution:
  General consensus was that Dave B. would re-word this to reflect this
  notion of deprecation in this position

I hope 1-4 above and the previous messages help.
