Replying to myself, I missed a quote reference, when I said in my
previous mail:

I was actually referring to Dan's request in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0092.html

about clarity for MUST/MAY about namespace prefixes, which is not for
item 3 specifically but about deprecation in general and I took on
the general consensus to deprecate now (MAY) and forbid later (MUST).
