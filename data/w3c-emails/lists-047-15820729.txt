Don't go there. i.e. don't get into "if the document
is broken, here's how you should interpret it." Just don't.
There lies madness.

All the WG need do is decide these documents* don't conform.
That's it. Full stop.

This seems like sufficient justification:

i.e. 1. the text of the spec can
lead reasonable readers to think that such documents
are forbidden, and

2. implementors have interpreted the spec to
say different things about these documents.

*RDF documents with attributes that are not namespace-qualified
(which, is the same as saying: RDF documents containing
attributes with no colons in their names).
