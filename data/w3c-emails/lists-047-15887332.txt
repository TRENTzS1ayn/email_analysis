Sorry for not being clear, but I see a very good reason for this.

It seems that consensus suggests that:

<rdf:Description>
  <propName />
</rdf:Description

should result in an empty literal for the value of propName. In such a case,
something like:

<rdf:Description>
   <propName rdf:ID="foo" />
</rdf:Description>

could only be understood as assigning foo to the reification of the
statement. Similarly,

<rdf:Description>
   <propName rdf:ID="foo" rdf:resource="bar"/>
</rdf:Description>

would also assign foo the the reification of the statement.

Certainly this does change the meaning, but it changes it to be more
consistent and brings it in line with what (IMO) the majority of RDF authors
expect. I doubt that many (if any) RDF authors understand the current
wackiness and even fewer have built documents on it. I think in this case we
can expend the effort needed to fix this rather large mistake in the syntax.
