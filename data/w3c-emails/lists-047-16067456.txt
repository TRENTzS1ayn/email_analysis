What does "on input" mean?
The RDF M&S spec doesn't specify software modules;
it specifies a language. Resolution of
this issue requires deciding, about some XML documents,
whether they're in the RDF language or not, right?

My original 26 Apr 2000 message included a test case,
taken from the spec [namspace declarations filled
in here for completeness]:

=========
  <rdf:RDF
xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
        xmlns:s="http://example/stuff#"
        xmlns:v="http://example/vocab#"

    </rdf:Description>

    <rdf:Description about="http://www.w3.org/staffId/85740">
      <v:Name>Ora Lassila</v:Name>
      <v:Email>lassila@w3.org</v:Email>
    </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>
=========

The question is: is that document an RDF document or not?

btw... it's also available at
  http://www.w3.org/2001/04rs22/confusedPrefixes.rdf

Whereas
-- We have heard from an editor of the original
spec that he never intended unqualified attributes
to be part of the syntax

-- tools that support the above syntax only
do so because of buggy namespace support; they
don't accept
<otherNs:ClassName about="#xyz"/>
but only
<otherNs:ClassName rdf:about="#xyz"/>

-- tools differ in their interpretation of
unprefixed attributes in RDF in general
and in the case of rdf:resource vs. resource in particular.

-- the cost of supporting both about= and rdf:about=
in the future is significant: consider XPath queries
like
<xslt:template match="/rdf:RDF/*[rdf:about="$myURI]">
...
and try fidgeting with it to accept about= on elements
from the RDF namespace. It's doable, but it's a pain.

I propose that no, this is not an RDF document. It is
not part of the language specified in the 19990222 RDF spec.
Any suggestion that it does in the spec an error; I propose we
update the errata page to say so and notify www-rdf-interest
that any documents that use this syntax are in error.

I just wrote a little XSLT transformation to make the fix:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/04rs22/fixAttrs.xsl

and documented it to some extent:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/04rs22/#fixatt

I consider them forbidden since 19990222, and I ask the
WG to agree.
