:Not sure what 'object type' refers to here. Are we talking about
:syntax or about interpretations? If the latter, are we assuming that
:resources *cannot* have literal values? If so, I will need to revise
:the MT somewhat.

I cut and paste that from the M&S. The current text is (2.1 p3):

"The basic data model consists of three object types:"

Under that, in the Resources description, there's this:

"[...] A resource may also be an object that
is not directly accessible via the Web; e.g.
a printed book. [...]"

Probably not to be confused with this wording in the
Statements description:

"[...] The object of a statement (i.e., the property
value) can be another resource [...]"

Almost all other uses of "object" in the M&S are that of the
object of statement. There's some use of object as in OO in
the section discussing containers.

Replace it with :

"The basic data model consists of the following types:"

?


:>The most primitive value type represented in RDF, typically a
:string of
:>characters [XXX: 7-bit US-ASCII?
:
:7-bit?? Yech. Tr?s malhe?reux. Why not use UTF-8 ?

Indeed. I took my cue from n-triples (because the MT refers to
n-triples); in fairness Unicode encoding is still an open issue
for n-triples.


:>as per n-triple/model theory?]. Literals are
:>distinguished from Resources in that the RDF model does not
:permit literals to
:>be the subject of a statement.
:
:Wait a minute. The subject is a URI, not a Resource, right?
:The Resource is what the subject (a piece of syntax)
:denotes, not the subject itself.

Again, that text was lifted out of the M&S
(glossary, non-normative, mind):

"[...] Literals are distinguished from Resources in that
the RDF model does not permit literals to be the subject
of a statement. [...]"


:For what its worth, about the only requirement from the MT is that
:literals must be clearly distinguishable from uriRefs (or URIs). Just
:allowing arbitrary charstrings wouldn't cut it, therefore.

That's interesting. I don't think there's any such restriction
on literals currently. Let me check on that for you. I guess the
idea has been that the machine is supposed to figure things out
from production forks/cues in whatever the grammar happens to be,
such as parseType for the XML.
