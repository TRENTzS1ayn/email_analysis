I think the fact that you state: "A namespace prefix MUST be used..." and
"unprefixed attributes from The List MAY be accepted." is sufficient.

Point 3 seems simply a point to implementers about what this means, etc. I'm
not totally sure because I don't know whether "the next RDF syntax document"
is the one we're going to publish or the one after that. Perhaps this point
can be separated from the rest of the document.
