Dave, mostly looks good, I think.  Two questions/comments.

(1)

I think #4 and #5 together capture the issue for the current specification 
rev.  We can leave future  "generations" free to make the requisite choices 
for future spec revisions.  I think #3 could be dropped.


(2)

The first sentence of this is fine.  I'm not sure of the implications of 
the second sentence.
