Aaron - I'm trying to understand the ramification
of the change you are proposing.

Would you please enumerate the triples you would
expect from the above RDF if it was legal (and doing so 
in Subject, Pred, Object format ala SiRPAC would be much 
appreciated)?

Also, what triples would you expect if the RDF was:

 <rdf:Description about="some_resource">
    <propName rdf:ID="foo" rdf:resource="bar"/>
 </rdf:Description>

Thanks,

Art
