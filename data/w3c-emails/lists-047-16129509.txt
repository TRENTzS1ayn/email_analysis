The basic idea is that it would be helpful for WG members
and the RDF community at large if there was a single place
where WG decisions were posted.

Once an issue is deemed closed by the chairs, the
issue's "Currently" flag in:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/

would be changed to a link named something like Closed and that
link would point to the issue in closed issue page e.g.:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/closed.html

Each closed issue would contain the following type of information 
where appropriate: 

o Link back to the original issue [the original issue could be
 left intact]

o Proposed change(s): the document(s) to be modified
 (spec, errata, etc.); proposed wording

o Justification for the change

o Backward compatibility issues

o Link to discussion in the mail archive

o Test case(s).  URI's would be nice but inline tests would
 be better than nothing.  [Perhaps a separate agenda item
 for the WG is test case creation and access.]

o ???

At the top of the page in blinking lights and 50 point fonts
there must be a warning about clearly states that the information
in the document is not final and subject to change. 

If something like this seems useful I am willing to mock-up
a page.  Of course, comments/suggestions/etc. are welcome.
Also, if other WGs have done something similar, I'd appreciate
the link.

I am also willing to take ownership of the document but may ask 
for some assistance if it becomes too time consuming [not a 
problem at our current rate of resolution :-)].
