Disapointed to say this, but having failed to make sufficient progress
with this issue in the past few days I would like to relinquish some of
the 15-mins of agenda time allocated for today's discussion.

I am also (due attendance at an offsite meeting) going to be joining by
mobile phone, likely without IRC/Web access, so don't feel in a position
to lead effective discussion of the containers-model issue at this point.

Brian, could you (again my apologies for the timing) reorder the agenda
accordingly?

As a stopgap, I'll report my current thinking/progress by email here.
I am now of the opinion that some relatively minor rewording of the formal
model portion of the specification, plus ammendments/additions to Dave and
Brian's 'Container syntax' proposal will allow us to deal with the
'representing partially described containers' of the container issue.
Brief version: "use rdf:li for complete description of containers; use
rdf:_n for partial descriptions; amend spec to make this distinction
clear".

I hope to have a complete and coherent proposal to the list in time for
discussion at the next meeting.
