We're all in agreement here (as far as I can tell) that the two forms
above should have the same interpretation (this has been made more or
less explicit by various people).

This kind of led to the suggestion that an RDF grammar should be given
in terms of the XML infoset rather than a BNF grammar producing a stream
of characters. Certainly coping with empty elements explicitly wherever
they might crop up in the current grammar would obfuscate it (in my
opinion). And we'd have no future-proofing when XML-foo invented
something useful that we wanted to take advantage of when serialising
RDF as XML.

Perhaps we might stick with a simple grammar for serialised RDF and
include something to the effect:

"any stream of XML tokens that is equivalent to this
 serialisation (wrt. {a subset of the XML infoset})
 is also a valid serialised form, and should be
 interpreted equivalently."
