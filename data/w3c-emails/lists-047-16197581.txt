Hi Dave,

Another nit:

There has been a suggestion that the future spec may use a different technique
to represent the RDF/XML language, e.g. XML Schema.  We should make sure that
the spec writers are free to represent the same resolution in these other
forms.  Perhaps a note to that effect?

And thinking in terms of XML schema/infoset, the key thing we require is
that attributes have an associated namespace.  I'm wondering whether that
is the right level of abstraction to capture the requirement.  Right now
that means that prefix's must be used.  But if XML were to change so that
there was another way to express namespaces for attributes, would it be
desirable if we were neutral to that change.

Brian
