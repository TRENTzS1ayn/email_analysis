I just wanted like to second this good idea!

I would also like the chairs to clarify what (if any) restrictions 
the WG has wrt to syntax changes.  For example, is there is a 
blanket statement that can be applied to all issues?

The only reference I found in the WG charter:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

regarding backwards compatibility is:

 [[ 
  Backwards compatibility with existing RDF applications is a priority 
  for the RDF Core Working Group. 
 ]]

so I'd also like to know - what does this really mean?
