(as discussed briefly today offline with brian + Dave B)

I've stuck a copy of RDF M+S at
http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms

with paragraph numbers (for a loose definition of "paragraph")

Perhaps it'd be worth sticking this somewhere more central.
You can refer to paragraphs as you'd expect...
http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#100

useful for referring to paragraphs of the spec in discussions I think.

Cheers,
jan
