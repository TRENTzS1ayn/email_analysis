[while enjoying holiday/family time]
to me this is axiomatic when talking about a function such as
  statement = triple(s,p,o)
i.e. having y = f(x) means
  for all x there exists a unique y such that y = f(x)
(of course there could be more than one x mapping onto the same y)
So the identity of a statement is that it exists and is
identical to itself and can be represented as triple(s,p,o)
More generally
[[
  it is also plogically essential as forumlae have an identity which is
  strictly their content
  whereas many documents may have different characteristicsn but parse to the
  same thing in N3 or XML.

which sounds like the resolution of this issue!
