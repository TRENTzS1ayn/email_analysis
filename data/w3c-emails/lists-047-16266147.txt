Ooops!  Thanks.  My blind spot:  I was wondering why it froze the online N3 
checker.

(I deliberately avoided using N3's {} syntax because it's its 
interpretation is in question.  For now, I'll assume you mean it to be an 
rdf:Bag of reified statements.)

The trouble with this that I see is that the rdf:Bag is attributed, not the 
statements in the bag.

Looks fine to me ...   The semantics may work, but let us be clear that 
these are *new* semantics added to RDF (in my case with a new property, in 
your case with a new class), not part of the core semantics.

The purpose of this example was to show the use of reification as a "hook" 
for adding new semantics.
