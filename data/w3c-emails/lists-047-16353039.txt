This is, of course, another Semantic Web Advanced Development
LEAD* hack; i.e. an installment in "a day in the life of the
Semantic Web." The meeting record tools (RDF schema,
XSLT transformation to XHTML, etc.) that I'm developing are
available at
  http://www.w3.org/2000/11/mr76/

Massimo did some related work in the context of XML Query...
  http://www.w3.org/1999/09/ql/xdm
  (Member-Confidential as of this writing)

Massimo, any particular reason why the XDM materials
shouldn't be public? not the meeting records themselves,
but just the XDM tools and docs?

*LEAD = Live Early Adoption and Demonstration
