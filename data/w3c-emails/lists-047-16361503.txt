The chairs have an important role in keeping us aware
of the charter and interpreting it from time to time,
but I'm not sure you should expect them to say
much more than what the charter says
at this point when we have so little experience.

Each time the WG addresses an issue, we provide part
of the answer here. If there's a pattern, or
if some things work well and some work poorly,
we can expect the chair to apply that experience
in the future; perhaps they'll eventually develop
a general policy for this sort of thing if it
looks cost-effective.

But please resist the urge to generalize on
the basis of little experience.

I think it's sufficient to figure that out as we go.
