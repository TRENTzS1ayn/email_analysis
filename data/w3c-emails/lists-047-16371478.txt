generally: make it available via HTTP and give
it the relevant license and availability/persistence.

Sending stuff to this list grants the relevant license
(as a consequence of the agreement folks executed
when they joined the group; see the charter and
W3C process for details).

I'd like to say that it assures the relevant
persistence, but actually, our list archives have
been known to reshuffle the numbers occasionally. Sigh.

So... sending stuff as attachments to this list
should be sufficient, but I don't think it's strictly
necessary; there are perhaps other ways to meet
the above constraints.

Yikes! optional behaviour? I should hope not; I should
hope each RDF document means exactly one thing. But I guess
we'll figure that out as we go...

We have avoided "deprecated" so far (whew!); let's keep it that
way as long as we can...


I have some comments on the format itself; I think I'll
send those separately...
