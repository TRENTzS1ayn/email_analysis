Attached is the final version of the MT document. Ive included 
material on reification and containers in case anyone wants to see 
them, but these probably should be excised from the public document. 
Ive also taken out all the 'meta-theory' (all those damn lemmas) 
which I think is better at this stage.  We can put them into a 
different document later, if people are interested, and when I really 
have got the proofs finally DONE, but they really are about RDF/S 
rather than the model theory itself.

Sorry this has taken so long.  Now, who can help me get this into 
W3-document-ship-shape?
