I do appreciate this effort, and I'm sure that others outside the Working
Group also do so.

Yet you make the archives of the list public, and perfectly readable through
other tools such as an RSS scraper, etc. I merely ask why this information
is not available over SMTP -- a more convenient system for many (myself
included).

I'm not asking for our discussions to be held in the wider community (as
much as I may believe in that option). I'm simply wondering whether it would
be acceptable to the chairs, and technically feasible to sign members of the
public up to a read-only email list of the discussions.

I'd even be willing to sponsor and manage the system myself, if need be.

I agree, and would be happy to work with others to implement such a system.
Still, it seems symptomatic of some at the W3C to allow the goals of the
future interfere with getting something working in the present. Sure, it'll
all be great and wonderful once we build the Semantic Web and our personal
agents tell us everything we need to know and cut down on how much we need
to read. But we're not there yet. Until then, I suggest we keep the lines of
communication open to those who are interested, while continuing to explore
systems that make things better.
