I think Frank Manola has done an excellent job of summarizing and reporting 
the broad thrust of RDF-logic discussion [1] -- it is a subtle many-faceted 
debate, so I think any summary will omit some point of debate.

Rather than try refine that summary, and partly in response to DanBri's 
comments, I have tried to pick up the ball by posting a list, for 
discussion, of goals that reification is purported to achieve or support [2].

Is more required on this specific action point?
