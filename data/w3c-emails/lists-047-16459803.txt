That would be fine with me.

The w3c-rdf-core archive.

I'd take any URI. I would also be willing to create new
directory(s?) under rdf-tests and put tests there.  But,
for example, if DaveB wants to point to a directory at
an ILRT site, I think that would be OK.

I don't think things like test cases and discussion links
belong in an errata.  But then again, until yesterday's phone
conference I thought errata content was fairly limited (e.g. 
fixing obvious typos) and would not contain things like
grammar changes.

However, the group decided the following change for rule [6.19] 
would be added to the errata:

 [6.19] Qname          ::= [ NSprefix ':' ] name

will be changed to:

 [6.19] Qname          ::= name

I think it would be helpful if the chairs would say something about 
what can and cannot be placed in the errata.

But even with this broad defintion of permissible errata changes, it seems
like some potential WG decision will be less clear - that is, not typo
fixes but more like interpretation changes.  As an example (and
please forgive me if I got this wrong), I believe as a resolution to:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr

you essentially suggested in:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0156.html

that the last clause of [6.12] be changed from:

 | '<' propName idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/>'

to:

 | '<' propName idAttr? resourceAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/>'

This wouldn't be a typo fix, IMHO, as it would clearly break
all RDF parsers that conform to the 1.0 spec.  

I would not expect these type of changes to be placed in the
errata.  As a convenience to the WG (and the RDF community), I
think it would be useful to consolidate these type of changes
in a document as I have described.  All changes in that document
would be subject to some type of "it's not over till it's over"
provisio as I stated previously.
