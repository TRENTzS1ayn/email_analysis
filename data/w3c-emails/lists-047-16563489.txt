Having been down this road in another context, I can concur that to
try and figure out what the author means, and then to try an support
it is almost undoable. (How does one decide whether the author really
meant 'about= ' or 'rdf:about='). Supporting both constructs is also
an unnecessary coding burden. Specs are meant to be succinct and not
open to interpretation, and the easiest way to ensure this in this
issue is to do as dan sugests.

<danc>I consider them forbidden since 19990222, and I ask the
WG to agree.
</danc>

i would agree 100% with this, and would also second Dan's suggesstion
(made somewhere) that  we provide a simple tool to convert
uncolonizeded attributes to colonized attributes in existing rdf
documents.

I can volunteer to make a first pass at such a tool (as an internet
application? as a stand alone application?).
