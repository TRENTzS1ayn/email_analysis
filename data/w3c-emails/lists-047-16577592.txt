What I'm after is a format for producing output from parsers (for
instance) that _doesn't_ require complicated handling; I don't want to
have to debug my test-output generator or reader too!

Triples are fine. A graph-matching algorithm might have a high cost
theoretically, but if we're talking about test cases producing less than
50ish nodes, this shouldn't be a problem.

The reason I used l("blah") rather than "blah", incidentally, is to
permit the attachment of additional information l("blah","language").

I don't really care what the syntax looks like* as long as it's trivial
to produce.
