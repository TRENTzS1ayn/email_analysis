I think rather:

   [6.19] Qname          ::= NSprefix ':' name

i.e. compulsory prefix, but I'll work on a full list of grammar changes

That particular issue is on hold until the empty-element issue is
clarified but yes, it would break things and I think the group does
recognise this since we've discussed it and I get the feeling most
people want to make clean breaks.

I'm also uncomfortable calling this errata, but would prefer to have
some statement in the errata for RDF M&S, Schema pointing at the
resolved issues document - some words needed here saying "watch out,
here are the changes subsequent to this document, changing the syntax
and model".  The resolved issues document could then give more details
on the state of proposed changes for those documents.
