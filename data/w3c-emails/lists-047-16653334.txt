Er... I think the non-technical issues actually dominate, in this
case. This is primarily a practical engineering decision.

I agree that technically, i.e. in theory, we could use
lots of things. But I don't agree to your proposal because
it's not backed by running code.

I have a preferred format that I have a zillion test cases in:
RDF/notation3.

I'm happy to discuss alternatives that are backed by running
code.

I pefer python. I'm also happy with the XSLT-based proposals
I've seen. I'm willing
to look at a proposal written in perl; I'll hold my nose ;-)

On behalf of W3C (esp. the I18N WG), I'm somewhat obliged
to prefer an XML-based format, unless there are good reasons
to use something else.

Meanwhile, I do think there are good reasons: (a) because
XML is so hard to read that it unduely increases the
cost of debugging the tests and (b) because using XML might
hide some of the RDF issues that are close to XML.
