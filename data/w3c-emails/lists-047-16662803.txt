Massimo did some related work in the context of XML Query...
  http://www.w3.org/1999/09/ql/xdm
  (Member-Confidential as of this writing)

Massimo, any particular reason why the XDM materials
shouldn't be public? not the meeting records themselves,
but just the XDM tools and docs?

Mmm, at that moment in time it started w3c-confidential as 
normal default procedure. Now, well, there's in fact no reason for it 
to stay so, apart from the fact that if it were to be publicly released,
I'd change a couple of small things that could be improved
(using XDM in the working group has been a very good testbench 
to stress things that worked well in it, and things that could have been
slightly changed).
This was on my todo's as a use case for the swad (later in the pile, 
after the processing tools...), but if there's interest it could be put 
earlier ;)

ps BTW, very interesting esp. also comparing XDM with Dan's new RDF tool.
