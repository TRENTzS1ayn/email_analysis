This seems an eminently sensible remark to make at this juncture: not to
replicate modelling and notational considerations from the level
below... and certainly not to adopt a syntactical convention that may be
bypassed by more fundamental changes elsewhere.

Can the whole namespace-attribute `decision' be reconstructed with
Brian's reference to XML namespace tying? Or are we determined to be
dogmatic about the actual syntax? Wouldn't that simplify our long search
for consensus?
