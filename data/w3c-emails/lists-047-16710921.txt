Maybe; when we get around to actually replacing the gramar
in the spec, I expect we'll do something at the infoset
level (i.e. using XSLT or XML Schema or whatever).

But for now, let's just use test cases to say what we mean.

I am determined to be clear about the actual syntax.
Down to the last character and byte, using test cases.

I doubt it; I find black-and-white test cases much
more conducive to building lasting consensus
than abstractions.

I say "lasting" because you can always abstract
away to the point where everybody agrees; but then
when you go to apply it, you discover that you
didn't have consensus at a level that actually
gives you interoperability.
