I thought to do a straightforward test namely
asserting the facts contained in
http://www.w3.org/2000/11/mr76/rdfc25May.n3
and then querying with that same
http://www.w3.org/2000/11/mr76/rdfc25May.n3
which should of course always succeed.
But it didn't succeed...
After some tracing I found
  n:_23 [ mr:from who:mdean; a mr:Absent ]; # didn't actually call his name, did we?
  n:_23 [ mr:from who:guha; a mr:Absent ]; # didn't actually call his name, did we?
giving the trouble (2 times n:_23) which I think
is indeed an inconsistency. Right?
That wasn't all, because there are lots of
mr:result properties further on as well.
So I am in doubt now...
