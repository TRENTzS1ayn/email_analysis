I attach 5 test cases for checking support of rdf: attributes along
with the expected outputs as simple N3 statements (regular s, p, o
form).  They are all cloaked as text/html to get stored in mail
archive.  They are in the order test<n>.rdf test<n>.n3 where the
former is the input as RDF/XML and the latter is the expected output
RDF/N3.

I have checked the test outputs by hand and they seemed correct.  I
also tried them on the W3C SiRPAC online RDF parser and it looks like
it gives the same number of triples and results (ignoring different
generated ids).

There are no test cases containing unprefixed attributes, since we
removed all mention of them from the current proposal at the previous
meeting.
