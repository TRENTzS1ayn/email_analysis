Hmm... let me try that with cwm... hmm...
it's not working; I'm not sure why...

Not by itself, no.

If you combine it with an axiom that n:_23 (and
all ContainerMembershipProperties) and
mr:from are UniqueProperties and who:mdean
and who:guha are different, then you get a contradiction.

Right; in the general case, it's perfectly
fine to have several values for the same
property of the same subject:
:s :p :o1.
:s :p :o2.
:s :p :o3.

in fact, there's a short-hand syntax for it in N3:

:s :p :o1, :o2, :o3.

(but I don't expect to use any shorthands for
test case expected results; I intend to add
some sort of --simple output that just
writes one statement per line.)

It's not clear what you're in doubt about.
Is it about the use of N3 for test case output?
Or about the idea of graph matching on
expected results in general?
