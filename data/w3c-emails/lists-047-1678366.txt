Let's not go there/do that.

Alt is just another class. There's nothing special about it
except that applications can treat it specially because
they know its name.

If

_:something :relatedTo _:C.
_:C rdf:type rdf:Alt.
_:C rdf:_1 _:x.
_:C rdf:_2 _:y.

then we neither license

_:something :relatedTo _:x.

nor

_:something :relatedTo _:y.


This is similar to the situation where folks assume that

_:something dc:creator _:C.
_:C a rdf:Bag.
_:C rdf:_1 _:Kernighan.
_:C rdf:_2 _:Ritchie.

entails

_:something dc:creator _:Kernighan.

But it doesn't. Documentation for the dc:creator property
might say that *for that property* the above inference
is licensed. But it's not a feature of the RDF core language.

Similarly for rdf:Alt.
