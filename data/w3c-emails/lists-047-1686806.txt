ok... I made a certain amount of progress:

  RDF Model Theory Proposal
  http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-mt/rdf-mt
  Wed, 29 Aug 2001 03:38:47 GMT

This meets the W3C publishing constraints that we've managed
to automate. There are others; I haven't worked on those.

I started with
  http://www.w3.org/2001/07/pubrules-form

and put in the above document; i.e.

http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?xslfile=http://www.w3.org/2001/07/pubrules-checker&doc_uri=http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-mt/rdf-mt&xmlfile=http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-mt/rdf-mt

and I chipped away until it was happy. It's now
- XHTML 1.0 Transitional valid
- CSS valid
- no broken links
- W3C style (automated/automatable parts) checked.

As I was saying...

I'd rather not do all this stuff again...
