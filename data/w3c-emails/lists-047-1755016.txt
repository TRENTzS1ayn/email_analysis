Does RDF allow, let's call it, non-URI-ref for predicates?
I don't think so, at present.  In the graph model in the original
M&S, predicates are arrows with URIs, they are never empty circles.

It was anonNode - which was probably worse, so I changed it.
How about princeNode?

It is just a token in the N-Triples grammar and if it will reduce any
implied meaning by changing the characters of the token, let's do it.

Well at present I say it is illegal N-Triples.
