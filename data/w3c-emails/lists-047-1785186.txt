The test case respository at:

 [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/

contains the following dirs:

  amp-in-url
  rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema
  rdf-ns-prefix-confusion
  rdfms-aboutEach-on-object
  rdfms-abouteach
  rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about
  rdfms-empty-property-elements
  rdfms-nested-bagIDs
  rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr

[1] also contains some two other dirs (rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr
and rdfms-empty-property-lements) that are obsolete/junk and
will be removed.

If you created test cases for the WG and they have not been 
added to [1], please contact me or send me a zip of the files.
