Thanks for the heads-up Aaron.  I separated the test cases in the
WD into two tables:

Certified Test Cases:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#tc_cert

and Un-certified Test Cases:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#tc_no_cert

and put rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about in this second
table.
