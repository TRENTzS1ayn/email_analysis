Folks, Frank Harmelen sent me his own perception of the discussion of 
this issue on the DAML telecon this week. I'm forwarding it (with his 
OK) to give a better impression to the WG.

>2. as a result of point 1, acyclicity of the subclass-relation in 
>DAML+OIL cannot always be detected by purely syntactic means, since 
>computationally expensive inference may be needed to detect implicit 
>("implied") subclass-relations

>3. because of point 2, DAML+OIL cannot require acyclicity of the

>at great computational expense.

>4. Point 3 means that if RDF-S will enforce acyclicity of 
>rdfs:subClassOf, then DAML+OIL can no longer use rdfs:subClassOf. In 
>other words, DAML+OIL will be forced to introduce daml:subClassOf
>
>5. Point 4 would mean that much (all?) backward compatability 
>between RDF-S and DAML+OIL would disappear: an RDF-S processor would 
>be unable to catch any of the semantics of a DAML+OIL ontology 
>(whereas currently, all the explicitly stated subclass relationships 
>in a DAML+OIL ontology are accessible to an RDF-S agent, since 
>DAML+OIL uses rdfs:subClassof
>
>6. An important design rationale behind DAML+OIL (and in fact much 
>other stuff on the Semantic Web so far) has been a layered approach, 
>where languages are stacked on top of each other, with as much 
>partial interpretation between the layers as possible. Tim BL has 
>even argued in [1], [2], [3] and many other places that such 
>"partial understanding is an essential design principle of the Web 
>in general, Semantic or not.
>
>The decision to make rdfs:subClassOf acyclic will force DAML+OIL to 
>introduce daml:subClassOf, and will therefore lead to an almost 
>total loss of partial understanding between these two closely 
>related ontology languages...
