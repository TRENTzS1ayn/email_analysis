NO, what I sent you was a DRAFT which has not been formally 
considered by the WG yet, let alone approved by them. You saw it 
first. The WG hasnt 'done' anything about this issue yet, so please 
don't say that it has.

Quite.  All blame is mine so far, and your points (especially point 
1)  have firmly convinced me that the WG should definitely NOT modify 
this definition, so please don't tell anyone else that it has done, 
there's a good chap.

And thanks for the input, most valuable.

Well, this seems perfectly natural to me. In fact the analogous 
assumption for 'parts' is considered one of the basic axioms of 
mereology, often called the proper part axiom: if A is a part of B, 
then there must be some other part C of B which is separate from A. 
Denying this axiom leads to models where everything has infinite 
descending chains of 'parts' all of which are extensionally 
indistinguishable. It also seems to be the intuitive basis for the 
fact that the empty set has no proper subsets.

But never mind, (1) was enough.
