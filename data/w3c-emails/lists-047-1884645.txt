Dan, did you take a look at the stuff I wrote on rdfs, and are you OK 
with it, given your worries about the earlier draft? I didnt really 
change the MT itself, but tried to make the text a better indication 
of the intended relationship between rdfs and rdf:type.

If there is a guide somewhere I could try doing it myself.

Quite. I will try to avoid your having to. Many thanks to you and to Aaron.

I propose to try to improve the layout, and make the following 
changes to the content:

1. Remove the summary of Ntriples syntax and replace it with a URI to 
an Ntriples defining document (ANYONE GOT THIS YET??)

2. Remove the sections concerning rdf:Alt from the MT altogether, and 
add a note saying explicitly that this feature is not described (AS 
IT STILL UNDER DISCUSSION?? OR WOULD IT BE BEST JUST TO KEEP MUM 
ABOUT IT?)

3. How about doing that for containers more generally? Anyone got 
strong views on that one way or the other?

4. Ditto for reification: any views?

5. I could put the 'lemmas' back in, probably best as an appendix 
though rather than in the main text.  Again, comments in either 
direction?

Thanks.

Pat
