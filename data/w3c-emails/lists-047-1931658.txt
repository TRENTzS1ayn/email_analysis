There has been some discussion on the ac-forum mailing list which has
suggested that the formation of the webont WG might drain resources from
and thus delay RDFCore.

If anyone feels that webont going ahead will significantly affect
their ability to meet their commitments to RDFCore, could you please let me
know.
