The most complete N-Triples documenation that I know of is:

 [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/

Note, however, that:

 ACTION 2001-08-17#8 Art Barstow Write strawman WD on test cases (
including n-triples).

implies the N-Triples doc will be placed in the Test Case WD
(this has not been done yet):

 [2] http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/

In the Open Issues of [2]:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#intro_issues

The issue "is N-Triples normative?" is raised.  Given the
MT's reference to N-Triples it seems the answer is yes. 

What do the WG members think about this issue?
