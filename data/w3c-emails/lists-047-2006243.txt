I don't really know how to answer questions of the
form "is X normative"? Here are some questions
I can answer that are perhaps relevant:

1. does our specification of n-triples
constrain the set of XML documents that
conform to the RDF 1.0 spec?

No.

2. does our specification of n-triples
constrain software that conforms
to the RDF 1.0 spec?

No.

3. does the RDF 1.0 spec say that RDF/xml
is the only syntax in which RDF may be expressed?

No.

4. does/should the model theory *depend* on
the definition of n-triples?

No; it's independent of any particular
serialization of RDF.

5. is it useful to use n-triples as
an editorial device in the model theory document?

Yes, I think so.

6. should the model theory draft cite the n-triples
definition from the testing draft?

Yes; given 4 above, I suppose this should
be an informative citation, if we're going
to distinguish informative from normative
citations at this point in the drafting process.
