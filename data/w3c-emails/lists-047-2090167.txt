I'm looking at
  $Revision: 1.24 $ $Date: 2001/08/28 15:04:46 $

The added/removed distinction doesn't show up with
stylesheets turned off.

It's fine to use stylesheets to make a nice style,
but please check that essential distinctions are
visible without the stylesheet.

Hmm... I was going to say that it's not critical
for this first release, but evidently it is:


  2.The document must conform to the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines
     1.0, Level A. Use the WCAG 1.0 Checklist (5 May 1999 version).

  2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available
  without color, for example from context or markup. 

  6.1 Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets.
