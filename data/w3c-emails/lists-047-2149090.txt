I understand that, but that still leaves open the issue that I was 
raising, which is: given that it doesn't have the properties 
contiguous, what does that entail? Are the 'missing' elements really 
there (but not mentioned), or are they genuinely not there? So in my 
example, if
xxx rdf:_1 aaa
xxx rdf:_3 ccc
does xxx have two, or at least three, members?
