I entirely agree with Dan here. I just wanted to have an informative 
(but stable) reference, not to imply any kind of endorsement or 
normativity. I only use Ntriples as a way to describe graphs, since 
its quicker to type than to draw a picture.

We could eliminate Ntriples from the MT document altogether and give 
all the examples as explicit graph pictures, like the M&S does.  I'd 
be willing to do this, if the WG feels it would make the document 
more accessible. I guess I was assuming that we were going to 
'publish' Ntriples in any case, even if it wasnt somehow endorsed as 
a standard, but if that assumption is overly naive then the JPEG 
alternative might be preferable.

I await guidance.
