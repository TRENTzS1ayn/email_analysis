I understand the points you guys are making.  However, to add a related
issue, the current RDF/XML Syntax draft says "This process [that is,
mapping from the XML syntax to the RDF model] is not yet complete, in
that the final step is defining for each syntax production which RDF
statements are added to the resulting model (if any)."  How are we going
to describe "which RDF statements are added to the resulting model" for
these productions?  Pictures of graph snippets?  If we use Ntriples
here, and other places where it appears we want to be *really* precise
(like in test cases), it sure seems funny to say it isn't normative.  On
the other hand, what we *really* mean to be normative here is the
translation from XML/RDF to RDF, not any particular way of representing
the RDF.  (Would saying we describe RDF statements in terms of
particular collections of binary predicates in mathematical logic be any
better?  That's more or less what Ntriples are anyway, and may sound
less like another "syntax").  In any event, given the current state of
affairs, we need to be damn careful that we understand all the ins and
outs of the various graphs and their mappings to Ntriples.
