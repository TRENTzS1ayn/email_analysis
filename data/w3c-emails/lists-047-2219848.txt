Not quite. The 'ACSAA' principle doesnt actually prevent one saying 
that a container has exactly these things and no more; but it does 
mean that if you are allowed to say that, then something someone else 
might say could contradict what you say. It raises the possibility of 
disagreement. So it can be said to be in opposition to a rather 
stronger principle, which might be characterised as 'anyone can say 
anything about anything and nobody will ever disagree with them'. 
Much of RDF seems to be designed on the ACSAANED principle rather 
than the ACSAA, however, so maybe this is indeed the reason for it. 
Right now much of the simplicity of RDF can be attributed to the fact 
that it is impossible to express an inconsistency in it, hence 
impossible to actually disagree with anything. I think that ACSAANED 
isn't a feasible basis for communication between agents, human or 
machine, but it certainly does reflect a happy 'love one another' 
picture of the world (one that reminds me rather of the early 60s, in 
fact.)

>2)  However, in the specific examples used in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the

Good point, although I think that the 'anyone' in ACSAA/NED includes 
oneself, so that it is always considered kosher to add some more 
information yourself, and presumably you could do that even if the 
node was anonymous.

More to the point, how could you know there were not? Part of the 
basic game of giving *descriptions* is that the interpretation is 
required to satisfy them, but not to satisfy them *exactly* (unless 
they are so expect that only one interpretation is possible). If I 
say three things exist, I do not thereby say that a fourth one does 
not exist. Often in ordinary conversation things like this are 
assumed, but the 'rules' by which those assumptions are made have to 
do with human conversational practice (what Grice calls 
'conversational maxims', eg don't give irrelevant information, always 
give all relevant information, and so on) rather than strict 
assertional content.

Not in RDF there isn't.

Again, I think that this is very debateable. If you were to use the 
actual words "I have two children" in a conversation, then indeed 
Grice's rules would suggest that you mean that you have precisely two 
kids, since to use the precise number in that context would be 
misleading if you in fact had three, and could have said 'three' just 
as easily.  But that is a very fragile assumption, and depends on the 
conversational context. Suppose for example that you were visiting 
your kid's school and told someone, pointing to the kids in question, 
"Those are my children", then that would be quite consistent with 
your also having other children, even though the same information is 
being asserted. Or suppose you were to say in a conversation about 
books, "I have read all of Shakespeare's sonnets"; it wouldn't be 
reasonable to infer that you hadn't read anything else.

I think it runs deeper than that.

Right. It would allow you to say something that others could disagree 
with, but at least conveys your intended meaning. Right now you can't 
even say it.

Quite.
