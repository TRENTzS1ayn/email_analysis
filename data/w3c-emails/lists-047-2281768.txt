I disagree. By refusing to acknowledge 'normativity' we are just 
declaring a refusal to get involved with a whole lot of 
'standardising' effort. If anyone doesnt like Ntriples they can draw 
the graphs themselves. Ntriples isnt really to do with RDF as such: 
its a graph-linearisation convention and would work for any labelled 
graph.

I would prefer not to do that, since that would be taken by many folk 
as importing a 'standard' semantics (which is in fact slightly 
different from the one we have right now...)

I agree. We can just publish Ntriples and describe it honestly as a 
NON-normative, but extremely handy, notation for describing RDF 
graphs in linear text, and *that's all*. Then we can use it in our 
prose freely, and the world will be able to follow us pretty easily 
once they get used to it (particularly if the document gives some 
examples and is careful to say that this is not being offered as an 
alternative RDF serialization - though of course everyone will see 
that it could be used that way, but we aren't *saying* that) and yet 
we won't be asked to give a semantics for it, write parsers for it, 
provide an XML serialization of it, etc. etc. . Put the BNF in an 
appendix in case anyone wants to use it, but don't wave any banners. 
(To rub the point in, we could even characterise it as a language for 
describing *pictures* of RDF graphs, which is how I tend to think of 
it in any case.)

I think the following is true, BTW: disregarding ordering of lines in 
an Ntripledoc and renamings of <anonNode>s , Ntripledocs and rdf 
graphs are 1:1;  every doc describes a unique graph, and every graph 
has a unique doc, and if you start with one, translate into the 
other, then back, you always get what you started with.
