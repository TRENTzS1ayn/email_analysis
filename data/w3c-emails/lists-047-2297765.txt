No, Dan changed rdf:type to take a literal value which is a change
beyond what we can justify as a cleanup just because it makes the
grammar slightly neater, IMHO.

The first triple in my original N-Triple output was
  _:id1 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement> .

The original grammar is pretty clear on this point, it intended
rdf:type to take a URI-reference.  rdf:type may also match propAttr
but the rdf:type property has a privileged position in the syntax
such as its generation from typedNode and this is another place.

  [6.10] propAttr ::= typeAttr
                      | propName '="' string '"' (with embedded quotes escaped)

  [6.11] typeAttr ::= ' type="' URI-reference '"'

  [6.14] propName ::= Qname
  [6.19] Qname ::= [ NSprefix ':' ] name

  -- http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#propAttr
     onwards

(plus modifying type to be rdf:type as we have already decided)
