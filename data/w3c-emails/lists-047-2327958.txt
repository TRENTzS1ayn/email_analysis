but Art is not responsible for the content of the N-Triples
document, which has been sitting around for weeks at the old URI,
linked from our home page http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/

He merged it in, and I have not had the time to update it since I've
been working on the other document.  Moreover I didn't have
permission to write to it till an hour or so a ago.

In a previous mail to the list I noted in a reply to Jos:

  > 2. why do we use the term namedNode for a node which is in fact not named?

  It was anonNode - which was probably worse, so I changed it.
  How about princeNode?

  It is just a token in the N-Triples grammar and if it will reduce any
  implied meaning by changing the characters of the token, let's do it.

The rest can wait till later, when I've updated the syntax doc after
the review.
