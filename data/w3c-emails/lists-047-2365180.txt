Or possibly the single most annoying typo (they left out "the denotation
of..." all the way through) in M+S. While it's quite common to infer the
missing words from context, it's extremely harmful in this case.

I think the missing words were _probably_ what was intended by the
original M+S mob, but you'd have to ask them. One of the biggest
stumbling blocks in understanding RDF seems to be realising the
distinction between the denotation of and (for want of a better word)
the dereferencing of a URI.

I'm fairly sure that the original working group intended to do the
"right" (ie, obvious) thing: evidence here is Ora's saying that he
originally wanted to have a "URI" arc linking resource nodes with the
addresses you could find them.
