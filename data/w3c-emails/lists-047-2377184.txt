The problem with treating this as a typo and fixing it is that
all the implementations of reification that I've seen
follow the spec as written. So it's of little use to
change the spec now.

I suspect the thing to do is to phase out the existing
subject/predicate/object vocabulary and phase in a new
one that works.

This is just one more reason why the 1st draft of the model
theory shouldn't include reification.
