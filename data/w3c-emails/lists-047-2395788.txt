Optional rdf:RDF (Aaron)
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0168.html
  A new issue for Aaron? :)
  Maybe related to infoset [document] information item

Container removal trick, confusion (Art)
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0211.html
  Unsure, maybe ask for developer feedback - does this make
  containers clearer?

Add/remove <ins>, <del>, css style; (X)HTML versions (DanC, Brian)
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0222.html
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0227.html
  Need docs rules advice, WAI.

IDs (Brian, Satoshi)
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0229.html
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0237.html
  Yes, I've got it wrong here, attribute values in infoset are all
  CDATA, attribute type is from DTD only if present.  Will redo.

References (Brian)
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0229.html
  Will check only cited docs are present.
  It is intended N-Triples will be cited in future, that is why it
  was there.  Maybe now cite the draft test cases doc rather than
  N-Triples.

Title (FrankM)
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0233.html
  Yes, it does need changing.  I suggest: Refactoring RDF/XML Syntax
