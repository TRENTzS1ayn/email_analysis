Glad we're publishing, but...I'd appreciate a
show of hands...

6.32 parseLiteral " rdf:parseType=\"Literal\""
6.33 parseResource " rdf:parseType=\"Resource\""

What would be the chances of:

1: changing them to this:

6.32 parseLiteral " rdf:parseType=\"rdf:Literal\""
6.33 parseResource " rdf:parseType=\"rdf:Resource\""

2: doing a soft deprecation on the existing
attribute values.

3: reserving the prefix 'rdf:' for future RDF rec use
in recognition of parseType's known use as an extension
mechanism plus there are words in the existing M&S that
seem to mandate this type of upgrade.

My apologies for not raising this at the telcon, but I've
been misreading the attributes as having the prefix in
there, until about 5 minutes before the telcon ended,
and I didn't want to cut into the MT discussion.
