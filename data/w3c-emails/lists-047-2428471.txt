Review syntax working draft V1.23

  This document is available at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0165.html

  Dave summarises his email; the major concerns are over a title change
  (suggested, "Refactoring RDF/XML syntax") and inserting a warning
  about some browsers' poor rendering of the <ins> and <del> markup.

  RESOLVED: to change the title of the document and insert a warning
about the browser display issues; that Dave should exercise
editorial discretion over the other items mentioned in his
email; to publish this next week.

  ACTION: 2001-08-31#01 : Art - to act as team contact for the purposes
of getting the Syntax working draft V1.23 (plus amendments)
through the W3C publishing process.

Issue rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0172.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0192.html

  Review and consider response from DAML+OIL.

  Pat reported that DAML "strongly urged" the WG to adopt their
  interpretation of rdfs:subClassOf in order to preserve the "layering"
  of DAML+OIL on top of RDFS.

  DanC pointed out that the interpretation of a subClassOf loop should
  be that the classes involved were coextensional, not intentionally
  identical.

  There was concern that a member of the WG (Sergei), amongst others,
  had expressed some doubts about the reception of this change in the OO
  programming community.

  Frank M, Pat and others said that:
  1. this wasn't a showstopper - a loop might be detected at compile
     time for source code derived from an RDFS schema, this was
     acceptable behaviour.
  2. that our intention with RDFS is to model classes (ontologically),
     not directly model classes as they occur in OO languages (same
     word, different meanings)

  There is some urgency to get a resolution to this issue in order to
  make DAML+OIL publication run smoothly. A tentative resolution might
  be to resolve to permit loops in rdfs:subClassOf, with the expectation
  of a specialisation of that property that forbids loops.

  The WG decided that it was important to hear back from Sergei about
  what he felt about that proposal (since he raised the issue at the
  F2F). Thus:

  ACTION: 2001-08-31#02 : Frank M - to chase Sergei for his reaction to
this proposed resolution to issue rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf
when he returns (or shortly thereafter)

At this point the Teleconference was curtailed due to a lack of time.
Brian indicated that he'd like to make the MT the priority next week;
next meeting to be one week hence.
