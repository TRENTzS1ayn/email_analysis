OK, but then this really does not make sense, because the M&S also 
says that 'Resource' includes off-webbish things like (real) books. 
So taken quite literally, this would allow a Statement to be a triple 
whose second element is, say, volume 1 of the 1815 edition of 
Brittanica. (Not an URI of said book, but the actual book itself, 
with leather covers, weighs around 3 lbs.)

So I suspect that the M&S is here, as elsewhere, just being sloppy 
about the use/mention distinction. At least I hope it is.
