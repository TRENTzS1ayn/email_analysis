Indeed. If we have to take this seriously then I withdraw the model 
theory, since it can't possibly work. Such a beastie, consisting of 
triples of real things, isn't even a language, so it can't have a 
semantics. (It also cannot have a grammar, by the way, since BNF only 
refers to strings of symbols, and my mother isn't a symbol.)
