"the range of a property" is an ill-formed definite description;
a property can have lots different classes as ranges.
Not to mention that a bnode can't be the object of two
different statements in RDF/xml.

We can use this idiom if, as Graham suggested[1], we pick
names for "the lexical space of the xsd:duration datatype";
say, rdfd:durationLexicalSpace. Of course, once we pick
it, we would say
xsd:duration rdfs:range rdfd:durationLexicalSpace.

I think Idiom B is much akin to PL[2]. I like the idea
that
- we give names to all three (lexical, value, mapping)
parts of each of the primitive datatypes

- we explain how to use them (PL/S-B, S-A)

- we let users choose
