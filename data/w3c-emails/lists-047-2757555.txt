I thought the idea of scalars in Perl was that their interpretation
was delayed to the actual operation being applied. The rdfs:range
property is not IMO an operation. An operation would be something
like max(a,b) or add(x,y). If the Perl scalar approach were taken,
then *all* RDF would concern itself with would be the lexical forms
and interpretation would be left to applications and particular 
operations of applications and those operations/applications would
have to inspect and deduce data types and values themselves simply
based on the lexical characteristics of the scalar representation.

I don't really see how the PL proposal is different from the
PDU proposal in that what is suggested is that the interpretation
of a given scalar (lexical form) is based on the pairing of that
scalar (lexical form) with a data type identifier. That's exactly
what PDU suggests.

What am I missing here? (or am I missing anything?)

Cheers,

Patrick
