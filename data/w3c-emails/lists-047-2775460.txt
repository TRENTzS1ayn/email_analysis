You can look at it that way if you like... you won't
run into any contradictions, as far as I can tell; but that's not
how the perl designers specify it. Again, please see:

I don't see the distinction. (I'm not sure it matters, either...)

So far so good...
(I take it you're not using 'interpretation' in the sense
of the RDF model theory.)

Now it becomes critical to be clear whether you mean
'interpretation' in the sense of the RDF model theory or not.

I understand the P/P++ proposal to actually muck
with that level of interpretation; they actually
allow model-theoretic interpretaions where the objects of
<rdfs:label>10</rdfs:label>
and
<ex:shoeSize>10</ex:shoeSize>
denote different things.

The S/DC/PL proposals don't muck with things at that level.

I'm not sure; I would need you to be more precise
before I can tell.
