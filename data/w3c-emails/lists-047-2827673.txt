I propose that the telecon on Dec 14th should be the last of the year and 
that we will resume on 11th January.

This is quite a long break and consequently, time permitting, I will assign 
an agenda item on the 14th's telecon to discuss the ideal gift suitable for 
the RDF geek suffering withdrawl over this period.

Brian
