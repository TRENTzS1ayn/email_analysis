Propose the WG:

  o  resolves that rdf:ID="attr" is an abbreviation for rdf:about="#attr"

  o  action ??? to create a test case


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about


16: Issue rdfms-aboutEach

It has been suggested:

  o  the WG resolves to remove rdf:aboutEach from the language on the grounds
    - it is not used
    - it is not widely implemented
    - it has confusing interactions with bagID as recorded in
        http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach
    - it does not scale as parsers have to save state
    - this is the wrong layer in which to implemenent such functionality

  o Action DaveB remove from the grammar in the RDF/XML Syntax document

  o Action Brian update the issues list, especially Attention Developers

Alternatively, it has been suggested that we are straying beyond
the borders of our charter in removing it, and it can be useful.

Propose, on the grounds that it does not seem to be harmful
that it should be retained.

Action 2001-11-16#9 FrankM Clarify the architectural and other broader concerns with any datatyping scheme that must be considered.

Action 2001-11-30#9 Jeremy Carroll Write up XML Schema structures datatyping proposal as e-mail to group.
