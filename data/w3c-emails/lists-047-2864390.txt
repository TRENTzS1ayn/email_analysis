Given that I am alluded by the suggesting, I note that the charter's
function has been further clarified to me (not in e-mail).

I would be happy to go either way on this; and will concur with the
majority.
I think Dave made a good case for dropping it; but not bullet-proof. Graham
later observed:

[[[
Which makes me think that the criteria for dropping bad features should
probably be less stringent than the criteria for adding "cool"
features.
]]]

which is a good point.
