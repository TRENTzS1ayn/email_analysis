OK, I can see why that text bugs you. I'm happy throwing
out all that text, just going forward with the model theory,
syntax, test cases, and primer docs. (with schema somewhere nearby).

How does this relate to fragments?
Do you know what http://dm93.org/2002/frobnitz means?

Do you expec the RDF spec to tell you what it means?

I expect the RDF spec to tell me what sort of inferences
I can make when I use such a symbol in RDF documents;
but that's all the meaning I expect to get from the RDF
spec.

Sure they do, vacuuously: the fragment is stripped off before the
request,
so the server never sees it. There's no problem interoperating
between HTTP servers and RDF software whatsoever.

If there is, please explain.

Again, yes, they do, vacuously. (i.e. by not doing anything).
Fragment support is all in the clients.

Where is the interoperability difficulty? All the RDF
software I know of gets along just fine with all
sorts of URI-RFC-happy software.

Their mapping to resources is just as defined as any other
sort of URI. Please re-read the model theory draft.

I see repeated claims of that; I see no justification, however.
This is called "argument by assertion." Two can play
at that game: yes, RDF is compatible with the
rest of the Web, W3C or otherwise.

I still don't see the problem for which this "solution" is needed.
