Well, it's meaning is specified by the URI RFC, so yes, at least in the
sense I meant here.

No. That is the problem.

Let me try this again:

HTTP is a way to retrieve (supposedly authoritative) information about the
meaning of an HTTP URI. I can get back a redirect, establishing something of
an equivalence between URIs, I can get back RDF metadata on it, or I can get
back an Unauthorized refusal.

HTTP cannot give me any of this information on a URI with a fragment in it.
All the tools I have to find out information about a HTTP URI don't work
when fragments are invited.

Exactly. I'm not sure about you, but I consider the Web in the network, not
in the client.

Well there appears to be a (rather sad) schism between the IETF and W3C
worlds. I suspect your stuff sits on the W3C side of the fence, which is why
it works. On the other side, my stuff chokes.

I'm hoping we can start patching up the divide. I'm approaching it from this
side, since RDF's deployed base is trivial in comparison to HTTP servers.

This is exactly why it's not well-defined. If any draft can define their
mapping to Resources, then that's a lot of confusion, is it not? I mean, if
the W3C can do it, why can't I? My Frobnitz draft says all fragments resolve
to the literal string "cheese".

It seems the W3C is ignoring the consensus on this issue that was reached at
great expense by the IETF's Working Group. If you want to reconsider that
consensus and put out an updated spec, I suppose that'd be acceptable, but
simply sticking your nose up at the decision and going against what it says
doesn't seem like reasonable behavior for a standards body the caliber of
the W3C.

If we're dealing with URIs and URI-refs, I consider them to be defined by
the URI RFC. It defines URIs quite well, but throws URI refs to the dogs, it
seems. I've been over the details with you several times on IRC, but I
suppose I can repeat myself if it's so necessary.

Even for all your pleas to just see the Model Theory draft it simply dodges
the question, saying that "It treats URIs as simple names". It also claims
that it's dealing with URIs[RFC2396], when it plainly is not. I don't see
how the Model Theory helps matters. It seems to only make matters worse.

As this point as been made to you a number of times in a number of different
venues, trying to explain things as best as can, I can only conclude that
you're playing "argument by not listening". Or as Sean B. Palmer says:
"emigrating, joining a space program to a planetary body with no atmosphere,
rocketing off, and then burying your head in the ground with your fingers in
your ears and screaming 'nur nur nur, I'm not listening'". ;-)

[ This is not meant to imply Sean B. Palmer's position on either side of the
issue. ]

I'm not sure what else I can do to open your eyes. I'm rather tempted to
say, "Denial is more than just a river in Egypt" but I sense it's at the
bounds of polite discourse.
