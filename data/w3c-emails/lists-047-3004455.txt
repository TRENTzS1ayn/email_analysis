In that sense the URI RFC also says
what http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#value means.

i.e. it gives a sort of standard interpretation that meshes
quite nicely with the interpretation structure in the RDF
model theory draft.

The problem is in your lack of expectations?
I don't think that's what you meant. Please clarify.
Ah... from reading more below, I see that you're saying
that the problem is that you don't expect
the RDF spec to tell you what URIs mean, but it
seems, to you, that the RDF spec is trying to say
what URIs mean. That's not the case, as I explain
above and below...

Sure it can; that is: you can get, via HTTP, documents that use such
URIs; documents which tell you about the meaning of such symbols.

For example?

The Web is a combination of clients, servers, networks, people,
and all sorts of stuff.

Baseless rhetoric.

The Director of W3C is a co-author on the relevant RFC.

I am as much on the IETF side as anyone else on the planet.
supporting evidence, per google:

Searched the web for connolly ietf.   
                                     Results 1 - 10 of about 6,120.

Searched the web for connolly bunyip.   
                                       Results 1 - 10 of about 688.

(uri@bunyip.com is the mailing list used by the IETF WG
that developed the URI RFC)

If you want to justify a claim of lack of interoperability,
just point out two pieces of software that
conform to the relevant specs and yet fail to interoperate, please.

That there is confusion is evident, but it is not a consequence
of conflicts between the URI spec and the RDF model theory.

The RDF model theory does *not* specify any particular interpretation
for URIs [except that it does, somewhat, constrain the interpretation
of, e.g. rdf:value w.r.t. rdf:Property; i.e. it does tell you
some stuff about the RDF vocabulary itself].
For URIs in general,
it specifies various inferences that are valid *no matter how*
you interpret URIs. It defers to the various other specs for
information about conventional/standard interpretations.

The RDF spec and the URI spec are orthogonal and don't form
this sort of conflict.

Which decision?
This looks like more baseless rhetoric.

Unless the working group is to be convinced by your
reference to these several IRC chats, it seems necessary.

I am not dodging the question on purpose, but I can't claim
to be answering it head on, because I'm still not sure
I understand it.

I am only trying to understand the issue in precise terms.

Yes, the point has been claimed to me many times. No,
I don't see any justification.

I understood a bit more now than before I read your message,
and I think I have explained a bit more how the specs
don't conflict. Perhaps we are making progress.
