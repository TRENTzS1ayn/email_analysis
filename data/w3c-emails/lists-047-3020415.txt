Dan,

I think that's a reasonable and consistent answer, but I'll note that's not 
what Perl does.
The following script:

#!/local/bin/perl
$a="10";
$b="010";
$c=10;
if ( $a==$b )
     {
     print "Equal '$a', '$b', '$c'\n";
     }
else
     {
     print "Not equal '$a', '$b', '$c'\n";
     }

prints:
     Equal '10', '010', '10'

I suppose that you could argue that '==' invokes a higher level of 
interpretation.
