I suppose we could make this decision. I would find it somewhat
disappointing and inconsistent with the marketing put out by W3C, but I
could live with it.

Just to clarify what I mean, take a look at the top of the W3C's Semantic
Web page, which reads (emphasis added):

[[[
"The Semantic Web is an *extension of the current web* in which information
is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work
in cooperation." -- Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, Ora Lassila, The
Semantic Web
]]] - http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/

It would certainly clear up a lot of confusion if we said that the URIs RDF
talks about are just random strings, and not related to the URIs everyone
expects them to be.
