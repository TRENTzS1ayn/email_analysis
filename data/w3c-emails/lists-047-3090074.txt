I sorta expected to see an entailment test, not just
an example arrangement of properties.

But as an example/explanation, it looks fine.

I'm happy to see it approved.

I'd like to see an entailment test (to show
that the transitive closure of parent is *not* entialed)
added at some point, but it's not critical.
