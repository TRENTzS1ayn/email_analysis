it provides a framework for describing resources, yes.

no, it says strings with #fragmentIDs are not URIs.

The defintion of resource that it gives isn't
limited in the way you suggest:

      Resource
         A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar
         examples include an electronic document, an image, a service
         (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a
         collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network
         "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
         books in a library can also be considered resources.

That text makes a clear point about syntax, but not about any
relationship between absolute-URI-references and resources.
