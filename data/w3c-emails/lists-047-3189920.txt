This is *not* what I mean.  See below for clarification.

Then what is the following wording doing in your message
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0579.html)?

[[[

   * the anonymous node has one and only one rdf:value
   * the anonymous node has one and only one rdf:type

The *point* is that your message restricts anonymous nodes to having ``one
and only one rdf:value'' and ``one and only one rdf:type''.  This is a
gigantic extension to RDF.

Not according to your message.

The what is the meaning of the construct as far as RDF is concerned?

Not according to your message, ``one and only one'' does not seem to allow
for zero.

No.  Some datatypeing proposals provide a meaning for such constructs.

Well I did try to understand the message that you told me contained the
best definition of PDU.  If you now come back and state that PDU is not
what was in this message, then how am I supposed to be able to understand
PDU?

Both P and P++ provide meaning for such constructs.

Even if one considered the above to be broken, which I don't, RDF has to
provide a meaning (or a collection of possible meanings for every legal RDF
knowledge base.  If it doesn't, then it is just not suitable for use.

Sure, but any datatyping scheme has to be able to handle contradictions and
ambiguity.

Huh?  What is S doing here.
