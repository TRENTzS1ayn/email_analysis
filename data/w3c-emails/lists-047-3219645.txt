Indeed...

I think there *is* an issue here, but I can't be sure exactly what/where it 
is.  I do think it's a point of co ntinuing confusion, if not outright 
disagreement.  I've yet to decide whether or not it will prove to be 
important in any practical sense, but the lack of clarity isn't helpful.

At the RDFIG F2F at the W3C plenary last year, I understood TimBL to agree 
that the set of "resources" referenced by RDF resource identifiers was not 
identical to the set of "resources" that are identifiable for possible web 
retrieval.   Maybe the correspondence between "web identifier URIs" and 
"RDF identifier URIs" is just a some-times convenient convention, no more?

Hmmm... what is/are the rdf:type(s) of the web resource accessed using 
<http://www.w3.org/>?
