Sergey's S-A and S-B are indeed very interesting
e.g.
  :Karel :age "13" .                        # S-B
and
  :Karel :ageInYears [ xsd:decimal "13" ] . # S-A
are like 2 paths between :Karel and "13"
and I think one can cope easily with that via
  :age ont:samePropertyAs ( :ageInYears xsd:decimal ) .
and all of this is just N-Triples.

The rules for ont:samePropertyAs are generic and allow
us to entail the same stuff from different descriptions.
