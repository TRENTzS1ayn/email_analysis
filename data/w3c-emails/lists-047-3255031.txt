I find Aaron's arguments both substantive and somehow unpersuasive.

So there are issues with fragments - is the RDF specs the right place to
address them, or should they be addressed elsewhere.

Fix RFC 2396

Fix HTTP defns to allow these features

Fix HTTP

I am not sure where this should be fixed.

(xe.g. #xpointer(id("reasons")/li[3]) )

Fix users! :-) This fragment is fairly broken, but that doesn't damn the
system.


As we expand the demands we are making on URIs it is inevitable that we make
new requirements that haven't previously been addressed. While we have to be
confident that we can get by with the current versions of the standards
(RFC2396 and HTTP defn, wherever that is), it doesn't have to be perfect. At
the next rev of these things we have some input.
