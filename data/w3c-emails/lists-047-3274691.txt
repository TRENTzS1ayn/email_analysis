That's a fair point.

I am not in any hurry to change either RFC 2396 or http, but these things
are not eternal holy writ, and they will either change or be superceded;
minor deviation from them is not necessarily a disaster. It then comes to be
a value judgment whether the fragment thing is minor or not, and the extent
to which it is a deviation that can be lived with or is perhaps positively
desirable.
