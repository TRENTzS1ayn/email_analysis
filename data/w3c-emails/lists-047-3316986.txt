I haven't yet finished the work I want to do for the next draft.
Hopefully I can get it done by tomorrow; it will probably close
another issue or two.

However, I've had some good progress with the RELAX NG schema, now a
non-normative part of the document.  It validates most of the good
tests and fails most of the bad tests (I can go into detail later).
If you are curious, have a look at
