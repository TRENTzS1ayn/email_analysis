Encoding of check in RDF:

<foo:Check>
   <foo:checkNum>12345</foo:checknum>
   <foo:accNum>12345</foo:accNum>
   <foo:amount>$54000</foo:amount>  <!-- no datatyping issues here please-->
   <foo:digiSigi>a;lkdsjfa;lksdjfa;klsdjfa;skldfj asiofjeuir 
qeior</foo:digiSigi>
</foo:Check>

Key thing is the check number.

Two checks with same number and amount = one promise.  Two checks with same 
number and  different amounts = somebody is lying.  Two checks with 
different numbers = two promises.
