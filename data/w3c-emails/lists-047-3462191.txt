Looks good. One immediate nit:

"The RDF Model Theory ([RDF-MODEL]) is a graph consisting of nodes "

...the Model Theory itself isn't a graph; it's a theory. So we kind of
want to say 'the RDF model is a', except we don't seem to use the word
'model' that way anymore. Same goes for 'the RDF data model', I think.

"The RDF Model Theory" [RDF-MODEL] defines RDF as a graph..." perhaps?

I've started using the phrase "the RDF information model" as a way of
talking about the RDF style of representing stuff. Not sure it'd work in
this context though.
