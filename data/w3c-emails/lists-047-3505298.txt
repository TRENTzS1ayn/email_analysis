Finally, at last, there is a new version of the MT document at 
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/w3-rdf-mt-current-draft.html

Ive used DanC's 'set of triples' way of describing RDF graphs (with 
all the horrid math in the appendix), I think Ive fixed all the known 
bugs in the tables, and have put in guarded comments about datatypes 
not being done yet (see esp. end of 1.2 ). It is still missing the 
long-promised proofs of the lemmas, but I will graft those on rather 
than keep it hanging around any longer.

Sorry this has taken so long. I will be unable to take part in 
telecons until mid-January, and wont be reading much email either. 
Happy holidays, and all.

Pat
