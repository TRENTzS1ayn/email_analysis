I must apologize to the working group for either my memory or searching
skills are failing me. I cannot find the email I mentioned in which one
group said they were using rdf:ID to mean something.

I've searched quite a bit for it and can't find it. I suggest that we go
ahead as planned and be sure to send a letter out to RDF Interest explaining
the decision in hopes that any with issues will read it.

Again, my apologies,
