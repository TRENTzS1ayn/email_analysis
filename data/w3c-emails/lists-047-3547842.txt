My intuition about this is that the schema statements cannot modify what 
you get by the simple action of parsing.  When you parse your example, you 
get the graph:

   <http://www.w3.org/> ex:orgDirectorShoeSize "10" .

The existence of some schema doesn't affect the result of parsing.  Under 
the P/P++ schemes, it *may* affect the interpretation of the graph obtained 
by parsing.

When you talk about entailment, I think any schema statements that are 
being used to restrict the possible interpretations must be considered to 
be part of the graph.

So, consider three possible graphs:

(a)  <http://www.w3.org/> ex:orgDirectorShoeSize "10" .

(b)  <http://www.w3.org/> ex:orgDirectorShoeSize "10" .
      ex:orgDirectorShoeSize rdfs:range ex:integer .

(c)  <http://www.w3.org/> ex:orgDirectorShoeSize "10" .
      ex:orgDirectorShoeSize rdfs:range ex:numeral .

where:

(a) is what you get from the document considered in isolation,
(b) is what you get from the document merged with one schema, and
(c) is what you get from the document merged with a different schema.

Now, I think it's pretty clear that:

(a) entails (a)
(b) entails (b)
(c) entails (c)

but that:

(a) does not entail (b)
(a) does not entail (c)
(b) does not entail (c)
(c) does not entail (b)

It's less clear that:

(b) entails (a)
(c) entails (a)

The final two cases are the "interesting" cases for P/P++;  as I recall the 
proposals, those entailments do work because the effect of the proposals is 
that the added schema datatyping information has the effect of restricting 
pairs in the relational extension of ex:orgDirectorShoeSize in 
models;  i.e. for all models of...

(a):
    IEXT(I(ex:orgDirectorShoeSize)) contains:
      <I(http://www.w3.org),integer(10)>
      <I(http://www.w3.org),numeral("10")>
    (and others)

(b):
    IEXT(I(ex:orgDirectorShoeSize)) contains:
      <I(http://www.w3.org),integer(10)>

(c):
    IEXT(I(ex:orgDirectorShoeSize)) contains:
      <I(http://www.w3.org),numeral("10")>

which, from the model theory definition of truth for a statement, leads to 
the entailments noted.

In conclusion, I see no reason to say that a document does not entail 
itself under P/P++.
