The statements above, as given, don't express the idea that "10" is a 
member of the lexical
domain of xsd:integer.  Hence...

There's no extension to the semantics of rdfs:domain.

The "special treatment" of datatypes is that the datatype-defining URIs 
have fixed interpretations. In the your example, having the definition of 
s:integer fixed so that its relational extension contains pairs of the form:

     <1,"1">
     <2,"2">
     etc.
