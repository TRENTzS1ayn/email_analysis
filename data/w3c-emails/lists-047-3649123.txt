in "3 Data Model" last line
... part of the node ro computed from the string-value of contained nodes.
                     ^^or

in "3.6 Identifier Node" 2nd sentence
... These nodes are created by giving two values for the for the ...
                                                         ^^^^^^^

                                                                ^
