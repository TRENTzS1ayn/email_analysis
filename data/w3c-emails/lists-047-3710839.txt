Jeremy--

I'm not sure what you're saying here.  Certainly people are going to 
have their own views about what sort of information to provide about 
"provenance", and hence that needs to be part of the overall 
model/ontology, as you say.  However, it's not clear to me that that 
observation means we can pass on dealing with the issue of how people do 
things like make comments about RDF statements (or groups of them), or 
do the other things for which "RDF reification" is currently cited as 
the solution.  Mind you, I don't necessarily think that "RDF 
reification", as currently defined, is the right way to do these things, 
but these seem to be basic issues in applying RDF, and I don't think we 
can punt on them.
