More evidence that xml:lang in RDF 1.0 doesn't meet
users' needs and shouldn't overly constrain our decision
on interpretation of literals...

"This encoding is also part of rdf using one of the abbreviated ways of
encoding rdf in XML. Unfortunally this is not sufficient.
[...]

KAON (kaon.semanticweb.org) extends the RDFS metalevel with addtional
primitives for representing a (multi-lingual) lexical layer...
See http://kaon.semanticweb.org/2001/11/kaon-lexical.rdf The syntax is
pretty adhoc, but it could be used as a discussion basis."

Raphael, you may be interested to know that the RDFCore
WG has a related issue on its agenda:

Issue rdfms-xmllang: Why isn't xml:lang information represented within
the RDF data model?
