I just noticed I missed from my definition of the rdf namespace names:
  Seq Bag Alt
as well as
  Property
which is defined in the schema
  http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
but never mentioned in M&S

Oops!

I've added them to CVS version 1.135 at
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/

(CVS http://cvs.ilrt.org/cvsweb/redland/rdfcore/syntax/index.html )
