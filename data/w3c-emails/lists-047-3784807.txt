OK, that version is now dated 14 December and has the following 
changes, in response to Dan's comments below. I suggest that this 
version be archived and announced to WebOnt, as per today's telecon 
discussion. Or, if you like, I can tell them to get it from the above 
URI, which should be stable enough to use.

I scanned the issue list but didn't see one that would characterize 
it! (I get the impression that this has gotten bigger than any one of 
our named issues.)

OK, point taken. I put in a few sentences and a pointer to the issues 
list where one can track on into the discussions in the archives. If 
you would prefer something different, or want to see other issues 
addressed, say what or suggest a change.

(Might be helpful if you could expand on what it is that is worrying 
people. I am at a bit of a loss here, in that this seems such an 
obvious point that I have trouble following what kind of 
justification people could possibly be asking for; its a bit like 
finding people worried about the need to have feet on the ends of 
ones legs.)

OK,  deleted

Hmmm.  The proof of the lemma is simple, and surely  ont: 
disjointFrom just isn't part of the RDF vocabulary, right? I think 
the point is that the semantic restrictions associated with the ont: 
vocabulary go beyond simple entailment.

Fixed.

OK, replaced with 'vocabulary entailment'

Oh damn.  Rats.  Then I will have to include all that vocabulary in 
all those tables, just to say this piffling constraint. Grumble 
grumble.

I reserve the right to put this off to the next draft.
