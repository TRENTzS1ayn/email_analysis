Dave

can I suggest that you also include properties with URIs like:

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#foo

and

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/foo

If I had known it wasn't a typo I might well have only considered fragments
of http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax as reserved.


Your call, I will approve the test case whether you act on this or not.

Jeremy
