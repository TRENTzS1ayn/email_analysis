Jeremy--

I don't think we disagree on how effective "RDF reification" has been in 
solving problems.  My concern has to do with exactly what "drop" or 
"punt" means.  In the current official W3C RDF specs, "RDF reification" 
is cited as the solution for certain problems (e.g., statements about 
statements, including which statements came from which Web source).  If 
"drop" is interpreted literally, it means all references to reification, 
and those problems, are simply eliminated from the spec, without further 
comment.  I don't believe it would be very responsible for us to do 
that.  I'd prefer to see some explicit discussion (possibly in a 
non-normative appendix) describing those problems, and stating 
explicitly that we don't explicitly deal with those problems in our 
(revised) specifications.
