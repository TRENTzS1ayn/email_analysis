I have recently been working on an RDF schema for representing P3P 
(Platform for Privacy Preferences) which is in last call.  I came across 
two cases where reification could be used.  This post describes the first.

P3P documents define a mechanism for describing data which I have rendered 
into RDF e.g.

   [ ]---rdf:type-->[p3p:User]
    |
    +----p3pb:bdate.ymd.year-->"1999"
    |
    +----p3pb:bdate.ymd.month->"February"

  ...

A P3P profile describes what data is collected by a web site.  One way to 
represent this is to say (simplified for clarity):

    [website]--p3p:collects-->[ ]--rdf:type-->[rdf:Statement]
                               |
                               +---rdf:predicate-->[p3pb:bdate.ymd.year]

ie the site collects statements whose predicate is p3pb:bdate.ymd.year.
