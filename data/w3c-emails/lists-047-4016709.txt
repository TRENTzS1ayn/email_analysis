A second use case occurred in my P3P work.  In this case I have actually 
done it another way, but here is the possibilty.

P3P defines an extension mechanism, where it is possible to include in a 
P3P profile xml elements not defined in the P3P specification.  Such 
extensions are introduced by a special P3P element meaning "here be an 
extension" which takes an attribute defining whether or not a P3P processor 
must barf if it does not understand the extension.  If the extension is 
marked as mandatory, then  the P3P processor must 'understand' and process 
the extension.

In the RDF translation, these extension elements are translated into 
statements.

Reification could be used to annotate statements resulting from an 
extension to define whether they are optional or mandatory.
