I don't think that adding a 'genid' to the model can be said to add any 
information that is not present in the XML.  (The 'genid' is presumed to be 
chosen so that it cannot clash with any other identifier used for any other 
purpose.)

So, in this sense, an anonymous resource might be claimed to be 
XML-syntactic:  it is the responsibility of the RDF/XML parser to allocate 
a unique identifier for any resource that is not explicitly named in the 
XML.  I would say that any issue that is dealt with entirely by a parser 
is, ipso facto, a "merely syntactic" issue.

...

(I'm not saying here that this must be the resolution, just trying to point 
out why I think it might be a resolution.)
