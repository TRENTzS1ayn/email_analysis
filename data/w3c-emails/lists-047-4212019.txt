Having some sympathy with both sides of this, I'm going to play devil's 
advocate for now:

It does suggest that literals have a special place in the scheme of things.

I think that even if all literals were to be regarded as data: URIs, they's 
still have a special place, as they are the only way to attach some 
specified data to an RDF graph without reference to some external data.

That does support your view.

I think all of these can be interpreted as recognizing that literals, in 
some sense, have a distinguished place in and representation in RDF without 
actually saying that a literal is not a resource.

Thus, considering Brian's discussion of scope:

It seems clear to me that there is some special treatment, but it is not 
clear Literals cannot be interpreted as a subset of Resources.
