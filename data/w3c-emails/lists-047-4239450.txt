That's true Graham, and also why we don't speak about
'Most General Unifier', but about (for anonymous nodes)
'does that thing have this thing at Least in Common'
(which is indeed asymmetric)

Subject:  query and unification

Hmmm...  my take is that querying is asymmetric, but unification is symmetric:

   (query Q D) != (query D Q)

but

   (unify E1 E2) == (unify E2 E1)

Maybe query is a special case of unification in which only one expression
contains a variable to be substituted?
