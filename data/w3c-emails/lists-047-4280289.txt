The point is that if you have an inference process that instantiates 
a variable by some kind of matching, then that process is valid only 
if the variable being instantiated is effectively universal (ie is a 
U-variable, cf my earlier reply to Dan C.) What it gets instantiated 
TO might well be an existential, but that is a different issue.

Nothing, as long as there is some guarantee that they are valid. Its 
a delicate issue, this one. I mention it only to mark it as something 
that will need more attention later, it is probably outside the WG 
scope.

If it is in a query, yes.
