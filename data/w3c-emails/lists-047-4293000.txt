That's a universal sentence of you write it out. It has the form
(forall (?x)(implies (meets-criteria ?x) (will-pay-for me you $35 ?x)))

No, its a universal, since it is an assertion you are making.

Substitutions of universally quantified variables, right.

Yes, it is traditional and accurate *in FOL*, where the language  has 
full Boolean expressivity (in particular, has negation), but RDF 
isn't FOL, so its not at all clear what an RDF query is supposed to 
be. With the interpretation you are giving, an RDF query has the 
logical force of a universal quantification, which goes beyond what 
is usually (?) taken to be the expressive power of RDF, as I 
understand it.

Look, heres a way to put it. Divide variables into U-variables and 
E-variables. U-variables are:
1. Universally quantified in positive contexts (ie inside an even 
number of negations in an assertion or an odd number in a query) 
(where the LHS of an implication counts as a negation)
2. Existentially quantified in negative contexts (ie inside an odd 
number of negations in an assertion or an even number in a query)
and E-variables are the others. Then U-variables are 'effectively 
universal' and E-variables are 'effectively existential', where 
'effectively' indicates that the semantics and proof theory don't 
really distinguish between these cases. Skolemisation applies to 
E-variables, and U-variables are bound to new values during inference 
processing: they are the variables that it is valid to freely 
substitute terms for.

Yeh, and that is potentialy misleading. In this sense, a conjunction 
in a query is really a disjunction and vice versa, and skolemisation 
has to be done backwards. The point is that queries are essentially 
*negated*, but when you negate something with free variables, the 
free variables stay free. So to keep the intepretation of free 
variables (which are universal in assertions) consistent, they have 
to be thought of as existential in queries. But if you check out the 
actual semantics of KIF, there is no notion of 'query' defined. The 
way that traditional theorem-provers work is basically by negating 
the 'query' and then testing the combination for inconsistency. 
During the actual reasoning process, all U-variables are treated 
similarly.

In a Gentzen sequent logic, 'queries' are on the RHS of the sequent 
and assertions on the LHS. All the inference rules apply to both 
sides but are exactly dual, so that conjunctions on the RHS are like 
disjunctions on the LH, universals on one side like existentials on 
the other, and so on.

No, if YOU describe your book using an existential, then the 
existential is not in the goal to be proved by the bookseller. Your 
example used an existential in the goal to be proved, which is like 
the use of a universal in an assertion. If he has an asserted 
existential he isnt in a position to infer that he's got a book you 
want, either. He isnt allowed to validly instantiate any of your 
existential variables (unless he knows enough to infer that they are 
unique, but then he could also infer that about your skolem name, 
since he knows exactly asmuch about that as he does about the possble 
values of your existentials.)

No, it has to have it an all interpretations that satisfy the 
antecedents, if we are talking about sentences that contain the name. 
If I assert
(exists (?x)(foo ?x))
and if I assert
(foo genid3452)
knowing that nobody, including me, can possibly know anything else 
about genid3452 (because I just made the name up out of thin air and 
it is guranteed to be unique), then I have said the same thing, and 
you can infer the same things from it (apart from the completely 
useless fact that whatever it is, I am calling it 'genid3452' in the 
second case.)

In the strict logical sense, I think that isnt actually true. When a 
new name is generated, the logical langauge changes. Its a fine 
point, but this is one place where we may need to be rather careful.

>So perhaps it's a misnomer to say that they're doing skolemization.

Well, all that means is using a new name. There isnt any doubt that 
THAT is what is happening, right?

OK.
BTW, I think that Frank Manola said it all right, as well.
