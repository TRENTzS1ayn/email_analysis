I am often wary of games in wording since they mostly seem aimed 
at making people admit things that they don't believe. So I ask 
you to kindly stop the wordplay and instead let's have a 
discussion on what we really mean. Still, even as message stands 
it does not make much sense:

I'm not sure how to interpret that, since my dictionary says:

@prefix ed: <http://www.w3.org/2000/08/eb58#>.
@prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>.

   dc:title "The DICT Development Group: Online Dictionary Query- 
reformulate" ]

How do we improve something without coming up with an improved 
theory? Perhaps you can shed light on this definition of 
"reformulate".

Furthermore, it is unclear to me that we are strictly forbidden 
from doing so, it is simply not our charter (i.e. a specific 
goal/requirement).

I'm not sure what that means. What is a "distinguished 
representation"? I think the question here is just what it would 
appear to be: Do literals (as defined by M&S) have URIs? Based 
on what I know about URIs, I'm pretty sure the answer is yes.

Let me be rather clear about my position in general: I think 
that an RDF statement is made up of three URIs.

I don't see how this is relevant to the issue at hand. Yes, 
there is a set of things in M&S called "Literals". Whether this 
is a side-effect of the XML syntax, or of the abstract syntax is 
not clear to me. Still, even if it was a special part of the 
abstract syntax, that does not prevent the set of Literals from 
having URIs. And if we do decide that they have URIs, that does 
not prevent us from maintaining this distinction or "special 
treatment".
