M&S does not operate in a vacuum. I assume that we also hope to 
align M&S with the other web architecture specs. So the standard 
of proof I would like is an explanation of why M&S's definition 
of Literal does not fit the URI RFC's definition of Resource.

The Working Group has made a number of mistakes. It was my 
understanding that we were here to fix them.

Literals can be a subset of Resources and the above can remain true.

The evidence is clear in the definitions of Resources and 
Literals in the many Web architecture specs. I simply don't 
understand how a Literal is not a resource -- something with 
identity.

I'd also be interested in hearing your position on why this.
