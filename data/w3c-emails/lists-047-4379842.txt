Whether RDF Literals should be kinds of RDF Resources; if that
is a mistake, it is a validation/requirements mistake; possibly
such mistakes are outside the scope of our charter. The chairs
can probably clarify this best.

:The evidence is clear in the definitions of Resources and
:Literals in the many Web architecture specs. I simply don't
:understand how a Literal is not a resource -- something with
:identity.

Literals might be, and you might be correct in the large. But
in RDF, an RDF resource is just a thing denoted by a URI; the
fact that things have identity is orthogonal; what's important
in RDF is that things have URIs. That makes RDF Literals
distinct from RDF resources in the M&S.
