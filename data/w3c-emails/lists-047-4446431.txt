I wasn't quite sure what you meant here.  If the WG were to
decide that the triples generated with rdf:ID and an rdf:about
were identical, would that tie the hands of a future WG?

A very interesting example.  Seems like this gets into (shuts eyes,
grimaces, holds breath) provenance and reification.  Does a PRISM
processor need to store the fact that a triple was generated
from description element with an rdf:about attribute rather than
an rdf:ID attribute.  Would generating isDefinedIn be enough
to capture the requisite information?  Does generating an
isDefinedIn contribute towards capturing the information?
