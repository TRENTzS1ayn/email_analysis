I assume you mean abstract syntax, not formal model.

Err, this is the point I'm not sure on. Would it not be possible 
to admit that Literals are Resources, define a set of URIs for 
them, but allow the abstract syntax to contain both forms 
(literal and resource)? This would not be a change to the 
abstract syntax, but merely some useful information to RDF 
users. Similar to the bit in the RDFS spec that says "Remember 
when we talked about the class of Literals? Well that has this 
URI...".

This is only one possibility -- I'm not necessarily sure that it 
is the best route.

I have come to a decision:

Since the M&S states that:

All things being described by RDF expressions are called resources.

and (possibly among others) the xml:lang syntax allows an RDF 
expression to describe a Literal, then Literals must be 
Resources. Furthermore, since M&S states:

Resources are always named by URIs plus optional anchor ids (see
[URI]). Anything can have a URI; ] the extensibility of URIs 
allows the introduction of identifiers for any entity 
imaginable.

And I can clearly imagine Literals, then they must be RDF 
Resources. Since the spec is unclear on this point, I think the 
answer is no, Literals do not have a distinguished 
representation in the spec. Anything else would seem to cause a 
contradiction. I think you'd agree that it's easier to make 
Literals into Resources than redefine Resources as everything 
except Literals.

Here's a starting point for some reasons:

  - The spec would be contradictory (see above)
  - Literals have many resource-like properties (language, type, etc.)
  - The "data:" scheme seems very close to a set of URIs for literals
  - Datatyping, query and other future directions in RDF may 
necessitate us to treat literals as resources.

Thanks to Dan Brickley for some of these ideas, although this 
does not mean he agrees with my position.

That is true.
