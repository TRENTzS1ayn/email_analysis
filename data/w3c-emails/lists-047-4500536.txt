This is a summary of the ACTION: 2001-06-22#4 / Priorities for F2F.

A total of five contributions were received from Graham, Jos, Pat,
Art, and myself.

The following priority ordering was consistent with all postings:

  1. model / abstract syntax

    - formal definition, semantics, prose for developers
    - what exactly is an RDF expression
    - what undocumented RDF assumptions are there
    - reification, ...

  2. serialization syntax(es)

  3. RDF Schema

An additional major issue that was raised in several postings is that
of scope/roadmap. It comprises a number of fundamental questions like

  - what we expect to produce and how
  - whether RDF is an assertional language or a programming language
  - which formal methods should we use to define semantics and
serialization
    syntaxes
  - extensibility path, ...

Logically, the scope/roadmap issue belongs as the very first one, but
seems to be hard to resolve upfront.

Finally, Art suggested to "open mic" potential topics/issues during F2F.
