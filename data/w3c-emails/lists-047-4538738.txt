Hi Dave,

Cool; it will be good to get automated tests going.

Two minors:

1: I agree with Graham for eoln:

  eoln ::= '\r\n'

would do the job.

2: if we wanted to go from xml <-> ntriples, I don't think
'\v' is a legal character in XML (ws or otherwise, but I'll
stand corrected); tab and spc are probably enough:

  ws ::= ' ' | '\t'

Bill
