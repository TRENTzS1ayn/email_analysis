[[
Issue rdf-containers-formalmodel : Formal Model for Containers.

raised Wed, 09 May 2001 by Dan Brickley

Summary: Parags 189-193 of M+S suggest a privileged role for RDF
containers within the formal model at the heart of RDF. Furthermore, they
suggest largely
unimplemented (**need to hear about Jan's implementation**) constraints,
either on XML encodings of RDF, on other (eg. database implementations) or
on both. These paragraphs are either in error (RDF does allow for partial
descriptions) or editorially redundant.

Resolution: On 8th June 2001 the WG decided that an RDF model may contain
partial descriptions of a container. Thus an RDF model is not contrained
to have
the containermembership properties contiguous starting from rdf:_1. The
following therefore, is legal RDF:

<rdf:Bag>
  <rdf:_2>2</rdf:_2>
  <rdf::_4>4</rdf:_4>
</rdf:Bag>

Currently: closed.

... I propose the following edit to the RDF Model and Syntax  specification
as closure on my action item to write up our editorial decision on this
issue:


Proposed fix:
[[
Strike paragraphs 189 thru 193 from section 5 ("Formal Model")
of the Model and Syntax specification.

ie. remove the description of containers beginning "As described
in Section 3., it is frequently " ... and ending "at least one
alternative)". See Jan's annotated doc,
http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#189 for a convenient exact pointer.

We also note that the container vocabulary is documented elsewhere
in the Model and Syntax specification, as well as in RDF Schema,
and that this documentation will need refining and consolidating
in addition to this change.

]]


Note that I'm not sending this for discussion at today's meeting.

Dan
