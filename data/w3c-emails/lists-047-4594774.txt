To clarify my position.
- A RDF-literal is a resource, in the common sense of the term "resource".
- It is not a RDF-resource as defined by the M&S, because a RDF-literal
has no URI.

Seen in other computing worlds:
- A java String is an Object, a java char[] is a primitve data type.
- An <!ENTITY> can be internal (a literal), external: SYSTEM, PUBLIC,
or even NDATA with a Notation attached

Java or XML could have get rid of (respectively) char[], internal entities.
They didn't.  And this brings me to ask the Question and my own answer:

Q: does RDF need "literal" e.g. a primitive (non-RDF)resource type?
(My) A: YES.  Because prooved by Computer History (aka Axiom.)
If one needs something more elaborate, one is able to use a data URI
scheme, or some appropriate protocol.  RDF does say:
"The object of a statement can be another resource or a literal"
I can do what I want.  I'm happy.

The term "resource" is just too imprecise.  Should it be RDF-resource,
U-Resource (Universal resource, accessible by the Universe) or
resource in italics?
In brief, I don't see anything wrong in the current M&S that precisely
defines what a RDF-resource is.  The term is just confusing.
Or shall we say "a literal is a primitive resource, and, in this sense,
doesn't belong to what RDF names "resource."

Again, the real question is: do we have the need for "vanilia strings"?

Pierre.
