Ron--

A question about the above part of your response.  Don't we have the
same problem with typing these things whether the things are literals or
data-URIs?  In other words, if we use literals, the RDF example becomes
triples like (sorry if I've got the component orders wrong):

date          "foo.txt"    "2000-9"
arith_problem "foo.txt"    "2000-9"

while if we use URIs, the triples become: 

date          "foo.txt"    urn:data:literal:2001-9
arith_problem "foo.txt"    urn:data:literal:2001-9

Don't we have to separately attach any type information in either case
(presumably, via the schemas that define "date" and "arith_problem"
respectively)?
