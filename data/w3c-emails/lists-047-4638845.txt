Pity to use the term 'Entity' for a syntactic category.

That doesn't conform to usage of 'resource' in the larger W3C world. 
You have defined resources to be pairs of character strings. My 
understanding is that resources are actual entities (not Entities) , 
ie things referred to by expressions, not a syntactic category.
