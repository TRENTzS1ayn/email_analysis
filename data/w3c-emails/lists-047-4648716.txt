Well, you know, there IS no common sense of this term. It was used 
for the first time by Tim B-L about 5 years ago  and has never been 
formally defined. But after extensive enquiries, I have been told 
that the recieved view is that 'resource' is pretty much the same as 
'entity' or 'thing', ie anything whatsoever than can possibly be 
referred to.
So with that understanding:

>- It is not a RDF-resource as defined by the M&S, because a RDF-literal
>has no URI.

that is irrelevant; the issue is whether it could possibly be given a 
URI; and the answer to that question is, yes, it could, since 
anything could.

Amen to that.

I don't think anyone (? certainly not me) wants to eliminate literals 
from RDF. They are obviously useful. But I don't think that was the 
issue we were discussing. Similarly, I don't want to translate or 
automagically morph literals into some kind of URI. And again, I 
don't think we were discussing that. The point was only that there is 
seems to be a contradiction in the spec. On the one hand, it seems to 
say, or strongly imply, that literals are not resources; but 
everything is a resource; which is a contradiction. Our primary goal 
is to clean up the spec, and this seems like an obvious thing that we 
can clean up. While we are at it, we can do a bit of spit and polish 
on 'resource' as well.
