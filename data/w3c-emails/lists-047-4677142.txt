In the interest group[1] Uche Ogbuji suggested that we make 
clarification of the rdf:value property a priority. I strongly 
agree, and while there is a related issue[2] I do not believe 
that it captures the entire problem, which I would summarize as:

RDF M&S 1.0 uses, but does not clearly define the rdf:value 
property. Various uses and meanings have been suggested, but it 
is not clear which one is correct.

I'd like to see this issue addressed soon, as it has an 
important effect on current users of RDF 1.0 and a clearer 
definition would clarify the meaning of their documents, as well 
as stem misuse of this property.
