Issues discussion:


Issue #1: rdfms-literals-as-resources

  A long discussion ensued (see the transcript).
  Scribe's attempt at summary (corrections to any partisan views or
  idiom to rdfcore list, please) follows:

  - On the question "is a literal a resource"?
    Aaron: everything described by RDF is a resource. Literals are
     described. Ergo, Literals are Resources. Furthermore, Aaron
     indicated that some uses of RDF (example given was schema) needed
     to treat literals as resources.
    Pat: by positioning "resource" as meaning "any entity", leaving
     literals out is not reasonable.

    Generally, everyone expressed sympathy with this view.

  - On the question: "is a literal just a data: URI"?
    Opinion here was more divided.
    Jos and Aaron wanted to clarify the relationship between literals
     and data: URIs.
    Dave and Ron both expressed a strong opposition to any "automagical"
     replacements.

  - On the question: "do literals hold some distinguished position
     in the RDF formal model?"
    Opinions are divided as to the role literals currently play.
    Actions arose to look at the impacts of various viewpoints
     on other issues (actions listed below)

  - On the issue of data types on literals:
    Danbri: you can just indirect through an anonymous node.
    Ron: we can _already_ do that.

  Actions arising from the discussion:

  Sergey (and Dan Connolly in his absence) both stressed a pragmatic
   approach: identify the related issues and corner cases and produce
   test cases for these.
  Danbri urged to ask for implementator's experience on rdf-interest.

AP: 2001-07-06#2 (danbri) - write test cases for the RDF schema issues
   that are impacted by this.

AP: 2001-07-06#3 (sergey) - review the other issues and report which are
   impacted by a decision on this.

[The meeting was curtailed at this point due to a lack of time]
