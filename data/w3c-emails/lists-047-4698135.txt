I've updated the N-Triples document at:

   N-Triples
   http://purl.org/net/dajobe/2001/06/ntriples/

   (RCS v1.4)

following comments here and privately and made the following changes:
  Reworked grammar to bring out line basis.
  Remove vertical tab from ws.
  Made eoln be: cr? lf
    -- it can't really be only cr lf since that would make all
       existing ntriples examples illegal
  Added string escaping section
  Removed URI encoding issue
  Split references into history + references sections
  Added section numbers, links
  Updated unicode encoding issues
  Lots of rewording.

There are still some unresolved issues at
  http://purl.org/net/dajobe/2001/06/ntriples/#sec-issues
that I'd appreciate feedback to resolve.

Dave
