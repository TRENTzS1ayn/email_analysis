Based on feedback from Uche, I've changed the wording to:

"Usage of an rdf:ID attribute to identify the subject of a 
description, is
equivalent to usage of an rdf:about attribute with the the '#' 
followed by the URI-encoded form of the content rdf:ID 
attribute."

to be more clear. Please send me your comments on this new wording.
