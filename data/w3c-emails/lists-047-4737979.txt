err... I'm surprised to see comments. Oh well... as
long as it's still line-oriented, that's fine.

But... please don't make the BNF informal by
way of external pointers like...

Nmtoken
            ::=
               See NT-Nmtoken in [XML10-2]
                                                              
 absoluteURI
            ::=
               An absolute URI-reference - see URI-reference in
               RFC 2396 - Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
               Generic Syntax

just define absoluteURI as [^<> ]+. (hmmm... the carat
raises the question of what characters are in the compliment...)
and nmtoken as [a-zA-Z0-9]+. And don't call it nmtoken.


Oh... I see this is called out as an issue:
 |Is Nmtoken an XML one or [A-Za-z0-9]+ as used in
 |    n-triples2kif.pl code and n3-simple.pl ? 

I don't see any reason to use XML's NMTOKEN construct.
It's unnecessarily hairy.
