I believe N-Triples is a line-based format, to allow ease of
processing with existing tools (e.g. awk, sed, perl, ...).

Just having long lines with URIs is a reason, but I don't think a
very good one since it is meant to be processed by machines.  We can
always make shorter URIs in the examples.

Depends on the "what is an RDF literal" question.  When we address
that, and if we make changes, we can amend or extend N-Triples.

Re naming: I'm sticking with N-Triples since it stands out better
than n-triples, ntriples, n3-triples, n-triple etc.
