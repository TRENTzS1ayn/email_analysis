The problem with this is that it then becomes impossible to provide a 
single coherent model theory. log:forSome is a good example, in fact. 
If that means what it apparently is supposed to mean, then any triple 
using it cannot be interpreted according to the terms used in the RDF 
M&S, since the latter claims that a triple indicates a relation holds 
between two things; but log:forSome is a quantifier, which is not a 
relation. The intended meaning breaks the earlier semantic model.

I would argue in the opposite direction. If we want to incorporate 
expressions which have special meanings, then provide syntactic 
markers for them, so that a semantics has some handles to attach 
itself to.
