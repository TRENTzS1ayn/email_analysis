:But further to 2.; while we should not give literals URI's , they are
:nevertheless resources. Thats all we need to say.

Ok, so one hand I see the use of the term 'resource' in what I
affectionately call mumbo jumbo; that would include things we
call Literals in RDF. On the other hand I see the term used
as things to be described in RDF via the use of URIs; that does
not include Literals. Why don't we just have separate terms, say,
'entity' as you do and then 'Resource' for entities denoted
by a URI? That way Literals can be entities but not Resources.
The terms are arbitrary enough: though it seems less expensive
to change the mumbo usage of 'resource' to 'entity' in the M&S
document, than search and replace through the standing body of
RDF on the web.
