I would be happy with that, but I didn't think that the terms were 
arbitrary, or that it was in our power to redefine terms like 
'resource'.  I was just reporting on what seems to be the common 
usage in W3C circles.

It may well be that people have been careless in not distinguishing 
between 'having a URI' and 'being the kind of thing that could 
possibly have a URI', or that some people mean one of these and other 
people mean the other. But if so, then this just means that people 
are confused, and that someone is going to have to change their usage 
if we are all going to understand one another. I don't really care 
who does the changing, but I do care that we aren't confused.

PS. There is a problem with saying that something is a different kind 
of thing when it is named by a URI; this means that a thing's 
ontological status changes when someone invents a name. So a certain 
star in a distant galalaxy might suddenly become a resource just 
because some astronomer in China puts up something on a website. I 
guess I find this uncomfortable.
