If a literal constant is just a value from {"urn:data:literal:",
Unicode*} as suggested in

should not need an additional identifier.

I think we need a glossary like that at some point! Mine is:

entity (constant) = anything identifiable
resource (constant) = URI, name, referring expression
literal (constant) = like yours
