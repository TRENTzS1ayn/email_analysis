I agree wholeheartedly.


:PS. There is a problem with saying that something is a different kind
:of thing when it is named by a URI; this means that a thing's
:ontological status changes when someone invents a name. So a certain
:star in a distant galalaxy might suddenly become a resource just
:because some astronomer in China puts up something on a website. I
:guess I find this uncomfortable.

Would you be saying maybe that instead of implying things change
because we in effect name them, we should say that things don't
change (or say nothing), but in RDF some things have names (URIs)
in order that we can usefully describe them.
