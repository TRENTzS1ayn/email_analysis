Hey - don't shoot the messenger.  I just thought it would be useful to
know what m&s says on the subject.  There's some more:

  As defined by XML, the character repertoire of an RDF string is
  ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO10646]. An actual RDF string, whether in an XML document
  or in some other representation of the RDF data model, may be stored using
  a direct encoding of ISO/IEC 10646 or an encoding that can be mapped to 
  ISO/IEC 10646. Language tagging is part of the string value; it is 
  applied to sequences of characters within an RDF string and does not have
  an explicit manifestation in the data model.
