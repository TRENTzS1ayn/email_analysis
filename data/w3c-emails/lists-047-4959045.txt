I think that's clearly at odds with RFC2396 (which seems the nearest thing 
we have to a universally accepted starting point for defining these things):

[RFC 2396, section 1.1]:

       Resource
          A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar
          examples include an electronic document, an image, a service
          (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a
          collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network
          "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
          books in a library can also be considered resources.

etc.
