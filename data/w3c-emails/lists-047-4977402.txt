FWIW, I think this is broken and will require some kind of fix (as opposed 
to clarification).  I'm agnostic about the nature of the fix.

The reason I think it is broken is that I think that RDF applications 
cannot be required to operate on anything other than that which appears in 
the "data model".  Thus, I think that if xml:lang MAY be significant then 
it MUST appear in the "data model".
