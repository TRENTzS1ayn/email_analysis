Here's some questions (with proposed answers) to get us thinking 
about rdfms-graph. I'm also curious whether there are other 
questions that should be considered part of the resolution -- 
the issue description isn't really enough for me to tell.

1) Does an RDF graph have a URI?

It is a Resource, and it can. M&S does not define a specific one.

2) Is an RDF graph a set or a bag?

A set, as it has conjunctive assertion semantics, or whatever 
they're called:
(A && A) => (A)

3) Can a node exist in a graph without any properties?

Yes. This is indicated in the current XML syntax with an empty 
Description element.

Do people disagree and/or think there are other questions that 
need to be answered?
