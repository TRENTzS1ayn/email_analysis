Two problems:

1. By using the above approach you are effectively building on (and
endorsing) anonymous nodes, and the rdf:value property. I don't think we
have a agreed understanding on those two things yet.

2. Applications cannot just ignore xml:lang. Instead, the apps must deal
with a special case of identifying the "anonymous" node and tracing its
rdf:value property.
