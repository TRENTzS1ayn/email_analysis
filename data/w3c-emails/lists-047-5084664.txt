Regarding the aspect of our charter relating purely to revision of
the Model and Syntax REC, I agree. However one might argue that we have a
little more room to move since we also chartered to complete our work on
the (as yet unfinalised) RDF Schema document. This includes consideration
of a better approach to typing of literal strings in the light of XML
Schema and developments in the XML world that weren't available in 1998.

In my view the availability of a widely implemented and understood
approach to structuring of XML literals would help us decide whether to
take a liberal or strict view of our charted role. Right now I don't see
much implemented in this area so am correspondingly inclined towards
conservatism.
