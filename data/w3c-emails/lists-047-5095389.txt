I completely agree. This seems to be very common in
implementations, we should make it clear.

I sort of agree. It would be nice, but I don't think it is
mandatory. If we assume that the serialization of RDF is
intended to move models between systems, the capability is
already there to provide the URIs of all items deemed
important. Forcing generated IDs to follow a particular scheme
would make comparing models much easier, but there are some
thorny issues around identity that we would have to tackle.

I'd be happy with a non-normative convention suggesting how
the IDs should be generated. I don't want it to be a MUST
in the clarified spec.
