Aaron,

See also TimBL's thoughts on this topic:

   http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/InterpretationProperties.html

in which he argues that language should be represented as a property whose 
value is the literal concerned; e.g.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
          xmlns:play="http://example.org/play#"
          xmlns:lang="http://example.org/lang#">
   <rdf:description>
     <rdf:type>http://www.people.org/types#person</rdf:type>
     <play:name>
        <lang:fi>Ora Yrj? Uolevi Lassila</lang:fi>
     </play:name>
     <play:mailbox>ora.lassila@research.nokia.com</play:mailbox>
     <play:homePage>http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila/</play:homePage>
   </rdf:description>
</rdf:RDF>

This is Tim's section 3 example, tweaked to pass parsing by the online 
SirPAC validator (http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/).  Having 
done this, it becomes clearer that the language tag is being represented 
here as a data type (rdf:type), NOT as a property relating the name and the 
literal string which is what the associated text says.

Tim... the above seems more akin to your subsequent comments about 
datatypes as interpretation properties, but still doesn't seem to capture 
the idea of "interpretation property" as described.  Did you really mean this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
          xmlns:play="http://example.org/play#"
          xmlns:lang="http://example.org/lang#">
   <rdf:description>
     <rdf:type>http://www.people.org/types#person</rdf:type>
     <play:name>
        <rdf:description>
          <lang:fi>Ora Yrj? Uolevi Lassila</lang:fi>
        </rdf:description>
     </play:name>
     <play:mailbox>ora.lassila@research.nokia.com</play:mailbox>
     <play:homePage>http://www.w3.org/People/Lassila/</play:homePage>
   </rdf:description>
</rdf:RDF>
