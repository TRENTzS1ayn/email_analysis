based on what we have testcased at
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/#Problem
I completely agree with you and I really
wonder how else we could model/infer
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/tpoint-result.n3 or
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/tpoint-all.n3
(which are not yet equivalent, but that's
another challenge)
