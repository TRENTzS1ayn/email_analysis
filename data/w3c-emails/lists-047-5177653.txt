A quick note to bookmark a point:

emitting the 'same' invented-URIs for un-named resource mentions is
risky: if we make the generated ID purely a function of the bag-of-bytes
XML document we could get situations where relative URIs are used to
mention _different_ resources, but result in a parser emitting the same
generated ID. I don't have time to cook up an example right here, but for
eg. <foo rdf:resource="../index.html"/> in different contexts means
something different, so an rdf/xml doc including that might be mentioning
a different pair of resources.
