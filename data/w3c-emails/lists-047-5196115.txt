I agree.  I'm not sure anything more needs to be said.  Any such URI is not 
part of the abstract syntax/model.

Again, I agree.  I'm not sure anything more needs to be said.

Here, I disagree:  there is no obvious way to represent an isolated node in 
an abstract syntax/model based on triples.  I think an empty <Description> 
adds nothing to the semantics so should not appear in the abstract 
syntax/model.
