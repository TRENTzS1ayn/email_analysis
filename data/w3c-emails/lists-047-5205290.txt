I don't.

Dan,

I think you've made a strong case for variables in query expressions.  I 
also think that Pat has argued fairly convincingly that this is logically 
equivalent to Skolemization -- i.e. substitution of a unique genId.  I 
think these are important issues, but...

My main concern is that this is not a clarification of RDF 1.0, but a 
significant extension of it.

Therefore, I ask:

(a) is there any respect in which my proposal contradicts M&S 1.0?

and/or

(b) can you point to ways in which M&S 1.0 supports your proposal to have 
special treatment of anonymous resources in the RDF model?

and/or

(c) do you think you have a compelling case for *changing* RDF 1.0 now 
rather than leaving this issue to be addressed in RDF 2.0?
