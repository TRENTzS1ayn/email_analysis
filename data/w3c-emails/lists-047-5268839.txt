I'd like to see the agenda explicitly reflect reception of the attached
message (and referenced paper) and that we have an action item to deal
with it.

Now that the RDF Core Working group has started its activities, the
"joint committee" who has designed DAML+OIL has written a document that
describes which areas of RDF and RDF Schema need attention based on our
experiences with defining DAML+OIL as an extension of RDF Schema. 

You can find the document at 
http://www.daml.org/2001/07/RDFS-DAML+OIL-coordination.html

On behalf of the "joint committee",

Frank van Harmelen.
