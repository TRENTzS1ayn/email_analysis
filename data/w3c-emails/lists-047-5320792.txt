Brian--

I don't have a problem with not spending a whole lot of time discussing
this (or at least its technical content) tomorrow.  I just want to make
sure we "officially receive it" and (hopefully) make some sort of
decision on how we're going to deal with the technical issues (even if
that's only an action item for future work).
