OK, the place we are mismatched is, not surprisingly, the 
relationship between "URI" and "resource". I understand "resource" to 
mean a thing; you understand it to mean a name. I think URI's 
*denote* resources; you think resources *are* URIs.  (Others, I 
gather, think that URI's are something like the address of a 
resource.)

We need to get this issue resolved or we will just sink ever deeper 
into terminological quicksand. Since these terms belong to the W3C, 
maybe we can appeal to them for a ruling on this question? Anyone out 
there who claims to know what the answer is??
