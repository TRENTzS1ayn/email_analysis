Actually I am beginning to wonder myself why I was uncomfortable with 
the notion. Any interpretation will need to 'choose' some universe, 
and of course that has to include everything that is named (so that 
the name has something to denote) but it neednt include everything 
there 'really' is, so as long as we allow that there *may* be some 
unnamed things in the universe, I guess my worry goes away (or can be 
safely relegated to the realms of metaphysical worries.)
