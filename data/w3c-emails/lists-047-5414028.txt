?? That reads like an oxymoron to me. How can one state anonymity 
without referring to the thing in question, thereby rendering it not 
anonymous?

Than it's not a genid. The global uniqueness of the token (not type) 
is part of what makes the genid idea work, seems to me. If my parser 
has to use the same id as your parser, then why not just include that 
id in the syntax?
