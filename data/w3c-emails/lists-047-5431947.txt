Thank you for raising this, which should have been mentioned explicitly in 
my summary.

I overlooked this because I had it in mind that this was really just a 
syntactic issue, adequately addressed by allocation of a unique 
identifier.  But, as you say, it is something that is explicitly discussed 
in M&S.

However, it is not clear to me that this is a requirement on the abstract 
syntax:  the graph (graphical representation) that you mentioned is, in my 
view, another possible surface syntax for RDF, and not one which is really 
amenable to being used as a basis for attaching semantics.  Thus, I think 
it is reasonable to view this case as a counterpart to the XML syntax for 
an anynomous resource, where the user may, as a convenience, omit any form 
of identification of the resource.

If a parser can then allocate a unique identifier for this resource, there 
is no need to represent this specially in the abstract syntax.  This seems 
to me to be the same as happens in Skolemization (absent universal 
quantification), which is consistent with interpretation as existentially 
quantified.

I think this is all consistent with what you say...

If we can all agree that queries don't figure (directly) in the problem to 
be addressed, then that matter can be deferred, then we can focus on the 
abstract syntax representation of the existential quantification:
   (a) by some distinct representation of the existentially quantified 
resource;  a name with localized scope seems to be a popular option.
   (b) by generation of a unique URI -- effectively Skolemization
which are the same as your cases (a) and (b) above.

For completeness:  nobody, to my knowledge, has argued for changing the 
spec per your (c).

With (b) there is the problem of generating a unique identifier, mentioned 
previously.

I can appreciate the appeal (a), but I think it does bring some significant 
complications of its own:  how to avoid "interference" between such 
resources when RDF graphs are combined.  Two approaches come to mind:

(1) selective update of identifiers so that they remain unique in the 
enlarged graph

(2) explicit representation of the scope of each identifier

Maybe there are others?

...

Finally, I note that DanC has claimed that cases (a) and (b) don't always 
represent the same information.  In an off-list message, Pat Hayes gave an 
assessment of this which I found particularly clear, and would like to 
repeat here (with permission):
