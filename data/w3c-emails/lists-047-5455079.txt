I agree except with the last sentence. The abstract syntax does not 
exclude URIs that may happen to denote an RDF graph, so we need to 
say that it means when they do occur. I think we can simply be 
agnostic about it.

The fact that it has this semantics doesn't mean that it is a set. 
Logical expressions are not sets, but (and A A ) still implies A and 
vice versa. The issue is whether we want to say that an RDF graph 
cannot contain two copies of the same triple, not what we interpret 
those triples to be saying. I would urge that it would be harmless to 
let them be bags, and insisting that they are sets places an 
unnecessary burden on a parser (which would need to remove all 
duplications whenever it merged two graphs), so let them be bags.

As a matter of general methodology, the question to ask is whether 
allowing it would cause any harm. I can't see any harm, so would opt 
for not forbidding it.
