Sure, but
(1) they are the things, not the names that, er, identify them
(2) it isnt absolutely clear what 'identify' means, but many people 
seem to think that it means 'denote'
(3) It isnt clear whether being a resource means actually having a 
URI, or only being the kind of thing that could possibly have a URI, 
ie anything at all; your -iable/ied contrast.

misunderstandings about these issues seem to get in the way of just 
about every 'semantic webbish' discussion.
