Brian,

I completely agree that many of the modeling issues are interdependent.
The approach I would suggest is to try to explore different, but
self-contained candidates for the RDF model/a.s., and to see how much of
the existing spec and applications would be affected by favoring one or
the other approach. Each approach should explicitly address the issues
to be resolved. I slightly revised the proposal that I made some time
ago and made it available at

http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/formal-model.txt

As far as I remember, Graham posted another proposal last month on the
list. We could definitely use a couple of more starting points.

Think so.
