2nded! (or 3rd-ed...).

This business seems to be at the heart of much of the murkiness around RDF.

I'm not sure we'll ever have a crisp answer to the question "by virtue of
what social/legal event does a URI string come to denote some entity",
since generations have failed before us with similar questions. But
there's still plenty of room for greater clarity.

Regarding identified vs identifiable, I much prefer the latter (since
anything is identifiable) as it removes us from having to seek answers to
inpossible questions such as the one above.
