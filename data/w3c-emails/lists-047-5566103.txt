Agreed. Note that it brings the Subject into the RDF graph... the lack of
arcs itself can be meaningful.

I agree except with the last sentence. The abstract syntax does not
exclude URIs that may happen to denote an RDF graph, so we need to
say that it means when they do occur. I think we can simply be
agnostic about it.

The fact that it has this semantics doesn't mean that it is a set.
Logical expressions are not sets, but (and A A ) still implies A and
vice versa. The issue is whether we want to say that an RDF graph
cannot contain two copies of the same triple, not what we interpret
those triples to be saying. I would urge that it would be harmless to
let them be bags, and insisting that they are sets places an
unnecessary burden on a parser (which would need to remove all
duplications whenever it merged two graphs), so let them be bags.

As a matter of general methodology, the question to ask is whether
allowing it would cause any harm. I can't see any harm, so would opt
for not forbidding it.
