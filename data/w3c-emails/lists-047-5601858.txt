Yes. That is what I would use quotation for: "foo" means those three 
characters in that order. OK, so <data:,  .....  > is a way of 
quoting, thanks for the clarification.

However, maybe I was wrong, but I have been assuming that 'literal' 
referred not only to <data:..> but also to things like <string:..> 
and <integer:....>, ie data types more generally (??). If so, I think 
it wouldnt be correct to say that all of these only denote 
themsleves, eg something labelling an integer wouldn't actually be an 
integer.
