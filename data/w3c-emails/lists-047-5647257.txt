Well, while the current M&S doesn't deal with data-typing 
(AFAIK), "data:" URIs do provide that function. It uses a MIME 
type to define the type of the data. For example:

<data:literal/integer:10>
<data:literal/string:foo>

But what makes you think that literal refers to these concepts? 
I don't see anything like that in the spec.
