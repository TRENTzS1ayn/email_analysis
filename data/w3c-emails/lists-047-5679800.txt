There has been a message [1] on rdf interest pointing out that some of our
early test cases don't quite work right because they were done before we
had the directory structure set up, e.g. some use xml:base.

Please could I ask those with such test cases to update them and make sure
they are in the test directory.  Thanks.

Brian
