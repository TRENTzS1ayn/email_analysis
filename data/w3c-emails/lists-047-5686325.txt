Jeremy Carroll in

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Jul/0041.html

has raised some test cases we ought to clarify:

  <rdf:Description rdf:Description="foo"/>

  <rdf:Description>
    <rdf:Description>foo</rdf:Description>
  </rdf:Description>

  <rdf:Description>
    <rdf:Bag>foobar</rdf:Bag>
  </rdf:Description>

  <rdf:Description rdf:aboutEachPrefix="foo"/>
    <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>
  </rdf:Description>

Also, he is questioning our resolution of:

  <rdf:_1>
    <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>
  </rdf:_1>

These are basically about what to do with names that are 'recognised'
as being part of the RDF namespace but appear out of context.  I'll
add this as a new issue to the list.  We probably ought to try to
give it some attention as it has been raised on rdf-interest.
