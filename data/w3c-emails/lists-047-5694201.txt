On such issues I find Dave Beckett's reference[1] a helpful 
resource, especially the "Has defined meaning as an Element" and 
"Has defined meaning as ab Attribute" sections. I'm tempted to 
declare everything that falls out of context illegal, if only so 
that we have extreme clarity on what an RDF document is.

While this is an extra burden on implementers, I think it is a 
worthwhile one. The alternative seems to be confusion and 
problems with interoperability.
