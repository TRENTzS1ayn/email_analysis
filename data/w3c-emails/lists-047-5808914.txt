It's difficult to meet opposing requirements. I was asked by 
Eric Miller to use Dan Connolly's meeting report tools (which I 
personally think are an excellent approach) which automatically 
convert RDF minutes into HTML. I do not feel it is a valuable 
use of my time to hand-convert the minutes into another format.

However, I can point you to a web service I have built to create 
a textual version of any HTML page:

http://swartzfam.com/aaron/textify.tcl?url=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/
www-archive/2001Jul/att-0012/01-rdfc13Jul.html

I will be sure to include a textified version when I send out 
the corrected minutes.
