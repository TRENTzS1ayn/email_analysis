Another data: point... to get literal/integer recognized as a MIME type 
would require a new IETF standards-track RFC, something that I don't think 
would be easily achieved for that particular idea.  A MIME subtype 
registration might give you something like:

     <data:text/literal-integer,10>

but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.
