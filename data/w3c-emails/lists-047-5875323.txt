I think I was a bit sloppy there -- I meant to say they don't have a 
distinguished or required place in the abstract syntax -- which I think is 
consistent with what you say.

Hmmm... I think this is a design choice that could go either way, each of 
which puts some kind of constraint on the parser:

Bag - requires that the parser accurately create a separate copy of each 
triple defined by the input;  this might be a burden for some 
implementations -- e.g. a relational database that uses the 3 triple 
components as the primary key in a table.

Set - requires that the parser detects duplicates, as you say.

In defining the abstract syntax, I think we are trying to capture something 
of the *intent* (read "meaning") of the RDF language used, rather than to 
prescribe a particular implementation.  Calling an RDF graph a "set" seems 
to more closely reflect the intent.

One might say it doesn't matter which it is (set or bag), and in a sense 
that would be true.  But then we lose a small practical benefit of the 
approach this group has been followings, viz. to prescribe a collection of 
triples that correspond to any RDF graph.

In defining and formalizing N-triples, I think the Bag approach of not 
forbidding duplicates is right, because that means the semantics is 
explicitly defined by the formalism.  In defining the mapping from RDF/XML 
to N-triples, the choice is less clear (to me).

So I'll offer a test case:

<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
          xmlns:ex="http//example.org/#">
   <rdf:Description about="http://example.org/#Subject" >
     <ex:property>Value</ex:property>
   </rdf:Description>
   <rdf:Description about="http://example.org/#Subject" >
     <ex:property>Value</ex:property>
   </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

For which, SiRPAC says the triples are:

<http://example.org/#Subject> <http//example.org/#property> "Value" .
<http://example.org/#Subject> <http//example.org/#property> "Value" .

Similarly, the graph displayed has two identical arcs.

This seems to be at odds with RDFM&S, section 5, (P162) which says "There 
is a set called Statements, each element of which is a triple of the form ...":

The "harm" I see is that (a) not forbidding would seem to suggest a 
requirement to represent it, and (b) it's not clear to me how one would 
represent (in N-triples) a node on its own.  Also, I think a node not part 
of a property has no "meaning", so allowing this would seem to introduce 
spurious alternatives for the same semantics.  It seems simpler to just 
ignore isolated nodes at the abstract syntax level.
