I think we should be wary about going down the road of specifying an 
interpretation for non-valid RDF syntax.

Thus, I think the main issue here is to decide whether or not they are 
reasonably treated as valid RDF.

I have a concern about rdf:Description used as a property:  it's not clear 
to me that the URI corresponding to rdf:Description should be interpreted 
as a class, so it's appearance in

   <rdf:Description>
     <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>
   </rdf:Description>

would be a syntactic way of saying "there is a resource of unknown type...".

Consider:

   <rdf:Description about="http://example.org/res">
     <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>
   </rdf:Description>

and

   <rdfs:Resource about="http://example.org/res">
     <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>
   </rdfs:Resource>

When RDF schema is taken into account, I think these both say the same 
thing, and in particular that the resource "http://example.org/res" has an 
rdf:type of rdfs:Resource.  (I thought the "equivalence" of rdf:Description 
and rdfs:Resource had been noted as an issue, but I don't see it.  See 
also: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Jan/0009.html)

In the case of rdf:Bag, I don't know if we need to forbid anyone treating 
it as a property, though it doesn't seem to be an immediately helpful idea.
