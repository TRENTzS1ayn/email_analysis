per the registration page:

[[
Hotel Requirements. Note Actual reservations must still be made by the 
individual with the hotel (see the logistics page). The information below 
is a redundant source of information for the meeting planners.
]]

This is reductant information to help manage various logistics and help the 
meeting planners.  If you're planning on staying at the conference hotel, 
select 'require' on this form.  If not, select 'do not required'.  There is 
no need to go back and update this form after you reserve a hotel room.
