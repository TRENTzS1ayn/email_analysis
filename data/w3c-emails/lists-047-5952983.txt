Consider the same bag-of-bytes document on different days (years). Nothing
licenses the inference that the anonymously mentioned resource in 1999
and 2001 publications of the document are the same.

<s:Document rdf:about="this.html">
<s:editor>
  <wn:Person>
   <foaf:mbox rdf:resource="mailto:webmaster@this.example.com"/>
   <rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="../../webmaster-profile.xrdf"/>
  </wn:Person>
</s:editor>
</s:Document>


I don't see any reason for us to presume that the anonymously-mentioned
instance of wn:Person in two occurances of this document must be
identical when the rdf/xml bytes are identical and the base URIs are
identical. Actually since i've used 'foaf:mbox'[1] (which is a daml unique
property) one could find evidence to support this, but nothing at the
vanilla RDF level does).
