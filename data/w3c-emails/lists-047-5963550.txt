The use case I have in mind is a metadata repository where new resources
are constantly being added, but they may be 'tagged' at a later time. In
this case, an empty

<rdf:description about="urn:myscheme:some_object_id">
</rdf:description>

would indicate that the resource urn:myscheme:some_object_id is a part of
the current domain of discourse, but nothing has been said about it. So the
resource is flagged as one that needs someone to meta-tag it. Of course,
there are many other ways to solve this such as meta-meta info to indicate
the tagging information, but this isn't reason enough to explicitly
disallow it...

cheers,

Really?

That (i.e. "the lack of arcs itself can be meaningful") goes against my
understanding of RDF.
