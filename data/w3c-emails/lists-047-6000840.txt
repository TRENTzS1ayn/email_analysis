Eric,

You kindly provided a use case for this issue.

So far we have concluded that M&S states that language is
considered to be 'part of' a literal.

Of the other two use cases we have, we have concluded that the one
provided by Jan Grant can be supported using xml:lang as described
in M&S.  The other provided by Martyn uses a completely different
mechanism for modelling language and the M&S use of xml:lang is
neither help nor hindrance.

I took an action at the telecon to ask you whether xml:lang
as described in M&S is adequate or any help for solving the 
use case you supplied.  Do you have a view on this?

Brian
