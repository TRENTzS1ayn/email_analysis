Steve,

Your approach seems entirely reasonable to me as an application design, but 
I'm not sure that it's something we want to be forced to standardize, which 
I fear may be the result of allowing it in the abstract RDF syntax.  E.g. 
when exchanging RDF between systems (the reason for standardization), do we 
really want to specify that the existence of a node, without properties, is 
significant?  If so, we must define the significance, and that looks 
awkward to me.

I suppose I'm not arguing to prohibit property-less nodes so much as saying 
I don't think we should try to define them as part of a standard.  IMO, the 
abstract syntax and associated semantics where such things appear is 
intended to unambiguously specify the intent of what we do define, not to 
prohibit (or say anything about) what we don't define.
