On reflection, that's not quite right...  I think it's closer to say that 
an abstract syntax captures the essential forms of a language, without 
necessarily providing detailed rules for recognition of wffs.  This group 
has decided to use N-triples as the basis for its abstract syntax, in which 
case it does define a specific form of wff, but I don't think this is 
necessarily true of all abstract syntax.

Although I've often heard the term used, and think I have a feel for what 
it means, I don't believe I've ever seen a specific definition of "abstract 
syntax".
