Yup.

Its not as easy as that.  Remember the charter.  We are not allowed
to change things just because we would have done it differently.

We have estblished (I claim) that the use of xml:lang in M&S is not
broken (there are several implemenations).  We have also established
that it is useful (Jan's use case).  That makes it a bit tricky to
justify changing it.

On what grounds are you proposing to justify a change.

I'd rather see further analysis of pros and cons before we get to
that.

Hardly rational and scientific.  My excuse is it was getting late
after a long day.
