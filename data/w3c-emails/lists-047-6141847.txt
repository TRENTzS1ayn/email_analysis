Excellent.  Are you also up for MusicBrainz?

I'm open minded if this is a good idea or not.  I had a couple of
things in mind.  One was to break the day up a bit, provide a bit
of light relief.  Another was just to share cool stuff - the
short presentations have been very successful at recent events
I've attended.  Another was just to keep reminding us of
what folks are doing with this stuff as debate the intricacies of
skolem functions and the like.

I'd like to be as well prepared as possible, though new issues may
emerge on the day.

If folks are up for this, the idea was to call for volunteers.
