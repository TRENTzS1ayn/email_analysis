Actually, I think that is a relatively painless way of interpreting nodes 
without properties (one that I hadn't thought of).

The "awkwardness" to which I refer is:

(a) how is one to represent such a node in N-triples?  Currently, there's 
no obvious way (apart from what you suggest above).

(b) having selected an N-triples representation, some kind of semantics 
must be defined -- it seems rather pointless to take special steps to 
define a form and then say it adds nothing to the meaning.

That said, I think your suggestion above quite neatly addresses both 
concerns (assuming that semantics for any triple of the form:

    <foo> rdf:type <bar> .

must be defined).
