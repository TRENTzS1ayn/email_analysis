Another possible disadvantage?:  not all literals are in some language.  It 
doesn't really make sense to specify a language for, say, a decimal number 
or a MIME type string.  Thus, we have some literals whose interpretation is 
dependent on an associated language attribute, and others whose 
interpretation may depend on other factors.
