What does this RDF actually mean?  What statement does it make?  I think 
it's something like:

    There may exist an X such that:
      Someone wants to buy X AND
      There exists a Y such that:
        X :description Y AND
        Y :product :roses AND
        There exists a Z such that:
          Y :quantity Z AND
          Z :units :kg AND
          Z :minValue "100".

There seems to me to be no way of rendering this statement using just 
existential quantification.

This may be a compelling use-case, but I don't see any sanction for this 
usage in M&S 1.0, and as such would suggest it be deferred to V2.0.

I think this case can be expressed adequately using just existential 
quantification

    There exists an X such that:
      X is for sale AND
      There exists a Y such that:
        X :description Y AND
        Y :product :roses AND
        There exists a Z such that:
          Y :quantity Z AND
          Z :units :kg AND
          Z :maxValue "500".

In this case, I think the meaning can be conveyed using either of the 
approaches we have discussed on the list and in the last teleconference [1].

I would refer to Pat's explanation, copied in [1].  Skolemization seems to 
work just fine here.

I still have not heard a argument that this is sanctioned by the current 
M&S 1.0.  If this use-case is to be captured, I think the argument for it 
needs to be made.

Yes, I think so.

[1] My response to [2], and apparent convergence on two approaches to 
handling anonymous resources; viz. Skolemization/genid, and scoped 
variables.

[2] Frank argues that the main goal sanctioned by M&S is statements about 
resources that exist but which are not named:
