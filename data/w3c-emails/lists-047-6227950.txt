Aaron,

I guess all you propose is possible, and reasonable.

When I briefly studied the denotational semantics of programming languages 
many years ago (a topic I feel I understand better now than I did then ;-), 
which was a kind of model theory, I recall that small additions to the 
language whose semantics were being defined could result in a 
disproportionate increase in the semantic descriptions of expressions in 
that language.  My resistance here is based on my perception of what will 
lead to simpler semantics for RDF.

I guess the model theory will tell.
