Steve,

I think I broadly agree with what you say.  My term "awkward" isn't meant 
to imply problematic, or even difficult.  My purpose of engagement here is 
based on:
(a) my perception that representing isolated nodes adds some complexity 
(though maybe not very much), and
(b) questioning whether there is any real purpose in adding this small 
extra complexity to RDF.

That said, Aaaron's proposal to represent isolated nodes as ( <foo> 
rdf:type rdfs:Resource ) overcomes those objections (but introduces another 
because it would make the RDF core dependent on a schema definition, viz 
rdfs:Resource).

You also say:
>"An RDF Subject that does not have any associated Properties corresponds to
>a disconnected node in a graph. The value of the about/ID attribute of this
>element is the label of the disconnected node."

With which I'd pick a nit:

My take on the current M&S is that the concept of "an RDF Subject" is 
meaningful only in the context of a property -- a "Subject" doesn't exist 
in isolation.  A resource can be any or all of Subject, Object or Property 
depending on how it is used.

(This isn't affected by your rewording in a different message.)
