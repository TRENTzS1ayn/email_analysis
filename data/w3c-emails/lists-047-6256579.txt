I don't think the problem is with FOL, but with the EC subset that RDF is 
presumed (by me, at least) to reflect.

In particular, the 'buyer advertisement' case that you relayed to us, which 
I have claimed is problematic to represent according to RDF M&S 1.0, I 
think probably can be captured adequately with FOL (allowing universal 
quantification as well as existential).  Roughly:

   For all X:
     ( X satisfies some conditions ) =>
       (some buyer wishes to purchase X)
