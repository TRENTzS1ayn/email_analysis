[Responding as a participant, not as part of my action to summarize...]

I broadly follow most of what you said.  One point of disagreement I have 
is with this:

At 05:54 PM 7/17/01 -0400, you wrote:

You say "the graph diagrams should show *generated* URIs".  I don't believe 
this is an inevitable conclusion.  My view is that the graph diagrams are 
another presentation format on a par with the XML serialization, and, as 
such, omitting the URIs is equally legitimate here.

However, I'll also note that this is a side issue.  The real issue would 
seem to be the N-triple representation, and this approach suggests that 
generated URIs would be needed in the N-triple representation.
