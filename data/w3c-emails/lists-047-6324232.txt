I only agree with this up to a point.  It depends on what you're using 
the "presentation format" for.  To the extent that the presentation 
format is being used for *input*, I agree that the URIs should be 
omitted (since you're not inputting them).  That's the way I'm viewing 
most of the XML examples in the M&S.  If someone were to build a 
graphical input tool for RDF, where you could input the graphs directly, 
I'd also see omitting the URIs in those instances as well.  However, 
where you were using the presentation format to display output (what 
actually got produced), it seems to me you'd display generated URIs as 
well (as SirPac does).  I view the graphs in the M&S as being primarily 
visual aids, and as such I think it would be clearer to explicitly show 
generated URIs, as helping to convey the idea that that is what will 
happen.

Well, *some* identifier is needed in the N-triple representation, 
possibly generated URIs (this is one of the choices).
