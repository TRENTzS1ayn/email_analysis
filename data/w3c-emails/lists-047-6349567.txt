As a data point it would be interesting to know how
current implementations deal with empty Description
elements.  SiRPAC generates zero triples for the
following test cases:

 <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:Description/>
 </rdf:RDF>

 <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:Description></rdf:Description>
 </rdf:RDF>

 <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:Description about="some_uri"></rdf:Description>
 </rdf:RDF>

I don't see anything in the spec that says whether this behavior
is correct or not.
