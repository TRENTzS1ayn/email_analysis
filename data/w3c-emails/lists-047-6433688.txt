Random uuids won't meet the requirement I understand you're after,
which is that different parsers would compute the same URI for
anonymous nodes given the same RDF input.

Random uuids are, effectively, skolem constants, which see
other thread about whether reducing existentially quantified
variables to skolem constants is OK or not. (my position: not).

I've noodled on the approach of naming things based on their
XML element position, and I've convinced myself that won't
work either. I don't have a proof that there's no such algorithm,
but I'm not likely to spend more time thinking about it until
somebody makes a concrete suggestion (i.e. running code)
of an algorithm that works.

I'm pretty sure that, at a minimum, it requires the sort
of tricks involved in putting a signature inside a signed
document.
