I actually have the same problem

To get familiar with jigedit, we first created
http://jigedit.w3.org/josderoo/WWW/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr/
because we found in http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/
  Issue rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr: Clarify the interpretation of an ID attribute in the
  propertyElt production within a Description element with a distributive referrant.
but then we saw that is was linked from the Model and Syntax Issues as
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr
and thought that was the identifier, so we then created
http://jigedit.w3.org/josderoo/WWW/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr/
and we are not succeeding in removing directories

> We really need some of these fixed

agreed
