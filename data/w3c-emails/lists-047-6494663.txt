I understand that, sorry if it seemed I was asking questions 
directly of you, but instead I meant to use you as a gateway to 
understand more background about the example.

I'd suggest that it might be better to model this in a way that 
made this more clear, such as:

<#anon12345> a :QueryForService .

or some such. In other words, I feel that they are depending on 
unspecified semantics of anonymous resources, which explicit 
statements would make much clearer.

Heh, it identifies one "conceptual mapping" perhaps, but that 
can map to other things. Otherwise lists wouldn't make much 
sense, now would they?

Pat Hayes has said repeatedly that one can pretty much only 
infer from an existential the same things they could from a 
specific identifier. Obviously, he has studied this more than I 
have, but it seems to me that people are asking anonymous nodes 
to mean more than they really do.

Clearly, whatever way we decide, it's important to clarify this,
