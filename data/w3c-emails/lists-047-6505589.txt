I agree with your last statement (for some value of "really do mean", since 
that's for us collectively to define).

I think the other part of Pat's position here is that when the variable is 
used in the query role (i.e. "does something satisfying <foo> exist?" or 
"Looking for something that satisfies <foo>"), it is NOT being used as an 
existential but (in some sense) as a universally quantified value.
