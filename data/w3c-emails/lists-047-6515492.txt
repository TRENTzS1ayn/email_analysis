Good point.  This is how the use case came to me and I just passed it
straight on.  I should have included a translation.  Here is one now:

#advert123 :role "buyer"; 
           :description [:product :roses; 
                         :quantity [:units :kg; :minValue "100"]].

translates to:

<#advert123> <foo:role>        "buyer" .
<#advert123> <foo:description> _:service .
_:service    <foo:product>     <foo:roses> .
_:service    <foo:quantity>    _:q .
_:q          <foo:units>       <foo:kg> .
_:q          <foo:minValue>    "100" .

i.e this is advert placed by a purchaser who wishes to buy roses in
minimum quantities of 100.

and

#advert456 :role "seller"; 
           :description [:product :roses; 
                         :quantity [:units :kg; :maxValue "500"]].

translates to:

<#advert456> <foo:role>        "seller" .
<#advert123> <foo:description> _:service .
_:service    <foo:produce>     <foo:roses> .
_:service    <foo:quantity>    _:q .
_:q          <foo:units>       <foo:kg> .
_:q          <foo:maxValue>    "500" .

i.e. this is an advert placed by a seller who can sell roses in
quantities upto 500.

I've checked with my source and this is the correct.

Err, I'm not sure why this is being raised in the context of this use
case.  I see no queries in this use case.  I see only assertions
about advertisments.

That seems plausible to me.

I'm not sure how to decide what really exists and what doesn't - I hope
we can stay away from that question.  I personally would be happy to have
a URI to denote a unicorn in some fairy story.

I'm not following the point you are trying to make here, but the
thought in my head is that we need to take care to distinguish
between the name of a 'variable' and the name of the thing
the variable is bound to.

Neither am I :(  I said to express and intution that isn't well formed
in the hope that someone might shed some light.

I see no queries in the use case - only assertions.

What I'm getting at that traditional logic is about designing formal
systems that are true under any interpretation.  That's not what we
are dealing with here.
