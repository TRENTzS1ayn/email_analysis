Loosely in English it means advert123 is for a service that will
buy roses in quantities of at least 100.

                     advert123 role buyer
and  thereExists ?X  advert123 description ?X
                     ?X        product      roses
     thereExists ?Y  ?X        minQuantitiy ?Y
                     ?Y        units        kg
                     ?Y        minValue     100

As  you see, I've made an attempt.

What is the difference between this and the example in:

Can you account for the fact that both adverts are very similar in
structure, yet you assign them different semantics?

This is the essential point.  My colleagues believe that if a resource
is not anonymous they will process it differently - i.e. it means
something different.

I have reread that message and it has not helped me to understand.

The issue is really very simple.  If an anonymous node is used, it means
"a service selling roses in quantities of at least 100".  If a node with a URI U
is given it means "The service called U selling roses in quantities of least
100".  The difference is that a processor of the advert is expected to know how
to relate U to the service it denotes.  At least that's how my colleagues
are using it.
