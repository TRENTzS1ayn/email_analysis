I decided to take a pass through M&S to understand what it says about anon
resources.  I've made a list of sections which I found relevant which I've
included here (almost) without comment, as crib sheet for others who wish
to do the same.

  Resources are always named by URIs plus optional
  anchor ids

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#34

  Resources are identified by a resource identifier. A resource identifier
  is a URI plus an optional anchor id

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#41

  The intention of this sentence is to make the value of the Creator property
  a structured entity. In RDF such an entity is represented as another 
  resource. The sentence above does not give a name to that resource; it is 
  anonymous, so in the diagram below we represent it with an empty oval:

The structured entity of the previous example can also be assigned a unique
identifier.

  If the resource does not yet exist (i.e., does not yet have a resource
  identifier) then a Description element can supply the identifer for
  the resource using an ID attribute.

  The structured entity of the previous example can also be assigned a 
  unique identifier.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#56

  A Description element without an about attribute represents a new 
  resource. Such a resource might be a surrogate, or proxy, for some
  other physical resource that does not have a recognizable URI.

This next paragraph is significant.  It is describing the translation of the
RDF/XML to the abstract syntax defined in M&S and describes a translation
the resource in the abstract syntax has no identifier.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#199

 r is 
    the resource whose identifier is given by the value of the about
    attribute of the Description or  

   a new resource whose identifier is the value of the ID attribute of the
   Description, if present; else the new resource has no identifier. 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#205

  The Description element itself represents an instance of a Bag resource.
  The members of this Bag are the resources corresponding to the reification 
  of each of the statements in the Description. If the bagID attribute is 
  specified its value is the identifier of this Bag, else the Bag is 
  anonymous.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#208

  When aboutEachPrefix is specified with Description, the statements in the
  Description refer to each of the members of an anonymous Bag container. 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#232

  r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new
  resource. If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new 
  resource. 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#235

  The value of the bagID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for the 
  Bag corresponding to the Description D; else the Bag is anonymous.
