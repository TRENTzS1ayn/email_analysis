I've managed to update the document
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/
with the notation changes you previously described, and with the
issues you have brought up, along with some solutions.

I don't mind saying N-Triples is UTF-8 since I've got code around to
do that and it comes for free with Java and Python for example.
However it just moves the escaping to a different level and makes it
impossible for anyone to generate unicode characters with plain text
(ASCII that is) editors.

Yes, but is it better than my other suggestions?
I've listed all the suggestions in the updated doc.

which was actually where I started in the first version, Doh!
