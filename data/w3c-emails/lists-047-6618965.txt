Good, thanks!

The problem I now see is that this asserts the existence of the required 
service:

   thereExists ?X which is the object of (advert123 description ?X)
   (etc)

But the apparent intent of this is ask if such a service exists.  Do I 
detect a "gensym" error?

That case asserts the existence of the un-identified individual.

Well, the difference I perceive is the apparent intent in one case to make 
a statement about something that may or may not exist, and in the other 
case to assert that something does exist.

In the seller case, I thought Pat's note explained quite well how a skolem 
form or existential quantification gave you the same information (excerpt 
repeated below).  Maybe much hinges on "If all you know about 'genid:xyzzy' 
is some sentence that I send you"?

If one happens to know something else about "The service called U", such as 
"how to relate U to the service it denotes", then this is a different 
situation.  But I don't think it's brought about by the anonymity, but by 
the expected other knowledge.
