Some observations:

(1) A signature is applied to some particular document or data, not to the 
information it contains or represents.

(2) Depending on the context in which the signature is applied, it conveys 
some kind of assurance about the content of the document.  It may assert 
that the information represented by the document is true.  It may convey 
some different assurance about the document.  (Joseph Reagle has some 
thoughts about this: see <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-p3p-profile/>.)

(3) Ultimately, the assurance conveyed by a signature will apply, I think, 
to the model theoretic interpretation of the information (in which, I 
assert, genid's and other identifying forms will not generally be present).
