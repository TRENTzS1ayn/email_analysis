I'm fine with asserting the existence of the buyer service.  The problem I 
have is that the *description* of the buyer service asserts the existence 
of something that may not actually exist.

An expression Pat used recently, if I get it right, to describe logical 
errors introduced by human interpretation of a symbol in an expression 
without any logical basis for that interpretation.

In this case, we know what a "buyer" is, and what a "seller" is.

The two examples you gave in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0240.html are 
identical modulo a name change and a quantity.  (Pedagogically, they could 
equally have been stated using the same quantity so that the only 
difference was a name change.)

Yet we infer that in one case the goods offered for sale definitely exist, 
but in the other case no assertion is made about their existence.  There 
seems to be no *logical* basis for this difference in interpretation when 
the only difference is a naming difference.

Currently, it seems to me that the Existential-Conjunctive (EC) subset of 
first order logic, hence RDF as I understand it, is incapable of expressing 
the buyer proposition without actually asserting the existence of that 
which is to be purchased.

And more.  See above.
