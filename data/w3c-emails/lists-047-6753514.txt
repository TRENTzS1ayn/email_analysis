I think part of the problem here is our natural tendency to take a
commonsense reading of what FOL "there exists" means, ie. reading
existential quantifier as taking about some form of "existence in the
world". If we try to take a strong reading of "there exists" we'll be
bouncing into a whole family of (what I understand to be) fairly well
known puzzles: how do we talk about pictures that depict Unicorns,
future events that may not come to pass etc.
