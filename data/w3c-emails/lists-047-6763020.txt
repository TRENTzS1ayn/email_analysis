Dan,

I think you've touched an important point here.  After I posted my 
comments, I also thought about Unicorns.  I think this is leading to the 
need for some kind of "reference without assertion" -- reification, or 
whatever.

However, I do believe that "there exists" in logic does actually mean that 
something satisfying the associated description does indeed exist.  Without 
this, much of the maths I learned would collapse.
