I'd suggest looking at
http://users.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm#Model (which also contains
a pointer to a useful paper by Taski).  The DAML model theoretic
semantics for which Graham posted the URL
(http://www.daml.org/2001/03/model-theoretic-semantics.html) provides an
immediate example.  Plugging "model theoretic semantics" into Google
provides a bunch of references as well, some of which are useful.  [This
stuff may not be very helpful, but it's more or less what I had in mind
when I volunteered!]
