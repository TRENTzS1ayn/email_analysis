Just to clarify my position on this: I'm quite happy claiming that FOL's
"there exists" captures the technical meaning of the RDF "anonymous
resource" construct. So whenever I'm seen muttering about unicorns or
scratching my chin about the meaning of "there exists", I'm not casting
doubt on either (i) the reading of anonymous resources as "there
exists", (ii) the utility of the FOL machinery. The "technology and
society" problem of relating FOL statements to social/legal claims about
the world is a separate problem to clarifying the technical meaning of
"anonymous resources" in RDF. I believe the social/legal problem of "what
exactly am I asserting when I use RDF anoynmous resources in my RDF/XML
documents" can be reduced to the better understood (and non-Spec
related) "what am I asserting when I use 'there exists' in FOL".
