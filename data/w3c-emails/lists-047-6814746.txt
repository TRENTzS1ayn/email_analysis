Per today's teleconference, these are the questions that I feel need to be 
answered to resolve issue #rdfms-identity-anon-resources [1].


1. Does the current model and syntax spec sanction the use of an anonymous 
resource to convey anything other than an assertion of the existence of a 
resource with the properties given?  c.f. Frank Manola's comment in 
[2].  See also Brian McBride's survey of relevant parts of M&S [3].


2. Does the use of an anonymous resource as a query variable represent an 
extension to the idea an assertion of the existence of a resource with the 
properties given?  Opinions vary: e.g. [4-9].


3 If the answer to Q1 is "no" and to Q2 is "yes", should we undertake to 
extend M&S to allow this usage?  If so, why and how?


4. Can we agree whether or not unique generated IDs (in the style of Skolem 
constants) are equivalent to existentially quantified variables for the 
purpose of asserting the existence of a resource with properties 
given?  (See Frank's message [10] for a discussion -- I discount the option 
of dropping anonymous resources.)

If we agree they are equivalent:

4.1 What are the advantages and difficulties with each approach?

4.2 Which approach do we prefer?

4.3 How does the preferred approach affect M&S?


5. Are there any other uses of anonymous resources that have been overlooked?
