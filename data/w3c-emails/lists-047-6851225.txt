I think this is a bug in the spec. The spec is clearly trying to 
provide an introductory description of RDF topics. Note the use 
of language like "Namespaces are simply a way to..." rather than 
"RDF uses namespaces to..." or "Namespaces must..."

There are many ways for Protege to find out the name of the 
schema -- I don't think this use case is a strong enough reason 
to change the model.

This is not true -- XML Schema datatypes have URIs and can be 
dealt with just  like anything else with a URI. IMO, Jonathan is 
somewhat confused on this point.

As I said, I think this is a bug and any kind of URI reference 
may be used.

What's the use case that makes it worth our while to change the spec?
