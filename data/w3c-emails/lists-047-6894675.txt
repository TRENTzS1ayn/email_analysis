I've been experimenting with adding the WG changes to the existing
grammar, and then trying to express that with XML Infoset terms.  I
like where it is heading so far - the grammar is getting smaller -
but it needs more precision, especially to capture some of the detail
expressed in prose in the existing RDF/XML and our decisions.

Need I say, very much work in progress?
