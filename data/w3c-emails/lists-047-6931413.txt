DanC makes concrete a fundamental philosophical point:

  An RDF processor can never know enough about the real world to decide
  that two anonymous descriptions were intended to describe the same
  resource.

Thus, if an RDF processor is ever to generate a URI for an anonymous
resource, it must never use the same URI twice, otherwise it risks
asserting that two different resources are in fact the same.

The only algorithms that it can use therefore are those that generate
(probably) unique identifiers each time they are called such as uuidgen.
