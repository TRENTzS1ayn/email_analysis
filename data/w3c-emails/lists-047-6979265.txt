?X denotes a service that will BUY roses in minimum quantities of 100kg.

There does exist a service that can be bound to ?X.  Its the buyer
service.  That's what we're advertising here.

Or was it ?Y you were suggesting could not be satisfied.

Of course it can.  If it can assert that a seller service exists, surely
it can equally well assert that a buyer service exists.  It doesn't know
the difference.
