Looks good, mostly...

I don't think you mean that relative URI references
are in U. I think U is the set of absolute URI references;
i.e. URIs with optional #fragment thingies.

that last P should be little, no? IEXT(I(p))

Just 3 major things missing:

1. existentials:

_:x <p> <o> is true in I iff
o is a member of U, p is a member of P,
and there is some thingy tx in I's set of thingies
so that (tx, IN(O)) is a member of IEXT(I(p))

The substitution (tx for _:x) is
said to satisfy the triple _:x <p> <o>.

In general, a substitution has
any number of (thingy for _:name, thingy2 for _:name2, ...)
pairs.

2. conjunctions

a list of triples is satisfied by
some substitution if each of the triples
in it is satisfied by that substitution.

3. putting it all together

A list of triples is true in I iff there's some
substitution that satisfies it.

Yes, let's leave that for a rainy day...

Just one of Pat's notes seems essential:

I'd say literals map to themselves. i.e. IS is the
identity function.

But that depends on my position on xml:lang...
