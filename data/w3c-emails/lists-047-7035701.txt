I agree.  I've asked Art to delete:

  rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr/

The other directories look to be correctly named.

The tests in 

  rdfms-empty-property-lements/

need to be made world readable

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-aboutEach-on-object/test1.rdf
should
be renamed to error1.rdf.

The nt files in
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/

 need to be editted so that each statement is on a single line (my job)

and also

 
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/Overview.html

should be deleted.

Does that cover it Dave.  If so, Art, could find time to implement the changes.
