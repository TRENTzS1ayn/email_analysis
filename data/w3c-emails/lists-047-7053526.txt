Can we get directories made for all the issues with test cases that
have been provided already, so that when they are updated for the
correct base URI and N-triples format, they have a place to live.

This is one of the mis-spellings that should be deleted.  The
rdfms-empty-property-elements directory exists, with Jan's tests in
it.

I just tried to upload a test to one of the directories for 
my issue http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/
and get the usual access denied.

Reminds me - I should probably ask that people use a .nt suffix for
these files to distinguish from full n3.  It might become important
later to distinguish the two.
