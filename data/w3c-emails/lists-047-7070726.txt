I guess U and S are denumerable, no?

Isn't the notation f: A -> B used for a function with
domain A and range B?
But IEXT is not a funtion at all, it is a relation on
a cross product R x R which is simply a subset of R x R
IEXT(I(p)) = {<I(s),I(o)> el R x R: I(s) I(p) I(o) is true}

> A mapping IS : S -> R
