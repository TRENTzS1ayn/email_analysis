Yup - its like my car knowing the way to work - when I hit that
capital R the D and F surely follow :)

Yes

Yes there's something screwy about what I wrote.  I think I
meant to write:

IEXT : P -> powerset(R x R)

i.e. IEXT is a mapping from from P to relations on R - the
idea being to ensure that R x R is not a subset of R.

Is that the same as you are suggesting?
