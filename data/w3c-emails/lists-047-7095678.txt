Exactly, although I was wrong in my wording.
The range of IEXT is indeed the powerset
(the set of subsets) of R x R

Beside rdf:subject, rdf:predicate and rdf:object
being nicely modeled now, I think we can also model
'sets of triples' and rdf:li as being a property
to list it's members, so something like
[ rdf:li [ rdf:subject <s1>; rdf:predicate <p1>; rdf:object <o1>],
         [ rdf:subject <s1>; rdf:predicate <p1>; rdf:object <o1>]]
but let's further think about that...
