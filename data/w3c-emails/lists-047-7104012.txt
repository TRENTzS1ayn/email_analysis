Really? they found it useful?
I thought the OCLC folks got their job done
without using xml:lang.

I guess I'll pore over the records, but I'd appreciate a pointer.

That doesn't seem to cover the case of rdf:parsetype="Literal".

it already says that a literal isn't just a string.

Why? n-triples can repesent pairs already, using triples.
I find that option much more appealing.

I'm not interested
in adopting it separately from a solution
to rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure. (I'm not interested
in adopting it at all; but this issue allows me
