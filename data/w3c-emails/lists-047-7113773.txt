I agree and understand 'substitution' as being a mapping from
variables to thingies and usually the identity mapping except
for the given pairs. A substitution denotes bindings of the
variables and instances of the thingies.
A substitution is a unifier of two thingies if the instances
of these thingies by the substitution are identical.
All the rest is just a matter of computing those unifiers and
applying some rules of inference.

do you mean an (ordered) list or a set?
indeed 'some' substitution is OK
(not a Most General Unifier or MGU)

fine

Well, we had lots of rain here, but that is of course not everywhere...
