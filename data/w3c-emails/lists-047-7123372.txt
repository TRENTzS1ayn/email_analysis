Concerning "and finally"...

I think what Pat hinted at in the last teleconference was that certain 
special identifiers (e.g. of the form _:name) might be global to the scope 
of any given set of statements, but that if two such sets were brought 
together then such identifiers would be rewritten to avoid conflicts, thus 
ensuring uniqueness in the new, combined set.

(It's similar to the renaming of free variables that is required when 
evaluating lambda expressions where an argument to a function contains free 
variable names that are also bound within the function body.)

Thus, the special handling of "variables" takes the form of a syntactic 
manipulation when statement sets are brought together.  Otherwise, they 
behave just like the other identifiers - URIs.
