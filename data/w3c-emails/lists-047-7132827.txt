Agreed.

I think the assumption that the URI denotes a specific resource is somewhat 
empty if one has no other knowledge about the resource thus denoted.  As 
Pat pointed out, in this situation you can do no more than infer that such 
a resource exists.

The detailed form of the argument here depends a bit on whether one assumes 
that URIs:resources are 1:1, or if several URIs can identify the same 
resource.  But either way I assert that two URIs can ultimately refer to 
the same thing in the domain of interpretation.  Thus, assertions about a 
resource named by a uniquely-generated URI MAY be referring to a resource 
that is elsewhere known by a specified URI.  This seems to be the same as 
information that one has about a resource identified by a variable.
