Brian,

OK, I think I get it now.  You're right about me committing the gensym 
error.   (FWIW, it was "product roses" that got me.   "productType roses" 
might have guided me around this pitfall.)

I now accept that neither buyer nor seller service logically assert the 
existence of the product potentially transacted.

So where does this leave the original discussion?  I think we still have 
every anonymous resource being something whose existence is asserted.
