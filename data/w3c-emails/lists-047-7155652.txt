In this case, I come to the opposite conclusion.

I think that in a model, or interpretation, there are just things that are 
denoted.  The form of the denotation used in the formal language being 
interpreted (identifiers, variables, position on a piece of paper, etc.) 
does not generally exist in the domain of interpretation.  Thus any 
distinction in the form of denotation is not material in the domain being 
described.
