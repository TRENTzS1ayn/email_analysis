Eric, please did I understood you correctly at the last telecon?  I 
understood you to say that the DC use case you provided did use
xml:lang as specified in M&S and that was adequate to meet the
requirements of that use case.

True - we've got that as a separate issue but really these should be
considered together.

  or it can be a literal; i.e., a resource (specified by a URI) or a simple
  string or other primitive datatype defined by XML.

This text does not make it clear, at least to me, that a literal can have
a language component as described in:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#221

  The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to associate
  a language with the property value. There is no specific data model
  representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to the data 
  model); the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part 
  of the literal.

The original WG have taken a different view.  Is there a more powerful
case that can be made to change what M&S specifies than we have so 
far heard.

Fair enough.

I see 'yuk', what's the justification?
