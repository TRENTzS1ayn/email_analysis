Right, exactly. The most obvious way to do this would be to have 
properties denote relational extensions, ie subsets of RxR. However, 
there is a technical advantage to making things just a whisker more 
complicated and distinguishing the relation-thing from its extension 
(I got this idea from Chris Menzel). Then it is quite kosher to allow 
properties of properties, and even properties which apply to 
themselves, without getting caught in wierd set-theoretical loops.

I'll explain more fully in a document ready soon (hopefully 
tomorrow.) Sorry I have been out of the rdfcore loop for a week and 
am trying to catch up.

Yes, the subset of RxR can be empty: that is a property that has no 
values (ie is always false).
