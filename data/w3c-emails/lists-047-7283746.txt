Well, is it a template or is it RDF?? That word 'template' means, 
presumably, that this is meant to be interpreted as something that is 
not making an assertion about someTHING, but rather a general 
assertion about a whole lot of things at once (ANY quantity of roses 
less than 100 kg) or maybe as a 'schema' which isnt about anything as 
it stands, but can be made to be about something by filling a value 
to instantiate the 'variable' in the template by suitable matching of 
some kind (eg [:units :kg; :minvalue "100"] might 'match' [:units 
:kg; :exactvalue "53"] ).  Either way, it goes beyond the scope of 
the RDF M&S.

There isn't anything in RDF 1.0 to support any notion of a variable 
than can be instantiated or matched. There probably ought to be, but 
there isn't.

He may, but that isn't what his RDF says. It just says that a 
(singular) quantity of roses exists.  He might just have one rose, 
and that would make his assertion true.

What does "instanceOf" mean? Where in RDF does the instantiation take 
place? How are variable bindings done and what do they mean?

>#service42 :product :roses;
>           :quantity [:units :kg; :value "200"]];

We have these problems - if they are seen as problems - with or 
without anonymous nodes.

And suffers from the same snags. If the existentials can be 
instantiated then they arent being asserted, but must be in queries, 
which makes them equi-expressive with universals in assertions, which 
is outside the RDF model .
