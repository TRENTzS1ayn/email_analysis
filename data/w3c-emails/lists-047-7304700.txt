Just sit down and take a few deep breaths.

In a given interpretation it denotes one thing. But then you have to 
ask, what does the reader know about the interpretation the writer 
had in mind when they wrote the RDF? Answer: only what is said in the 
RDF or specified in the semantic rules for RDF. You get the same 
answer if the writer uses an anonymous node or if the writer uses a 
non-anonymous node *which the reader doesnt know anything else about* 
(a skolem name, eg). Either way, all the reader knows is that the 
writer had in mind an interpretation in which some thing exists which 
satisfies whatever they wrote about the thing indicated by the URI.

NO!!  That is NOT a valid assumption. URIs need not be 'public' 
names, in the sense that they are shared between more than one user. 
I can invent brand-new URIs and use them , and you might have no idea 
what I am talking about.

I don't think the internet makes any difference. If I use a name in a 
private way, putting it on the internet doesn't make it any more 
obvious to you what I mean. The internet is only a file interchange 
protocol, when one comes right down to it; it doesn't work semantic 
miracles or make people telepathic.

I dont think this is in any way valid or warranted. It amounts to a 
global unique-name assumption, which is obviously not correct on the 
Web, since it isnt even correct on many web pages. It may be correct 
(in an ideal world) for URL's, but it cannot be assumed for all URIs

Almost all languages are bult around that idea.

I couldn't disagree more. We do NOT have one interpretation. All we 
send one another are assertions, not interpretations, and if the 
sender wants to constrain the receiver's interpretations then he 
needs to send enough content to make the constraint explicit. I might 
have one interpretation in mind, but there is no way for you to know 
what it is; unless of course I only use literals to say what I mean.
