Right; the obvious (I should know better than to say that) 
interpretation of a 'bare' name is that it says that a thing exists 
with that name, which is usually vacuous, so harmless. And this is 
what <foo> rdf:type rdfs:Resource seems to say as well, in a kind of 
reified way where having an rdf:type is like having the property of 
existing somewhere in the domain.  So the obvious (?) semantics for 
this would say that the extension of I(rdf:type) has to be a subset 
of Rx(2|R)  and that <x, y> is in EXT(I(rdf:type)) just when x is in 
the set y. This provides a general-purpose way to say that something 
is in a subset of the universe - provided of course that the subset 
in question has a name - and then the case in question has y being 
the universe itself (which is required to be the denotation of 
rdfs:Resource, I presume) , so the assertion just says that x exists, 
which is always true.
