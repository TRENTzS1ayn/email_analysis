No, it doesn't. The quantifier is not a relation between the 
quantified expression and the quantified variable. It doesn't mention 
the expression: it uses it (in an admittedly devious way).

Yes and no. Sorry, but the answer depends on what 'rdf:type' is 
supposed to mean. However, we can't do

<foo> rdf:type rdfs:AnonymousNode

  and also do

<foo> rdf:type rdfs:Resource

because the first takes <foo> to be a node, while the second talks 
about what the node denotes. You can have it either way, but you 
can't have it both ways (in the same langauge)(well, not without very 
severe semantic pain).
