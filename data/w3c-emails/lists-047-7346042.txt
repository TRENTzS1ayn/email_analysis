Right, though that "(in some sense)" deserves to be made more 
explicit, which I will try to do before the f2f meeting. I mean, it 
is an existential, strictly speaking, but queries are functionally 
similar to *negated* assertions, so the machinery you need to handle 
an existential in a query is the same as what you need to handle a 
universal in an assertion. This is one of those things that just kind 
of gets to be part of the atmosphere to anyone working in logic. In 
most inference engines you can't tell asserted existentials from 
queried universals, and vice versa.
