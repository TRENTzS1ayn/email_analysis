OK, though you really shouldnt have used the same '-:q' as in the 
first example. BUt now, how is any matching done between these? 
Rewrite the second example using a different anon-name:

><#advert456> <foo:role>        "seller" .
><#advert123> <foo:description> _:service .
>_:service    <foo:produce>     <foo:roses> .
>_:service    <foo:quantity>    _:qq.
>_:qq          <foo:units>       <foo:kg> .
>_:qq          <foo:maxValue>    "500" .

and put it all together and we have a total of 12 triples which refer 
to two anonymous things called _:q and _:qq which have no obvious 
connection to one another. No variables, nothing to 'match', no 
obvious consequences. Certainly it doesnt follow that _:q  equals 
_:qq; they might be respectively 256 and 483, say.

Right. Say 'really exists' means 'is in the universe of discourse', 
without taking a stance on what that universe consists of.

Agreed, though that isnt the key issue here. What matters is what 
kind of process is allowed to 'bind' a value to a variable, and the 
(sad but true) fact that whatever is doing that had better not claim 
to be doing anything that is valid in RDF1.0.

WHICH mapping? How can I possibly know, when reading your RDF, which 
mapping you have in mind? All I can know is that whatever it was, it 
presumably made all your RDF sentences true, otherwise you wouldn't 
have asserted them. But look: if I already know your intended 
interpretation, you wouldnt *need* to send me any RDF. I could 
generate it myself and it would magically mean what you intended it 
to mean, by a kind of semantic resonance. If there is only one 
interpretation, then we all already know what sentences are true and 
false, and there is no point in telling one another what we already 
know.

The key issue is whether something is allowed to bind variables to 
new values during processing. If they are, and if this is considered 
valid, then those variables that get bound must be either universal 
variables in an assertion, or existential variables in a query. 
Either way that takes us outside the RDF 1.0 M&S, seems to me.

No. Logic is about characterising how truth is preserved. The idea 
isnt that formal systems are true (actually that doesnt mean 
anything), but that the formal systems *preserve* truth: it the 
antecedents are true (in I) then the consequents must be true (in I). 
That 'if..then' is what has to be true for any I if the reasoning is 
valid. The point being that if I have no idea what your intended 
interpretation is (which in general I don't, in fact, other than 
knowing that it makes your assertions true), then that doesnt matter; 
I can still draw valid conclusions from your sentences since 
*whatever* your intended interpretation was, my conclusions will be 
true in it.

The key issue is who is doing the binding. If an RDF engine can bind 
values to variables at run time (ie at inference time), then it's 
going beyond the M&S.
