That says that it buys roses in a (singular) quantity of at least 
100, not ANY (plural) such quantity. It would be made true by a 
single purchasing act.

What you want it to mean is that the service will buy *any* quantity 
of roses with at least 100 roses in it, but that's not expressible 
using existential quantifiers.

That example refers to a single creator. It doesn't say that 
http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila  has creator *everything* and they all 
have name Ora and Email lassila@w3.org.

I tend to agree that this should be expressed using a universal as 
well, given the intended meaning, if it is an assertion.

Well, strictly speaking it does mean something different, but its a 
miniscule difference. Certainly not enough to support any kind of 
binding to an anonymous node.

Then that involves a *universally* quantified assertion, not an 
existential. Think: would this description be satisfied just by a 
single act of selling less than 100 roses? Or does it assert that 
*any* such act of selling is on offer here?

Well, we could give RDF that semantics. But if we do, then the 
example in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-pa 
rt#41
must mean that *everything* is the creator of 
http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila , for example.
