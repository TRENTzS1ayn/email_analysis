Right. It is  even valid. But only in a query. So the issue becomes, 
do we have queries in RDF? I will leave that question to the proper 
authorities.

I guess there is a genuine cultural clash here. Are we supposed to 
define a precise meaning for RDF, or are we supposed to take a breezy 
hack-it-up-if-we-need-it attitude to what RDF is all about? I'm quite 
happy to take either road, but we need to get the question clear, 
since the two attitudes arent really compatible. The breezy approach 
has the merit of making anything as precise as a model theory 
entirely pointless, so I would have a lot less work to do.
