Look at the assertions in your example, above. There are two 
existential claims made in there. One says that something (X) exists 
which bears the description-1 (ie the inverse of description) 
relation to advert123 and the product relation to roses and the 
minQuantity relation to some other thing Y.  X could be a 'service', 
sure. But what kind of thing is Y? It bears a units relation to kg 
and a minValue relation to 100. It sounds like a sale, or a 
transaction, or maybe a quantity of roses. But whatever it is, the 
sentences only assert that *one* of it exists. There is nothing here 
that could possibly convey what is meant by the English gloss of "a 
service that sells roses in quantities of at least 100 kg" (that is a 
hell of a lot of roses, by the way) , since that gloss uses the 
plural ("quantities"), but there isn't anything in the logical 
version that implies more than one of anything.

Assuming that a formal structure means more than it really does just 
because it seems to mean that when you read it as if it were English. 
Comes from a famous AI paper by Drew McDermott where he suggested 
that all 'intuitive' names be replaced by gensyms (LISP for genids) 
before you try to figure out what the axioms mean.

The difference is that the Lassila example is purely existential, but 
this isn't.

Fine; but what it says about it is that it is connected with the 
existence of an un-identified quantity of roses. Not any such 
quantity: just one. You had better move fast if you want to buy a 
rose.
