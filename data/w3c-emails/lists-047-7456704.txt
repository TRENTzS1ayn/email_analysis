I think this is wrong on several grounds. First, there is not in 
general any way to 'identify' the resource denoted by a URI. If I am 
given a URI then I may or may not be able to discover what resource 
it was intended to identify, but there is no general presumption that 
this can always be done. Second, while of course the other 
application can recognise the URI in the sense that they know where 
it comes from, there is no general presumption that they can 
'identify' what it denotes, ie discover exactly what resource that 
was supposed to be. In many cases this may be possible (eg it will be 
for URL's presumably), but not in general.

I disagree. What do you mean by 'binding' here? There doesnt seem to 
be any reasonable sense of binding for a URI. Certainly there isnt 
any way to bind a URI to the resource it denotes, in general (cf 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-pa 
rt#33
"A resource may also be an object that is not directly accessible via 
the Web; e.g. a  printed book. ..... Anything can have a URI; the 
extensibility of URIs allows the introduction of identifiers for any 
entity imaginable."

In both cases, it is making assertions about some thing, ie some 
resource. The use of the URI may enable the receiver to connect the 
assertions made by the source to other assertions (perhaps made by 
other sources) about the same thing, made by using the same URI. That 
is the only sense in which a URI can be said to 'name' anything.

It isnt clear to me what the scope of anonymous node is intended to 
be, but it if it is the document containing the node, then indeed it 
should be impossible for any other source to say anything about the 
thing it refers to, so this is a genuine difference. However, the 
same is true of a non-anonymous URI if its use is restricted to this 
one source.
