I don't think so. At the least, we should put this up as an explicit 
item for discussion: do we have a clear notion of query, and how does 
it relate to the notion of an assertion? (What does it mean to 
satisfy a query, can queries generate other queries, can queries be 
incorporated into an RDf graph (how?), can one query a literal, and 
so on.)
