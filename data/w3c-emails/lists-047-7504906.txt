Yes. If we have genuinely anonymous nodes then they must be 
recognisable as such. I gather however that this is still an open 
issue, ie do we have genuinely anonymous nodes in an RDF 
graph/document, or does 'anonymous' simply mean 'unspecified', so 
that anonymous nodes have an URI (unique to the document which 
originated it) but we just don't say what it is ?

To me, the interesting thing is that the model theory works just as 
well either way. Details coming, hopefully tomorrow.
