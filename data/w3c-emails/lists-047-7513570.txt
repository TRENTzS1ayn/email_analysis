No, I meant URL's, which I take to mean a URI that locates something. 
I'm not sure about URN's: I don't see any global unique-name 
assumption (ie the assumption that everything has a unique name, so 
different names must denote distinct things) in the URN specs 
anywhere, but maybe I just havnt found it.
