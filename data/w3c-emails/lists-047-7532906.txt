Looks like a good start to me, modulo comments already raised.

I have a couple of questions/comments:

Isn't p also a member of U?  (And IN(p) a member of P.)

I would have exp[ectyed this to read:
    (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p))

Similar comments.

I think it would be good to see this formally linked to the syntax of 
N-triples, but I guess that can come later.

I still have some thoughts about reification, but am happy to let that lie 
until the base elements are settled down.
