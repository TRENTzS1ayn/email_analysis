    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
this is not a disadvantage (from the POV of query languages) - in my
opinion it means you get to express more clearly what you're looking
for. One can envisage a number of properties of literals that you might
wish to express constraints on in a query language (eg, "< 4") that you
don't necessarily wish to write out with triples; certainly even if you
_did_ write them out, you'd need special processing to deal with them.
