Let me put it another way. The query server offers a function which maps
one graph onto a sequence of graphs. The query is a graph, serialised
using RDF, which expresses the user's search criteria. It's sent wrapped
up in a query message (in other words, I suppose it's being quoted).

In other words, the query is a packaged assertion ("this represents the
things I'm looking for") and the search target performs some best-effort
processing in order to return a series of results which (it promises)
are its best effort at "answering" the query. The details of the
function it calculates are deliberately obscured.

Yes, I describe the whole think in a "hacky" fashion, but I'm not
_completely_ convinced that I'm really breaking with the spirit of RDF
here (in other words, that there's a way to describe the process I'm
performing couched in such terms that it doesn't step on the toes of a
model theory).
