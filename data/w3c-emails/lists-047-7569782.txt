I agree with your last comments - we use XML for doing this properly
and this is a simple text/plain format that *can* encode all
characters, and is indented primarily for developing and testing RDF
syntax reader/writer code, and as a concrete syntax for our formal model.

This is not intended for end users to type as a new RDF syntax.

[ At least not yet... if we do change our minds about this later, we
can revisit it later and use, for example, UTF-8 since it is a
superset of US-ASCII, the 0..127 code points are the same.  But I
don't want to start that discussion now. ]

So I am going to change the N-Triples document to be a US-ASCII
format (chars 0..127) and the \-escapes to allow encoding of the
higher code points.
