I'm struggling slowly to understand.  My appologies if I miss the
significance of some remarks first time around.

The syntax clearly allows anonymous resources.  I think you have just
said that a parser, which on receiving RDF/XML containing anon
resources, assigned URI's to the anon resources when spitting out the
triples would not be representing exactly the information it had
as input.  Are we agreeing on this?

To represent exactly the information recieved, anon resources must
be a part of the model/abstract syntax.  Yes? No?

Could have, but didn't.  I suggest the requirement here is that
the abstract syntax/model be able to represent *exactly* the information
conveyed in the syntax.

My point here is that the abstract model should be able to represent
*exactly* the information that SOURCE intended to sign.  Any subsequent
inferences are the responsibility of the recipient.
