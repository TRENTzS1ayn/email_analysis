Yes I agree that it can't always be done.  With an anonymous resource it
can never be done.  With a URI it can sometimes be done.  That is a 
difference and it may be significant to an application.

They may have some information about it, e.g. reference service.

I mean that the mapping from the URI to the resource it identifies has
been defined.

see above.

We seem to have different notions of binding.

If I can tell that the scope of such a URI is so limited, then I think
I might be happy with that - so long as I can tell such URI's from those
those are not so limited.
