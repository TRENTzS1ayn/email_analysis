Oops - re-reading the example, I wrote nonsense.  The example is wrong.
It should read something like:

                      advert123 role buyer
 and  thereExists ?X  advert123 description ?X
                      ?X        product      roses
      thereExists ?Y  ?X        minQuantitiy ?Y
                      ?Y        units        kg
                      ?Y        value        100

I also think the role really should be a property of ?X, but I've left
that for now.

?Y simply denotes 100Kg.

Or it could have been:

                      advert123 role buyer
 and  thereExists ?X  advert123 description ?X
                      ?X        product      roses
      thereExists ?Y  ?X        quantity     ?Y
                      ?Y        units        kg
                      ?Y        minvalue        100

in which case ?Y could represent a range with an unbounded upper limit.
