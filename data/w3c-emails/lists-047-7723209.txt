Maybe we should keep it breezy for 1.0 and save the model theory 
for 2.0. I think it'll be sort of hard to retrofit semantics 
onto RDF when many folks haven't followed them (as we've seen). 
It also gives the whole group less work to do and a chance to 
spend time on issues that will affect the entire RDF community 
(as opposed to the logicians, etc. who are interested in a model 
theory).
