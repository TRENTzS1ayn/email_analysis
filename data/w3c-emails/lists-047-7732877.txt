Well, it COULD, but theres nothing in the RDF to say that it DOES. I 
don't think that any agent could read this much RDF and figure out 
what someone was saying about roses and such. In fact, I can't figure 
it out myself.  It doesnt say anything about selling, for example, or 
buying. It only requires that two things exist, as well as whatever 
'roses' and 'buyer' mean, so it could be satisfied in a universe with 
only 4 items in it. So whatever it means, it doesnt seem to amount to 
enough to imply anything about selling quantities of roses.

You might want to say that the meaning of 'product' and 'minQuantity' 
somehow ought to convey the intended meaning about selling things in 
batches of a certain minimal size, but where does that information 
reside? If there is a common vocabulary of these terms that 
advertisers all understand, then its meaning needs to be specified 
somewhere, maybe in an RDF or DAML+OIL Kbase (?), or else somehow in 
the advertisement itself. It isn't built into RDF, for sure.

PS. This morning I had some kind of local email crash and lost all 
messages to this list since last night, so if anything sent anything 
vital in the last 12 hours could they please Cc me another copy? 
Thanks.
