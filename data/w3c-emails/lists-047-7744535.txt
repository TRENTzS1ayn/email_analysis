Well, this is only indirectly about model theory.  I can understand how
the entire RDF community may not feel a compelling need for a thingie
[ahem!] titled "model theory", but how about a somewhat clearer RDF
M&S?  One, say, that clarified how anonymous nodes were to be
interpreted and handled.  You have to keep in mind that Pat's comment
was extracted from a message in a thread in which it was being suggested
that anonymous nodes could be used to represent variables in queries (or
templates).  Now, that may or may not be a reasonable thing to do, but
it is certainly out of the blue as far as my interpretation of RDF was
concerned.  I always thought RDF was intended for making assertions
about resources.  If I encountered some RDF on the Web, it was making
assertions about some resources.  Similarly, if someone *sent me* some
RDF, they were sending me some assertions about some resources.  I
wouldn't have interpreted that RDF as a query (and I'd hence have
misinterpreted any anonymous resources in that RDF if that were the
intent).  Now, as far as I can tell, the M&S today doesn't contain
anything that describes using RDF to represent queries and templates. 
That doesn't necessarily mean those uses are excluded or unreasonable,
but I claim that if we think that using RDF in these ways *is*
legitimate, it's our job to say so very clearly, and illustrate and
explain those uses in the M&S.
