There's been a fair amount of traffic - you might like to check the 
archive - 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/

One of the nice features of this archive is that there is a link in the
archived messages that let's you reply to them so the replies appear in
the right thread - at least it seems to work on my machine.
