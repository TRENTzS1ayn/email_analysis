I've updated the required reading, recommended reading and recommended 
materials sections of the f2f page.  The recommended readings include
some basic materials that will obviously not be appropriate for everyone.

I'm also suggesting that folks who can, meet in the Garden Courtyard of the
Sebastopol Inn from about 7pm onwards and head off to dinner around 8pm.
