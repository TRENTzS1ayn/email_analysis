I'm really glad you express it so clear
and I think you couldn't be more right :-)
This is indeed related with Modus Tollens (MT)
  given P->Q and ~Q we can deduce ~P
  (Q like the Query and P like the Premiss
  an P becoming now a new given sub-query etc.)
and ~forall is like forsome so indeed
  you can't tell asserted existentials from
  queried universals, and vice versa.
and I still think this is kind of what also
happens in the 'mini' world of anonymous node
resolution (which is kind of generalized MT)

??? could it be that [ :p :o] (as one token)
is an existental but that we *could* assert
forall _:s such that _:s :p :o. ???
(we actually do use the former and then
query with some kind of univeral/template
(which can contain the 'normal' existentials))
