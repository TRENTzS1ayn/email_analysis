Brian--

The f2f page says "It is recommended that participants bring a printed 
copy of these versions of the Model and Syntax and the RDF Schema specs 
which are annoted with paragraph numbers".  Is there some special reason 
for wanting *printed* copies (rather than copies of the documents on 
one's machine)?  The less paper the better....
