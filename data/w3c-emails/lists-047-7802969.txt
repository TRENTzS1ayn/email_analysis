""" Aaron:

Obviously this wouldn't work for N-Triples output from a data in 
which ordering information had been lost ...
"""

RDF doesn't have a natural ordering over statements where the 
above would make sense. You'd be imposing a convenience ordering 
over RDF syntax parsers that doesn't exist in the _model or grammar(s). 
Plus more brittle implementations which are looking at the ordering 
rather than the implied graph, might miss possible equivalences...
but that's programming with side effects for you.

I don't see why tag URIs can't be used for anon nodes...maybe I don't 
see why anon nodes need to be made equivalent or consistent in the 
first place.
