I think that neatly uncovers my unstated assumptions...

I guess I was thinking of statements as an abstraction.  But if we are to 
use N-triples as the reference form then statements have both order and may 
be repeated, and we must rely on the semantics to state the equivalence of 
expressions under duplication or re-ordering of individual statements.

So, on reflection, I agree that N-triples represents a Bag of statements.
