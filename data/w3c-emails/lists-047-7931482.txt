I've been thinking recently about encoding inference rules in RDF, where a 
rule may have a variable that is scoped by the rule; e.g.

    Dog(?x) -> Animal(?x)

Originally, I was thinking that, when encoding this in RDF the variable 
represented by ?x must somehow be scoped within the RDF.  But when I 
started looking at candidate RDF encodings this need for scoping just melts 
away:  the variable is represented by a new, unique resource:  that 
resource has global scope (and, hence, if it has a URI it is one that is 
not shared by any other resource).  The only place where the concept of 
scope is needed is in the original expression.  Some other expression; e.g.

    Cat(?x) -> Animal(?x)

Has a different scope for its ?x, but the resource that represents the 
variable in the encoding of this is a different resource than the one that 
represents ?x in the previous example.

 From this exercise, I tentatively suggest that the scope of any resource 
(node) is global -- the entire universe of discourse.

(I'm trying to be clear that this is an encoding of inference rules in RDF, 
not an attempt to make inference rules part of RDF.)
