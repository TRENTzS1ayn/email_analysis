Brian,

You said:

I think that to "represent exactly the information received" the entire 
RDF/XML document received must be represented verbatim.  I don't think 
we're going there.

In defining RDF, and in particular its semantics, we are in the process of 
identifying the significant information in a received RDF/XML document.  We 
are making choices about what constitutes "information received" (guided by 
the existing XML and RDF M&S specs).

Signatures present an interesting case, because the most trivial change 
(e.g. adding or removing a space in an XML comment) changes/invalidates the 
signature.  So if we mean to convey the exact meaning of a signature (i.e. 
that a certain key signed a certain sequence of bits) we must keep a copy 
of the bits (or at least a copy of the digest of the bits that was signed).

When one takes a signed XML document and interprets it as RDF, I think one 
needs to make some choices about what it means, which will be some function of:
(a) the information conveyed by the bare RDF, and
(b) the information conveyed by the signature

So suppose I receive a statement:

(1)   _:exists-X hasProperty Y .

which is signed Alice.  Also suppose that I apply Skolemization represent 
this information:

(2)   skolem:12345 hasProperty Y .

where I am certain that nobody will independently use skolem:12345 to 
represent any resource.  Now I am not entitled to say that the statement 
(2) was signed by A, but I might legitimately say that I received some 
document signed by A whose content was interpreted to mean (2).

When I sign a cheque, it is a piece of paper that I sign.  When the cheque 
is presented for payment, the bank interpret the signature to mean that I 
have authorized the payment of some amount to some person.  If someone 
writes a telephone number in the margin of the check, the exact content of 
the document is changed, but the authorization conveyed by the signature is 
not.  Thus, any signature as well as the signed document need to be 
interpreted.

A better cheque-based example might be that some banking transactions no 
longer require that the original signed document be presented to the 
payer's bank.  The signed check can be interpreted into some system, and 
then transferred electronically to the paying bank.  Thus, the paying bank 
receives a different document, but in conveys the same authorization 
(modulo adequate trust and security mechanisms).

So when you say:
>My point here is that the abstract model should be able to represent
>*exactly* the information that SOURCE intended to sign.  Any subsequent
>inferences are the responsibility of the recipient.

I would say that "information ... intended to sign" requires some degree of 
interpretation.  How much is a choice to be made.
