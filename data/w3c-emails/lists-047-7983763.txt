I agree.  I should have made clear that my hypothesis here is that it is 
the 'model' that was signed, not the document.

That was not what I meant.

Good example.  You can't say that (2) was signed by A because that is
not the statement A sent.

And the question for me is do we prefer an abstract syntax
that allows us to express what A sent to us, or are we happy to loose
information in the process of transforming RDF/XML to the abstract syntax.

I didn't intend that we get hung up on the nature of a signature.  The
intent was to try to draw attention to the issue of whether the received
model is the same information as the sent one.  I think we've agreed
that if the receiver skolemizes, then the information is not the same.

Consider running the scenario twice and the second time the anon resource
gets skolemized to skolem:54321.  Given 

  (3) skolem:54321 hasProperty Y .

do (2) and (3) represent the same information.  If the answer is yes,
then you must be treating skolem URI's differently from say URL's.  If
the answer is no, they can't both represent the same information as in (1).
