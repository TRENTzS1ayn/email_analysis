Which falls foul of another rule, i.e. inventing a new escaping 
mechanism.  (I assert that adding the ';' terminator changes the escape 
mechanism.)

It is not clear to me that a fixed-length form like \uxxxx or \Uxxxxxxxx 
actually breaks the rule given above:  it depends on one's interpretation 
of "delimiter":  counting is a well-established way of delimiting values in 
some kinds of structure.

Just an observation:  I don't really mind which way we go (but also note 
that a compelling reason that N-triples is as it is is that existing N3 
processors can read it).
