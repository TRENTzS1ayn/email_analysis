OK, you have left me behind already. I don't see any way to get 
anything remotely like that into RDF. I presume this is supposed to 
mean that for any ?x, if it is a dog then it is an animal, right? How 
do we encode universal quantifiers in an exist-conj logic like RDF?

??? Wait. Resources are the things in the world, the things that are 
denoted by URI's, right? One doesnt get quantification by putting 
variables into the *domain* (whatever that means: I'm not sure what 
it means, to be honest. )

Well, I think I follow your point, and indeed one can do something 
like this in conventional logic, where its often called 
'standardizing apart', ie no variable name is ever used twice, so 
there is no risk of getting them confused. But (1) it is unworkable 
in practice, and (2) you still need some way to indicate, or 
determine, the scopes. For example, consider the difference between
foo & (cat(?x) -> animal(?x) )
and
(foo & cat(?x)) -> animal(?x)

Maybe this is my problem. I'm not sure what this distinction amounts 
to. RDF has a 'meaning' already, so how does one get its meaning 
changed so it can do this encoding for you?
