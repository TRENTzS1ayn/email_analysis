He hasn't convinced me yet. Look, its a simple point. The scenario 
involves two agents posting pieces of RDF and someone noticing a 
relationship between those pieces of RDF which triggers some kind of 
commercial transaction.  What is that relationship? If it is that one 
of them entails the other, then the one that is entailed by the other 
was a query, in the required sense. (If it isn't an entailment, what 
is it?)

I think this example has been valuable because it illustrates a much 
bigger and more important point than the one we started with. The 
implied meaning to an English speaker is *completely irrelevant* 
here. RDF is supposed to be used by software agents, not English 
speakers (if we could rely on the native savvy of English speakers, 
we could do it all in HTML). So the only content that any piece of 
RDF (or DAML, or KIF, or any of these 'formal' languages for 
capturing content) actually contains is what some mechanical agent 
could infer from it (together with whatever other pieces of RDF it is 
able to glean from various sources, of course.)

If you apply that criterion to Brian's example, and if you take it to 
be an assertion, then all that you could possibly infer is that four 
things exist and a few relations are true between them. If this is 
supposed to convey the fact that one of these things is a 'service' 
and therefore that it implies that a lot of other things exist (eg 
batches of roses which are available for sale or purchase -I've lost 
track of whether we are selling them or buying them), then something 
needs to say that.  Nothing in Brian's example seems to say that, 
however, so there is no basis for anything to be able to conclude it. 
(I would hazard a guess that the only way to say what needs to be 
said here is to use a universal quantifier, by the way.)
