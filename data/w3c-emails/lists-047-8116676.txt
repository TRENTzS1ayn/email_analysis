Maybe. I think a global unique-name model is sustainable only in a 
very fragile sense: if everyone cooperates and nobody ever makes a 
mistake or gets confused, then it will work. But one error, anywhere, 
could make the entire edifice crumble, since nobody could then rely 
on the global assumption being valid.  In fact, I will undertake to 
be the fly in the ointment, and will offer a universal 
unique-name-wrecking service by generating copies of RDF webpages 
with just the names changed.
