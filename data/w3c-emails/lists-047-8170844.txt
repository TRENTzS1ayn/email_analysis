Sorry, I meant only to provide the back reference, not to rap your knuckles.

Yes.  It would not be representing EXACTLY the same information, 
since there is some information just in the use of the new name. You 
can imagine a conversation going like this:
A: There is a frog in my sandwich.
B. OK. Let's call it 'joe', OK?
A: OK.
Now, there is a small sense in which B has contributed 'information' 
to the discourse simply by giving the frog a name. But its a very 
small sense. Compare with
A: A frog I will call 'joe'is in my sandwich.
B: OK.

To represent *exactly*, yes. But see the section on skolemisation in 
the revised model theory I send out this morning.

OK, I agree. If the source sends you an existential, then you can 
skolemise it, but you should not claim that the skolemised form is a 
valid conclusion from what the source sent you. It isn't.

To illustrate why not, imagine sending it back to the source. If you 
sent back the original, the source could agree that is what it said 
to you; but if you send it back the skolemised form with the new 
name, then it has no way to know if the use of that name might not 
imply all kinds of content that it had not sent you. (If you 
skolemised 'honestly', of course, then it wouldn't, but the source 
has no way to check that.)

However, this really begs the question. If we have genuine 
existentials in  the langauge, then indeed we need to be able to 
distincguish them from uses of names. But the issue, seems to me, is 
whether or not to even have existentials in the language at all. We 
could interpret anaonymous nodes as having 'unknown' URIs, or URI's 
which are assigned arbitrarily in some non-conflicting way, ie 
'dont-care' URIs. Then there would be no real existentials in the 
language at all, so no need for the recipients to be able to make the 
distinction. And, the skolemisation point is, nobody who was making 
assertions would be any the worse off: they could still all say what 
they want to say just as well, but they would be using names to say 
it with.

I agree entirely. The issue is whether we allow people to sign 
documents that express existentials, or whether we insist that 
anything that is said, must be said using 'names' of some kind, so 
that if you want to talk about a frog (even just to say it exists) 
you have to give it a name. It doesn't cramp your style in any 
serious way, is the point.
