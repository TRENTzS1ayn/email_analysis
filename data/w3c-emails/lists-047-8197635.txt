Well, some folks' thinking as I understand it would have it that you have, 
by definition, created a distinct set of resources that happen to deliver 
the same set of entities in response to the same queries.

This is sort-of what I meant by saying they result in the "same model" 
(which is probably not exactly right), in the sense that the resource 
itself is a nearly invisible intermediary between a request that names or 
references the resource (by means of its URI) and a thing one gets back in 
response to the request.  RFC2396 talks of resources as "conceptual mapping"s.

This is all very woolly, and I'm not going to try and defend either view 
right now.  OTOH, if you (or someone) can come up with an irrefutable 
argument why one of the approaches won't work, forcing a choice could help 
to avoid a whole minefield of potential misunderstandings.

I think you're right that there is fragility in some of the assumptions 
about URIs.  I guess the theory is a lot about the way the Web SHOULD work.
