Right. But we could interpret anonNodes so that the sender would have 
, in effect, skolemised, just by treating anonNodes as being in the 
same category as urirefs. The language wouldnt be affected 
significantly as far as making assertions was concerned, and there 
would be a few communication advantages. Eg if anonNodes really are 
exisententially quantified, then there is no way to refer to them 
outside the document in which they occur. You can send me the 
document, but neither you nor I can refer to that thing that exists: 
eg I can't ask you anything about it. If it has a name, I can. Eg

A: there's a frog in my sandwich.
B: what color is it?

We can't do this since we don't have any way to say "it". Contrast:

A: there's a frog which I will call 'joe' in my sandwich.
B: what color is joe?

Right, good example; though I think we have to treat URI's 
differently from URL's in  any case.
