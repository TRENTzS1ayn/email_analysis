Whatever the relationship is, it is not expressed in either of 
the smears of RDF provided in this example.  Or to put it another
way, are you suggesting that it is in some way illegal for me to
describe in RDF a service that buys roses, lest somewhere, there
might be a service that sells roses and I would thus have created
a query relationship between the two and that is beyond the scope
of M&S 1.0?

Right.  The example as originally presented was not clear enough as
much detail had been removed, perversely, to try to make it clearer.
