I concur. My reading of the rule is that the use of a special 
character as an 'end' delimiter should be avoided.

BTW, are N-triples really only an in-group convenience, or are people 
thinking that we are going to endorse it as a public standard? If so, 
I would like to reconsider the line-oriented nature of the syntax, 
which strikes me as being archaic for a serious standard these days, 
and will break immediately the language is extended to anything more 
complicated.
