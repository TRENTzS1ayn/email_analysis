The only case the straw-dog doesnt cover right now is the use of a 
literal as a predicate. This would be OK if the EXT mapping were 
extended to the set LV of literal values, but I didnt know if that 
was considered legitimate. If people are happy with this, it's easy 
to make the modification.

I await input.

PS. It also easy to have only some literal values be predicatable, as 
long as we can characterize the relevant subset.
