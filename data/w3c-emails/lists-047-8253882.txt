?? Again, that seems to be a completely different notion of 
'resource' than the one I have been trying to work with. Brian 
assures me, for example, that unicorns are resources, but I never 
expect to get sent one in response to a request.

> RFC2396 talks of resources as "conceptual mapping"s.

Right. It says, in fact:
-------
          The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of
          entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that
          mapping at any particular instance in time.  Thus, a resource
          can remain constant even when its content---the entities to
          which it currently corresponds---changes over time, provided
          that the conceptual mapping is not changed in the process.
------
which reads to me to be simply incoherent, since if the entity to 
which it corresponds changes, then presumably the mapping to that 
entity also changes (or else it no longer 'corresponds' in any sense 
I can imagine), so whether the resource is the entity or the mapping 
is irrelevant to the issue of whether it retains its identity through 
time.  It may be, of course, that a 'conceptual mapping' isnt 
actually a *mapping*, rather in the way that an imaginary horse isnt 
actually a horse.

I would use a harsher word, myself.
