Well, no. Of course programs rely on such things all the time, but my 
point is that in cases like this the information is NOT being 
conveyed as a 'logical difference', ie in this context, in the RDF, 
but in some other way that is invisible to an RDF processor. Which is 
fine, as long as we face up to that. In the meantime, however, I am 
assuming that what we are supposed to be focussing on here is what 
can be said in RDF.

If we were programming local computations in a limited, known 
context, then we could rely on all kinds of assumptions. But RDF is 
supposed to be publishable on the Web, right? What 'context' can be 
assumed between a publisher of a web page and a reader of that web 
page, beyond the protocols used to transfer the information?

If there are any global assumptions then by all means let us build 
them in. In the strawdog, for example, I assume that literals have a 
fixed global interpretation which never varies, so anyone using a 
literal can assume that any reader will have the same interpretation. 
We can have fixed interpretations for things like rdf:subject (in 
fact for anything starting rdf: or rdfs:). But how do we establish 
globally fixed meanings for things like wholesaleSupplierOfRoses ?

I thought that was the central point of RDF. It certainly is for DAML+OIL.
