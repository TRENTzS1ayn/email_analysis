Aaargh. I really don't know. This is one (of the very few) aspects of 
Sowa's thinking that seems to be completely off the wall. I have had 
many debates with him about it, some lasting for years. Other 
Peircian scholars seem to have the same obsession with this stuff, 
sometimes amounting almost to a religious conviction in a kind of 
Peircian revealed truth. Nobody else seems to think it anything more 
than an embarrassment or a joke, a kind of numerology. I have come to 
the conclusion that there isn't anything in this 
'firstness/secondness/thirdness' that is worth talking about at any 
length, so I won't.

Well, if I was saying that, I wasn't aware of it :-)

I guess so, though you would only know that if you knew that you had 
received the whole document since that is where the existentials are 
quantified (see discussion in the strawdog model theory).

>(unless that already provided constitutes a definite description),

Right, but it can't in RDF since the definite description uses a 
universal quantifer.

Right.

Good question.
