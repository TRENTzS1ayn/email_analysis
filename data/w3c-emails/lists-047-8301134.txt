Pat,

The original RFC 1766 was not written with XML in mind.  Indeed, it 
pre-dates the original XML recommendation by 3 years, and was designed for 
a different environment.  Many Internet protocols have some elements that 
exist for machine-to-machine communication, and other elements that exist 
to be displayed to humans.  For example, in email,  From:, To:, etc. 
headers carry addresses are there to get the mail delivered to the right 
mailbox.  Other fields such as Subject: carry information for human 
consumption.  The intent is that fields intended for human consumption have 
language tags so they can possibly be translated for different audiences, 
or presented through speech synthesis, or handled in some other sender- or 
recipient-language-dependent way.

The distinction is similar to that between XML element names and XML 
(PCDATA) element content.

That said, I do appreciate your point that it is arbitrary to exclude RDF, 
and the language might have been softened in RFC 3066, which does 
acknowledge XML.  I also expect that the authors didn't anticipate 
situations where the content could be either human- or machine 
language.  That would be very unusual in a lower-level network protocol.

BTW, the likely tag, if registered with IANA, would be 
'i-RDF'.  Three-letter tags are reserved for those approved by one of the 
other international standard bodies.

I'll see if I can get some more background on the thinking when I'm at the 
IETF meeting in a couple of weeks.

You also say:

I would suggest that this is an argument to not use xml:lang as the primary 
indicator of the language of a literal.  If there were no xml:lang 
attribute, I suspect the "obvious" way to indicate language would be with 
RDF properties (e.g. per TimBL's interpretation properties [1]).  Surely, 
the "Web Way" to designate a language should use a URI?
