It seems as though the context has some significance in how we
view this scenario.  The participants have intent to establish
commercial transactions.  Lets try a thought experiment, change
the scenario and see how that affects how we look on it.

Two folks, Anna and Bertie have home pages on the web.  For no
other reason than its the done thing to do to be hip, they
include in their home pages RDF statements about where they live
and where they work e.g.

  <Anna>      <livesAt> _:AnnasHome .
  _:AnnasHome <zipcode> "12345" .
  <Anna>      <worksAt> _:AnnasWork .
  _:AnnasWork <zipcode> "54321" .

  <Bertie>      <livesAt> _:BertiesHome .
  _:BeritesHome <zipcode> "12345" .
  <Bertie>      <worksAt> _:BertiesWork .
  _:BertiesWork <zipcode> "54321" .

Pure assertions, yes?  No query, yes?  No intent to create 
a relationship, yes?

Friends of the Planet have noticed this hip behaviour and they
have a web crawler that sucks up this information and looks
for folks with close home and work zip codes and sends them
email suggesting they might like to car share.

Seems to me that the processing that goes in this scenario and
the original are effectively the same.  The point is, that the
query, if there is one, is a feature of a third party, not of
the publishers of the RDF.

BTW, Anna has two homes, both with the same zipcode.

I don't dispute that different processing may be required in
different circumstances.  But those circumstances may not depend
on the intentions of the publishers of the RDF.

Does this shed any light on where I'm going wrong?
My brain is beginning to hurt.
