Oooh!  A bit of Web heresy there, I think.  Depending on one's point of 
view, the typical Web view is something like this:
(a) there is no difference between URLs and URIs -- they're just 
identifiers, or
(b) a URL is just a kind of URI that contains some built-in hints about how 
to use the Web to access the resource it names (e.g., protocol, addressing 
information), which isn't otherwise semantically significant (for RDF).

Any way, I think that treating things differently based on a URL/URI 
distinction is to go on very shaky ground.
