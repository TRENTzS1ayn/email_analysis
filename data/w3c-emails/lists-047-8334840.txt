I recently CCd an email to this thread which I should not have sent, 
particularly in view of its being archived, and am writing to 
apologise for sending it, to express my regrets for any offense it 
may have caused,  and to ask for it to be retracted. The message in 
question is dated  Thu, 26 Jul 2001 13:14:16 -0700 and expressed an 
opinion concerning a paragraph in RFC1766.

If it is possible to delete it from the archive, I would request that 
it be so deleted so as to avoid any further risk of offending anyone.

However, I would stand by the suggestion made in the message that a 
careful reading of RFC1766 suggests that it is not an appropriate 
standard for RDF, since it seems to be predicated on an assumption 
that the lang: tag in XML is solely for use in marking up NL text for 
purposes of direct human use, rather than the more 'machine-oriented' 
uses which have arisen in XML applications and towards which RDF is 
oriented. I hope this point can be considered independently of the 
parts of the message which may have given offense.
