I spoke carelessly. What I should have said (since URLs are URI's, if 
for no other reason) is that URL's can be treated in particular ways 
that may not be applicable to all URI's, and that in RDF we can't 
assume that any URI is going to be URL-like. URLs are a special case; 
as you say, they contain built-in hints about access, but we can't 
assume that all URIs have such hints.
