True, all true.

Ah. OK, as long as we are clear about that, then I agree. I was under 
the impression (and I can no longer remember where this came from, or 
if I just imagined it) that the buyer/seller scenario was supposed to 
be a case where the seller said something existed (to do with 
flowers) and the buyer said he *wished* that something existed, or 
maybe that he was *asking* if something existed, and that was the 
basis on which the match-making worked. If they are both just telling 
the world something, then *everyone* is making assertions.

(I would just mention , though, that FotP are going to be using 
internal inferencing that goes beyond anything that Anna and Bertie 
have said. Which is fine, of course; just thought I'd mention it.)

>BTW, Anna has two homes, both with the same zipcode.

Sure, no sweat. She's only mentioned one of them, but that doesnt 
stop her having more. (Who is this 'Berites' guy, though?)

Yes, thanks.

Eat your spinach and you will be fine.
