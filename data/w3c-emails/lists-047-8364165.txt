The DAML+OIL paper "Coordination points between RDF(S) and DAML+OIL"
identified three changes that the DAML+OIL community  felt were required
in RDF(S).  In my review of that paper, I reviewed those proposed
changes, noting that there had not yet been any discussion of these
issues in RDF Core.  The purpose of the attached paper is to initiate
that discussion, present some of the background material, and briefly
review some of the discussion that had taken place on these issues in
the www-rdf-logic mailing list.
