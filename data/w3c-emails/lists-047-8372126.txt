This is how it seemed to me all along but I thought I'd missed
something.

The seller asserts that he has roses. The buyer asserts that he has the
capacity to accept roses. The two assertions have no (static) link
(apart from some common symbols) until an agent (which may represent an
actual intermediary or just a piece of software that a rose buyer would
use) matches the two assertions under an interpretation that (by the
nature of the agency) matches the two (ie, one applies a matchmaker
algorithm). This algorithm may apply query-like interpretation (and
transformation) to either of the assertions (either a seller's query or
a buyer's query). The assertions are symmetrically disposed until then.

Or have I missed something else?

(My brain has been hurting since I started here...) (Also I'm beginning
to use too many brackets)
