For me it was this front-side-of-one-page web page, derived from a book:

% Formal Systems - Definitions
% (from Ruth E. Davis, Truth, Deduction, and Computation.
% New York: Computer Science press, 1989.)

http://www-rci.rutgers.edu/~cfs/305_html/Deduction/FormalSystemDefs.html

which I was able (I think) to transcribe into larch:
  http://www.w3.org/XML/9711theory/FormalSystem.lsl
  $Id: FormalSystem.lsl,v 1.3 2000/10/31 22:26:31 connolly Exp $

I have since used that knowledge to draft a model theory
for RDF:

  http://www.w3.org/XML/9711theory/RDFSemantics.lsl
  $Id: RDFSemantics.lsl,v 1.2 2001/03/30 18:42:44 connolly Exp $

to go along with an Abstract Syntax:

  http://www.w3.org/XML/9711theory/RDFAbSyn.lsl
  $Id: RDFAbSyn.lsl,v 1.5 2001/03/30 18:42:44 connolly Exp $

I intend to update RDFAbsyn.lsl and RDFSemantics.lsl w.r.t.
recent work of this group, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
