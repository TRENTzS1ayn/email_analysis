Pat,

Brian eventually convinced me that his example was NOT a query.

I could be wrong, but you may have been making the same assumption that I 
made, namely that the description of the buyer service asserted the 
existence of that which was to be purchased.  But on closer examination, 
none of the existential variables in the description actually stood for 
"roses":  ?x stood for the service, and ?y stood for a concept of quantity 
constructed from a number and a unit of weight.

The statement:

     ?x product Roses .

was not saying that ?x was an instance of the product roses;  ?x was the 
service, and the above statement was a description of the service.  I think 
the implied meaning to an English speaker would have been clearer if the 
statement were written as:

     ?x offeredForSaleOrPurchase Roses .
