Folks,

There is a terminology document at:
<http://public.research.mimesweeper.com/RDF/RDFTerminologyConcepts.html>

Proposal: take this document and work it up to a glossary/appendix for
M&S.

Are we within the charter to consider merging such a document into the
M&S? I think it would a useful thing to have. The last relevant post
that I can find on this was from Graham
(<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0144.html>)
.
