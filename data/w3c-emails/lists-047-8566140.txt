Hi Graham,

I know, I raised it (can you tell what book I was reading at the time
:). I'd like to force the issue though, on whether the M&S should
incorporate a terminology/glossary. I think it there should be such a
thing if only because RDF is such a cross-disciplinary technology. I'd
love to help work it up.

Bill
