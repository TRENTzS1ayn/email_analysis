There are various places in the M&S that tie property names to specific
schemas (e.g., P60, sect. 2.2.1, property names must be associated with
a schema, and in 2.2.3).  I don't think this idea is currently reflected
in the model theory is it?  (It would appear to (at least) impact the
definition of vocab(I), and the to-be-written material in Section 9.)
