As one of the self-appointed 'charter cops', I'll say
that I don't believe it violates the spirit of the charter,
so long as the terms it defines are restricted to those
used in the M&S and RDF Schema documents (modulo any
new terms added in the course of clarifying those, such
as using 'graph' to mean an instance of a 'model').
