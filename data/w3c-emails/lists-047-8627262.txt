Just to let you know where friday's minutes have gone...

By convention these should've been shipped on monday; however as I was
scribing, and have since then been entirely occupied with  travelling to
and attending SWWS workshop here in stanford. I've the raw materials on my
laptop and will try to get them done during the drive up to sebastapol.
