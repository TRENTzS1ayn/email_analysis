I digested that by translating it to larch...

In the course of getting it to sort check, I had some questions
about the relationship of the set of resources with the LV
set of literal values. I chatted with Pat a few minutes ago
and I think we sorted it out.

A few other details from my hardcopy:

Larch has a lot of machinery for finite/denumerable sets as opposed
to sets in general. In my larch formalization, I made the vocabulary
of an interpretation a finite set. Is that a fair assumption?

Are literals included in the domain of an interpretation?

[answer after discussion with PatH: yes.]

again, I used larch's finite set gizmo for such as set of triples.
Is it fair to assume that the set-of-triples we're interested in are
finite?

I didn't get much further than this.
