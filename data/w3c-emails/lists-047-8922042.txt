Sometimes I wish this feature of RDF would just go away, but Dave always
insists on bringing it up. ;-) My thoughts:

test1: OK, if we have to. Does anyone feel that this feature is important?
test2: No, I believe this is inconsistent with our new interpretation of
<propElt />. It should be considered an error, in the same way error1 is.
test3: Same as test2.

error1: OK.
