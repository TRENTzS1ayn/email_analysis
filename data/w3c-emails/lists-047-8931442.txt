It would be helpful if you could explain why.  The grammar production

 '<' propName idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/>'

allows it and 
  
    Specifically; each propertyElt start tag containing attribute 
    specifications other than ID, resource, bagID, xml:lang, or any
    attribute starting with the characters xmlns results in the creation
    of the triples {p,r1,r2}, ...

specifies the interpretation.
