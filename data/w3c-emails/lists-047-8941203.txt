The important part comes afterwards:

    r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new
    resource. If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new
    resource.

Since the context of the test cases is the decision that an empty element no
longer creates a new resource, I do not feel that RDF should create any
properties to hang off of that no-longer-existent resource. To do so would
only make things more confusing.
