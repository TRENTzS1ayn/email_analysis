I apologize in advance if I am mistaken, but I believe we were discussing
the test cases in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0059.html

which states it is about "More on empty property elements" so I assumed it
was an addition to the test cases and proposed resolution documented in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0000.html

which is Jan's message about empty property elements.
