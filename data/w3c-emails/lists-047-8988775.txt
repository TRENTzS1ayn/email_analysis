test2 of Jan's first set of tests states that in a particular case,
the object of the statement is a literal, not a resource.

test2 of Jan's second set of tests is a different case, falls under the rules
he refered to in his message and I quoted earlier.  Those rules require
the object of the statement to a resource.  Not to create a resource in this
case would be a change to the spec.

test2 of Jan's first message says nothing about the interpretation of test2
from his second set of tests.  They are different cases.

Would you agree?

Brian
