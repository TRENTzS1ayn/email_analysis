Er... maybe I'm missing something, but I read it twice, and it
seems to reduce to this simple test case: is this an RDF
document or not?

<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
    <rdf:Description>
        <rdf:_1>abc</rdf:_1>
        <rdf:_3>def</rdf:_3>
    </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

The simplest answer that meets my needs is: yes, that's
an RDF document. The parts of the spec that suggest
otherwise are an error.

To my mind, anything that suggest that containers are
fundamental in any way -- that they are anything
more than a standardized vocabulary of classes and
properties and some syntactic sugar -- is an error.

Now this doesn't resolve either of the active issues you
own, danbri, so maybe I missed the gist of your proposal.
