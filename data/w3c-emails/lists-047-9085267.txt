I love LISP but was not given the opportunity to
actually USE it (bad luck).
If you refer to what I called 'is', then we have
to be extremely careful here (and maybe use another
verb). It is really in the sense of

and it is the verb of a statement.
Now your example is cyclic which is not the
case in what we call 'anonymous (sub)graph' --
