Input from the community is always in order; I believe we considered
all the input from the community that was available before we
made our decisions. Then we made the decisons. The errata document
is now out of date, no? (it reflects the decision on
ns-confusion but not aboutEachPrefix; $Date: 2001/05/31 17:23:36 $)

If updating it prompts further input from the community, we can
reconsider our decision(s).

I would have thought just the opposite: updating the errata often
keeps the community in the loop w.r.t. the progress that we're making.

Ah... so it does; that's good...

but I don't see where this comes from:

"Until the results of the WG process are concluded and the W3C Members
review
and approve the results, any conclusions the RDF Core WG reaches should
be considered non-normative."

In what way are the W3C Members expected to review the results
of our errata dicussions?

Hmm... thinking it over, yes, I agree, this is workable.

Maybe it's different from the way I'd have done it, but then...
I believe in He Who Does The Work Makes The Rules.


Ah... one pretty important, if not critical, issue: let's
make the test case repository
  RDF Examples and Miscellaneous Tests
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/

easier to find.

Right now, the link from ns-confusion for test cases goes
to
  http://ilrt.org/people/cmdjb/2001/05/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/
but I don't think DJB and ILRT want the responsibility of
archiving those tests for the web community forever.
