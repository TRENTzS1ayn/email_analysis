I have heard it suggested (on www-rdf-interest and personal communication)
that, whilst this sort of file is an RDF document, the language of
paragraphs P189 thru P193 of M+S (see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part)
imposes behavioural constraints on RDF databases, query engines etc. For
example, I think there was some discussion regarding the Mozilla RDF
API's "proper" behaviour if a element is removed from a list via the API.

Some people have appeared to say "yes this is an RDF doc" to your test,
yet believe P189-P193 impose behavioural requirements on RDF
implementations.

I agree. Would you support the removal of P189-193 from the "RDF formal
model" section of the spec?

Indeed.

[ * danbri does some ACTION archaelogy ]

This appears to have mutated slightly since I was originally ACTION'd in
the first meeting; my apologies for not clarifying things sooner.

[[
Issue Discussion
We discussed 3 technical issues:

#rdf-ns-prefix-confusion
The XML Namespace spec doesn't address unprefixed attributes. We'll have
to live with their bug. RESOLVED: We'll strongly recommend the use of
namespace qualified attributes, and allow but deprecate unqualified
attributes.
#rdf-container-syntax-ambiguity
#rdf-container-syntax-vs-schema
Ora noted that it was an original requirement for RDF that parsing should
not require knowledge of the schema.
The discussion on the latter 2 issues largely occurred in parallel and
became a more general discussion about containers. Several people
advocated deprecating container types and/or making them a separate module
(this also applies to reification).

It also brought out several larger issues:

RDF Syntax vs. Model
We should record more of the history behind various RDF issues.
What is the real-world use of containers and other RDF features? What will
break if we change stuff? ACTION (everyone): send RDF feature usage
information from real-world applications you know of to Guha, who will
collect it.
Modularization can be accomplished via namespaces or documents.
Redefinition of the RDF(S) namespaces may not be required.
ACTION: Dan Brickley will own the "container problem". Ora Lassila will
help.
]]


My action (followed up after the call in a jetlagged discussion with
Ora in Hong Kong) was a follow on from the minuted observation that "The
discussion on the latter 2 issues largely occurred in parallel and became
a more general discussion about containers". The "container problem" that
I went away with Ora to summarise was to look at some of the
broader-than-syntax problems with containers that we touched on in that
call, and come back with an account of the model-oriented (rather than
pure syntax) problems. We focussed on the privileged role given to
containers in the model.

Having convinced myself there is indeed an issue here, I believe it
deserves a separate place in the issue list.

Proposed issue summary:

rdf-containers-formalmodel
[
Parags 189-193 of M+S suggest a privileged role for RDF containers within
the formal model at the heart of RDF. Furthermore, they suggest
largely unimplemented (**need to hear about Jan's
implementation**) constraints, either on XML encodings of RDF, on other
(eg. database implementations) or on both. These paragraphs are either in
error (RDF does allow for partial descriptions) or editorially redundant:
in either case they should be removed.
