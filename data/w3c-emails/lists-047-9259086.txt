More or less, yes.

In detail...  I don't want to lose the axiom that rdf:_1 etc. are
functional/unique properties:

"For a single collection resource there may be at most one triple
whose predicate is any given element of Ord"

though I'm not sure I'm happy with the way that's stated;
and it doesn't belong in this section (where we put
axioms that are layered on top isn't clear. But this axiom
definitely isn't part of the RDF model/abstract-syntax.)

The rest of P189-193 seems either bogus (the bit about no gaps)
or redundant w.r.t. the specification of container syntax
starting at P209

The last sentence sounds more like a proposed for how to resolve
it than a summary of the issue. I mostly agree, but (a) I found
some novelty in the text and (b) the other issue summaries
seem to relfect an attempt to make neutral summaries, without
pre-judging the outcome.

But yes, it's an issue
and it's not subsumed by syntax-ambiguity nor syntax-vs-schema.
