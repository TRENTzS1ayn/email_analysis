Good point. This needs to be preserved somewhere.

This doesn't seem to be made explicit in DAML+OIL axioms btw,
http://www.daml.org/2001/03/axiomatic-semantics.html though perhaps
"f an object C is type ?Container?, then C is a KIF list" does that job.

A possible home for this content within RDFCore's work might be in a
cleanup of RDF SChema section 6., http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327/#mns
"Model and Syntax concepts".

You're right; I was over opinionated. I'm too jetlagged now to suggest a
clean fixup, but I agree that issue summaries shouldn't contain their
resolution.
