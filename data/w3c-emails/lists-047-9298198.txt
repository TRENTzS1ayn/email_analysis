This isn't directly related to the issues list, but I'd like some sort of
notification from the Working Group to the RDF community (perhaps via
www-rdf-interest or some sort of new www-rdf-announce list) about the
decisions of the Working Group. I'd be happy to send these things out, and
suggest they take the short and simple form of something like:

--- BEGIN ---
Subject: ANN-WG: Issue rdfms-abouteachprefix Resolved

On 21st June 2001, the WG decided that aboutEachPrefix would be removed from
the RDF Model and Syntax Recommendation on the grounds that there is a lack
of implementation experience, and it therefore should not be in the
recommendation. A future version of RDF may consider support for this
feature.

Issue:
    http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteachprefix
Minutes:    
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0008.html
Test cases: 
    Not applicable.

Please send your feedback to mailto:www-rdf-comments@w3.org for
consideration by the working group. This decisions is not yet normative but
it does represent the WG's current position.

--- END ---

I feel that this kind of communication with the Interest Group is very
important. It would also be nice if we could put links up to the issues list
decisions on pages like <http://www.w3.org/RDF/>.

In addition to issues, I think that resolutions of general interest to the
RDF public (like the creation of n-triples, etc.) should be sent out too.

Thanks,
