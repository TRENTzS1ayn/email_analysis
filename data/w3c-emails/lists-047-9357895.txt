Confirm following actions completed:

D1: Dan Brickley  send analysis (#rdf-container-syntax-ambiguity and
                  #rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema)to rdfcore-wg list
  DONE.

D2: Brian McBride edit the errata per the resolutions above; i.e. those
    regarding #rdf-ns-prefix-confusion.  [ArtB to work with Brian to get
    Brian write access to the errata and to determine a strategy for
    maintaining the appropriate documents.]
  DONE.

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#3: Jos: review the test cases for rdfms-empty-property-element
  DONE.

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#4: DaveB: review the test cases for rdfms-empty-property-element
  DONE.

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#7: Jan: summarize what XML-Base might do for RDF.
  DONE.

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#8: DanC: send a note to the WG that points

  DONE.


Review status of following actions:

 A1: Dan Brickley: Solicit RDF feature usage info from Guha and report
     back to the group.
  DONE.

 A4: Guha: re #rdfms-reification-required: Present analaysis to list
     for discussion.
  CONTINUES.

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#1: Martyn: create test cases rdfms-resource-semantics
  CONTINUES.

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#2: FrankM: create tests case for reification.
  CONTINUES. (Frank reports these as under development)

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#5: Eric: investigate a test case repository for the
   WG.  The repository must facilitat WG members adding and modifying
   test cases.
  CONTINUES. (Eric reports team access to repository in place)

ACTION: JUN-01-01-#9: Ora: send a note to the WG that describes

  CONTINUES.


Issues discussion:


Issue #1

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-empty-property-elements

  Owner: Jan Grant

Consensus that the test cases are OK.
RESOLUTION: the consolidated test cases represent RDFCore's decision on
  this; the issue can be closed once those test cases are all in one
  place.
AP: 2001-06-08#1: Jan: Consolidate, renumber and repost test cases.


Issue #2

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema

  Owner: Dan Brickley

Some discussion about the behaviour of various RDF implementations with
regard to (re-)numbering container members. The consensus seemed to be
that RDFMS did not preclude an RDF implementation from handling partial
descriptions of containers.
Aaron: pointed out this didn't resolve the open syntax issues.

AP: 2001-06-08#2: Dan Brickley: write this up in more detail for the
        list
AP: 2001-06-08#3: Brian McBride: pick up on the syntax issues now the
        model details have been clarified.


Issue #3

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about

  Owner: Aaron Swartz

Aaron: summarised earlier email discussing this
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0019.html
Aaron: Leaning towards proposal #2
Dave Beckett: third proposal: much code seems to treat rdf:ID and
       rdf:about as effectively synonyms. The triples generated would
       be the same.

AP: 2001-06-08#4: Brian McBride to write up this third proposed
       interpretation
  CONTINUES.


Issue #4

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xml-base

  Owner: Jan Grant

Discussion revolved around whether admitting this to RDFMS was in scope;
their were concerns about versioning requirements since new documents
using xml:base would produce different output on older parsers.
Pat: making RDF malleable in the face of future changes to XML:Base is
      not a good thing.

AP: 2001-06-08#5: Eric: to talk to the XLM Processing Workshop about RDF
      requirements from XML:Base

  CONTINUES. (Take to email)
