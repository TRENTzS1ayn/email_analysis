Hmm... I thought I had sent regrets; anyway, I am pretty sure I wasn't there

> Issue #1

> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-empty-property-elements
> 
>   Owner: Jan Grant
> 
> Consensus that the test cases are OK.
> RESOLUTION: the consolidated test cases represent RDFCore's decision on
>   this; the issue can be closed once those test cases are all in one
>   place.
> AP: 2001-06-08#1: Jan: Consolidate, renumber and repost test cases.
> 
> 
> Issue #2
> 
> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity
> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema
> 
>   Owner: Dan Brickley
> 
> Some discussion about the behaviour of various RDF implementations with
> regard to (re-)numbering container members. The consensus seemed to be
> that RDFMS did not preclude an RDF implementation from handling partial
> descriptions of containers.
> Aaron: pointed out this didn't resolve the open syntax issues.
> 
> AP: 2001-06-08#2: Dan Brickley: write this up in more detail for the
>         list
> AP: 2001-06-08#3: Brian McBride: pick up on the syntax issues now the
>         model details have been clarified.

> 
>   Owner: Aaron Swartz
> 
> Aaron: summarised earlier email discussing this
> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0019.html
> Aaron: Leaning towards proposal #2
> Dave Beckett: third proposal: much code seems to treat rdf:ID and
>        rdf:about as effectively synonyms. The triples generated would
>        be the same.
> 
> AP: 2001-06-08#4: Brian McBride to write up this third proposed
>        interpretation
>   CONTINUES.

> Issue #4
> 
> http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xml-base
> 
>   Owner: Jan Grant
> 
> Discussion revolved around whether admitting this to RDFMS was in scope;
> their were concerns about versioning requirements since new documents
> using xml:base would produce different output on older parsers.
> Pat: making RDF malleable in the face of future changes to XML:Base is
>       not a good thing.
> 
> AP: 2001-06-08#5: Eric: to talk to the XLM Processing Workshop about RDF
>       requirements from XML:Base
