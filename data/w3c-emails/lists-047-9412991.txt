I don't remember, but another consideration was related to an artifact of
the XML encoding: RDF had to something that could be serialized within
HTML docs, which means using XML attributes for literal data, eg. <FOO
rdf:_1="a" rdf:_2="b" />. Since XML doesn't allow for repeated attributes
with the same name, so we needed the numbered container-membership
properties.
