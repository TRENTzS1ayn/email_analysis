I modified the W3C's online RDF sandbox (aka online SiRPAC):

 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/

so that if the user selects the "list triples in N-Triples format"
checkbox, the subsequent page will contain a list of the
RDF's triples in the n-triples format (instead of a table of
the triples).

I also created a new release (1.17) of SiRPAC that includes
the N-Triples support as well as some bug fixes that I've
commited since the 1.16 release:

 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/SiRPAC-1.17.jar 

To get n-triples output from the command line, do something
like:

 % java -classpath SiRPAC-1.17.jar \
       org.w3c.rdf.implementation.syntax.sirpac.SiRPAC \
       -ntriples \
       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/att-0000/01-test1.rdf
       
I've done a little testing and it seems to work OK.  I've done no 
work with quote escaping in the object.
