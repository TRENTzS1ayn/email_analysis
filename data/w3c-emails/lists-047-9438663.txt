Art,

That is fantastic!
I really hope you will like that Leffe triple (one
of the best Belgian beers, at least in my opinion).
I've downloaded the 1.17 and it did the job.
Could it be that some uris are not 'absoluteized'?
(at least I saw things like <foo> as predicate)
Anyhow, have a very nice weekend!

Subject:  SiRPAC release 1.17 - includes NTriples support

I modified the W3C's online RDF sandbox (aka online SiRPAC):

 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/

so that if the user selects the "list triples in N-Triples format"
checkbox, the subsequent page will contain a list of the
RDF's triples in the n-triples format (instead of a table of
the triples).

I also created a new release (1.17) of SiRPAC that includes
the N-Triples support as well as some bug fixes that I've
commited since the 1.16 release:

 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/SiRPAC-1.17.jar

To get n-triples output from the command line, do something
like:

 % java -classpath SiRPAC-1.17.jar \
       org.w3c.rdf.implementation.syntax.sirpac.SiRPAC \
       -ntriples \

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/att-0000/01-test1.rdf

I've done a little testing and it seems to work OK.  I've done no
work with quote escaping in the object.
