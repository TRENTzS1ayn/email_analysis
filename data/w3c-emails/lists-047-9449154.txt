Hi Jos,

SiRPAC has a known bug with absolute URI's.  I documented it
as DEC-06-2000-1 at:

 http://www.w3.org/RDF/Implementations/SiRPAC/SiRPAC-defects.html

Please take a look at the associated problem report:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2000OctDec/0036.html

and test case:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/SiRPAC-bugs/DEC-06-2000-1.rdf 

and let me know if the problem you see is different than the
defect that is documented.

Thanks,

Art
