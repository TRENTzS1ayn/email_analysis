In today's conference call, Aaron pointed out that the XML Base
spec[BASE] states that it is not retroactive, it is something that
developers of new XML formats have to decide whether to use.

More specifically, it says:

  The deployment of XML Base is through normative reference by
  new specifications [...] The behavior of xml:base attributes in
  applications based on specifications that do not have direct or
  indirect normative reference to XML Base is undefined.

Our Charter[CHART] says that
  "The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF
   syntax, nor to reformulate the RDF model".
It also says that
  "Backwards compatibility with existing RDF applications
   is a priority for the RDF Core Working Group". 

Given those statements, it is pretty clear that the WG has to
leave xml:base untouched for now. I suggest a resolution
such as:

  On 2001-06-?? the WG decided that the behavior of the xml:base
  attribute must remain undefined for the 1.0 RDF Model and Syntax
  specification. Creators of documents following the 1.0 RDF
  syntax SHOULD NOT use the xml:base attribute.

Those of us who would like to see it available for use in
RDF will have to do it somewhere other than in the syntax part
of a clarified M&S spec.

Ron
