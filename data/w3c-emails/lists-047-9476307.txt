not sure
I saw it happen with http://www.agfa.com/w3c/rdf/brian.rdf
but that is of course a testcase (and I guess Brian would
agree to put it at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/)
BTW, I'm preparared to do regualar 'regression' tests
with cwm, Jena and SiRPAC, because I think it is
good that their N-triples results converge)
