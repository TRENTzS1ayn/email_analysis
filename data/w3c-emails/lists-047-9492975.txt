With respect to action:

  AP: 2001-06-08#3: Brian McBride: pick up on the syntax issues now the
        model details have been clarified.

from last weeks teleconference, I would like to propose the attached 
McBride/Beckett proposal for parsing containers.  This proposal was circulated
on RDF Interest in December 2000 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Dec/0082.html

and has been received positively.

Feedback at the time this proposal was originally circulated suggested that
the interpretation of rdf:li as an attribute should be modified, e.g. in:

  <rdf:Bag rdf:li="foo"/>

There have been two proposals:

  o disallow rdf:li as an attribute

  o define rdf:li as an attribute to always translate to rdf:_1.

I suggest that rdf:li be disallowed as an attribute.

Another weakness of the original proposal is that it is not clear what
tripes to generate for the following case:

  <rdf:Bag rdf:_1="1", rdf:_2="2"/>
    <rdf:li>?</rdf:li>
  </rdf:Bag>

That said, if the WG raises no objections to the general thrust of the proposal,
I will create a fuller set of test cases.

Brian
