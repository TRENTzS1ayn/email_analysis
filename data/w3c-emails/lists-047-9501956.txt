I have a question about this proposal. It says:

  3) rdf:li processing

     This description of rdf:li processing is described in
     terms of an implementation.  Parsers are not required
     to implement it this way, but however they implement
     it, the effect should be the same as if it had been
     implemented as described here.

     rdf:li, when it is encountered in the propName (6.14)
     production, is transformed to an ordinal property, i.e.
     one of rdf:_1, rdf:_2 etc.

     It is transformed to the successor of the last ordinal
     property encountered within the current element.  If
     this is the first ordinal property encountered within
     the current element, then ....

My question is, do 'when it is encountered' and 'last ordinal 
property encountered' refer to the time-sequence in which the 
encounterings occur, and doesn't that depend on the implementation 
details of the parser? And if so, what does the requirement in the 
first paragraph even mean?

If 'encountered' has some more technical meaning in this context 
which makes it clear from the syntax what order the encountering has 
to happen, then it might be better to state the ordering in those 
terms (?)
