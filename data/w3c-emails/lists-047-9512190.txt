Now that we've wrapped up rdfms-empty-property-elements I suggest that it's
time to finish rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr. I hope I'm not stepping
outside of my bounds here (as DaveB is really the issue owner) but I'd like
to put forth a proposal.

I'd suggest that the example in the issues list:

    <rdf:Description>
      <foo:bar rdf:ID="foobar" rdf:resource="http://foobar"/>
    </rdf:Description>

be interpreted as:

    _:genid foo:bar <http://foobar> .
    <#foobar> rdf:subject _:genid .
    <#foobar> rdf:predicate foo:bar .
    <#foobar> rdf:object <http://foobar> .

DaveB, in his original proposal[1], decided that ID and resource could not
be used because in an empty XML element, ID pointed to the object of the
element. He later said[2] that the issue could be looked at again if
empty-property-elements were decided differently. As they are now decided to
eliminate the portion of the spec that cause the confusion, I suggest that
the interpretation of ID be changed to fit with the test case above.
