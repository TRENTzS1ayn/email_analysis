On the one hand: this seems like the obvious interpretation.
I had to poke around to figure out why anyone would think otherwise.
(hand pointer:
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr)

looks like a bug in the grammar of the RDF spec, to me.

So I sorta second this proposal; but on the other hand...

I'm afraid rdf:subject/predicate/object are Broken As Designed,
and that they need a level of quoting to be useful; i.e.

     <#foobar> rdf:predicate "....foo#bar" .
     <#foobar> rdf:object "http://foobar" .

(dunno how you'd give the rdf:subject in this case;
it's anonymous.)

use/mention and reification: rdf:predicate/subject/object

So don't put me down as endorsing the way rdf:predicate/subject/object
are used in Aaron's proposal. In fact, I'm inclined to postpone
all issues about reification (and resource semantics etc.)
until more of the mundane syntax issues have been resolved.

On balance, I guess I'd be happy to see this resolved, provided
the "attention developers" stuff says that we're likely
to revisit the way rdf:predicate/subject/object work.
