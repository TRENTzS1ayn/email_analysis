As I understand things, in XML the order of elements in a document is
significant, i.e.

  <foo:bar>1</foo:bar>
  <foo:bar>2</foo:bar>

is not the same document as:

  <foo:bar>2</foo:bar>
  <foo:bar>1</foo:bar>

So really the proposal is saying that the rdf:li's are processed in
document order.

Note that this is not true for attributes on elements.  Thus

  <foo:bar rdf:_1="1" rdf:_2="2"/>

is the 'same' document as:

  <foo:bar rdf:_2="2" rdf:_1="1"/>

and that is the reason for the second problem I acknowedged in 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0122.html

The first paragraph is basically acknowledging that the proposal as
given is written in procedural terms, and that it should be re-written
in a declarative style.

Yes.  I agree.  Now if I could just get an hour or two ...
