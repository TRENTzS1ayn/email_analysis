This brings me on to an ambiguity in the grammar that needs sorting out.

Skipping for a moment the use/mention arguments about reification (and
the base URI problem*), I got very close to this test case (although
looking back, I didn't include it) in my first message about
#rdfms-empty-property-elements:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0000.html

Which people seemed to be in agreement with. Modulo arguments about
expressing reification, I'm in agreement here (although you left out an
rdf:type arc).

HOWEVER. The reason behind my second message on the subject:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0059.html

was this: paragraphs 229-243 of M+S
http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#229

give another interpretation for rdf:id (in particular P232) if it
appears. In particular, there are two conflicting interpretations for

<blah:propname rdf:id="foo"></blah:propname>

(which people seemed happy to indicate reification - see my test case
here:)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/att-0000/09-test5.rdf

and

<blah:propname rdf:id="foo" />

which currently matches a different clause in the grammar (the last
alternative of production [6.12] with zero occurrances of propAttr) and
which has a different interpretation (accoring to para 232).

Since these two cases are indistinguishable as XML, this is a problem.
Thus, (again, modulo the "how do we do reification" argument), M+S needs
a revision of paragraph 229-234 to bring them into accordance with
Aaron's, Brian's, (my) etc. understanding of rdf:id.

Otherwise, +1.

* I don't want to make it seem that I'm making a big issue of this. I'd
just like to know how to couch my test case output; that's all.
