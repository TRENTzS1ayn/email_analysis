Hi Jan,

I understand the problem.  If we can get a permanent directory structure for
test cases then the problem will go away.

How about for the moment we assume that all test cases have uri's of the
following form:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/[issue-id]/testnnn.rdf

and results are

  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/[issue-id]/testnnn.nt

where [issue-id] is e.g. rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr

Brian
