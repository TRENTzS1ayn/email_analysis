Now that we are getting on a roll resolving issues, I'd like to keep the
pipeline reasonably well stocked.  So I'd like to call for volunteers to own
the following issues:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-aboutEach-on-object
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-nested-bagIDs
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach
