So if the above is a typedNode [and I thank Brian for catching
my error], then the triples suggested in:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0138.html

don't seem to be correct.

I have a question about BNF.  Given:

 [6.2] obj            ::= description | container
 [6.3] description    ::= '<rdf:Description' idAboutAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/>'
                         | '<rdf:Description' idAboutAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '>'
                                propertyElt* '</rdf:Description>'
                         | typedNode


is there a left-to-right precedence with the '|'?  That is
since description is first, does it bind more tightly than the
container?  Or does the '|' have no associated precedence?
