I don't remember making the comment, but I can reconstruct some possible 
rationale...

Attributes (and elements) beginning with xml are already special cases in 
XML.  xml:base and xmlns spring to mind.

By being clear that attributes beginning with xml do not generate triples, 
we avoid the situation that future developments of XML might change the 
output generated for some given document:

   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=... ...>
     <rdf:Description rdf:about='#foo' xml:fudge='...' />
   </rdf:RDF>

Absent an interpretation for xml:fudge, it would appear as an RDF attribute 
of the RDF resource #foo.  A subsequent definition of xml:fudge to affect 
XML infoset generation could change that.
