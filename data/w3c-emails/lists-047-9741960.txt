I'd love to move containers out of the core, but I just don't believe it's
feasible because of the special interpretation of the rdf:li element. Which
is really too bad, because I'd love to massively simplify the core. I
suppose we could always subset RDF... but I'll save those plans until we get
closer to writing a spec.
