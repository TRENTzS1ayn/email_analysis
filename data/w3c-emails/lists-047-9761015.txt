Hi Aaron,

The proposal:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Dec/0082.html

say:

 [[

  4. Proposal
   ========

   1) Parsers MAY NOT implement the specific productions
      6.25-6.31.  This has no effect on the language as
      anything that matches these productions also matches
      other productions in the grammar.
 ]]

Are you [or Brian] saying this means that rules 6.25-6.31 will be 
removed?
