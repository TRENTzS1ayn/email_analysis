The following WG members should have received an email message
regarding a new account so that they have write access to the WG's 
test repository:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/

Dave Beckett dave.beckett@bristol.ac.uk    dajobe     
Frank Boumphrey bckman@ix.netcom.combckman
Jos De Roo jos.deroo.jd@belgium.agfa.comjosderoo
Jan Grant Jan.Grant@bristol.ac.ukjang
Martyn Horner martyn.horner@profium.comhorner
Frank Manola fmanola@mitre.orgmanola
Stephen Petschulat spetschu@ca.ibm.comspetschu

The following WG members already have a W3C account and access
to the above repository has been extended:

Brian McBride brian_mcbride@hp.com bwm
Aaron Swartz aswartz@upclink.comaswartz

I generated these lists from those that asked for access during
the June 01 phone conference:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0008.html

plus my recollection of additional members that have outstanding
action points to create tests.  Please notify me if you are not on the 
above list and want write access to the repository.

Apparently, the above people should be able to create files and
directories but one of the W3C Team members (DanB, DanC, Eric or
I) must set the ACL so that the world can see the new file/dir.
