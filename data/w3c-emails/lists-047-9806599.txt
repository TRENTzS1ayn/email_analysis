Here (fwd'd) is Guha's feature usage summary, as solicited/closed per
action A1 in our last teleconf:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0109.html

Recap: Guha was soliciting implementation feedback from WG members on the
parts of RDF that they've used. He didn't get much input, so we just have
a quick summary below. I might add that my experience of RDF deployment
is similar: grudging use of the built-in container vocab, little use for
reification as currently specified.

Didn't get much. People use the basic triples. Two companies
use containers. No company uses reification.
