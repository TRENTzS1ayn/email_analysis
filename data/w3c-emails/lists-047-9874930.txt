(that's a little stronger, but i think we basically agree...)
We don't want it all to go away, just to "go away" from that (central,
foundational) section of the spec. As DanC
noted last week, there are some constraints, such as that being the n-th member
of a container is a uniquely identifying property (ie. that each
rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty is a daml:FunctionalProperty ((?)),
which  will need to be written down somewhere in one of the WG's specs...
