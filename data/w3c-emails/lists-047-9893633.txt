Forgetting reification for now, are you saying that we should completely
drop *all* mention of the RDF container machinery (bag/seq/alt/li and
syntactic support)? Unless you can show them to be undeployed and broken
beyond repair, this seems to me to go beyond our charter. RDFCore is a
clean-up operation not a rewrite. More importantly, dropping containers
would be somewhat over the top: the main problem with the container stuff
is the central role that M+S gives it. As a handy (if quirky) piece of
vocab it is often useful (eg. as deployed in the RSS 1.0 spec,
http://purl.org/rss/1.0/). I believe we can re-present RDF in terms of a
slimmed down formal model spec plus and syntax and  various bits of
utility vocab (schema stuff, containers etc). I don't really see what
purging containers entirely from our specs would buy us...

(forgive me if i misread your comment)
