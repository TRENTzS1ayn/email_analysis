but I was (again) too implicit
1. it was learning to use jigedit
2. it was following Brian's testcase naming proposal
3. it was taking the simple RDF pieces (and obvious changes)
   from the issues document
4. it was with a (now corrected) typo
   /2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-propElt-id-in-dr/test1.rdf
                                               ^^with
5. it was without .nt reference results (because they
   are not yet clear to me)

so I hope to have made my mess a bit clearer
