I dunno if Guha lost my response, but I've got experimental code that
uses reification - it sprang out of the "context" meeting that Graham K,
Brian and a mob from the ILRT had a while ago. Not using it in
production though.

It's worth adding that I've got NO "grudging use of container vocab"
because at the time I did this stuff (which I've got on my "to-revise"
list come July) I hadn't slapped a parser on top of the API :-/

I use containers. I've got some API support for them. Never had much to
do with N3. I've toyed with support for statement sets and node sets in
an API, but nothing's settled donwn there yet.

I use reification, too. In fact, I've got a "model within a model" class
(I call it ContextModel) which represents a model with RDF as a
collection of reified statements*. It's mostly experimental, but I'm
(very slowly) building a web-of-trust app on top of it. I've also got a
lightweight record-retrieval mechanism built on top of RDF which can use
reification to ask queries about queries - not had much use for it thus
far though.**

Same here. It's quite handy to not have to give something a URI.

* Actually, it's a little more complex than that for efficiency reasons,
but that's the gist.

** primarily because I've got better things to do than sit down and
build a UI for it.
