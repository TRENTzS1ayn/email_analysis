Er... thanks for the details about which parts of

Please let's not wordsmith this resolution stuff any more.
As a group, we made the relevant decisions and
we're done with this, provided the associated actions
get done presently; i.e. provided you provide
test cases and BrianM links them from the errata
document, as we agreed last Fri.

  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/errata
still shows

Did EricM get you what you need to write to it?
