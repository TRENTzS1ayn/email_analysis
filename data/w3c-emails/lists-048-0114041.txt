Dave,

Thanks for this.  A couple of nits:

In test 2, should the rdf:bagID attribute not be an ID rather a full URI.

Did you have a particular reason for not including illegal examples?  Is it
not essential to include some?

Finally, and I hate to burden you further, but would it be possible to
make the text of the test cases visible in the message.  Right now, accessing
the mail archive I have to do a view page source to get to see the test cases.

Brian
