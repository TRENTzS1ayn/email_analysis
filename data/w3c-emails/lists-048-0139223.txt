I didn't want to wordsmith them further but I wanted a full record of
exactly what we had agreed and there were still some changes I had to
merge in from in the meeting.

Additionally, I remembered somebody wanted the specific changes to
the grammar enumerated exactly and I said I would do it, which would
then be linked with the errata section.  I thought that was you Dan,
but I can't remember exactly or see it in the irc logs.
