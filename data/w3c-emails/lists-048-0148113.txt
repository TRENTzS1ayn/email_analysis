Perhaps we should not take this all on at once, but I'm hoping that the
format we choose is usable with standard tools (diff/sort) and provides a
canonical version useful for other things (digital signing, transport,
etc.).

Personally, I'm not much in the mood for coding and debugging a graph
matching tool. However, I can write a script to output the format I suggest
in only a couple of lines and code already exists to read it (the various N3
parsers).
