Certainly, I do not think we can leave aboutEachPrefix in its current form.
I see two possibilities:

    1) Have it generate triples, rather than make such a wide assertion. So:

<rdf:Description rdf:aboutEachPrefix="http://example.org/">
    <s:prop>Blah</s:prop>
</rdf:Description>

would generate something like:

<http://example.org/> :aboutEachPrefix [ s:prop "Blah" ] .

    2) Remove it from the spec and recommend that RDF users instead choose a
       higher-level system such as URIspace:

        http://www.w3.org/TR/urispace
