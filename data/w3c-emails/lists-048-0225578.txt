Ah... sorry, I missed that. Very good.

Er... what we agreed to is (supposed to be) in the meeting
record; is your message (of Wed, 30 May 2001 16:27:01 +0100)
intended as a correction to the minutes?

Looking at it that way, it looks mostly OK, except that
I don't remember deciding exactly how we'd fix the grammar.

I'd prefer to stay with the record of our decision as is
(in my message of Fri, 25 May 2001 13:21:52 -0500) but
I don't have a strong preference.

BrianM and Danbri, please do include, in the agenda
for this Friday's meeting, any corrections to the
record of our meeting from last week that you think
are in order.

I've updated these...

# I've incorporated these changes:

#BrianM Wed, 30 May 2001 16:31:32 +0100

Feel free to use them as the meeting record;
make copies if you like.
