Sure it is.

No, I think what the community said was that there's just
one XHTML language; i.e. the XHTML namespace is the
XHTML namespace is the XHTML namespace.

That doesn't necessarily carry over to RDF. It certainly
doesn't carry over to XSLT, where there are at least
two extant dialects with different namespace names (one
from Microsoft, another from W3C) nor for XML Schema,
where there are several dialects from W3C with
different namespace names.

But XML syntax isn't built using namespaces, so it can't
use namespaces as a versioning mechanism.

Sure it is! It's one of the main motivations for namespaces.
