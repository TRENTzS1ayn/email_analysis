If we can use namespaces for versioning in RDF, no one would be more
delighted than myself!

However we need to make it clear that that is what we are doing. A
parser must understand how a document is to be interpreted.

I must say that I have some misgivings though. Using namespaces may
make things very difficult for the parser.  if we have a strict
versioning, the parser can find out the version, and switch over to
that mode. On the other hand, usinf namespaces it will it cope with
