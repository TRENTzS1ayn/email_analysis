The way I was looking at it, was that removing the 'MUST NOT' was removing
constraints on the behaviour of an RDF processor.  That doesn't prevent us
having examples that are not legal RDF.

I personally feel it would be useful to do so.  I have attached a couple
to this message for you to consider.  [Hope I get the cloaking right].
