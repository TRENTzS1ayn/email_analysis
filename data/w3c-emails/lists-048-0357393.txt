well, this is one of the best approaches I ever heard!

yes, we work on the almost and have a simple case running
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/animal.n3 as given
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/animal-simple.n3 as query
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/animal-result.n3 as result

the idea is
given the 'n3 normal format'
proof the 'n3 simple format'
(using a resolution algorithm)

btw the http://www.w3.org/2000/11/mr76/rdfc25May.n3 testcase is
    also working now (and we also see DAML coming in quickly)
