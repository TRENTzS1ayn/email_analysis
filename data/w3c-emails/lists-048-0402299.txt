Very nice work.

A quibble, just to show I read it carefully:

This isn't an anonymous node; it's just a relative identifier:

  @prefix : <#> .
  :genid <http:...> <...>.

I'm proposing that we use
_:genid <http:...> <...>.

i.e. no @prefix, just _:name. TimBL hacked support for it yesterday;
let's see if it works...

yup...

$ python2 cwm.py --quiet --rdf
http://ilrt.org/people/cmdjb/2001/05/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test01.rdf
--n3=spart --bySubject
    
    <http://example.org/resource1/>     <http://example.org/property>
"bar" .

hm... test2 doesn't work as well; cwm.py doesn't believe in bagID.

in test4.n3, you've got a relative reference in your expected results,
resulting from rdf:ID="foo". We're going to have to specify the
base URI as part of test inputs so that we can absolutize everything
consistently.

Aha... test5 allows me to show what I'm after:

$ python2 cwm.py --quiet --rdf
http://ilrt.org/people/cmdjb/2001/05/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test05.rdf
--n3=spart --bySubject
    
    <http://example.org/resource1/>     <http://example.org/property>
_:0 .
    
    _:0     <http://example.org/property2> "bar" .

I'm using

re test6: whoa! I didn't realize rdf:type as an attribute
was special syntax; i.e. that it takes a URIref rather
than a literal. None of the code I've written groks that.
Learn something new every day, I guess.
