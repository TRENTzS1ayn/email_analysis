Umm... I have a (standing) conflict at that time every week;
I'm not sure how I'll resolve it, so I offer tentative regrets
for this week's RDFCore WG telcon.

This is done to my satisfaction:
  Test cases: format of input and output Jan Grant (Fri, May 25 2001)
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0188.html

Please add an agenda item for discussion of test case expected results.
In particular, I'd like folks to discuss my proposal

For those that grok perl, this is sort of a specification:

  $Id: n3-simple.pl,v 1.2 2001/05/30 22:34:14 connolly Exp $

In case I don't make the telcon, I just have one clarification
to the proposal: any number of spaces (unicode character 32;
not newlines, tabs, etc.) are allowed between terms in a statement (P S
O.)
and after the '.'; lines are separated by \n or \r\n (where \n is
unicode
character 10, and \r is character 13; UTF-8 is the encoding used
thruought.)
[The perl code doesn't grok \r\n yet.]
