OK, fixed those.

Hmm, can't seem to get the CVS of cwm updated for me:

  cvs server: failed to create lock directory in repository `/sources/public/2000/10/swap': Permission denied
  cvs server: failed to obtain dir lock in repository `/sources/public/2000/10/swap'
  cvs [server aborted]: read lock failed - giving up

Yeah I noticed that so had to construct what I thought the n3 should
be, using the M&S bagID example and encoding the triples emitted from
the SiRPAC demo.

I'll just leave it for the moment until we get something precise for this.

Oh yeah, isn't rdf's xml syntax fun - you need to write a parser to
appreciate what a joy it is.  rdf:type as an attribute isn't seen
much but is legal.
