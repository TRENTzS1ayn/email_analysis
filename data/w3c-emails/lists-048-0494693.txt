Isn't the requirement here a bit more stringent? log:includes, at least from
the name, implies a sort of subClass semantics -- that one includes the
triples of the other, but may include other triples. Shouldn't we insure
that a processor _only_ generates the correct triples and nothing more? Or
am I misunderstanding log:includes?
