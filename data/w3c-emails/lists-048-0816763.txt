You told me that I had it wrong, but you didn't tell me what was right :-)

Well, OK, but that is completely at odds with everything the M&S says 
about reification. A reified statement is supposed to be a 
reification *of a statement*, ie of a triple, right? In your account 
here, the reification of the triple

<mary> <hit> <ball> .

has exactly the same content and meaning as the original triple. If 
this is the case, what is the point of using reification at all? All 
one has done is to provide another way to write the same thing.

[Later. Oh, I see what the answer might be: same proposition, but not 
same assertion. Reification here isn't thought of as a metalevel 
assertion, but rather as a way of sidestepping assertion. The point 
being that the unreified triple is asserted in any graph in which it 
occurs, but the reification is not asserted. Is that the idea?]

Tell you what, rather than get into an immediate debate about this, I 
will try to write a short summary of various views on what 
reification  means, which that will give us something to refer to. (I 
now have four of them. ) I was planning to do this last week but got 
zapped.
