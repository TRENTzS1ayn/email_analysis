No no, wait a minute. You are having your cake and eating it. That 
triple doesn't conform to your proposed idiom; it uses the literal 
label in object position on an arc not labelled with a datatype 
mapping. If you allow this kind of triple and also your bNode idioms, 
you need to somehow connect them. Can we infer one from the other? 
Both ways? If so, the simple idiom (as you have here) is equivalent 
to the extended bnode form, so why do we need the latter? If not, how 
do we manage to establish any kind of inferential connection between 
them?
