Hi Pat,

Literals formed the main technical discussion at the telecon last Friday.  My 
understaning, (haven't checked the minutes yet) is that we agreed that there is 
an important choice to be made between on the one hand your choice 2, where the 
type is 'part of' the literal, and other choices where the type information is 
represented in the structure of triples.

I'll probably get this wrong from logical point of view, but I've got another 
terminological problem.  I wonder if it would help to talk about representing 
instances of concrete data types, such as int, date, float etc, thus 
distinguishing between what RDF currently calls literals and these other beasties.
