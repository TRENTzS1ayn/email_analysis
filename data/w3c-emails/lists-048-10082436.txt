I agree as well, but with the caveat that those other documents need to 
be written too!  They don't necessarily have to be products of the WG 
(although they can be), but if the folks that know the specs best (which 
we hope at least *include* those that write them!) also know things 
about pitfalls (in either meaning or implementation) that readers/users 
of the specs are likely to fall into (typically because the writers have 
fallen into them themselves), or have other useful guidance that could 
be provided, ideally that *should* be provided (in clearly separate 
material).
