There was discussion about this a few weeks ago in the
rdf-interest list (or was it rdf-logic...?)

Anyway, the gist is that if both a local type and a range
are defined, then the range can be seen as prescriptive such
that a value can be deemed invalid if the local type is 
not equivalent to or a subclass of the range type.

If no local type is defined for the value, then the range
can be seen as descriptive of the type of the value.

The latter is all fine and good, until we think about lexical
forms and the fact that lexical forms are specific to a
given data type, and thus, the descriptive approach is not
reliable as it may suggest an interpretation for which the
lexical form is either not valid or "unknown".

See my other discussion about this point posted today, along
with the assertion (which you are apparently going to take
umbrage about) that range is *only* prescriptive...

Cheers,

Patrick
