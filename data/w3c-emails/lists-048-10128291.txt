We can use fiat to solve this use case:

"1: All RDF datatypes MUST provide a canonical lexicalization 
   s.t. a = b iff canonical-lex(a) = canonical-lex(b)"
 2: A well-formed RDF/XML document MUST use the canonical lexicalization
   for each literal."


Then an out-of-the-box M&S RDF will work.
Somewhat ugly, but robust; well up-to rounding errors.

I note that CHARMOD uses this approach to strings, where there is more
than one equivalent lexicalization of certain (non-US English) strings,
one (known as NFC) is the canonical form, and well-formed XML documents
must use that one. 
Perhaps I am too uncritical of CHARMOD.
