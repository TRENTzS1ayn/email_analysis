(The example I use is "chat".  ((we actually had an email
adderss for feiendly team discussion chat@w3.org and had a problem
when Mlle Catherine Chat joined the Paris office and wanted chat@w3.org)))

No, it would be the fault of the standard which said it SHOULD treat
the strings as syntacticly different but didn't have to!


Never mind higher forms of equivalence -- if the whole language is
built on something which has ambiguity in syntactic identity of literals,
then  the whole thing is weak.

Remember that a vast amount, of Semantic Web deployment
will be as glue between existing systems which work in other
languages.  The bank's systems and the calendar system and the
programming langauges and database systems they are written
have ASCII strings or Unicode
strings, but they don't have (lan,g,ustring) pairs as fundamental
data types.  So in most real cases, the name is going to matched
up with something which has no langauge tag.  So the database join
for example, will be using a language-tag-independent notion of
equality.   But then all the RDF-based systems will be built
using language-inclusive identity.  What of the things built on
top? Of DAML equiavalnce as used in cardinality etc?
