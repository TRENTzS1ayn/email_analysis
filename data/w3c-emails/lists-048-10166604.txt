There is no syntactic marker of the boundary, which is the point. How 
do we define the merge of two documents?

The MT works fine, but the issues of how to handle anonymous 
resources gave us incredible trouble. Maybe they shouldnt have done, 
but they did.

NO!! That's the point. The merge of two graphs is a meaningful graph, 
and the union of two sets of triples is a set of triples. But the 
document consisting of that set of triples doesnt correspond to the 
graph got by merging the graphs. The only way to describe the proper 
'merge' of two triples-documents requires us to talk explicitly of 
renaming, standardizing apart, generating names, etc. etc. ; its a 
mess. A familiar mess, but a mess nonetheless. We found a way to get 
out of the mess. Its worth being a little careful with a few 
definitions to stay out of the mess.
