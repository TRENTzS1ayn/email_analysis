Well, I thought I was clear, but now I am completely confused.

>  M&S uses the term predicate for a component of a statement.

That means a triple, right? Or a [node/edge/node] combination in an 
RDF graph. Or does 'statement' mean something else? Right now, as I 
understand it, there are triples in Ntriples,  pieces of graph in the 
graph syntax, and more complicated pieces of syntax in RDF/XML. Which 
of these is called a statement?

I thought the subject (being a piece of syntax) was a [node labelled 
with a] uriref.

>The predicate must be a property

Which of these terms refers to a syntax class and which to something 
else? (And I thought the syntactic thingie in the middle of a triple 
was a uriref, in any case.)

>The object may be a resource or a literal.

uriref or literal, I presume. Or did you mean 'resource or literal value'?

>The terms predicate and property in M&S mean different things.

But you just said that the predicate WAS a property. If they are the 
same, how can they be different?

What distinction???
