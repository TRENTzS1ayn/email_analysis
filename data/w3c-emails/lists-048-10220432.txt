I wish I'd been there.

Right, that is a basic choice, I agree. However I now think that we 
can provide a single mechanism that accommodates both cases (as far 
as the MT is concerned anyway.) So if a literal has its typing 
built-in, then fine; but if not, then it can be determined from 
context. You can have it both ways.

I guess Ive been assuming that a general-purpose literal datatyping 
mechanism ought to be able to handle things like this, up to a point 
at any rate. I presume that if someone were to invent a new 
datatyping scheme for some purposes, say mathxsd:float or some such, 
then in an ideal world it should be possible to adapt RDF smoothly to 
use that without going back to the drawing board. So even if they are 
not RDF literals right now, we ought to fix things so that they could 
be considered literals without completely re-doing everything, 
provided that we can do it relatively easily.
