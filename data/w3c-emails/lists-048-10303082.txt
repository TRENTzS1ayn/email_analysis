Its only a slight matter. Sets are more traditional and its slightly 
easier to state some of the lemmas. No big deal either way. What I 
would like however is for us to decide it one way or the other, 
because I have to re-do the math every time we change it.

Yes, we can do that. Everyone go on that?
