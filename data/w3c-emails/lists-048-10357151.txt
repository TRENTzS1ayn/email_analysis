Umm, I think I'd classify it as just another consequence of the
particular tree structure, not more fundamental than that. The real
reason is that there's no local identifier attached to a bnode* in a
serialisation.

Anyway, this all sprang from a rather disastrous foray into XSLT on my
part; unfortunately, when someone asserts that a language "is Turing
complete" I tend to produce code that resembles a state machine with a
huuuge tape.
