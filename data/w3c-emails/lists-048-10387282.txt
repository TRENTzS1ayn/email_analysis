according to http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2000/10/swap/log.n3
[[[
   log:conjunction a rdf:Property;
       rdfs:label "conjunction";
       rdfs:domain log:List;
       rdfs:range  log:Formula;
       rdfs:comment """"A function to merge formulae: logical AND.

   The subject is a list of formulae.
   The object, which can be generated, is a formula containing a copy
   of each of the formulae in the list on the left.
]]]
so I have done it completely wrong, sorry for the confusion
the intention is to have
--> there is something, say _:a1
    and that something is the merge of a set of graphs
    identified by those URI's in object position
    (and then of course that merged graph entails a graph)
help...
