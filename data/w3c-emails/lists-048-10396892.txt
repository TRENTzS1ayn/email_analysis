I wrote something on RDF's "striped" syntax last week, after realising
that the notion of it being striped was what helped me "get it"
originally. Not sure if it makes sense for the primer, but here it is
anyway: http://www.w3.org/2001/10/stripes/

Still working on RDFS, hope to send something from Boston tonight.

Running for taxi,

Dan
