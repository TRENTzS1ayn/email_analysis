  ACTION: 2001-10-19#8 DaveB.  Email URLs of issues to be discussed/resolved


Starting from the list of issues related to syntax in
  RDF/XML Syntax Editors WD
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/
  CVS version 1.95

in section
  RDF Core WG Issues affecting RDF/XML Syntax (Non-Normative):
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Updated-Grammar-changes


I've made an attempt to split the issues up (I haven't modified the
document above as such since it is being reviewed at present).


1. Editorial Issues that will be addressed in new syntax working drafts

  => I propose these issues will be directly addressed by the new
     Syntax working drafts and should be DONE when this document is
     complete.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-syntax-desc-clarity
    The language describing the syntax is unclear [in section 6]

    Action: WG developing new approach.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-formal-grammar

    Action: WG developing new approach.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#mime-types-for-rdf-docs

    Action: Internet Media Type registration should be pursued when
    WD is more mature and this document will define the syntax for
    that type [aside: application/rdf+xml probably]


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf

    Action: Has been generally agreed some validating XML schemas
    will be provided / pointed to in future WDs.



2. Issues out of scope of charter - will not be addressed in current
   RDF/XML syntax.

   => I propose all issues here should be CLOSED


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-quoting

   The syntax needs a more convenient way to express the
   reification of a statement.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qnames-cant-represent-all-uris

    The RDF XML syntax cannot represent all possible Property URI's.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-replace-value

    Suggestion that the rdf:value property be replaced by rdf:toString


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qname-uri-mapping

    The mapping of QNames to URI's generates incorrect URI's.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qnames-as-attrib-values

    Suggestion that Qnames should be allowed as values for
    attributes such as rdf:about.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-syntax-incomplete

    The RDF/XML syntax can't represent an an arbritary graph structure.


3. Issues still under discussion, not decided

  We have strawman proposals for some of these.


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr

    Clarify the interpretation of an ID attribute in the propertyElt
    production within a Description element with a distributive referrant

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces

    How should a parser process namespaces in a literal which is XML markup?


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xml-base

    How does xml-base affect RDF?


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach

    Processing rdf:aboutEach requires a processing of sub-property relations.

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-abouteach


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr

    The propertyElt production 6.12 of the grammar does not allow
    both an ID attribute and a resource attribute to be specified.

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about

    What is the difference between using and ID attribute to 'create'
    a new resource and an about attribute to refer to it?

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about



4. Issues not yet discussed

  We have strawman proposals for these


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-nested-bagIDs

    What triples are generated for nested description elements with bagIDs?

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-nested-bagIDs


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-reification-required

    MUST a parser created bags of reified statements for all
    Description elements?

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-reification-required


  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-rdf-names-use

    Illegal or unusual use of names from the RDF namespace

    Proposal
      http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-rdf-names-use
