I think so, but a fleeting worry about literals crossed my mind:

    ex:subj ex:prop "lit" .
    ex:subj ex:prop "lit" .

I can't see any actual problem here, but at some stage there seemed to be 
this idea that different instances of a literal were distinct things in the 
abstract syntax;  e.g. so that things like:
    ex:shoe shoe:size "10" .
    ex:shoe shoe:label "10" .
could be interpreted appropriately.

Just checking.
