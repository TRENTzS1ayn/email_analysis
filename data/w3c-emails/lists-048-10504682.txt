I'm not sure that I agree that the number of size properties here 
matters.  The interpretation of a graph as True or False in some 
interpretation seems to be the key, and if the datatyping tells us that 
"10" and "010" are representations of the same integer value, then
   _:foobar util:size xsd:int-"10" .
entails
   _:foobar util:size xsd:int-"010" .
and vice versa, so the truth of the graph in any interpretation is not 
affected.

(Or should I say:  the truth of the graph in any interpretation with the 
"expected" datatyping properties is not affected.)

So what meaning is to be applied to the well-formed RDF that does not use a 
canonical form for its data type?
