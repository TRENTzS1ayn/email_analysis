I take it that we are kind of stuck with it for the grammatical 
category as it is built into RDF syntax as rdf:Predicate. I think 
that as long as we use it along with 'subject' and 'object' only as a 
kind of syntax-technical term for the middle part of a triple, and 
take care not to say that the things in the domain - the things 
denoted - *are* predicates, this will be fine. After all, we can say 
that John is the subject of the sentence 'John loves Mary', but it 
would seem odd to categorize him as being a subject rather than a 
human being on that basis.
