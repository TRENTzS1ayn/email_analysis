OK, I'm getting there, sorry I'm slow. Yes, I see. This makes sense, 
I agree. The things are the RDF graphs/Ntriples documents, whatever, 
and the relationships between them are defined by entailment 
relationships between those graphs/documents. I think you ought to 
call them things like
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/rdf#conjunction
(rather than log#), is all, but that's just aesthetics.(It would help 
to keep the different entailments straight, though.)

I guess I'm still slightly puzzled by HOW you get from the fact that 
the merge of a, b and c simple-entails d, to the assertion of the 
existence of the entailment of the conjunction. There seems to be a 
kind of entailment-reification going on here, and *that* isn't 
RDF-valid, of course, though we could probably state it as another 
semantic extension, and call it entailment-valid, or something.

Cute!

Pat
