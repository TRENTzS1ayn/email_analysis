Lifting kilt to reveal scurrilous plot:  Brian is concerned that we have to take 
  into factors other than logic in our deliberations, so is trying to stir 
implementors into thinking about the implications.  He is also trying to figure 
out how to stir modeller's into action.

I would agree that having two size properties doesn't change the meaning in this 
case, but if I'm paying extra money to store or process them, then it matters to me.

Good point.
