Brian--

It's not clear to me what distinguishing "statement" and "triple"
accomplishes in this context.  Are we doing "uses" and "mentions"
again?  The M&S (Section 5) says:

"(P162) There is a set called Statements, each element of which is a
triple of the form 
 (P163) {pred, sub, obj}"

I naturally read that as saying that the triples were statements as far
as RDF was concerned (if they weren't, why wasn't the set called
"Triples" instead of "Statements"?).  Morever:

"(P179) From the standpoint of an RDF processor, facts (that is,
statements) are triples that are members of Statements."

I'd agree that the M&S is not a canonical example of precise language,
but as long as we're talking about what the M&S says (or seems to say!),
it seems to say to me that triples are statements.  

Regarding the graph representation:

"(P165) We can view a set of statements (members of Statements) as a
directed labeled graph: each resource and literal is a vertex; a triple
{p, s, o} is an arc from s to o, labeled by p. " 

This says a triple is an arc in the graph.  So if a triple is a
statement (by my reading), then an arc is a statement.  Maybe some more
elaboration would help.  When you say:

Do you?  Or do you have two lines of structured text that represent the
same triple?  The same problem exists with "tuples".  You said:

> >    o a statement is an abstraction; its a tuple with three components, subject,

If distinct tuples are identified by three distinct components, then
however many times I write the same three components down, I've still
stated only one tuple.  Is a triple identified only by its components,
or by something else too?  If I say "Frank is confused" 500 times, have
I made 500 (true) statements, or only one?
