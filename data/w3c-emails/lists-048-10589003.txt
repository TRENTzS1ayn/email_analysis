I found I could make best sense of M&S with the distrinction, and hoped to 
reduce confusion.  I should have known better, I suppose.

I tried to emphasize that this was my *personal* reading of M&S.  I don't intend 
to try to defend it as the 'one true way' (I've learnt something over the past 
few months.)

Fair enough.  I'll try to remember that is your model in discussion.

This sort of discussion can rathole deep and long.  I've seen it many times 
before on rdf interest and elsewhere and never get anywhere.

It was for this, if for nothing else, that I wanted us to have a model theory. 
Please, please, lets try to stick with the concepts we have a formal 
mathematical definition for in the model theory.  We have nodes and arcs and 
labels.  What does reification mean in those terms?

And for failing to keep to my own rule, I appologise and will slap myself silly 
all the way home.
