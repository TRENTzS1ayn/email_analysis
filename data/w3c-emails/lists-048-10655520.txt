Seems like reviewing the non-issue related test cases in pieces or 
in one batch would take the same amount of time.

Well, if you're going to start playing charter cop, then I don't
believe the charter explictly lists as deliverables test automation 
or automatic triple generation :-).  

You may also want to consider a threshold for the number of WG members 
that need to approve a test case before it gets labeled as Approved 
in the TC doc.

I currently have no plans for creating new tests.  I do, however, 
agree with the sentiments Graham expresed in:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0429.html

and wouldn't categorically deny a test case just because it
doesn't represent an issue in the issue tracking doc.
