That is how I read it also.

No, it seems very coherent to me.

It would be a class of triples which satisfy the same Ntriples BNF, 
or something like that, right? The MT would work smoothly if we were 
to add this notion. The point being that the meaning of any triple in 
any interpretation depends only on its syntax, so we could just talk 
of the interpretation of a statement or of a triple-token of that 
statement and get the same answer.

This all works fine until we get to reification, at which point it 
all goes horribly wrong, because the only useful sense of reification 
would be about tokens (triples) , but the only one we have actually 
got is about statements.
