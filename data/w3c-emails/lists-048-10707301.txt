Yes, good point. However I think that the only way that two tokens of 
a  literal could possibly need to be distinguished would be if they 
were somewhere, somehow, included in two different triples, in any 
datatyping scheme.  Otherwise you could co-data-type them without 
causing any contradictions with anything else. So this would be safe 
even in this case.
