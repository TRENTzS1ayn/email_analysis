Ah, implementation details ;-)  In such a case I think that you would pay 
for a superior implementation that is able to recognize the equivalence 
(through knowledge of the data typing) and only store the information once 
-- possibly selecting a canonical form -- on the basis that this entails 
all the other forms that might be used, assuming the data typing is the 
same in all interpretations considered to be models.
