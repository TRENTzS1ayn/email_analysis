Hey, the following thought occurred to me. Is it legal to use a 
uriref in an RDF triple, where the uriref is the URL of the document 
in which the triple appears? In other words, can a piece of RDF refer 
to itself? If so, what could it possibly mean?

In case anyone is wondering, the issue arises when one starts playing 
with Jos deRoo's entailment examples, which have triples which talk 
about RDF documents.
