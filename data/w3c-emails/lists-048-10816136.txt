At the end of the meeting, I'd like to know the answers to
the following questions wrt the MT, Syntax and Primer docs:

1. What issues must be resolved before the doc is ready
 for a public release?

2. What can other WG members do to help with #1?

3. What is the tentative date for the doc being reading for
 WG review?
