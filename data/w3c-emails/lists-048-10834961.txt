I just tried such a case
==== etc001.n3
[] etc:supportsProofOf
    [ etc:blunt <test001.nt>,
                <test002.nt>,
                <test003.nt>,
                <etc001.n3>;  # self-reference
      etc:kind <rdf-rules.n3>,
               <rdfs-rules.n3>;
      etc:sharp <test004.nt> ] .
====
and that works fine and could actually (maybe) be useful
in case etc001 contains additional facts to support the
entailment test case (which is not the case here)
no?
it seems to be very similar to the thing/ectension distinction
isn't it?
