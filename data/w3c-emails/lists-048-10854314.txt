7: Propose resolution of whether graphs are sets or bags

Propose the WG ACTION Pat to ensure that:

   the model theory uses tidy graphs from which duplicate arcs have been removed

Further the WG notes that:

  o an RDF/XML document may represent an untidy graph which contains duplicate arcs

  o an n-triples document may represent an untidy graph which contains duplicate arcs

Dave Beckett, with help from Art and Jan, investigate how to represent RDF/XML grammar and the specification of the transformation of RDF/XML to a graph representation.


11: Postpone syntax issues
The aim here is to quickly resolve those issues for which there is clear concensus.  If extended discussion is needed, we will postpone the decision.

Propose the WG RESOLVE that the following issues be postponed for consideration by a future WG

12: Close syntax issues
The aim here is to quickly resolve those issues for which there is clear concensus.  If extended discussion is needed, we will postpone the decision.

Propose the WG RESOLVE that the following issues be closed on the grounds that they are resolved by the new approach taken to defining the syntax.
