Yes, you do.  Thanks!

I didn't mean to suggest that the mapping to logic helped with the 
type/token business.  I meant to suggest that the mapping to logic 
illustrates that something is needed beyond nodes, arcs, and labels. 
However, it occurs to me that this may not be right, depending on how an 
arc in the graph is understood, i.e., whether the arc includes the two 
nodes at its ends or not.  What occured to me was that I'd been 
interpreting "arc" as simply the connecting line, in which case you need 
another concept for "arc and its beginning and ending nodes" (a triple, 
in other words).  So where the model theory says "An arc labeled with p 
from a node n1 to a node n2 maps to an atomic assertion..." I was 
interpreting that as saying that the thing corresponding to an atomic 
assertion was a group of things, an arc, and two nodes (a triple), not 
just the arc.  And the model theory defines triple too.  Back to 
elementary graph theory.
