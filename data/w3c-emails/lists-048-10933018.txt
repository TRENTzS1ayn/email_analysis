I agree;  there certainly is terminology to reflect these distinctions, 
although I've seen different terms used, e.g., Curry uses "inscription" 
for Pat's "token", "sentence" for Pat's "sentence", and "statement" for 
(roughly) "the meaning of a sentence".  As Pat says, as long as we're 
consistent in our terminology, there isn't a problem (I think it only 
becomes a rathole when we don't identify the distinctions we need to 
make, and agree on separate terms for them).  But we were talking about 
how we read the M&S, and I still think the M&S can be read as saying 
that statements are (roughly) triples (as opposed to consistently making 
the distinction we've been talking about).  So what's the terminology 
we're agreeing to use?

1.  abstract thing: "statement";  concrete thing:  "triple"
2.  abstract thing: "triple"; concrete thing:  "triple token" 
(discourage use of "statement")
3.  something else?

The point is, we're in the process of writing stuff (*I* certainly am), 
and that writing ought to use the proper terminology to reflect the 
distinctions we need to make.

Same comments apply to graphs, as Pat suggests.  Again, what terminology 
are we agreeing to use?  We're going to have to talk about graphs a lot, 
both in the abstract and the concrete senses (e.g., copying graphs, 
shipping them around, merging them), and we're going to have to try to 
use unambiguous terminology in writing that material.
