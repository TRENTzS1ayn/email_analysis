No problem.  However to take note of Aaron's point, propose instead:


Propose postpone

   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-equivalent-uris

on the grounds that the issue of defining an equivalence mechanism for arbritary 
URI's is out of scope of the WG's current charter.  The WG notes however, that 
by allowing cycles in rdfs:subPropertyOf and rdfs:subClassOf RDF Schema provides 
a related mechanism for properties and classes.
