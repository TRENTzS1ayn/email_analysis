(Sorry - this sort of mailing is tedious).

Graphs for me are sets and cannot have duplicates to remove.

How about:


Propose the WG ACTION Pat to ensure that:
 
  the model theory uses graphs with no duplicate arcs

Further the WG notes that:
 
   o an RDF/XML document may contains duplicate triples
 
   o an n-triples document may contains duplicate triples

   o and such triples map to a single arc in a graph.



(Omitting the last point would leave Pat more wriggle room to take a
multiset view of graphs if he so chooses).
