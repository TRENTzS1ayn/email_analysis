Those pages describe datatyping as used in the OCL (Object Constraint
Language, used in UML as a formal language for defining things that
cannot be defined within UML). Further datatyping-related sections are
e.g. Sec 2.5.2, 2.7, and Sec. 3.

The above Sec. 22 describes how datatypes of other languages are used.
Further relevant pointers are Sec. 7 and 8.

Datatyping seems to be dispersed over [UML] and [CWM] pretty broadly, so
some fishing is required...
