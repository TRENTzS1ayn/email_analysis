It seems to me that you're trying to say something like:
[[[
'rdfs:domain' and 'rdfs:range' is applied to an rdf:Property to state 
additional information about the subject and object of any [statement] 
containing that property.  Specifically, 'rdfs:domain' indicates a class of 
which any such subject is an instance, and 'rdfs:range' indicates a class 
of which any such object is an instance.
]]]

(For [statement], replace appropriate terminology from outcome of recent 
discussions.)
