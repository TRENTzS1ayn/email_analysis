[I missed this when it was raised]  I like this proposal, as it makes much 
more intuitive sense to me, and leverages existing developer understanding 
of toString() in existing programming languages.  Assuming it's consistent 
with any decisions about datatyping, I think there would be value to our 
current charter in adopting this.

To deal with backward compatibility, I'd suggest that rdf:value be retained 
as a "deprecated" form, equivalent to rdf:toString, which becomes the 
preferred form.

Thus, my vote is AGAINST deciding to defer this issue to a new WG at this 
time.  I think the proposal should be accepted or rejected by this WG.

I think deferring this issue would effectively be equivalent to accepting 
and fixing the status quo;  i.e. URI formation by concatenation.  I think 
this is a decision that this WG should face, not defer.

>   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qnames-as-attrib-values

OK

>   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-syntax-incomplete

OK.  (I think it's fine that the syntax cannot represent any graph;  if 
such a syntax is required, I think it's clearly an issue for a future WG.)
