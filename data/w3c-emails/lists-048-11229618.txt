Just to make sure I'm still "on message" (as political spin doctors are 
required to be):

- A statement is an abstract thing that has the value true or false in any 
interpretation.

- A triple is a kind of token for the statement, consisting of a subject 
URIref, a property URIref and an object URIref or literal.

- An arc in a tidy graph (identified by its endpoint nodes and arc label 
URI) is another kind of token for a statement.
