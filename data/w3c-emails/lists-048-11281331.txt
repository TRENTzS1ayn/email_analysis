I favour this approach, but I would also like to say...

I think this work *is* important, in the same sense that the model theory 
is important.  I apologize for not (yet) finding time to properly digest 
this work.  I would like to see it made available either as an appendix or 
a supporting document.  BUT I don't think it's something that every reader 
of the syntax specification should have to understand, hence my support for 
the proposal.
