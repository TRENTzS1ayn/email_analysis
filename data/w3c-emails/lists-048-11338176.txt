If it is being considered, then I vote to REJECT it, for reasons that 
I hope will become clear when I get the MT datatyping document 
finished. (Basically, the appropriate interpretation of rdf:value in 
the new MT is that it is simply identity, and the 'toString' name is 
then actively misleading. This view of the meaning of rdf:value has 
built into it a view about datatyping that I want to argue against, 
basically one which assumes that all literals occurrences are 
strings.  I think that it only makes intuitive sense if one agrees to 
read all literals as referring to themselves, which, I will argue, 
embodies a use/mention confusion which is neither semantically 
productive nor necessary.)
