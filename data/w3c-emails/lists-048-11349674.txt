That reads OK to me, apart from the ConstraintProperty (Havn't we 
decided to trash ConstraintProperty ?). To avoid the imperative sound 
of 'must', phrase it thus, maybe?:

rdfs:range

Applied to a property, rdfs:range specifies a class that the values 
of the property are known to be in.
OR:
...that contains all the values of the property.

You might also add:

If several such classes are specified, any value of the property must 
be in all of them.
