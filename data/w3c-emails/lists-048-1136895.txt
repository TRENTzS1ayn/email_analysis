So, the simple types do appear to follow this.

The  derived types satisfy this by construction.

Derivation by restriction
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#derivation-by-restriction
satisfies this by construction.


Derivation by list
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#derivation-by-list
and by union
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#derivation-by-union
satisfies this by virtue of not having a superclass (other than
anySimpleType)


The primitive datatypes inherit from anySimpleType, which appears by
definition to be a union of all the other types, and hence Patrick's
condition is satisfied.

The complex types (which have XML elements - see message later this morning)
seem more difficult, and I think in general Patrick's condition is false. I
am new to XML schema though, having only read part 2 last week, and parts 0
and 1 last night.
