excellent.

Does anybody disagree? If so please let the WG mailing list know before
our next teleconf.

As one of the guilty parties behind the RDFS 1.0 spec, and this bit in
particular, I have to say: we got rdfs:ConstraintResource *wrong*. (Sorry!)

It was a nice idea, to try to give some categories for likely RDFS extensions so
that 1.0 processors weren't _entirely_ suprised by future revisions of the
spec. But the notion that schema language constructs were either
'constraining' or 'unconstraining' was incoherent. The idea of this all
being used for data validation was, I think, taking up much more of our
attention than it does now. Anyway, as I say: we goofed. Let's drop the
feature and move on.
