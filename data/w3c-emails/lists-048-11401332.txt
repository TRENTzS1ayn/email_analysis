Did you mean

aaa bbb "xyz"
bbb rdfs:range ccc  ?

If ccc is a subclass of rdfs:Literal, the example looks fine. If some
other conditions prohibit ccc from being a subclass of rdfs:Literal,
then the example has no valid interpretation, I guess. But we might as
well find a testcase like

aaa rdf:type Person
aaa rdf:type Shoe

What do we make out of that? ;)
