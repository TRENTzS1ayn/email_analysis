I agree with Pat's comment that rdf:value will probably be taken care of
in datatyping (it may disapper, although I think it still may be useful
- use cases and possible interpretation are in my recent "suggestions
for datatyping" posting).

As to qname-uri-mapping, I believe it could be merged with
uri-substructure.
