yes I did (wondering how I could have written that)

well, I'm wondering...
let's take another testcase
####
    :Animal a rdfs:Class;
         <http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil#restrictedBy>  [
             a <http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil#Restriction>;
             <http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil#onProperty> :parent;
             <http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil#cardinality> "2" ];
         rdfs:label "Animal" .
####
what is that "2" denoting? the number 2, isn't it?
I can't imagine that the range of
  <http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil#cardinality>
is a subclass of rdfs:Literal
