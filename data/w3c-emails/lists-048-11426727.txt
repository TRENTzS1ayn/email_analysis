W3C have just announced the launch of the Web Ontology WG.

Currently the details are on Member-only mailing lists (so you'll need
your w3.org Member password).

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-semweb-cg/2001Oct/0024.html

The message includes some discussion of dependencies on RDF Core, on the
need for good communication between the groups, etc. I expect our work on
datatyping to be the main point of overlap now between the work of the two
groups.

Dan
