I believe we made a decision to accept the proposal in the agenda.

The text of the syntax group's decision was:

DECISION:

   That we will use structured English [in the Syntax document] to
   describe the transformation from the grammar to n-triples.  The
   rule based formalism [done by Jeremy] will be used to verify
   that the structured English is correct.

The decision was that these issues will be postponed for consideration by a 
future WG.  [I would expect them to remain in the appropriate section of the 
issues list]

The WG RESOLVED that that issues

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-syntax-desc-clarity
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-formal-grammar

are closed on the grounds that they are resolved by the new approach taken to 
defining the syntax.
