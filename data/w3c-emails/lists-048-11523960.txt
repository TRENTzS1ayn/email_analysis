I politely disagree. The other proposal (I would not call it mine - it's
completely consistent with the current MT draft) does not have this
ambiguity at all. Each resource symbol or literal symbol is mapped to
exactly one entity in DD, period.

I see several critical problems with Pat's/your way. I'll summarize them

One of the problems is, for example, that XML Schema datatypes are
"built-in". You can neither construct derived datatypes, nor use
datatypes defined by other languages. If you do, you would end up with a
self-morphing model theory. At least, the approach you/Pat described
would.

I might want to use a datatype scheme like that! After all, I'd like to
write "July" and mean month July, right? So if I'm able to introduce a
type for months, who prevents me from saying that "Peter" should be
interpreted as Peter Pan?

This is what I mean by ambiguity. Recall your "Arghhhh!" reply on the
top of this message.

That's not what bothers me. Making the blank node in the above example
to denote the string is what I don't agree with. It denotes something.
The interpretation of this something is restricted by the attached
``print-string''.

Do you think this example is ok? So, who is the "Creator" of the Web
page in the above example, after all? Peter Pan? According to your
proposal, the Creator would be an xsd:string as defined in the XML
Schema.

The first statement is fine, IMO. Property "name" could be thought of as
a relationship between Persons and 
Literals. A concept of a "name" could be stretched to that of a
character string. The second statement I'd consider bad modeling
practice. And in the long run we won't do ourselves a favor by endorsing
it.

I'd rather say corrupt data. Misunderstanding is when you (or an
application) look at the data and imagine one thing, but in fact it
means something completely different. Moreover, the proper understanding
could still be quasi-enforced by cardinality and domain/range
constraints, right?

If the meaning of a literal can change from statement to statement, I
would never use resources. Why bother? I might end up with a model
without a valid interpretation... Moreover, URIs are waaaay too long...
So, I'd just use a bunch of literals - I'm sure that a really
intelligent human can determine what I had in the back of my mind. No,
wait, why bother... In fact, I'd just stick with XML after all.

Having said all that, I'd like to add that I appreciate your input very
much. I'm still abstaining from writing an itemized critique of
Pat's/your proposal because Pat may be working on a version of
datatyping for MT that does not require polymorphic literals.
