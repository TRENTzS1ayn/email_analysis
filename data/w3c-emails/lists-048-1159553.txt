There's a wrinkle here that occurs to me...

Suppose that in addition to:

   monthOfBirth rdfs:range xxd:EnglishCalendarMonth .

we can also presume:

   monthOfBirth rdfs:range xxd:decimalInteger .

(this being legit RDF) ... might the allow us to write:

   _y monthOfBirth "July" .

OR

   _y monthOfBirth "7" .

?

There are two points I see here:  (a) multiple datatype classes might 
permit ambiguity in the value denoted by a given literal string, and (b) a 
literal value might not have a defined mapping under some presumed datatype 
class.

(a) I see as not really being different from the case where no datatype 
class information is available, except that it seems to run counter to the 
conjunctive nature of type information.

(b) if no mapping is provided by a presumed datatype class, how does this 
affect the truth of the corresponding statement?
