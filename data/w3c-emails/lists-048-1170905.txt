Yes... I see the primary purpose of the MT is to give us a sound foundation 
for RDF, and to avoid the gotcha's that have plagued V1.0.   I don't expect 
DPH to read the MT to clarify his understanding of RDF;  rather, we who do 
read and agree on the MT can, as a result, should be able to present a 
description and test cases that is consistent and well-founded and 
consequently easier to follow.
