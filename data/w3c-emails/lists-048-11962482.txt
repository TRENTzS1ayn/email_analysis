Well maybe it's an arrow without a URI.

I think that princeNodes should be allowed in the predicate 
slot... they're rather useful.

While I'm giving unsolicited advice, I think that a DLG is 
probably not the best way to represent the RDF model... it's 
sort of difficult to picture arrows pointing at other arrows.
