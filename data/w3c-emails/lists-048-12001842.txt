I like the idea of allowing predicates to be princeNodes
because it would eliminate special casing predicates (and simplify 
N-Triples a little).  However, I agree with Dave's position (although
M&S is not explicit on this) and thus have written some apps that 
assume predicates will be URI-refs and not princeNodes.

Would you please give an example where this would be useful?
