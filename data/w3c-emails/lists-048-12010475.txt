I'm not going to argue mathematics with you Pat.  Long time passin',
when I was first taught about sets, I was taught that a set could
contain physical objects, i.e. the set of books on my bookshelf is a
legitimate set.  Was that wrong?

Similarly, in the mathematical concept of a tuple, e.g. (x,y,z) can
the components be physical objects, even though the tuple itself is
an abstract thing?
