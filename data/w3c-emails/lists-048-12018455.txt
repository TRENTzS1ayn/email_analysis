Representing partial knowledge: for example, one might know that persons A
and B were related biologically, without knowing whether that was
brother/sister/father etc. Being able to represent claims about a
relationship that holds between A and B (without URI-naming that relation)
could be useful. You could say, for example, that there is a relationship
that holds between A and B, and that the relationship was of rdf:type
misc:BiologicalRelativeRelation. Where misc:brother, misc:sister etc were
members of that class.

Sorry for the cheeseball example, I'm in a rush. Another more general
example could probably be composed that used WebOnt / DAML+OIL classes
such as daml:UniqueProperty.

Also for the record, none of my code has any problem with un-named
relations, although I've assumed there was no way to serialize this in
RDF/XML 1.0.
