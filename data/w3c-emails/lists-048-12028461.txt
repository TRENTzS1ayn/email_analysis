I don't have any problem with the change - just to note it *is* a
change and we should take care that if we do this, we have good
reasons and consider what the change causes deployed applications.

The current RDF/XML syntax cannot generate any model with non-URI-ref
predicates (unless you reify) thus that means some models can be
created that can not be transfered in the standard RDF/XML syntax
(although this is true for other models too).

For evidence on implementation: my Redland system has no problem
handling princeNode predicates.
