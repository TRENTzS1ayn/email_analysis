While I have held, in principle, what I'd characterise as DanC's opinion
here (or the more extreme version: "alt is totally broken") - that is,
that an app can infer what it likes, an alt-unaware MT is going to
produce an odd semantics for something like


     <doc1> <dc:creator> _:a .
     _:a <rdf:type> <rdf:Alt> .
     _:a <rdf:_1> <jan> .
     _:a <rdf:_2> <dan> .

("doc1 was written by either jan or dan") - I don't see how you can
ignore alt in the MT and get this interpretation, no matter how you go
about it.

If it's broken really badly - don't fix it either.
