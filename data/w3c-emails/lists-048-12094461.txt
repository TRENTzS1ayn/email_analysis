[snip]

A brief historical factoid: back in '98-ish, the use of qnames _inside_
XML attributes was considered rather daring, risky, and was largely
unprecdedented. Since then, a few other (@@which??) XML-based specs have
done this. At the time we punted this for future work, to avoid being out
of step with the XML mainstream. One could make the case now that this
practice has been established, and that any extensibility mechanisms that
RDF Core defines should use it.
