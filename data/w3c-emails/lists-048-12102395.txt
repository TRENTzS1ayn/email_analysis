I'm not saying it's broken; I'm just saying it's not magic.
It's very mundane; from the MT perspective,
it means no more or less than any
other class (Apple, Bananna, Integer, ...).

I interpret that n-triples fragment not as "doc1 was written
by either jan or dan" but

  doc1's has a creator value which is a collection including
  jan and dan; this collection is the sort where folks conventionally
choose
  one from the collection, rather than using all of them.

Again, suppose the graph had a Bag rather than an Alt:

      <doc1> <dc:creator> _:a .
      _:a <rdf:type> <rdf:Bag> .
      _:a <rdf:_1> <jan> .
      _:a <rdf:_2> <dan> .

We don't license the inference that
<doc1> <dc:creator> <jan>.
in that case, do we? No. Then why should rdf:Alt have any magic
associated with it?
