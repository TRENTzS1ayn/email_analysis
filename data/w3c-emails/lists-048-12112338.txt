Didn't mean to sound dramatic.  I suppose I'm looking at the charter
and dragging my feet again.

Personally, I'm sympathetic to this change.  However, I'm not sure
there is a problem here we need to fix.  What difference would it make
if we did nothing?

What is unclear exactly?

Are we comfortable that an existing processor encountering
rdf:parseType="rdf:Resource" will treat it as rdf:parseType="Literal"?
