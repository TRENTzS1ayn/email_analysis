I don't consider the two to be interchangable. Why? Compare

http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#108
"The students in course 6.001 are Amy, Tim, John, Mary, and Sue."
It seems here that the collection itself is truly considered the value
of a property, whereas...

http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#111  (and #112)
"Here, any one of the items listed in the container value for
DistributionSite is an acceptable value without regard to the other
items."

In other words, the Alt-collection itself isn't really being considered
the value of the property; the members of the Alt are being considered
so instead.*

Because clearly they don't behave in the same way, so the analogy isn't
sound.

I'd rather see Alt go away - the examples in M+S are vague and subject
to this kind of confusion.

jan

* although there are two kinds of alternative notion: the one in this
example is "this is true for ever member of the Alt, just pick one" (so
why isn't it just a bag?) as opposed to "this is true for at least one
member of the alt" - which is where you need some MT support (I think).
