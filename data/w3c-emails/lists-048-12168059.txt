Funny, I'd always read the bag example as `each and every member is a
student in course 6.001' - that is, the property is distributed over the
members of the set - not applied to the set. Therefore `alt' is a
different distribution: there certainly isn't a whole-set/members
difference between bag and alt - in my mind. Typically, the semantics of
the properties used are intended for the individual: the use of a
collection just simplifies the expression. Where does the set
interpretation come from?
