Dan--

I agree that folks who *design* schemas with explicit subclass loops are
probably making an error of some kind.  But another use case here is
when some of the class (subclass) relationships are *derived* (e.g., the
inference mentioned in the snippet from the forwarded message below). 
For example, in Semantic Web apps I may be combining information based
on a number of different schemas, and while the individual schemas may
contain no loops, the combination may turn out to (effectively) have
one.  Rather than throwing out the resulting "effective schema" as
violating some syntactic constraint, I want to determine what having
come up with that loop "means".  I could still conclude that an error
had been made, but I might also conclude that the classes involved in
the loop were equivalent (and the designers of the individual schemas
just hadn't known about the other ones).
