No, I meant it all.  But I spoke hastily. I guess anything can be a 
symbol, so maybe my mother  *could* be in a grammar. However, it 
wouldn't be a grammar that could be described in BNF (since she - my 
mother, that is - is at least three-dimensional, and BNF only 
describes one-dimensional structures, ie strings.) Also, I would bet 
that anyone would have a hell of a time getting my mother to stay in 
an RDF graph for any length of time: she would have it vacuumed and 
dusted before you would have time to even parse it.
