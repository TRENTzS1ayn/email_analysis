The problem would be having the, er, 'same' arrow linking A to B and 
also C to D:

A _:xxx B
C _:xxx D

The chief utility of the graph syntax is that it gets rid of the 
problems that arise from having to provide several distinct 
renderings of a single anonymous node, since anonymous nodes are 
unique in the graph, ie they only occur once (contrast <anonNodes> in 
Ntriples). If we have to include an anonymous arrow in the graph in 
two places but indicate that they are the 'same' by giving them a 
special anonymous label, then the confusion is back in the graphs in 
spades. In fact there would then be no particular advantage to the 
RDF graphs over Ntriples documents, and we would have to go back to 
some notion of quantifier scoping in the model theory. Which we could 
do, but please lets us get this matter settled one way or the other.

If *that* is allowed then the M&S is totally screwed up. Is it legal 
RDF to have a property be the value of another property??
