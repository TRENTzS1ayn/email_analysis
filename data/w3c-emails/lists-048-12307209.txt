Right. Although there is one possible answer in the M&S (an aspect 
that I ignored), which is that an Alt is required to have at aleast 
one element, which is the first, and is considered the 'default' 
value. So an Alt might be a bag with a default first member, maybe. 
(However, the need for this default suggests that as you say above, 
the members are the intended values, not the alt container itself.)

Yes, I think so also.
