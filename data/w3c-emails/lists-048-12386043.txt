Thanks, v. useful. Mostly OKs, except:

I'll try to say it better. I put a note there in response to a worry 
someone else had about leaving this until later. Maybe the thing to 
do is to put all the discussion early on, but in a 'technical aside' 
so its easy to skip if one isn't interested.

Not a typo, but I'll try to say it in anglo-saxon.

>o section 2a, para 3

Right, I was being sloppy. The arc goes from a node labelled with s 
to an node labelled with o and is itself labelled with p.

BTW, I notice that some people (also the M&S) write triples in the 
order p s o.   Is this likely to confuse people, and should I put in 
a note emphasising that I use s p o to conform to Ntriples?

No, this is a real issue.  The usual way of thinking about bags 
(containers more generally) is that they *are* determined by their 
contents, so there seems to be a mismatch between RDF and the rest of 
the world here. We could just dodge it by saying 'equivalence'; but 
in any case I'm actioned to remove the containers stuff from the 
working paper, so lets get back to this later.

Yes. I changed  (IR union LV)  to IR here to allow the 'distributive' 
reading of rdf:Alt when an alt was used as a subject; but to hell 
with trying to be clever with rdf:Alt, is the conclusion I now have 
come to.
