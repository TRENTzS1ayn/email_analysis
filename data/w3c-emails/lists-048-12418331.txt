M&S makes a distinction between a statement and a triple.

My interpretation of it, is that a statement is an abstract mathematical
tuple containing three components, the subject - a resource, the predicate
- a property and the object - a resource or literal.

A triple is a representation of a statement, e.g. in a language, or in 
the memory of a computer or as signals on a wire.

This is how I make sense of what M&S says about statements containing
the resources themselves and

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#291

 Triple
     A representation of a statement used by RDF, consisting of just the
     property, the resource identifier, and the property value in that order.

That said, the glossary definition of a statement:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#289

seems inconsistent with that defined in section 5, and I tend to give section
5 more weight.

M&S's treatment of statements as being composed of the resources themselves
has led to all sorts of problems and overly long discussions on RDF interest
and elsewhere, in part because nobody seems to be really sure what a resource
is.

That was why I was keen that we move away from the set oriented model as
defined in M&S to what we have now where we have a language, the RDF Graph,
and an interpretation function that maps URI's to pumpkins.  This avoids
so much of that mess.  Its a great step forward.  Joy unbridled and all
that ...

Now when we get into reification, some of this mess reappears. I'm not 
trying to defend M&S's position.  But it did seem right to point out
what M&S says on the subject. Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up right now. 

I suggest we continue with our plan, punt reification till later and hammer
a stake in ground with what we have now.
