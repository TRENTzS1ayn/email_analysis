That isn't obviously a universally held view.  The fact that it seems that 
such different views *can* exist was the reason for raising this point 
(effectively, for discussion) in the original glossary.

Sorry, I was not being clear...  the possible use as identifier wasn't in 
question.  But it didn't seem to me that there is an obvious way of putting 
an real number on the web in such a way that it's URI usefully identifies 
it.  (There are clearly many possible technical solutions, but none I can 
think of that seem obviously useful for general use.)
