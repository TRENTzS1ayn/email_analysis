Hi Pat,

That get's the blood flowing first thing in the morning.

We can make this decision independently from deciding whether prince arcs are
allowed.

Whether or not we decide to allow prince arcs, we should adopt a notation
that would allow them to be representated.  That way any future WG, (and ours)
is free to decide that they are allowed, without having to revamp the
core representation.

We decided at the F2F to use a graph notation.  If we can *reasonably* extend
that notation to support prince arc's I suggest we stick with the decision
we made.  

To extend the graph notation we'd need:

  o non-URI identifying labels on arcs
  o a node and an arc can have the same label
  o a scoping notation

Is that sufficient?  If it is, is it a reasonable notation on which to base
the formal semantics?

Brian

ps: If I may say so, Pat, that was a very good catch.
