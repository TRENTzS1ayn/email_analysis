(Not strictly a WG topic for now, but I wanted to test my understanding...)

In the 28-Aug MT draft, section 4, the reification conditions are described as

(V union VxVxV) is a subset of IR
<x,y> is in IEXT(I(rdf:subject)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x=<a b c> and y=a
<x,y> is in IEXT(I(rdf:predicate)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x=<a b c> and y=b
<x,y> is in IEXT(I(rdf:object)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x=<a b c> and y=c
x is in ICEXT(I(rdf:Statement)) iff for some a,b,c in V, x=<a b c>

This seems to say that *every* 3-tuple in VxVxV is of type 
rdf:Statement.  This appears to preclude the use of the 3-tuple for any 
other purpose.

Is this right?
