(Another not strictly WG topic for now...)

In the 28-Aug MT draft, section 4, the class extensions ISEQ and IBAG are 
required toi be disjoint.  It's not clear why they need to be disjoint.

Indeed, I think this would prohibit some RDF that is arguably legitimate; e.g.

   [ a rdf:Bag ; a rdf:Seq ;
     rdf:_1 "member 1" ;
     rdf:_2 "member 2" ]

I see nothing in RDFM&S that prohibits this, and I think the resource thus 
described is clearly in the class extensions of both rdf:Bag and rdf:Seq.
