I am happy with the proposal that we limit ourselves to describing legal
RDF, and hence make test 8 an error. It is one of the many inconsistencies
of the old spec that it (mis)specifies the processing of a particular type
of error, but not of other types of error.

If we are not specifying processing behaviour of bad input we do not specify
what to do when meeting an attribute with "no meaning". The current version
of ARP, in good faith, based its processing of rdf:aboutEachPrefix on a
particularly reading of para 196 (mine not Dave's!); that processing was not
simply ignoring the attribute. I suspect that trying to specify the
processing of incorrect input is a never-ending task. (It seems hard enough
to specify the processing of correct input and how to differentiate correct
input from incorrect input.) I am not wedded to the current version of ARP,
and only use it as an example, since I understand what it does and why!
