I'd like to consider this business of requiring <rdf:RDF> a little bit
further.  In particular, Section 2.2.2 says:

Would requiring an explicit RDF tag mean that there are "certain
well-structured XML DTDs" which under the original rules could have been
directly interpreted as RDF (and which didn't contain an explicit RDF
tag) but couldn't under the change?  If so, I would think this a
problem, since being able to directly interpret XML as RDF would be a
big win IMO.  Do people think that it's unlikely that any XML would be
directly interpretable as RDF unless it was intended from the start to
be interpreted that way (and hence we could reasonably require an
explicit RDF tag)?  It's certainly true that the examples in Section
2.2.2 have such tags.
