Interesting question.  I agree multiple <rdf:RDF>s should be legal.

But are they the same as al the RDF in a single element?  I'm not so 
sure.  I'd think that separate <rdf:RDF> elements would generate different 
RDF graphs.  They might be used in different contexts, or different modes 
(e.g. assertion vs query).

I think it would be safer, in the long run, to preserve the separate 
graphs, and allow an application to merge them if it that serves its purpose.
