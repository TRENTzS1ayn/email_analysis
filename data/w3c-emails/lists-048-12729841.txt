Ironically, I've just sent a report to the W3C online validator because it 
doesn't work as required in the absence of <rdf:RDF>.

The reason I'm interested in this is because I'm suggesting that XML 
formats used in some kinds of (IETF) protocol elements be RDF-compliant (in 
this case, presence information);  i.e. conform to RDF syntax -- mainly 
this involves ensuring that the "striped" XML structure is used, and making 
sure the appropriate namespace declarations are present.  This makes RDF a 
relatively easy sell (it costs very little to implement and might yield 
great benefits in due course).

I therefore suggest the above syntax is appropriate, and the current RDF 
specification is about right on this 
point.
