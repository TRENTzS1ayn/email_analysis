In the attached zip I have some straw XML to try and get conversation
rolling on how we write down datatype info in RDF/XML.

In order to avoid using xsi:schemaLocation, and to assuming that RDF Schema
accesses shecma info by getting the URL some of the files in the zip should
be at the following URLs:


XML Schema files:

colour.xml                     http://www.example.org/colour
complexNumber.xml              http://www.example.org/complexNumber

RDF Schema file:

things.xml                      http://www.example.org/things

The other files are RDF files, either starting in P or S depending on which
datatyping system they use.

All the P ones depend on the RDF Schema. I note that Pat seemed to be happy
with datatype info being indicated in other ways than range constraints, so
maybe I need to do another three P-examples using xsi:type instead of
schema.

I think there are a number of errors, but this is the best I could do this
morning and I wanted to get something out.

Issues that strike me:

In the rdfs:range statements just how do you refer to the types: I've used a
qname maybe an rdf:resource="full-uri-ref-with-fragment" would have been
better.

The namespaces are confusing, some have a # at the end, others don't.
