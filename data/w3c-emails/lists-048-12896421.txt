We could reserve all unprefixed parseTypes for RDF use, and say that
extensions should use namespaced prefix attributes; thus blessing DAML
and
TBL without a significant change to M&S.

I'd thought about this option (which is the same option we have now, but
hardened). We'll probably have to mandate/describe practice on prefix
usage (make it a namespace!) as you say. Then we have to inform the RDF
community that if it's using unprefixed unrecommended parseTypes it will
have to upgrade. That option does minimise changes to the M&S at the
possible expense of people using it (but being realistic, not that many
people perhaps). If there's change pain, I'd rather the wg bore it. If
we mandate using an RDF namespace for RDF use, it's less likely we'll
step on anyone's toes. I guess ultimately if we're telling others to use
namespaces for extensibility here, we may as well eat our food :) I
observe that the asecendent M&S/XML grammar can continue to claim the
current Literal and Resource attribute values and duplicate them under a
namespace.
