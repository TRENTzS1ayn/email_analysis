OK, I'd like to do that also.  Im glad we agree.

Anonymous *nodes*, please. They are almost exactly what Frege used 
(they are the 'links' connecting an existential quantifier to the 
term positions it quantifies, in his graphical notation) and also 
what Peirce called 'identities', so the idea is actually very old 
(though not currently fashionable.)

I didn't intend, when writing the model theory, to *change* the 
meanings associated with these names. My intention was to express 
what the M&S says about their intended meanings as precisely as I 
could. Sorry if it came across as an attempt to set the record 
straight: that wasn't my goal.

What assumptions about those names are made by the deployed code, 
however? Doesn't it assume that they denote the obvious relations 
between a triple and its three components, as the M&S says? That is 
what the model theory assumes. What else could they mean?

OK, fair enough. My problem now however is that I honestly, with the 
best will in the world and trying hard to be constructive, cannot 
imagine what this other interpretation of reification (that is 
embedded in code and widely adopted, apparently) can possible BE. 
Apparently it is not what the M&S says about reification, so where is 
there any source which can explain what it is?

I understood that there was still some feeling that reification 
needed more discussion. I wish we could start having that discussion 
some time soon, and that someone could enlighten me about what RDF 
reification is supposed to mean.
