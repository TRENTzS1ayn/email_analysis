>Some comments on the 28-Aug MT draft.

Many thanks, especially for the suggestions for rewording to make the 
meanings clearer.

I will take these into account in rewriting. Some of them are already fixed.

One point; there is indeed rampant confusion in the 28 Aug draft 
between NTriples terminology (eg <uriRefs>) and RDF graph 
terminology, a product of my own confusion and the change made at the 
F2F. I am currently trying to get this completely rationalized, so 
thanx for the pointers.

Er.....no, it *is* intended to preclude those. One could imagine 
having 'current position' being described in RDF, of course, and 
being constantly updated, but that's what I meant by any particular 
piece of RDF being a 'snapshot'.

Yes, but the point is that while the interpretation doesnt assign any 
denotation to anonymous nodes, it does specify the truthvalue of a 
graph containing anonymous nodes.  I will try to say it more clearly.

Yes. Im learning how to write HTML (new experience for me! ) using 
DreamWeaver, and this stuff will all be laid out in tables in the 
next version.
