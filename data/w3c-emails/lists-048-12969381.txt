Oh, OK. I guess I just assumed that they had to be disjoint since 
they were interpreted differently. In fact it would be easier if they 
weren't required to be disjoint, because then there really would be 
*nothing* special about rdf containers.

I will follow the consensus view on this issue, and have an open mind 
on the matter.
