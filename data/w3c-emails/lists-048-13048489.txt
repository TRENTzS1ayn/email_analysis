It's probably a red herring.  But I was wondering what would happen if one 
wanted, in future, to allow 3-tuples of resources in the domain of 
interpretation for some purpose other than representing a statement.  I 
find it difficult to imagine a useful node that wouldn't be some part of 
some statement, hence be a member of V.
