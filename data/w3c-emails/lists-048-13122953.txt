Oh dear. That simply does not make sense. Look, there are two notions 
here. One is the thing with an identity, more traditionally called 
the thing denoted; examples include web sites, books, human beings, 
corporations, etc. . Another is the conceptual mapping or 
correspondence between the name and that first thing, sometimes 
called the denotation mapping. These are not, and cannot possibly be, 
the same thing. So RFC2396 is just plain confused.

BTW, it is even more confused that this, since neither of these 
notions (entity denoted and denotation mapping) have got anything 
particularly to do with time and change, and the introduction of a 
temporal distinction in the second paragraph seems to confuse 
denotation - the mapping from a representing or naming symbol to the 
thing it denotes or names - with some notion of a temporally 
unchanging referent which somehow 'corresponds' (whatever that means) 
to a changing value. The phrasing " the entity which corresponds to 
that mapping at any particular instance in time" is incoherent and 
meaningless. The last sentence is nonsense: if the thing identified 
by the mapping changes, then *of course* the mapping has changed, 
since the mapping *is* the relationship between the names (or 
referring expressions) and the things 'identified' by the mapping..

I don't think there is any point it trying to 'rescue' this prose. It 
is too broken to be useful.

They are already tied up in knots. That phrase is meaningless in an 
extensional language, since it has an implicit "now" in it, which is 
an indexical. If URIs have an implicit reference to the time of use 
built into their meaning, then *any* model theory for *any* language 
which uses URIs will need to be based on something like a modal 
semantics which explicitly mentions temporally possible worlds. That 
could be done, but it gets us into a minefield of complexity (what 
kind of temporal model do we assume? Discrete or continuous? Based on 
points or intervals? Deterministic or branching? Etc.)

The RDF model theory as it stands simply does not support the notion 
of an URI meaning 'the current weather report'. There is no notion of 
'current'  or 'now' or 'at the time of accessing' in the semantics. 
At any given moment, a URI might denote the weather report at that 
moment, but if that gets changed then the meaning of the URI gets 
changed as well. Changing the content of a weather-report URI is a 
genuine change, not merely an update to an ongoing 
temporally-relative 'tensed' meaning.

Oh dear. That also doesn't make sense to me. What does it mean to 
refer to a 'particular view' of something, rather than refer to it?

So a URI is an identifier of a *document* ?? But I thought that we 
were working on the understanding that URIs denote *things*, not just 
documents.

How about representing things that have nothing to do wth documents?

Which flatly contradicts the previous quote. Sigh.
