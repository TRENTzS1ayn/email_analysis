I have no trouble at all, eg how about a triple of real numbers, or 
of pieces of coal, or of plays by Shakespeare, or whatever. (They may 
not be nodes, but they are triples.) The things in IR are the 
entities being denoted, remember, not their URIs. Putting V and VxVxV 
in the domain just says that some of the expressions are counted as 
things that can be talked about by other expressions, but there are 
still a hell of a lot of other things that can be talked about and 
are not expressions, so are not of type rdf:Statement.

There can be triples in IR already. The proposed V-semantics for 
reification is just a way to be explicit about some of the triples 
being syntactic in nature, ie in the class rdf:Statement.
