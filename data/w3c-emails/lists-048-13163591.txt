Right. Sorry, I was being sloppy: people talk of 'existential 
quantifer' and 'existential statement' and I tend to use the one that 
is handiest.

Oh, I hope not. If so, then the quantifier over properties isn't over 
the properties themsleves (which is still first-order) but over their 
possible extensions (which is higher-order and not semidecideable). 
That would mean that the proof process would have to be able to 
handle unification of expressions with embedded lambda-expressions, 
for example. Best to not go there, believe me.

Thanks due to Chris Menzel for that one.
