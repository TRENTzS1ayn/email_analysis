I promised a publishable version of the MT by Wednesday, but I may be 
a day late, as today was a lost day due to unforseen complexities. 
Sorry.

Also, I will be unable to take part in the WG activities between 20 
Sept and 14 Oct, including telecons, so would ask someone to take 
over the shepherding of the MT document through the W3C publication 
process once it is approved by the WG. It should be in workable HTML 
and need only very minimal editing.

BTW, there is also the matter of whether rdf:SubClassOf should permit 
loops. As I have been acting as liason between the WG and the 
DAML+OIL committee on this issue, and think it is important, could I 
ask that someone else be willing to, er, shepherd it along while I 
will be away? Ora Lassila  has been involved in all the relevant 
discussions at both end and may be willing do so.

Pat
