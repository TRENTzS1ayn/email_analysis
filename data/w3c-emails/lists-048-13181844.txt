[Replying to RDF core list rather than RDF comments;  I think this is 
mainly a WG issue, but I've no objection to it being copied publicly if 
anyone thin that helps.  But we've been asked not to cross-post messages 
within and without the WG.]

I think that this is an application issue, beyond the scope of the RDF spec 
to either require or prohibit.

The purpose of the core RDF spec is, IMO, to state what constitutes 
well-formed RDF, and to state how it may be interpreted.  I think our job 
is easier if we focus on this.
