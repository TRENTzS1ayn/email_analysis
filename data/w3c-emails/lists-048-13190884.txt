[Full message below]

Oh dear, indeed ;-)

I'll not try and respond directly to your points (yet), but see if I can 
skirt around them..


Problem statement:

The web currently contains many things, identified by URIs, that correspond 
to ideas like "the current weather".  I think this is something that makes 
the web truly valuable -- the ability to deliver dynamic information.  If 
RDF cannot describe these things then I think it falls very short of the 
goal to be able to describe all things that are "on the Web".


Some tangential background:

One of the challenges of functional programming, in its strictest form in 
which all values are immutable, is its use in applications that deal with 
inherrently dynamic things (text editors, real-time control, etc.).  The 
approach that I have seen adopted is to treat such things as sequences of 
values, or time-varying functions.  Coupled with techniques like lazy 
evaluation that only evaluate values as they are required, a program can 
represent and handle such possibly-infinite values.


Possible solution?

(This may be a horrible abuse of a new trick, but I must try...)

The functional programming trick seems not dissimilar to the 
relational-extension trick used in the MT denotation of RDF 
predicates.  Can it also be applied to the denotation of resources?

So, a "resource" is the thing identified by a URI.  Why not have the idea 
of a resource extension that corresponds to the set of entities that can be 
retrieved via a resource, where each entity is a static sequence of octet 
data?  (At this stage, for the purpose of testing the resource extension 
idea, I've deliberately stuck to things that can actually be retrieved on 
the web, and left unspecified any correspondence there may be between the 
data and other real-world objects.)  Then, the resource can correspond to 
the current weather forecast, but its extension includes the set of all 
weather forecasts for all times;  the particular member of that extension 
one retrieves depends on when the retrieval is performed.

It seems to me that this treatment of resources is allowed by, and 
orthogonal to the current model theory, because it still provides a fixed 
denotation for each URI, just one a that is more complex than originally 
envisaged.  It also seems, to me, to capture something of the intent of 
RFC2396.
