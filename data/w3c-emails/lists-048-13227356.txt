I've never beleived for a second that RDF can describe all the things 
that are on the web. RDF is really a very, very small language with 
very limited expressiveness. It isn't a miracle cure for the whole of 
semiotics.

Right, continuations and that kind of thi ng.

But there is something basically wrong with that picture. Entities 
(and resources) are *not* streams of octet or any other data, in 
general: they can be real solid things like books and people. (This 
may be tangential to your main point.)

As I understand it, the real-world objects *are* resources, so the 
idea of being retrievable on the web simply isn't applicable to 
resources in general.

We could do something like this, but this is what I meant by a modal 
(possible-world) semantics, since the denotation here ought to be not 
the entire extension (in your extended sense) but the particular 
member of it at the time the query was made. The semantics on this 
case would need to introduce a notion of times and time-relations in 
order to make snes eof this notion of 'now'. (It could be a very 
simple notion, eg points with a total order, but the point is that we 
would need to say *something* about it.)

In the meantime however we could also just put this issue off to the 
future, and the current MT be thought of as kind of instantaneous 
time-slice of this extended temporal semantics.

I wonder what the intent of RFC2396 actually was, I have to confess. 
It just seems to me to be confused.
