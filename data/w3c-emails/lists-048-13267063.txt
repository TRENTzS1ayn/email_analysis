We are getting our languages crossed here. I have been excorciated by 
W3C folk in the past for claiming that only documents are 'on the 
web', and told that this phrase is intended to mean not that 
something is *retrievable* through the Web, but that it can be 
*mentioned* on the Web. So for example, the existence of a URI 
convention for telephone numbers means that every telephone is "on 
the web". So in this sense of "on the web", the entire sum of all 
past and future human experience is indeed on the web. Nothing to do 
with mere retrieval.

Right. OK, I spoke too quickly.

That is what I originally assumed, but I gather that my summary is 
the received W3C viewpoint; and since this usage of the word 
"resource" originates with the W3C, I feel obliged to take their word 
for what it is supposed to mean.

That would be one way to go. It would complicate both RDF and its 
semantics, though. Presumably for example it would not be correct to 
interpret <s p o> as meaning that a relation holds between s and o, 
since sometimes it would mean that the relation held between the 
'extension' of one or both of s and o. In fact this is what I thought 
would be necessary when I first agred to try to do a model theory, 
and I was considerably relieved to find that it apparently wasn't 
necessary. (It can get awfully complicated. Suppose one URI denotes a 
document which contains another URI, for example; do we have to say 
that the chain of retrievals keeps going until it terminates in 
something with an extension? (Is there any guarantee of termination? 
What about reference loops?) If we don't, what sense can we make of 
the triple?)

My one is, yes. But I thought you wanted it to not be.

Nice point. I'll think about that some more.

Thanks for the pointer. I like this a LOT. Larry is not confused by 
the use/mention distinction.

Sigh. At the DAML kickoff meeting I asked the assembled WWWebbies 
whether the idea was that this semantic markup was a description of 
the web page, or of what the web page described? And I got the 
cheerful answer that it didn't really matter, but both. I worried 
about that at the time, and think I was right.
