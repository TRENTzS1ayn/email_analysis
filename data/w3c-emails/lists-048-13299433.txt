I accept I'm probably abusing the adopted terminology there.  My real 
thrust here was to get the ideas straight for things which do have 
retrievable entities, before trying to tackle the potentially trickier 
problem of non-retrievable entities.  A kind of walk-before-run strategy.

I don't follow that.  If I understand correctly, if <s p o> is asserted all 
the model theory tells us is that <s o> is in the relational extension of 
p.  That seems to stand independently of whether or not s and o have what I 
called "resource extensions".  What it means for <s o> to be in IEXT(p) 
seems to be a matter for the particular interpretation chosen, which is not 
specified by the MT.

Oh, hang on, s p and o *are* interpretations, aren't they?  ... [continued

I was about to say "no, see above".  But realized that I was trying to talk 
about an interpretation of an interpretation which isn't a defined 
concept.  So I'll regroup:

I wasn't expecting time dependence to be reflected directly in the MT, but 
introduced somehow through the interpretation or URIs.  The MT tells us:

(a)  the interpretation of a URI is something called a "resource"

I am suggesting an addition:

(b)  a "resource" is some abstract thing, having an extension (possibly 
empty, possibly infinite) that is a set of entities.  These entities may be 
web-retrievable octet sequences.   And when we're ready to try running, 
they might be physical objects.

This would act as a constraint on any interpretation that satisfies the 
MT.  But the exact relationship between the resource and its entities is 
not specified by the model theory, and I don't see that it needs to be.  In 
some cases, the members of the extension may be time-specific.

It feels that what I am suggesting here is like a level of indirection 
through the thing we call a "resource".  (There's a saying that there's no 
problem in software engineering but can be solved by an additional level of 
indirection.  Maybe there's a KR equivalent:  no problem not solved by an 
additional level of extension? :-)
