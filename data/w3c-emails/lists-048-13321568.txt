Martyn,

This debate has clearly gone beyond the original point that sparked it.  I 
should have changed the subject line -- I think it has more bearing on the 
nature of the model theory and its interpretations than the terminology 
(though use of terminology is part of our debate).

I don't think we're yet ready to propose a glossary clarification based on 
our exchange.  But I am hopeful something useful will emerge.
