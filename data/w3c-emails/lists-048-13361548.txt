I prefer that too.

I suppose it's worth adding to the issues
list (if it's not already there; sorry for not checking...),
since it has come up a number of times; as a WG,
I suppose we owe the folks who have asked an explanation
ala...

Dealing with time is orthogonal to the RDF core
semantics; options for dealing with it include
-- making it explicit in your RDF vocabularies
-- out-of-band info about the time context of RDF documents
-- limiting your use of RDF to things that don't
change over time
-- other ideas.

I hope not.

I'm not sure I understand that, but if I do, it seems
sorta like the "out of band time context" stuff above
(but formally, rather than sorta hand-wavey)

It seems worth considering, eventually, but I'm in no hurry.

That's coherent, but it doesn't appeal to me.
