Well, if there is an issue (which is indeed important and all, but) 
which we have decided to shelve, then we ought to say that clearly, 
not give definitions which give the people what they want to hear, 
but don't in fact correspond to what we are saying.  RDF as it 
stands, seems to me, *doesn't* deal with temporal variance. Maybe it 
should, but it doesn't. (It doesn't deal with lots of other things, 
either, of course.)

Pat: So do I; but I thought that this particular discussion had been 
already dealt with, and that the broader terminology was now 
accepted. If not, then lets go back and get it sorted out as quickly 
as possible.  But if so, then let the glossary reflect the meanings 
we are using, not the ones that people wish we were using.

Pat: But it isn't this easy. Getting this right is tricky. For 
example, if the temporal extension of <uri1> is time sequence A, and 
of <uri2> is time sequence B, then presumably the triple <uri1> foo 
<uri2> is not supposed to say that foo holds between the A and B, but 
that a sequence of foo-relations holds between the elements of the 
sequences. But *which* elements? Always those at the same times? Or 
do we allow relations like Yesterday which are true between <uri1> 
and <uri1>-yesterday? What if foo holds between A and B only on 
weekends, say? And so on.

The use of words like 'current' sounds fine to a lay reader but it 
gives any logician nightmares, since its an indexical: it means 
different things at different times, like "now". Think about it. 
Suppose we actually had a logic with times, all sorted out with 
time-orderings defined and so on. Now, what time does a word like 
"now" denote? Answer: whatever time it was when the word was used. 
But what does it mean to 'use' a piece of RDF? RDF is put on websites 
and left there; it isn't speech, said by one person to another at a 
time and place. When was the RDF "used"? When it was composed? Or 
posted? Or read? Or used in an inference?  Indexicals literally make 
no sense in an assertional logic.

No, I don't like that at all. In fact I don't know what it means. 
(Identified by need???)

It would suggest a whole lot of stuff that we wouldn't have a hope in 
hell of ever getting clear, let alone formalized in any kind of 
useable inference language.

OK, but I really do not follow this talk of something being 'made' a 
resource. As far as I can see, in the sense we are using the word, 
everything already is a resource. Being a resource is just a way of 
saying that it exists (in fact, according to Brian, not even that.)

BTW, I also don't follow this notion of 'identification'. What would 
it mean for something to *not* have an identification? There is a 
similar notion of 'having an identity' that occurs in some W3C 
documents, which has a nice philosophical ring to it but which seems 
to be meaningless, since in the philosophical sense *everything* has 
an 'identity'; that's just a way of saying it is identical to itself.

I cannot follow this at all. Can you apply it to an example? Take 
'the current weather forecast', say, and assume for simplicity that 
it is one of Rain, Dry or Cold, and is issued every day. Now 
something like 'today's weather' is presumably one of Rain, Dry or 
Cold on any particular day, right? That's what makes it 'timely'. If 
it were the entire time-sequence <....Dry, Rain, Rain, Cold, Dry, 
....> it wouldn't be timely. But on this proposal, the Uri 
<todays-weather> denotes the entire sequence, so if we use it as the 
subject in a piece of RDF we are saying that the entire sequence has 
some property, not that todays' weather is suitable for playing 
cricket.

I think that we have. (As far as the MT is concerned we have, 
anyway.) So the glossary ought to reflect the reality of what we have 
done, not our dreams of what we ought to have done; still less the 
novice's fantasies about what we ought to have done, no matter how 
clear they might be.

I disagree: I don't think the SW can manage *without* something like 
this, in fact, in the long (or even medium) run. The SW isn't for 
PEOPLE to use, remember, its for MACHINES to use. People can use the 
ordinary web. But if some B2B software agent is trying to figure out 
when the money was transferred to the account, I would like for it to 
be *very* clear about things like the difference between today and 
yesterday.

Just tell them the truth. If its not what they want to hear, then its 
time they were told the way the things really are.

Actually, this usage of 'resource' is unknown outside the W3C 
community. Unlike words like 'entity' and 'thing', it isn't going to 
have a lot of surplus meaning-baggage: its a technical term we can 
define any way we like, within reason.
