At the F2F we took a show of hands for those interested in working on a RDF 
Primer as one of the RDF Core deliverables.  I'm interested in re-polling 
this group to identify individuals interested in working on such a 
Primer.  If there is a large enough group interested, I propose we 
form a sub-group to produce a pre-Working Draft Primer for review by 
whole WG by, lets say... the middle of October.

If you are willing to write some of this document, please send email to the
list.  I'll also be looking for a couple of folks to take on the burden of
organising this sub-group, so if you have the bandwidth please let me know
(publicly or privately as you prefer).

Brian
