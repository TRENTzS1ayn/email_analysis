Dave Beckett has asked me what the process is for handling feedback on WD's.

Does anyone know what the usual practice is?

I'd expect something along the lines of:

 o Editors should subscribe to www-rdf-comments@w3.org
 o Responses to comments on a particular WD should come from the editor(s)
   of that WD or someone they delegate to.

We need to decide what to do about the issues list.  Editors can either
maintain their own issues lists or pass issues to me and I will continue
to maintain the central one.  FWIW I'm planning to extend Jema to
include some support for issues management.  If its gets robust enough,
maybe we can put it up on a server somewhere.

Brian
