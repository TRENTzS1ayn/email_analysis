A description can be found at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2000JanMar/0108 but 
it is aimed (somewhat) towards major reviews that move documents 
out of a stage of W3C process. I still think it is useful, 
however.

Since it is not public I will summarize:

There is a table that includes all comments, each row is an 
issue with a pointer to the issue on the left and a pointer to 
the disposition on the right. Possible dispositions are comment 
was withdrawn, comment was out of scope, changes were made, or 
there is a minority opinion (which must be saved for future 
parts of W3C process. All these must be supplemented with 
pointers to the relevant email(s).

This table could also be represented in RDF. ;-)
