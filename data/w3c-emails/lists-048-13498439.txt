All true, all true. Two small comments.
1. We have to worry about communication between machines as well as 
humans, and that seems to require playing by different (and 
'stricter') rules; and
2. One can give model theories for languages (eg tense logics) that 
have explicit temporal sensitivity. I see the longer-term issue being 
whether a future MT might want to *not* make this simplifying 
assumption, and to aim our work in that direction, or at least 
attempt to avoid saying anything that would hamper that future effort.

Also, to return to the glossary issue, I would like the glossary to 
reflect the technical work that has been done, rather than our hopes 
for the future.
