I find this odd. Why not let them be equal in this case? Omitting the 
language tag presumably means that no language information is being 
supplied. But in that case, there is no need to reject a match with 
an identical literal which does have a language tag, is there?

Or is the idea that omitting the language tag is a way of indicating 
that ANY language tag would be inappropriate?

(A rational way to make sense of this would be to assume that UND 
means 'not any known language' and a missing tag simply indicates no 
information; but that rational interpretation seems to be ruled out 
by the above quote from RFC 3066, unfortunately.)

Seems to me all the f* could be t. Why not have (Smith, English) 
match (Smith,_) ? It has to be an English word or the first literal 
wouldn't be well-formed. If we reject this, why do we accept 
(Smith,_) matching (Smith,_)? After all, "Smith" might mean Sailor in 
Catalan.
