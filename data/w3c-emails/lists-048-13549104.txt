That's my preference at this point.

I can confirm that all the XML Schema simple/scalar datatype
values can be represented as (unicode-string, uri) pairs
using URIs from the XML Schema datatypes spec.

The complex type values can, in theory, be represented that
way, but (a) the XML Schema WG hasn't provided the relevant
URIs, and (b) it looks like a hack/kludge to re-serialize
XML values this way.

For primitive/scalar datatypes, yes.

For other stuff...

nor am I.
