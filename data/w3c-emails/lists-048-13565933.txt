phpht. cursed RFC2396...

I mean absolute-URIs-with-optional-fragment-identifier-s, yes.

cf.

[[
      For each built-in datatype in this schema (both primitive and
      derived) can be uniquely addressed via a URI constructed
      as follows:
        1) the base URI is the URI of the XML Schema namespace
        2) the fragment identifier is the name of the datatype
        
      For example, to address the int datatype, the URI is:
      
        http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int
