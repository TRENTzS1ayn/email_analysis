The unicode reference for making comparisons seems to be:

http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/

which is a W3C Last Call Working Draft whose last call period ended on
23 Feb.

I haven't yet understood what it says. A speed read suggested that when
creating RDF data you should normalise your unicode strings. (i.e. RDF
processors just do a simple comparison).

I'll try and give a better summary sometime next week.
