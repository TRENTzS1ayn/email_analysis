I agreed with Bill earlier, and continue to do so.

The purpose of defining equality is that in the model theory we are
talking about a graph, which is a set of edges. We need to be able to
tell whether one edge is the same or different from another edge.

We are not trying to define a processing model for language aware RDF
processors.


I think the graph constructed by

_:a <rdf:value> ("Roma", "it").
_:a <rdf:value> ("Rome", "en").
_:a <rdf:value> ("Rome", "fr").
_:a <rdf:value> ("Roma", _ ).

is different from 

_:a <rdf:value> ("Roma", "it").
_:a <rdf:value> ("Rome", "en").
_:a <rdf:value> ("Rome", "fr").

If the literal ( "Roma", _ ), i.e. with no language specified, is the
same as ("Roma", "it"), i.e. in italian, then the two graphs are
identical.


Now, suppose we have a language aware graphical information system, and
a user whose preferred language is "fr-ca" (French Canadian) comes up. I
have quite deliberately not tried to specify which label goes onto the
big city half way up italy.

Such an app may be clever enough to decide that "fr" is a better match
to "fr-ca" than _ but maybe not.

A different application, may always read a pair ( "string", _ ) using
the currently set default language; while that certainly should not be
the default case, I wouldn't want to rule it out as a way of processing
RDF.
