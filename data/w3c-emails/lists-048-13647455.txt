This seems like an editorial comment on the M&S text, yes?

Having an entry in the glossay seems like a good idea, though I personally
haven't tended to think of RDF processsors as being confined to operating
at the syntax level.  Did you have a specific syntax in mind?

I'm not sure that modifying the M&S text is that useful until 
we get to drafting the whatever replaces the model bits of M&S.
I suggest that I add this to the list of editorial comments on M&S and
we can then deal with it at the appropriate time.  Does that work for you?
