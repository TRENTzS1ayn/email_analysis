Other than log:Quote, not that I'm aware of (I've asked for feedback on
this in rdf-logic and rdf-ig: in fact I was just writing up the response
to those lists). 

I find it more than interesting that when it has occurred, people have
used Qname like constructs. Frankly, I'd be surprised if we never see
another extension to parseType. I can easily envision people wanting to
use parseType to qualify RDF-XML literals with XML Schema simple and
complex types, as XML Schema gets used in anger (to me it's a clear
point of tangency between RDF and XML Schema). It'd be great to be able
to say outright that people can reuse their XML Schema datatypes for
XML-RDF literals (imho, expect to see Schema datatyping to become a
standard practice in enterprise level middleware). Point being this: if
people can use their precanned types, they won't need to define new
parseTypes :)
