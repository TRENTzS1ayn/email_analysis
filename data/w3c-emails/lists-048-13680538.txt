Hi Brian,

Yes.

No not really. But when I'm thinking about processors, I'm thinking
about code that dealing with io, parsing and serialization, rather than
code that processes or manipulates rdf triples or graphs. I observed
that most references in the M&S to processing seem to be concerned with
the former . Frankly, it's difficult to get a clean distinction and
isn't worth spending much time fussing over; we surely have bigger fish
and all that.

Sure, sounds good.
