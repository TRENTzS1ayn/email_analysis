OK, fair enough, and very good points. I guess that I have been 
thinking of the lang attribute as a kind of property, which isn't 
appropriate when we are talking about syntactic identity. So I 
withdraw my query and suggest that Bill go back to his original 
three-(or maybe 2.5 -)valued truth-table.
