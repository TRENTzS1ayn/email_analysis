One possible starting point for our work on the primer might be 
this document I've put together:

http://logicerror.com/semanticWeb-long

I'm not sure how many of you have seen it, but I've given it to 
several people who were interested in understanding the concepts 
behind the Semantic Web, and they said it it was very helpful in 
getting started.

Obviously, there's more I'd like to add to this, and more that 
will be needed for the Primer, but perhaps this is a good 
starting place. One way in which I imagined the Primer working 
is being a running explanation of how yo go thru the process of 
writing some RDF documents, creating your own vocabulary, etc. 
with explanations of concepts along the way.

I think that real-world applications should be included along 
(obviously) with many examples. Some talk about what the future 
holds for the Semantic Web, and RDF probably wouldn't be too bad 
either.
