Mostly, it seems reasonable to me.  I have some comments on this:

(a) I'm not yet convinced that there is any need/value to distinguish 
between Literal and Canonical -- see other message on related topic of 
Literals.

(b) This is picky, but I think it's confusing to use different case for the 
qualified and non-qualified forms of Literal, etc.  I tend to view your 
proposal as providing default application of the RDF namespace for 
unqualified names;  so having 'rdf:Literal' and 'Literal' as equivalent 
values seems more natural to me.

For absolute clarity, I think there should be an example that uses a prefix 
other than rdf; e.g.

   <r:RDF xmlns:r="http://..." xmlns:x="http://...">
     <r:Description>
       <x:prop r:parseType="r:Literal">This is a <i>literal</i> value</x:prop>
     </r:Description>
   </r:RDF>
