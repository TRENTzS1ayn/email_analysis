I started with that at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range
but W3C team should give appropriate access rights.
In the mean time it can be found at

  Issue rdfs-domain-and-range:
  ---------------------------
  Should a property be allowed more than one rdfs:range property?
  What should the semantics of multiple domain and range properties be?

  -> Multiple domain and range constraints are permissable
     and will have conjunctive semantics.

  test001
    describes a property with rdfs:domain the intersection of 2 domains
  test002
    describes a property with rdfs:range the intersection of 2 ranges
  test003
    sample statement
  test004
    entailed description using test001, test002, test003 and axioms
  axioms
    a couple of N3 rules to infer rdf:type information
]]

I hope the rdf-to-nt is quite straightforward.
The entailment stuff is there to support the issue resolution.
We've been testing that with CWM and Euler.
For Euler we have
  java Euler test001.nt test002.nt test003.nt axioms.n3 test004.nt
which is like
  test001 test002 test003 axioms.n3 |=> test004
and it gives the appropriate evidence for the entailment.
For CWM we have
  python /n3/cwm.py test001.nt test002.nt test003.nt axioms.n3 --think
and we see that that includes the statements in test004
