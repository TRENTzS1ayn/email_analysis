When there are comments/questions/issues/etc. with specific
test cases, I think the original author of the test case
(or the last person who significantly changed the test case),
should be responsible for ressponding to the comment.

For example, who ever created:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-elements/test011.rdf
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-elements/test012.rdf

Should address the comment:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001JulSep/0242.html

OK?
