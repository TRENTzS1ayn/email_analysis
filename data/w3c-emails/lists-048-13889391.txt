Since the tests are not under a publicly-readable CVS archive,
seems like the best we can do is to say that the only tests that
were approved in the Sep 12 WD are in:

 [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/RDF-Test-Cases-2001-09-12.zip

and that any test or directory not in [1] or is different than
the same file in [1] has NOT been approved.

Seems like this should be a chair's responsiblity (perhaps as part
of tele-conf decision).
