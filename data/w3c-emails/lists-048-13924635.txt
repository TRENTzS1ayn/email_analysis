You've seen that very good Brian!
There is indeed little value in the individual
cases but I still believe very hard in the
  "this is what it means in n-triples"
when one applies the "entailment pattern"
*across* the cases, and I mean also cases
at other places.
I think it is the beauty of something like
  uri1 uri2 uri3 |= uri4
that it can explain further meaning.
I also think that it is perfectly
automatable (at least we do it right now)
but we indeed need some conventions for that.
