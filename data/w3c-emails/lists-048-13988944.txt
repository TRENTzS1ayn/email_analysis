Not sure if this sheds light, but danbri is fond of quoting this 
from the schema spec:

[[[
Although the RDF data model does not allow for explicit 
properties (such as an rdf:type property) to be ascribed to 
Literals (atomic values), we nevertheless consider these 
entities to be members of classes (e.g., the string "John Smith" 
is considered to be a member of the class rdfs:Literal.)

Note: We expect future work in RDF and XML data-typing to 
provide clarifications in this area.
]]]

I think this is a bit of a kludge.
