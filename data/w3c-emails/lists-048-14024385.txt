My take is that it provides a way of characterizing the things that 
literals denote.

So even if
   LLL rdf:type rdfs:Literal .
is not valid syntax, I think it's reasonable to be able to say that LV
(as in XL: qLiteral -> LV) is the same as ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)).

I think this is consistent with the material Aaron refers to in his 
response to you.  I think that material also hints at the possibility of 
recognizing different sub-types of rdfs:Literal.
