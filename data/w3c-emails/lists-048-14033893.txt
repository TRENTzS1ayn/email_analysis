Well, there is something very odd about having a constraint that is 
perfectly clear, perfectly natural, and assumed in the semantics, but 
being unable to say it in the formal language, especially when its 
perfectly clear HOW to say it in the formal language. (Its a bit like 
not being able to assert subclass loops, in fact :-)

That would be OK, since there the rdfs:Literal would be the value of 
rdfs:subClassOf rather than the subject of something.
