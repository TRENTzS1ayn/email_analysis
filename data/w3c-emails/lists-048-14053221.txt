this is also syntactic stuff and I had better used the symbol |-
  S |- R  i.e. "from the set of formulae S we can obtain the formula R"
(RDF graph seen as a formula)

at the moment we do that also via entailment i.e.
  f1 |- f2 & f2 |- f1
so that's why we keep the f(ormulae) in the same directory
but I can see that we keep the test descriptions distinct
