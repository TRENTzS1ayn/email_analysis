So Jos, would you be willing to draft something for inclusion in
the test cases WD which explains how these tests work.

The syntax test cases area easy.  The directory name tells me what
is being tested.  The RDF/XML files define the input and the equivalent
.nt files define the correct output.  If my implementation produces
equivalent output to the .nt file, then it processing that test case
correctly.

Its probably best to assume that a significant part of our audience
may be new to FOL.
