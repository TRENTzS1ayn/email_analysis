Oops, have I been misunderstanding?  I've been pointing to test cases from
the issues list document.  Are you saying that test cases under

   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/

Are not publicly readable?  I can read them, so they are presumably at
least member readable.

So to tell whether a test is approved or not, I have to download the
zip file?  That doesn't seem very satisfactory.

How about we include a status in the test case files?
