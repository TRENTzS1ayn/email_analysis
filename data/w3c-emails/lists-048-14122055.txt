I've tried this morning to sketch another approach.

Like the LFG approach of last week this is declarative.
However it is XML based, presumably implementable in XSLT, and
compatible with the Infoset grammar rather than an EBNF grammar.

Again, this is intended as a discussion document, primarily for the
syntax subgroup.
