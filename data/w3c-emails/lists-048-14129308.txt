Of course the tests are publicly readable.  However, the repository does 
not have a *CVS archive* that is publicly readable [thus no labels
or version history is available].  

For example, the W3C's source tree has a CVS archive that is publicly 
readable:

 http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/

It would have been very nice if the RDF test repository could have been
stored in that CVS vault.  The problem with doing that is that the W3C 
does not have the fine-grained access controls that would permit WG 
members to only have write access to the repository directory.

Perhap we should move the repository to a place where the public
can freely access all of the CVS information.

I put the following in the WD says

[[
 The test cases described and referred to in this document may also be 
 updated, replaced or obsoleted at an any time. 
]]

to give us the flexibility to do what we want, when we want.
