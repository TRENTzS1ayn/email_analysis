Folks,

To accompany the recent discussion of literals and language tags and URIs, 
here's a draft I'm circulating privately(-ish) for comment, with a view to 
IETF Internet Draft publication in a couple of days.  It is motivated by 
our RDF work, but that's not necessarily its sole target.

(Raw text and HTML attached.)
