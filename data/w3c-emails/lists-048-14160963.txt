At last the model theory is in readable form, at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html

There is still an appendix 2 missing (with the proofs of the lemmas 
in it) which I will attach in the next couple of days, but I thought 
the rest of it was readable without that.

The only really new part is the discussion of entailment in RDFS in section 5.

I've tried to take account of all the comments on what parts were 
obscure, misleading, etc..,

I've added a general introductory paragraph for model-theoretic 
newbies, and incorporated some comments here and there which were 
once in separate sections in earlier drafts (eg 3.1) .  If anyone 
feels that the brief comment on containers (section 6) goes beyond 
the action item, then I can take it out again.

PS. This was made using dreamweaver, so its better HTML than the last 
effort, but it hasn't yet been run through the W3C  filters.
