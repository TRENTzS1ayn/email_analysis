I got hold of Sergey (who is trying to get out from under the hundreds
of messages that piled up while he was away) by phone on the subclass
cycle issue.  He said he'd be on the teleconference on Friday (so
consider this just an interim FYI), but basically he said after thinking
about the issue following the F2F, he didn't see that allowing cycles in
subClassOf would make a big difference one way or the other.  He felt
that not having the restriction against cycles was probably a more
general way of handling them (since you could introduce
application-specific restrictions if you wanted to), and that he
wouldn't have a problem with removing the restriction against cycles if
we wanted to conform with DAML on this.
