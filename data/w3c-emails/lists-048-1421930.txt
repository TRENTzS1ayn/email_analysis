RDF Schema does not indicate how one chooses which schema to use.

I assume its the natural one, at the end of the apppropriate URL.
Alternatively there should be a mechanis, like xsi:schemaLocation for
specifying it. As a third possibility the application just knows.

Any single schema should be clear enough, i.e. it is a bug with the schema
if it is not possible to decude which *range* should be used.

A system for selecting the schema then resolves the "different people say
different things" problem.
