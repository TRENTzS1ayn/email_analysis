Dan Connolly :

It's a small change, but not one that I think can be reasonably
read into the RDF 1.0 spec. We're not designing RDF 1.0; we're
clarifying the spec, right?

I don't draw a useful distinction between a clarification and a redesign
if that's whats needed. I figure if we can go as far as producing a
model theory to clarify the spec, we can certainly add some words about
using parseType to qualify literals.


Dan Connolly :

If/when we get around to designing, I'll suggest that
we replace rdf:parseType with xsi:type (from XML Schema) wholesale.

Sure, you can do that. Or maybe find a way to extend rdf:parseType from
xsi:type and stay somewhat backward compatible (could that be done
inside RDFS' mandate now? Danbri??). In the meantime people will still
have to tunnel type information about XML-RDF Literals in some form or
another. So we might as well offer them an upgrade path.
