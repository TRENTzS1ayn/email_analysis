Thanks Pat!

It would be good to get this published.  We said we would allow a week
to give folks time to review publication candidates.  We have less than
that before Friday.  However, if folks have reviewed it to their
satisfaction by then, I'd see no point in delaying.

So unless there are objections, I may ask at Friday's telecon
whether we are happy to publish.  Anyone in the WG can veto that by
saying that they have not had time to review it, either by email
or at the telecon, in which case we'll delay another week.  If we
can review it by Friday and decide to publish that would be good.

Regarding the missing lemma's appendix, I'm not sure its absence is
a show stopper.  Would it be ok to hold off on that till the next
version?  Lets publish based on what we have, otherwise we get into
"there just one more bit I'd like to add" syndrome.

Brian
