[this isn't about the action list, so I changed the subject]

I'd like test cases to be part of the decision record.
Hmm... I thought we had some, but the ones I'm
thinking of are for domain/range.

I suppose I can cook one up...


Here's the gist of it:

========
@prefix u: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.
@prefix :
<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/test001#>.

:A u:subClassOf :B.
:B u:subClassOf :A.

:X u:subClassOf :X. # tautology
========

Formally, it's in RDF/xml and RDF/ntriples:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/test001.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/test001.nt

For fun, here it is in KIF:
  [see http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/rdfx2kif.py]


(prefix-kludge "u" "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#")
(prefix-kludge ""
"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/test001#")
    (and
     (u:subClassOf :A :B )
     (u:subClassOf :B :A )
     (u:subClassOf :X :X )
    )
