Yes, I agree, it's horribly botched. I'm not arguing that
it *should* be this way; only observing that it has been widely
interpreted this way.

Maybe we can convince
the implementors that have implemented it this way that it's
a bug. But it's a widely deployed bug. Perhaps not a lot
of applications depend on this behaviour, and it's
feasible to "fix" the bug; i.e. redeploy the implementations.

Well, yes, in the applications I want to build, that's
the sort of reification that would be useful.

I have no idea why anybody would want this form of reification.

Not for me.
