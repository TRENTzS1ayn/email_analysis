I await instruction. I meant to use 'URI' as the vanilla terminology, 
and 'uriref' when referring to Ntriples, but I may have slipped up in 
places.

Right.

YES!  You are absolutely right!

Many thanks for catching this. I will fix this in the next version 
(ready in a few hours)

See, *this* is why one ought to write the proofs before publishing.
