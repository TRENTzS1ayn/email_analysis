I agree we need to delete the current restriction.  However, given that
the issue is "*no* cycles in subClassOf" the problem appears to be that
there *is* a prohibition :-)  Fine:  change the wording to "to resolve
issue rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf by deleting the restriction
prohibiting cycles of subClassOf properties, with the meaning of a cycle
of subClassOf properties being an assertion that the classes involved
have the same members."
