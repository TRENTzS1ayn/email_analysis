Hmmm...

 From above:
1.   <I(aaa),I(bbb)> in IEXT(I(rdf:type))
2.   <I(bbb),I(ccc)> in IEXT(I(rdfs:subClassOf))

 From 1. and 5th rule of RDFS interpretation:
3.   I(aaa)          in ICEXT(I(bbb))

 From 2. and 6th rule of RDFS interpretation:
4.   ICEXT(I(bbb)) subset ICEXT(I(ccc))

Then by 3 and 4:
5.   I(aaa)          in ICEXT(I(ccc))

Which is the condition for
   aaa rdf:type ccc

QED?

If I'm right, these means no change is needed unless aaa is NOT of rdf:type 
ccc.
