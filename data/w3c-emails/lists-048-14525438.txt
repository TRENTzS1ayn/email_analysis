Ah, I see. I hadn't realized that this meant in English prose as well 
as in Ntriples syntax. It makes for rather unreadable English. 
However, Ive found that replacing 'anonymous' with 'unlabelled' makes 
the prose read OK, and it seems unobjectionable, since whatever we 
*call* them, they don't have labels, right? (Sorry, I forgot to do 
all the CSS fireworks , and just made the changes.)

OK, I have now tweaked the prose to make it both readable English and 
hopefully WG-correct.

BTW, I noticed that I was using 'label' to refer both to node labels 
and to ntriples expressions, which is confusing, so I have changed 
the latter to 'identifier', eg "....a particular uriref or bNode 
identifier in an N-triples document...."  I've also eliminated the 
usage of the term 'qliteral' since its no longer in the Ntriples BNF, 
and erased the last sentence of section 1.4, which didn't really say 
anything.

If anyone objects, say so before Friday :-)

Pat
