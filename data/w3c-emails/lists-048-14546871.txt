Whoops, you are right again.  Sorry. This was one I thought about 
taking out, but left in.

THIS is the case I originally had in there but decided to remove. It 
is the analogous inference for domains:

aaa rdf:domain zzz .
zzz rdfs:subClassOf yyy

??entails??

aaa rdf:domain yyy

and similarly for rdf:range, of course.

The real point is that in all these cases (and there may be others) 
it really is not  completely obvious what we want to count as a valid 
RDFS inference.

If all the RDFS semantic conditions were stated strictly as iffs, 
then all of these closures would have to be used, so that for example

foo rdf:type rdf:Property

would always entail

foo rdf:domain rdfs:Resource

but right now, the domain and range truth-conditions are only 'ifs', 
not 'iffs'.
