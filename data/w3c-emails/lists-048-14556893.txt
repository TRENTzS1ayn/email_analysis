so far, I was assuming yes (to your question)
and I thought you expressed that in the second last
entry of your table for RDFS entailment, no?
or (in notation 3)
  { ?x a ?C. ?C rdfs:subClassOf ?D } log:implies { ?x a ?D }.
and similarly for rdfs:subPropertyOf
  { ?s ?p ?o. ?p rdfs:subPropertyOf ?q } log:implies { ?s ?q ?o }.
I just see a typo in entry 2: BBB or bbb
