(Pat: my comments refer to I think not quite the latest draft, sorry if
any of the issues have been fixed).


The Model Theory draft is stunning.
I am certainly happy to see it go out.

I particularly liked the touch of section numbering from 0.
From the very first symbol in the table of contents it is clear that
this aims to be a serious mathematical document, rather than a
computer scientist's hack.

I have a few comments: three minor contentful points, and a few
spellings.



1: rdf:domain and rdf:range from RDFS spec.

In Section 4, in the paragraph before the table, the phrase
"rather than the wording in the M&S" should be
"rather than the wording in the RDFS spec."

2: Finiteness

In section 5, in the paragraph after the table, there is the word 
"finitely".

This is the first mention of finiteness in the document, personally
I was not assuming when reading this that the vocabulary was finite.

I believe infinite RDF models are out-of-charter, so would be happy
with making all vocabularies finite by changing the first paragraph of
section 1.4 to start

"All interpretations will be relative to a finite set of URIs, called
the vocabulary of the interpretation"

More conservatively, finiteness could be introduced in the second
paragraph of section 5

"Suppose E is a finite RDFS graph "

3: RDFS entailment rule missing?

In the table in section 5, I think rule 3 

aaa rdfs:subPropertyOf bbb .
   =>
aaa rdf:type rdf:Property .

should also have

bbb rdf:type rdf:Property .

on the RHS. 
This is only necessary when E does not contain any

xxx aaa yyy .

since otherwise the triple follows from the other rules.

Also, I would prefer if the rules were numbered.
(Perhaps those who know me and have got fed up with me discussing
grammar production 6.12, my favourite, would prefer if they 
weren't.)


4: Spellings ...
Ones I noticed were:
"sematnic" in 1.1
"the the existential closure" in 2.1
"decideable" in 3.1 after the Interpolation Lemma.
