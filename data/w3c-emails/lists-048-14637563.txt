charmod is a relatively recent specification of this
feature, but the feature itself is baked into HTML 4.0,
XML 1.0, XLink, and RDF 1.0:


  Note: Although non-ASCII characters in URIs are not allowed by [URI],
[XML]
  specifies a convention to avoid unnecessary incompatibilities in
extended URI
  syntax. Implementors of RDF are encouraged to avoid further
incompatibility and
  use the XML convention for system identifiers. Namely, that a
non-ASCII character
  in a URI be represented in UTF-8 as one or more bytes, and then these
bytes be
  escaped with the URI escaping mechanism (i.e., by converting each byte
to %HH,
  where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the byte value). 

By that wording, non-ascii characters in rdf:resource are
an error, and there's a suggested way to recover from the error.
By the more modern specs (XLink, charmod) this is no longer
an error but a 1st class feature.

I guess it's not totally obvious that we should follow XLink
on this, but if we don't, we owe the I18N WG a last-call
comment on charmod saying we're not going along with this.
I expect they wouldn't be happy.

The I18N WG has given its answer in the charmod spec; it's a question
of whether we want to follow along.

No, RDF 1.0 had the above note, and I think following charmod
is a reasonable interpretation of it.

I'm not sure when charmod will finish, but as I say,
it doesn't really matter: there are plenty of RECs
for precedent (XLink, at least).
