Hmmm, I was just examing the XML specs concerning system identifiers
....

See:

http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E4


Your quote from the old RDF spec:

This seems to be a misinterpretation of the XML spec, which the erratum
clarifies.
We should, IMO, hence go along with the clarification, and the RDF/XML
processor is responsible for escaping non-permitted characters in
URI-refs.



I also note that this is consistent with our test case:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.nt

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.rdf


which has not been approved, seems to suggest the following

1: ID's are subject to the same URI encoding rule.
2: N-triple URIs are in US-ASCII and must be already encoded.

These seem like good things.

Dan - do you know about namespace declarations? 
    - are the URIs in Unicode (needing escaping) or US-ASCII?
