OK, I'm aware there has been discussion along those lines;
I haven't been convinced by it.

I thought you were suggesting that the WG had made a decision
along those lines.

Er... do you mean you don't find it appealing or intuitive,
or that it conflicts with something in a technical sense?

I suggest IEXT("foo") is empty, and similarly for all literals;
I think that captures the intuition that literals shouldn't
be used as properties.

We do? I don't think we need anything called "node" in
the abstract syntax at all, let alone "a way to say when
the same node is being used in two places."

It's there in my message; you left it out:

Really?

I don't like the idea of arcIDs either.

I don't see why it cannot.

I don't understand what you mean here.
