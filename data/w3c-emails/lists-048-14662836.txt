Note that at present, RDF ID attributes are not XML IDs.  RDF M&S
uses a production from XML's original syntax, but does not say that
the IDs have the same meaning as XML.  There are also some words I
think about ID creating a resource in M&S - which I think has been
discussed previously (can't find them just now).

I noted this as an issue near
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20010906/#rdf-id

> 2: N-triple URIs are in US-ASCII and must be already encoded.

The encoding of URIs in N-Triples must change to match the Charmod
requirements, see the discussion on www-rdf-comments starting at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001JulSep/0245.html
and subsequent responses by me.
