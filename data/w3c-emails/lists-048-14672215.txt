I don't understand how that's relevant. We decided
that
rdf:ID="foo"
is short for
rdf:about="#foo"
and hence rdf:ID *is* subject to the same rules for
turning Unicode strings into URI references.

No... to do that would be to propagate a misunderstanding.

n-triples has the distinctive feature that URI references go right
in the file without any sort of quoting or other mangling,
except putting <>'s around them. (relative URI references do get
absolutized.) Recall: URI references consist of US-ASCII characters
only. No URI reference has an umlaut in it.

string literals in n-triples need quoting, but URI references
do not.

So n-triples shows the *result* of taking a unicode string
from an rdf:resource attribute and converting it to a URI reference.

I see:

|Looking; CHARMOD says, for URIs:
|
|  A W3C specification that defines new syntax for URIs, such as a new

That text from the CHARMOD spec is perhaps misleading: no W3C
specification can define new syntax for URIs. That's what
RFC2396 is for. W3C specs can be defined that *use* URIs.
n-triples is such a format. Luckily, as I say, URIs in
n-triples don't need any form of quoting.
