I didn't realize we'd get around to this issue so soon, but to 
warn the Working Group, I believe that these "URI-views", or 
whatever we wish to call them, should be removed from the RDF 
spec. It seems odd to claim we're the "Resource Description 
Framework" when many of the identifiers we use have no binding 
to Resources!

RDF needs to respect the layers it's building on top of, and the 
URI spec is one of those.

More information on the issue is at:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001May/0137.html

Which perhaps should be linked to rdfms-fragments on the Issues List.
