FWIW, I'm having a separate discussion with Martin Duerst about this issue 
with respect to CC/PP (an application of RDF);  Martin seems to think the 
XML system identifier rules should apply to URI values in RDF -- I'm 
pressing for clarity about why this is so, given that URIs per se cannot 
contain non-US-ASCII characters.

(I think part of the motivation is to prepare the ground for deployment of 
IRIs.)

I had been planning to report the outcome of the discussion back to this 
group, as it relates to some wording that exists in the existing RDF spec.
