7: Issue: rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf Frank Manola

Proposal: to resolve issue rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf by allowing cycles
of subClassOf properties.  The meaning of a cycle of subClassOf
properties being an assertion that the classes involved have the same
members.  A more formal specification of the meaning will be given
in the model theory.

Proposal: to approve the test case given in:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/test001.rdf
and
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/test001.nt

Question:  What about subPropertyOf?
