Brilliant piece of explanation, many thanks.

Actually, I have a secret belief that the Web is always going to 
consist of kludge-towers, since it is always going to be designed by 
the biggest committee one can imagine. Maybe the right moral to draw 
is that as long as we have machines which are *just* smart enough to 
de-kludge our interfaces, kludges that usually work are better than 
waiting for the killer notation.
