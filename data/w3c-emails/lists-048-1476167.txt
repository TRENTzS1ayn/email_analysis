(Personally I like Jeremy's view, anyway...)

Can someone tell me which of these are using, and which mentioning, Jan*?

The subject of the sentence is "Jan".

The sentence is about Jan.

Seems current reification behaves like the latter; is there anything
wrong with this?

jan

* Insert quotes as appropriate.
