I think this is a no-brainer from an internationalization point of view.

When a non-English speaker wishes to write a meaningful rdf:about or
rdf:ID value then they will use non-US ASCII characters.

Since URIs are US ASCII somewhere someone has to do the conversion, and
the %HH encoding of UTF-8 is the correct conversion to do.

It is necessary for a spec to say who does the conversion, and given
that RDF/XML is meant to be (barely) end user readable, it should be in
their language. Hence the RDF/XML processor needs to do the conversion.
