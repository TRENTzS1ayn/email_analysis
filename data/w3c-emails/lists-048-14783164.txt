(I forgot to CC this reply to the rest of the group. The changes 
mentioned, plus some minor tidyings-up,  have been made in the 
version which has a CSS-style-removed line at the top  dated 9/20 
11:25 am, which y'all should now be able to download.)

We mathematicians do have a certain sense of style. For example, I 
almost always put on a bow tie before typing long formulae.

Done

Hmmm.  I removed the finiteness condition from an earlier draft 
because I wanted to allow infinite vocabularies as a theoretical 
construction, to allow for interpretations of things like *all* 
instances of certain URI schemas, or whatever.  But the only place 
where this was actually being used was in a section that was very 
speculative and has been removed, so we could put it back in.

On the other hand, the MT works fine for infinite vocabularies, so it 
seems a pity to restrict it unnecessarily; and even if such things 
are outside the charter, there are advantages to being constructively 
agnostic. How about if instead I simply qualify the reference in 
section 5, by saying that *if* the vocabulary is finite then the 
rules will terminate. (And if it isn't, then of course they won't, 
but we can still talk about their closure, its just that we couldn't 
compute it by running the rules to exhaustion.) (I've made that 
change in the latest version, if you do a reload in about an hour; 
its just after the table of rules.)

See above.

Right, I missed that case. OK, done.

Hah. They were originally, but I kept having to re-number them and I 
didn't use the numbers anywhere, so I trashed them.

I have put numbers back in the latest version.

Thanks. I ran the text through three spellcheckers but they didn't 
find the the the. Fixed now.
