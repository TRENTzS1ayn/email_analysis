I've been updating ARP trying to get it to pass the test cases in the
zip file and have hit a number of problems.

Earlier in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0062.html

and the related thread I queried

rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007.rdf
rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0008.rdf


1: rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007.rdf

I suggested that the triple

<http://example.org/resource/> <http://example.org/property> "bar" .

was missing from rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007.nt

I got no response on that one.

2: rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0008.rdf

There was some discussion that didn't terminate on this one.

which I am supportive of.


A further problem is that a couple of files still have xml:base in them
as highlighted in
