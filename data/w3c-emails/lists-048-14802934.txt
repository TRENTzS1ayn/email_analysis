Well, I apologize if I misunderstood you, but that seemed to be what you 
were suggesting.

I find it difficult to see how we can resolve this without (a) disallowing 
"URI-view"s in RDF, or (b) undertaking a possibly rat-holing task of 
redefining the nature of URIs and URI-references when used with RDF, which 
I think may be stretching the charter.  However, I do think it is an 
important issue and I am open to other ideas.
