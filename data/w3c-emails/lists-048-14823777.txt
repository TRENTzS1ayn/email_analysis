I have no problem with that position.  I just don't think it's clear from 
the XML spec (for system identifiers), the XML namespace spec (for 
namespace URIs), or the current RDF spec (for URI-valued attributes, etc.).

I think that when one says a piece of text has URI syntax, and that it may 
also contain non-US-ASCII characters, then the latter has to be stated very 
clearly.  This is not completely at odds with RFC2396, which talks about 
characters -> octets -> URI-character mappings.  But I do think that when 
one talks of URIs in data streams, what is usually meant is a sequence of 
URI-characters;  i.e. the US-ASCII subset used by URIs.
