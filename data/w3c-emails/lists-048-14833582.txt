I'd propose instead the more recently corrected (in response to 
feedback from WG) version now found at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html

This should have a CCS-deleted line just after the title which reads 
(note time)

Latest update 9/20/01 1.38 CT

I have made two more small changes to the wording just before the 
rule table in section 5, using N-triples nomenclature instead of 
graph/node terminology, in order to clarify that the rules apply to 
unlabeled nodes as well as labeled ones. The tables are written using 
Ntriples syntax, so this is more appropriate anyway. Also I have 
slightly changed the notation used in the example after the table 
(foo bar baz instead of aaa bbb ccc, since the original could be 
misunderstood as saying that only these literal forms were intended. 
These are not substantive changes.

The document will need to be addition/deletion restyled (which I can 
do, once everyone is happy that we have the final version) and the 
version URLs inserted by whoever puts it onto its official pedestal.
