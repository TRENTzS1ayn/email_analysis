That is legal RDF/xml syntax (or rather: it corresponds
to RDF/xml syntax in a way that the WG has agreed on),
but the way you read it is exactly
the issue we're debating. I read it as saying that something
denoted by the uriref Pat is related by a relation
denoted by the uriref shoeSize to a two character string
'1' '0'. i.e. it corresponds to
(shoeSize Pat "10")
in KIF.

The shoeSize relation might be defined in such a way
that allows you to conlude that your shoesize is ten.

Not in any particular way; n-triples syntax is independent
from XML.

we are not obliged

That's my suggestion.

er... huh? You'll have to tell me how your new syntax
relates to RDF/xml syntax, then.

That would be nifty if RDF/xml had such a syntax.
I believe/suggest that it does not.

So that example is irrelevant, from my perspective.

(a) as a relation, it *is* invertible; its inverse is
not a function, but it's a well-defined relation. (b) if
you need an inverse that's a function, the XML Schema
spec does give a canonical lexical representation for
each value.
