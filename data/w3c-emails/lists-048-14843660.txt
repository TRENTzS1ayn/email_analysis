Pat (et.al.),

I was wondering if it might make sense to include a sentence or three in 
the abstract to help explain Model Theory and the benefits of expressing 
RDF in terms of this formalization?

Something along the lines of

[[
Model Theory is the part of mathematics which shows how to apply logic to 
the study of structures in pure mathematics.
]] - http://www.math.toronto.edu/~weiss/

and then append the following section (currently located in the Status of 
this Document)

[[
This document was written with the intention of providing a precise 
semantic theory for RDF and RDFS, and to sharpen the notions of consequence 
and inference in RDF. It reflects the current understanding of the RDF Core 
working group at the time of writing. In some particulars this differs from 
the account given in Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax 
Specification, and these exceptions are noted.
]] -- http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html

to the abstract.

Does this make sense?
