Summary: I'm happy for this to be published as a draft.

Detail:

4. RDFS Interpretations

6th paragraph:
        "The subsets referred to in subPropertyOf are sets of pairs."
and subsets in subClassOf?

6. RDF containers

1st paragraph
2nd sentence too long for me to read!  Can you split into something like
this?

   A container is a resource which is a member of one of three subclasses
   rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq or rdf:Alt of the class rdfs:Container.
   This class is the domain of a countable set of properties indicated
   by rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc., all of which in turn are members of the
   class rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty.

Before publication there are some minor things that should be done
apart from the other W3 style, checking:

  (Remove all the removed, added parts and styles)

  Add anchors to all things that might want to be pointed to, such as
  the lemmas.  At present they are e.g.
    <strong id="mergelem">Merging lemma.</strong> 
  best to be something like
    <a name="mergelem" id="mergelem"><strong>Merging lemma.</strong></a>

  Hyperlinks to the N-Triples terms e.g. uriref, bNode in the test
  cases doc. such as
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-rdf-testcases-20010912/#uriref

  A reference section in W3 style and [CITE] for RDF M&S, RDFS,
  Test-Cases, N-Triples section in test-cases, anything else.  Maybe
  normative, non-normative ones if they help. 

  Very minor point - appendixes usually labelled A, B in w3 docs I've
  looked at?

Great work

Dave
