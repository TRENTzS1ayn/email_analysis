Pat,

I've been testing the 12 rules in
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html#rdfsentail
(we actually have 14 rules because of the 2 rules with 2 statements in
their conclusions) and I think it all goes very well except for rule 1.
I currently don't see how to implement that with a back-chaining reasoner.
Any hint?
