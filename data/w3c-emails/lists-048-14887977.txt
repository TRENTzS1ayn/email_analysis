Thanks. However, this is a bit confusing (on my screen) since one 
cannot see the arrows going 'through' the mapping boxes. Eg the 
mapping from 1 to 2 and 2  to 1 isn't clear. Could those boxes be 
made translucent?

I can make translucent stuff using Omnigraffe, but I have no idea if 
it can be rendered in HTML.
