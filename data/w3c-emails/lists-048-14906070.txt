Er .... subsets? The point of the remark was just to remind 
nonmathematical readers that a relational extension is a set of 
pairs, so a subrelation is a subset. If it's confusing, maybe it 
would be best omitted.

OK, will do.

Will do.  At this stage it needs cleaning up.

OK, will do. (But what is the point of adding anchors which aren't 
used? If this is obvious, never mind. I'm an HTML newbie.)

Will do. Ah, this answers the previous question, right? Never mind.....

>   A reference section in W3 style

Oh, whoops, I forgot that. (Though isn't a bit pass? to have a 
references section in hypertext? Seems a bit like putting a 
whip-caddy on a horseless carriage. Oh well, go with the flow. )

I don't follow this last point, I'm afraid.

OK, will do.
