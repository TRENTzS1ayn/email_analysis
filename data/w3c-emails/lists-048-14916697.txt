Ah, good point. Maybe it would be better to rewrite the table with 14 
rules in this format. I'll do that unless anyone screams, OK?

I guess I don't see what the problem is. Can you elaborate?

Pat

PS. Why do you ever need to backchain? I think you can use the rules as
though they were a production system: as soon as a LHS matches, fire 
the rule (and check its not duplicating anything) then re-start 
searching from the beginning of the list. If you ever get to the end, 
stop.
