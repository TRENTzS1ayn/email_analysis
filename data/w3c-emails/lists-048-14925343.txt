My point was, is it only the subsets in subPropertyOf that are sets
of pairs?  Answer: yes?  The subsets refered to in the subClassOf
defn. and elsewhere are not.

The two sets of references could be (this is just a suggestion)

1) Normative - documents you cite upon which this document depends
   for definitions, refers to directly in the text such as RDFM&S,
   RDFS and Test-cases etc.   This section is stuff that must be read
   and understood in order to read the document.

2) Informative (or non-normative) - other documents.
   Here you could pointers to related work, theoretical basis, primers
   etc.  This is all optional, and up to you if you have stuff that
   goes here.
