Oh, I see. Yes.

Well, they might be sets of anything, in fact, including pairs as 
well as grapefruit, say, but that's not really to the point.

I will try to make this all clear. Maybe it would be best to just 
leave this sentence out, it seems to be causing more grief than it is

I suspect that there will be so few references that this will be overkill.
