OK, guys, what I hope is a final version is now at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html

I've put in references and internal anchors as requested, and 
re-organized the introductory material to put the newbies-intro stuff 
at the front; I think it reads better now.  (The section headings and 
numbers have changed as a result.)

Ive replaced the rather klunky reference phrases with proper 
W3C-style square references that link to the biblio. (The href for 
'model-theoretic semantics' might give people a pathway into some 
background reading. )

It still has the old drawing in it, but we can fix that later.

I've run it through the W3C filters, and it seems OK apart from the 
version-?? links.

Pat
