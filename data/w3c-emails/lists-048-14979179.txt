Agreed.

The erratum
http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E4

is the only clear statement I've seen in the specs you've menetioned that I
am aware of.

I think charmod is fairly clear.


Given the lack of clarity of the current RDF spec on this issue I think we
can clarify it in accordance with charmod and allow international RI, which
the RDF/XML processor has to UTF-8-RFC 2396 escape.

I agree wholeheartedly with your desire for a clear statement of that.

The main problem I see is with name-spaces. Given XML namespace's silence on
the issue, maybe it means that these are already US-Ascii, which would be
ugly since we would then be mixing two different forms for the same URI.
