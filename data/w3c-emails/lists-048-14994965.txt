Um, I replied and agreed with you in

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0063.html

I propose we fix this by adding the triple.

Lets fix this too by removing test0008.rdf

I also support the removal of the xml:base attributes from
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-elements/test011.rdf
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-elements/test012.rdf

Do we need this confirmed by the WG or can we just get these fixed as errors?

Dave
