Ah, that is precisely why I *do* like it. After all, RDFS is supposed 
to be the central, canonical, universal class reasoning engine; and 
here we have a class heirarchy of central importance to the language. 
It seems to me that if RDFS is unable to describe its own datatyping 
class heirarchies, then it really isn't doing very well as a class 
reasoner.

Again, this seems like a bug/feature disagreement.

I think we are seriously confused here somewhere. First, neither P 
nor S  'shrink' the graph. P leaves the graph alone, X shrinks it, 
and S enlarges it. Second, both P and S have untyped literals as node 
labels, so they seem to be entirely equivalent as far as 'hiding' 
lexical forms goes (whatever that means).

Explicit in the label but not accessible to a reasoner, which is what 
worries me.
