Well, not resolving the issue would place us squarely in the 
territory of (b), I would think.

Other options I can see:
  - Make some noise about deprecating URI-views in RDF and 
politely ask people to stop using them

  - (ugly kludge) Map URI-views into some other form of URI, such as:
http://www.example.org/foo#bar
   =>
http://www.w3.org/2001/ugly-
kludge/?uri=http://www.example.org/foo&view=bar

I hold out faith for other solutions...
