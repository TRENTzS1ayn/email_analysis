I'm leaving the W3C and thus must resign from the WG.  My last
full day at the W3C will be Nov 12 although I do expect to have
some limited access on Nov 20. 

Anyhow, the editor's copy of the Test Case WD:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/

is ready for publishing.  The changes since the first WD are 
summarized in:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#change_log

and the open issues are logged in:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#open_issues

Good luck and please, keep/make it simple, simple, simple :-)
