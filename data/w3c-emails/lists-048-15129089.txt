Since the set of graphs on both sides of the entailment is 
closed, would not a list be more appropriate for enumerating 
them?

  [ a tc:Graph ; tc:contents (<g1> <g2> <g3>) ]  tc:entailRDF
  [ a tc:Graph ; tc:contents (<g4>) ] .

You use both entailrdf and then rdfsentail. I'd suggest 
mtrdf:entails and mtrdfs:entails to make the separation clearer, 
and also keep model theory statements out of the test cases 
schema.

Hmm, this seems less-than-adequate to me because it does not 
represent the key to these test cases, namely that they are in 
different formats... Perhaps something like:

[ a tc:Graph ; tc:file <g1.rdf> ; tc:format tc:RDF-XML ]
   tc:equivalent
[ a tc:Graph ; tc:file <g1.nt>  ; tc:format tc:N-Triples ] .
