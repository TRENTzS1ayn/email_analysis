Well, the set is not closed at the LHS.
One can always add extra graphs at the LHS and the
RHS is still entailed (monotonic feature).
The RHS is a single graph.

I have to think about the rest of your message
So
[[
  Jos de Roo: Write up something to describe these entailment
  tests (with help from Pat)
  Jan Grant: Write up proposal for an RDF test case manifest
  Art Barstow: Collect the above materials for inclusion the RDF
  Test Cases WD
]] -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0326.html
seems very close!
