Jos, you are basically right, thanks for catching it. I've found a 
patch (detailed below) and put up a version of the document with this 
fix  (and the fix to rule 9) at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-rdfs-fixeddraft.html

Dan, can we can go to press with this version, or is it too late??

Hmm. I had thought that this was all derivable, but I see that maybe it is not.

0b is, I think:
1:  xxx aaa yyy.
2:  aaa type property . (1, rule 1)
3:  property type class . (2, rule 7)
4:  property subclass Resource (3, rule 8)
5:  aaa type Resource (2, 4, rule 11)

but one can do this for the others only if you can infer that they 
are in a class, and of course they may not be. If nothing is said 
about classes or the range and domain of aaa (which would provide 
another path using rules 5 and 6, then 7 etc., then as above) then I 
think the rules would be stuck.  Damn.

>If yes, that would mean that LV is a subset of IR

They would have to be stated like rule 9b, using 'uuu' to rule out 
the literal case for yyy, and then I think this would not be 
required. Ah, just noticed, rule 9a should be stated NOT using uuu. I 
will change that.

---

OK, heres my suggestion: expand rule 1 into 3 cases, like this:
1a

xxx aaa yyy .    -->   xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

1b

xxx aaa yyy .   --->   aaa rdf:type rdf:Property .

1c

xxx aaa uuu . ---> uuu rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

where 1b is the current rule 1 of course.

OK with you?

Pat
