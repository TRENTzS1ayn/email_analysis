Oddly, I can see Pat's document becoming a very useful general introduction 
to model theory, with RDF as a sample language... it (RDF) has enough 
complexity to show what the MT brings to the party, but is simple enough to 
be easy to understand what is going on.

Also, I think there's some background in Pat's old "Naive physics 
manifesto" papers that helps to motivate the necessity of mapping from 
language to some domain of discourse.

(I offer this simply as observations from someone who has relatively 
recently gone through a learning process about MT principles.)

Thus, rather than duplicating material in the MT document, maybe the primer 
material could be a short commentary on that document?
