I like the general approach here, but would like to see the MT distinction 
maintained between RDF entailment and schema closure.  Maybe using 
something like:

   [ tc:graph g1, g2, g3 ] tc:entailrdf [ tc:graph g4 ] .

   [ tc:graph g1, g2, g3 ] tc:merge [ tc:graph g4 ] .

   [ tc:graph g1 ] tc:schemaClosure [ tc:graph g2 ] .

?

Then RDFS entailment might be described as something like:

   [ tc:graph g1, g2, g3 ] tc:merge [ tc:graph g4 ] .
   [ tc:graph g4 ] tc:schemaClosure [ tc:graph g5 ] .
   [ tc:graph g5 ] tc:entailrdf [ tc:graph g6 ] .

where satisfying values for g6 are exactly what is s-entailed by { g1 g2 g3 }.
