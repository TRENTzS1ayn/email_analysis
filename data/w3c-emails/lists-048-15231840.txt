Jeremy,

that is indeed true, and I think the current MT is
reflecting that position:
   -------------------------------------------------------
  | 1c | xxx aaa uuu.     | uuu rdf:type rdfs:Resource.   |
   -------------------------------------------------------
where
  uuu for any uriref or bNode (but not a literal).
so 1c does,t apply for LV (and I had to know that
and not cause the confusion with 0c, but I was
biased by my implementation problerms,...)
