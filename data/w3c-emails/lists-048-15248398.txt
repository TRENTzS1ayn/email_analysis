Bill and I have produced the attached text for your consideration.

The goal is to have something that we might agree on, and if so, then the
various editors can cut and paste out of this text as appropriate. [Some of
the text is more relevant to the model theory (not this draft!), some to the
syntax, some to the primer].

I apologise for rather ducking the (unminuted) request to explain how to
modify the (unicode string, RFC3066 lang tag) representation to have a
general URI rather than a language tag. Paras [2] and [3] are the limit of
the treatment of this proposal.

If we've time, I would like to discuss this text at Friday's teleconference.

Jeremy

PS Brian has put in a bug report against ARP's handling of
parseType="Literal", which is pretty weak. I am hoping to get agreement to
this text so that I can bounce it!
