I'm not sure what is the value of saying this.

It seems to me that this would be an application concern,
if an RDF processor is still expected to accept non-normalized XML
as a literal.  Hence I'd rather say nothing here.

Similarly, I don't think this has any place in the RDF specification, other 
than perhaps as a non-normative implementation recommendation (hence not 
using RFC 2119 form - may rather than MAY).

What's a normalizing transcoder in this context?  (I think this means 
conversion to character-normalized UCS/Unicode.)

[Later:  now I see -- 
http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#def-normalizing-transcoder; citation at this 
point would be helpful.].

I think the expression "binary equality" here is an over-simplification of 
the cited identity matching algorithm;  I'd suggest describing it as 
"String identity matching, per [citation]".

I think the indicated transformations are legitimate for *any* value of 
parseType;  if parseType='Resource' that would not affect the resultant 
RDF, and for other values of parseType, if they are not recognized then 
they may be treated as 'Literal' per spec.

..

Apart from these small comments, I think you've done an impressively 
thorough job here.
