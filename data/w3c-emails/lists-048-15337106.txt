That wasn't my intent.  I added the following text to the 
test case:

[[
 Description: the purpose of this test case is to show how
 how XML's Predefined Entities - in this case the ampersand -
 is escaped when it is used in the value of an rdf:about
 attribute. Note that the ampersand is represented by its
 numeric value as specified in:

 http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-predefined-ent

 In the associated N-Triples file the numeric value of the
 ampersand will be replaced with single ampersand character.
 Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file, the
 ampersand may be displayed and not its numeric value.
]]

Anyhow, specific word changes would be helpful.
