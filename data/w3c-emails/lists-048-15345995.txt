I'd be happy to provide:

  Description: the purpose of this test case is to show how
  reserved characters in XML - in this case the ampersand -
  are escaped when they are used in an RDF document.
  Note that the ampersand is represented by its
  corresponding entity as specified in:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-predefined-ent

  In the associated N-Triples file the encoded ampersand entity
  will be replaced with a single ampersand character.
  Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file, the
  ampersand may be displayed instead of the '&amp;amp;' entity.
