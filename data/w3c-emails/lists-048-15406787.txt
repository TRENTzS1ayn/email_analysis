I don't really understand how this sort of RDFS spec fits into
our present work. Isn't it completely subsumed by
sections 4 and 5 of the model theory spec and the primer-to-be?

  http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html

Hmm... I guess neither of those is home to rdfs:label nor rdfs:comment.
nor rdfs:seeAlso rdfs:isDefinedBy (how is it that those
are "core properties"?)

If we're going to stick to the idea of an editorial revision
of RDF 1.0, the RDFS sections of the MT can't go in there.
But maybe it's not worth doing separate RDF 1.0-second-edition
and RDFS-to-REC processes; maybe it's easiest to just
do one big set of specs.

Anyway... I don't think the RDFS spec should maintain its
present form. I suggest it should be about 3 pages:
just give each of the terms in the vocabulary and
the rules (ala the MT spec) that define them.
Leave all the examples and fluffy prose to the primer(s).
