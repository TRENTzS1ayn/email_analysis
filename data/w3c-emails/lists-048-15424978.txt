I don't have a strong opinion about whether the RDFS spec should
maintain its present form or not, but I don't think I agree with the
idea that the spec should be nothing more than 3 or so pages of terms
and rules, with all the explanatory material pushed off into the
primer.  I expect a primer on a language to be be a source of
explanatory material on that language, but not to be the *only* source
of explanatory material (and I would expect a primer to go about its job
of explaining things differently than a specification would in any
case).  There is room for argument about examples being part of a
language specification or not (I tend to favor them), but I expect the
spec by itself to be a reasonable description of the language for those
who are intended to be its likely users.  If the prose is too "fluffy",
let's unfluff it, not eliminate it entirely.
