Right, so do I.  See below. I don't want to open this hornet's nest either.

I think you will find that 1c is OK. It deliberately uses the form

xxx aaa uuu .   --->   uuu rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

where uuu is required to NOT be a literal, in order to block the case 
that you object to, and leave the question open.  The rules already 
did this in places that would have produced a triple with a literal 
in the subject position, for just this reason.

In any case this is required by N-triples syntax at the present: the form

xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

is syntactically illegal, and hence not a triple,  if xxx is a literal, right?

I agree.
