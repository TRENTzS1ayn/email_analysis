Good man. There are now three versions you can choose from:

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-rdfs-fixeddraft1.html

which has the example after the RDFS table fixed, as Jos suggested

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-rdfs-fixeddraft.html

which only has the table fixed, and

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20MT-currentdraft.html

which is the old buggy version.

If its still possible to choose, the first is better than the second.

Pat
