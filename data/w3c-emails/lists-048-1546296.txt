Perhaps I'm not understanding the S and P proposals, but
I don't see how any examples can be created that are
relevant to any of the proposals, as the S P and X
proposals are about attaching type to literals, right?

What I'm talking about is when there is *no* type attached
locally to the literal. It's just the literal. 

What am I missing here?
