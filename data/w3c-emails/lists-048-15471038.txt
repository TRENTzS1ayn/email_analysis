Sorry. I started off using 'added' and 'deleted' styles but it got 
unreadable, and it is a chore to put those tags round every little 
jot and tiddle. Apart from the substantive changes that have arisen 
from email discussions, and the editorial style changes suggested by 
Dan to conform to W3C guidelines, I have slightly re-worded the 
acknowledgements section several times, fixed minor typos when I see 
them, added some references, a new figure 1, and inserted some more 
text anchors.

I have left the version dated 23 September alone and since then added 
new versions with new URIs (two so far:
The latest version has a substantial change to the RDFS rules after 
Jos found a bug in them, and I am about to change the example just 
after the table to conform to that change, again as Jos pointed out.

Thanks. Neat tool, maybe I should get one.

Oh.

Sure. I thought it was stable until Jos found a bug in the RDFS rules 
:-) I sincerely hope that there will be no more changes.
