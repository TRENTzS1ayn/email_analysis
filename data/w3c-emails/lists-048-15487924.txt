Hello all,

For folks interested in working on the RDF Primer, Eric's trying 
to arrange an initial telecon. Current proposed time is:

Thursday, 2001-09-27 at 11:00 AM EST

We're hoping to cover the outline, scope, and getting initial 
people to sign up for sections of the document.

RSVP to me/Eric about whether or not this time is good for you.

Thanks,

--
