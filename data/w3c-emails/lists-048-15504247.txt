My current plans are to use this document and the feedback received before 
Thursday 9:00 am EST to help shape the discussions for an RDF Primer call 
(time still to be confirmed, but targeting this Thursday, 11:00 am EST, 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0368.html )

RDF Primer subgroup, please review this rough draft and comment on scope, 
outline and additional related documents that might be of interest in 
helping shape this Primer.  Also, if there is a section that you're 
particularly keen on, feel free to have rough drafts started ready for 
discussion for this call.

Brian, please consider a report from this teleconference an agenda request 
for Friday's RDF Core call.
