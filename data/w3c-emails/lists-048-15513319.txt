Hmm...
  "RDF Primer is a non-normative document ..."

I'd like to nip this sort of tone in the bud.

I'd rather the first sentences in the document were something
light and energetic like...

RDF is a nifty technology for integrating all sorts of stuff...
for getting the computers to acutally help solve problems,
rather than just shuttling them between people.

If you're new to RDF, or you have been put off
by all the stilted language-lawyer-ese RDF documentation,
this document is for you!
