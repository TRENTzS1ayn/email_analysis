Sure, but we could argue fruitlessly on delineating between processors,
serializers, parsers and applications and so forth. The term used in the
M&S is usually 'processor. Processors above means things that do stuff
with the XML syntax: go figure. Having to say things like this is why I
wanted a common sense definition of an rdf processor put into a
glossary, without stipulating a processing layer cake. Saying parser is
fine.

That was intentional, to emphasize a point: if human readers can't
always see equivalences in literals without extra info, machines haven't
a chance. That's probably too zen for a spec. Adding a comment would be
fine.
