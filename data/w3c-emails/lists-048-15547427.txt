No, it is more than the parser.
*normalization* is the job of the parser. 
This is true whatever the input syntax, e.g. if the input document is
not in a UCS-based encoding, then unicode NFC should be applied.

*equality* is the job of the implementation of "=" which typically is
not in the parser, since the parser does not care about equality.

I think the rest of the text is talking about the parser role using the
term "RDF/XML processor" (as distinct from RDF processors).
