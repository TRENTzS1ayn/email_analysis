I agree with Dan.  It may be necessary for "official reasons" to include 
these statements, but it seems to me they could go at the end.  As part 
of the core "primer" material, it might be reasonable to include some 
discussion about the relationship of the material in the Primer to the 
actual specs, expressed in normal English (i.e., not using terms like 
"normative").
