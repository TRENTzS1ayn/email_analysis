Er... whoa! I'm having trouble following this thread...
I doubt I'll be prepared to decide on this by Friday.

I need direct implementation experience with whatever
proposal we come up with in order to be comfortable.
(test cases are really important for that, btw.)

In particular:

What happened to the proposal that an RDF literal
is a (string, URI) pair?

As I've said, I think it's important to decide this
issue in the context of integration with XML schema
datatypes. But I can at least see how the (string, URI)
idea would work with XML schema datatypes.

Yikes! I haven't seen enough motivation to change the RDF 1.0
spec in that way. (maybe the motivation is there and I
just haven't read it.)

I'm not comfortable with that.

I'm not comfortable with that either (as I've said).

For the rest, I'd have to have my implementation-source-code
open in the other window to review it carefully. No
time for that just now. (I'm in another telcon :-( ).
