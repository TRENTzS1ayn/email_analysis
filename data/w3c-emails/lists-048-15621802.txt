I agree, lets avoid abstractions as far as possible at the beginning 
of everything. Start with an example, would be better, as a way to 
introduce the points being made. Can we cook up a simple, artificial 
but convincing example/case study to use to illustrate the main 
points? It ought to show RDF doing more than XML would do :-)
