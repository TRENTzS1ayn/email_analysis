The temptation to do a commercial is hard to resist. Profium's main
product is an RDF-based routing engine. It uses available RDF sources to
divert content to where it's required. It's RDF-based, it's working now
and it's not directly part of the Semantic Web movement...

But there again you don't necessarily want a commercial.

I have managed to describe the application without too much of a sales
pitch in the past. I could do it again.
