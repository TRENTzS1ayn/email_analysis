Depends. Equality of what? Equality of lexical items *is* the 
business of the parser (actually of the lexicalizer, if that 
terminology is acceptable here). So this depends, seems to me, on 
whether or not literals are considered to be lexical/syntactic 
thingies, or only semantic thingies. In the MT I assumed they were 
syntactic, and left open the issue of what they denote (could be 
themselves, of course).
