I think that would have to be at least two examples.

It is my view that the value of RDF is that it allows data/information to 
be shared between applications, and ultimately for some kinds of processing 
to be handled by generic software systems.

So, I think the value to be demonstrated is when a new application is 
introduced that relevant data created by existing applications is 
accessible to the new application, and vice  versa.

TimBL once gave an example of an invoice for aircraft parts;  some elements 
would be details of commercial transactions, generated by a sales/order 
processing system, while others would be related to the technical bill of 
materials for an aircraft, generated by engineering CAD software.
