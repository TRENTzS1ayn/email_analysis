Whoa! #2 - this is far too much to take in.
It is too early to approve it.

After a quick scan:

  * What Issues do all these points address?  Please re-order by
    issue.  If they address none, why are they there?

  * It seems to require changing existing software in unclear ways.

  * No implementations (I want more than one)

  * Hypothetical future work (stuff like "RDF Core WG
    may in future ...  One example is ").  Delete these.

  * Repeats things from other documents e.g.  "the usual XML
    processing rules" then includes some rules - should cite them
