There are some serious bugs in the RDFS closure table in section 6 of 
the MT WP. See a recent message from Peter Patel-Schneider and my 
reply, on rdf-logic 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2001Sep/0033.html.
  I will try to get the bugs out and produce a revision as soon as 
possible (couple of days). Along the way I will also fix all the 
little typos and add a wee bit of explanatory prose here and there to 
prevent the misinterpretations that seem to have been produced.

One matter that I would like some feedback on is, what to do about 
rdf:type rdfs:Literal.  Since it is syntactically illegal in RDF to 
write

xxx rdf:type rdfs:Literal .

when xxx is a literal, and since this is false in RDFS if xxx does 
not denote a literal value, there would seem to be little utility in 
having rdfs:Literal in the language at all, since it is impossible to 
say anything true about it other than things like

rdfs:Literal rdf:type rdfs:Class .

which have it in subject position. So I decided to simply ignore it. 
However, I didn't actually say that it was being ignored, so Peter 
was right to slap my wrist about this.

I am inclined to simply avoid this issue right now by explicitly 
stating in section 6 that the RDFS analysis simply excludes all 
mention of rdfs:Literal, with a brief explanation of why and 
suggestion that this will be revisited in future work. If nobody 
objects strongly to this way of getting out of this problem, I will 
circulate a draft wording soon.

....Sorry ....

Pat
