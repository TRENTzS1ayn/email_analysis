I am sure that I can fix all the bugs in the RDFS model theory. They 
are all things missing from the closure-rule table in section 6.

However, it is also clear that there are some subtle issues 
surrounding rdfs:Literal  (see 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2001Sep/0039.html )
that really ought to be explained in a bit more detail, and should 
probably be looked at by the WG before being published. Many of the 
problems that Peter has noted aren't in fact fatal, but they do show 
up the need for more exposition. Also, since Peter and Dan Connolly 
seem to agree about the oddity of ICEXT, I will see what happens if I 
rewrite the MT without using it at all.

I will try to get this all done as (a) readable draft(s) (with 
changes all style-sheeted for visibility) before Monday.

Pat

PS. I guess the fact that Peter didn't find anything much wrong with 
section 3 can be thought to be some consolation :-)
