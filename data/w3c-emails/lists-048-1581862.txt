Ah. OK, that would work, as long as one doesn't think that

aaa <rdf:_NNN> bbb .
aaa <rdf:_NNN> ccc .

is a contradiction. However, the other problem remains, that there 
seems to be no way to distinguish a bag from a set. For example, if 
the bag [aaa aaa bbb] has both aaa and bbb in every position, then 
how does it differ from the bag [aaa bbb] ? They both have bbb in the 
second place.
