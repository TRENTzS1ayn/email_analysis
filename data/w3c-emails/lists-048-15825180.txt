Another way that I could thin the text would be to create a shorter document
that only addressed RDF files in UTF-8 & UTF-16, e.g. those without any
encoding attribute in the xml declaration.

This could avoid completely any mention of normalization!
(I suspect that this is part of the *too much* problem).

I won't do that this week ....
