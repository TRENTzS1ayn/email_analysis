OK, I've got a billion things to try to tie up, but as Art requested...

There's a brief, slightly more articulate discussion of this at
http://ioctl.org/rdf/test/
- but discussion of this on #rdfig got me thinking about what it means
to be a literal again. (DanC: third options smells bad. Not sure why).

In an attempt to make everything smell of roses, I'm going to try to
produce some words about literals by the end of the day, with a view to
comparing the points of view on Friday.

Leverage that synergy! Ooh yeah, looking good! Now stretch - and relax.
