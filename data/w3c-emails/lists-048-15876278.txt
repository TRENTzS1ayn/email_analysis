I attach the new test case.
I still haven't worked out how to update the W3C site.

The text of the comment is:
===

  This example is not legal XML, and hence should be rejected
  by RDF/XML processors.
 
  The XML error is in the rdf:about attribute, where the ampersand
  does not introduce a reference.
  
  Sample error message:
     The reference to entity "def" must end with the ';' delimiter.

  The intended XML document is probably that in
