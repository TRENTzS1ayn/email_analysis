I'm agnostic on the specifics of the kick-off example to use.  As long as 
it addresses the criteria of (a) being something people can relate to (e.g. 
solves a problem a lot of people have), (b) easy to understand, (c) 
demonstrates the benefits of RDF, I'm interested.

I'd be interested in hearing your description of the application.  If it 
meets the above criteria and just so happens to be supported industrial 
grade tools, thats even better!
