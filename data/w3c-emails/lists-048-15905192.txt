I'm happy with the general intent.

Some nit-picking:

"...the properties involved in the cycle have the same members"
Should this be:
"... the [relational] extensions of properties involved in the cycle have 
the same members"
?

"A more formal specification of the meaning is given in the model theory"
I don't recall this point being explicitly addressed by the MT;  would it 
be more accurate to say "... given by the model theory"?
