Pat--

I'd like you to resist (if possible) the feeling that some of these
issues people are raising (like the one about literals) are issues with
the *model theory* per se, rather than issues with *RDF* that the WG has
to wrestle with, and figure out where we stand on them.  That's not to
say the model theory won't help;  but if the WG is agnostic on some
issue, it's not really a problem with the *model theory* if the model
theory accurately reflects that.  

To raise a similar issue, it's going to be difficult writing a very
convincing Primer section about reification, given our current
understanding (to use the term loosely!) of reification (at least in my
opinion).  If the resulting section isn't very convincing, it won't be
an issue with the *Primer*.  GIGO, as we used to say :-)
