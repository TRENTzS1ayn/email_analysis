I agree:  this is nit-picking :-)

Your rewording is technically more correct;  it's just that we didn't
refer to the relational extension when we worded the corresponding
motion about class cycles (i.e., we didn't say "the relational
extensions of the classes").

Fine with me.  Once again, the model theory doesn't talk explicitly
about class cycles either, if I remember correctly.  What it does do it
define what classes and properties (or rather, their extensions!) are
made up of.
Inferring what a cycle means is left as an exercise for the reader.
