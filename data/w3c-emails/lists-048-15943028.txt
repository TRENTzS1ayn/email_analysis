That seems unwise.

These proposals are sufficiently long and complex that I'm
pretty sure it would be more straightforward to code
first and describe the code after the fact.

To be a bit more blunt: for this issue,
I'm really not interested in reviewing any
proposal that isn't backed by running code.

If the WG wants to decide something before coding,
I'll just abstain.

For this issue, without some code, I don't see the value in any
agreement.
