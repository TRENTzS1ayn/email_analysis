Hi Graham, thanks for the feedback. I concur on all points. A quick 
remark on rdf:Instance; while one could introduce it, there would of 
course be no way to make sure that it was the inverse of rdf:type on 
literals.... Also, I think its not quite right to say that 
rdfs:Literal has *no* role, since we can legally assert that some URI 
has a literal value, and that might, I guess, be a useful piece of 
information. But its a pretty small role, for sure.

Pat
