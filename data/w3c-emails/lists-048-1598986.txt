Thanks, but I still don't know what you are talking about. What does 
it mean to say that a value is 'invalid'? The way I see RDF is that 
triples make assertions. More triples make more assertions, which 
restrict the set of satisfying interpretations. There is no notion of 
some part of a triple being 'invalid': if you can write it down, then 
it ought to mean something. (If some construction is meaningless then 
we should rule it out as syntactically illegal; but there is a strong 
RDF cultural bias against this kind of restriction, for 
methodological reasons having to do with the 'open-ness' of the 
semantic web. )

Well, it can be unknown: that is harmless. I agree that we need some 
security against *incorrect* interpretations being used on literals, 
so they are interpreted in ways that are not the way intended.
