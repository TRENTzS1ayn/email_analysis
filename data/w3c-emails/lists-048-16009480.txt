Well, I sort-of assumed this was where we were trying to go.  The charter 
restriction on not extending RDF in this round emphatically does not mean 
(IMO) that the underlying abstraction must be hobbled by the limitations of 
the current syntax.

I see two ways to instantiate this vision:  (a) make the abstract 
graph/model theory agnostic w.r.t. possible future extensions, or (b) pick 
a general, consistent framework that ignores the arbitrary 
restrictions.  If the latter is easier, and if it doesn't force us to make 
some premature decisions, I'm all for it.

I very much agree.  (Though I'm mildly surprised to hear you say this.)

Ah... that's why you had LE : E -> URI designated as "partial", n'est pas?

If (a) it's simpler to express than being merely agnostic about certain 
points, and
(b) doesn't force us into making premature decisions that out successors 
may later regret, then I'd support such an approach.  An issue may be 
whether or not we can be sufficiently confident about (b).
