Yes, I understand and agree. After further thought I think the MT can 
stay agnostic about this particular issue without any real harm, but 
I will add some explanatory text (with small examples) to the 
document to help readers avoid the reefs.

Quite. Though GIGO sounds quite different when one is on the inside, right?
