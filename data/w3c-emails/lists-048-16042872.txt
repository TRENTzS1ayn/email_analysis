Although I'm not Danbri, I did make some testcases at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/
but the feedback somewhere went into the
"RDFS entailment test" direction (which is nice BTW).

If people can live with test001 and test002 as at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test001.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test001.nt
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test002.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test002.nt
we could proceed now (and extend as we go).
