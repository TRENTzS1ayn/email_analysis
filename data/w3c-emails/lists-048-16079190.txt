[that ``image'' reminded me about a real simple example]

<h1>A simple example</h1>
the web is about "saying anything about anything"
<ul>
  <li>suppose that picture i was taken at position p and time t</li>
  <li>suppose that event e took place at location l and date d</li>
  <li>what kind of inferences can we draw from those facts?</li>
</ul>
