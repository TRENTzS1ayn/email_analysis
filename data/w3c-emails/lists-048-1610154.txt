No, I'm not. It has been pointed out many times on this list that use of
rdf:value often leads to big trouble when some resources suddenly turn
out to denote the same thing. (Brian gave an example of such clash some
time ago.) Therefore, I avoid rdf:value completely until we dashed out
the basics of datatyping.
