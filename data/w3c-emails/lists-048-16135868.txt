Dan,

This is all great stuff, and I'm grateful.  The issues list
is not as uptodate as I'd like and needs some attention.

And if I may humbly add, follow Dan's example and create
a new thread (i.e. don't reply)

Good point.  DaveB has been suggesting we assign issues to the
docs too.  What I had in mind to do was to ask the editors to
say which ones they felt would be covered by their docs and then
see what overlap/underlap their might be.  Looks like you've given
us a start.

However, I do think we have a process issue to resolve which you
brought up earlier around what docs we are aiming to have.

Err, that might be why its under currently open issues.

No.

That's a good idea.  With the decision to fold Martyn's work into
the primer that seems a reasonable thing to do.  Martyn - you ok with
that?

I hope you are right that we can close this one.  I felt we needed to
await Sergey's return before putting it on the agenda.

I'm a wee bit nervous making sure we are procedurally correct in closing
such an issue which has been so controversial and this was not on the
agenda for this week.  Can I suggest we action Graham, the issue owner,
to propose formal resolution at the next telecon.  And when its passed
we all heave a collective sigh of relief :)

No - but we've made enormous progress :)

I guess I put it there, probably because it was clearly active and
no-one volunteered to own it.  Pat - can we put your name against it?

On a quick look neither can I.  My fault.  I will find
the decision or restore it for consideration.  Can you tell from
the CVS diffs when it got moved to postponed - that will help
narrow the search.  Shame I can't put log entries in through
jigedit.  Maybe I should follow Dave's example and include a formal
record of changes in the text - it just would be nice to have
machine support.

My bad again :(  I was trying to push this forward myself hoping
someone would take pity on me pick it up.  In effect I think Jeremy
and Bill have with their work on literals.  Jeremy/Bill - I merge this
issue with rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure?

Jeremy is the owner.  He and Bill dehOra have, in my view been doing
a great job moving this forward.

Yup - we have a whole host of closures/updates from the f2f on
schema which are not reflected in the issues list.  I was maybe
hoping Danbri would do these - but as he's real busy - I'll do it.

Yup - hopefully do subPropertyOf today and I can close that one off.

I'm putting issue list management into Jema - but if someone could give me
a scraped version of the current issues list that would be wonderful.
