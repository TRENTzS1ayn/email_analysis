WRT 2001-09-28#10: artb talk to em and danc to investigate editors 
 draft and updating documents process

The bottom line is that it up to the editor(s) to decide how
to handle new WDs in progress.  That is an editor may choose
to edit a document at their site, at the W3C site or to use
email to provide new versions to the WG.  It also is at the 
discression of the editor(s) as to whether or not changes
should be done with change bars and/or a Change Log section.

Dave and I have agreed to edit the TC WD in the same location 
it had before it was published:

 [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/

Note [1] contains a version tag below the This Version URI.
The version tag may be useful as we discuss this document
but it will be removed before the next publication.  

I added a new section Change Log to [1]:
