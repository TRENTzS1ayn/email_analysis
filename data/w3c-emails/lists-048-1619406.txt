Yes, that would be one way.  Another is that the knowledge is embedded in 
applications that process statements containing <ex:prop>.

I think I must be misunderstanding something here in what you are 
saying.  Previously, you responded to me:

My intent was that this was pretty much the same as I was trying to 
describe with my
   <ex:subj> <ex:prop> "10" .
example above, but more explicit about how the typing information was supplied.

Well, maybe... depends how the above issue works out.
