I think it's fine to educate people that it's not a good idea, but with the 
current understanding and use of RDF I think we should allow it to be 
legitimate RDF which *can* be interpreted as the designers intended.

I think it's a fair trade-off that a fully-generic RDF processor 
(reasoner?) cannot access the intended meaning without supplying some 
additional information, which may be awkward to do.

So the statememt:

    <http://www.ninebynine.org/> dc:creator "Graham Klyne" .

should be allowed to be consistent with:

    <http://www.ninebynine.org/> dc:creator
        [ a foaf:Person ; foaf:name "Graham Klyne" ] .

even if it doesn't, of itself, convey the same information.
