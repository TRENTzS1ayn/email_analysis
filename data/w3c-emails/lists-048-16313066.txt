I've put DanC's rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf testcase at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/
and FrankM's rdfs-no-cycles-in-subPropertyOf at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-no-cycles-in-subPropertyOf/
I changed some URI's in them and I think they are OK.

BTW, Brian, a possible agenda point for next meeting is also
