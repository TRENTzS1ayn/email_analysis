I don't think IEXT("foo") is meaningful.  If you meant IEXT(I("foo")) then 
I'd observe that there is no prohibition on I("foo") being the same as 
I(my:property).

I think that (part of) the technical difficulty to which Pat alludes is 
syntactic/representational in nature, because it would require label 
scoping to be introduced into the abstract graph syntax.
