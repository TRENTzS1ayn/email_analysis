Yes it does, and I support the test case. Sorry about my earlier hiccup.

Can I suggest a minor change that in test0001.nt one of the domains and one of the ranges should be assigned to the subproperty not the superproperty. One could even add a third domain and range for the subproperty.

That's just to completely rule out any sort of non-monotonic defeasible reasoning.
