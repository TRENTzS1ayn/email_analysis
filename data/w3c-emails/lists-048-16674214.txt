Fair enough, though I do think that dark triples is what might be 
called a general-purpose fudge for layering anything on top of RDF. I 
would myself vastly prefer to redefine RDF altogether to give it the 
ability to describe arbitrary recursive syntax trees, but I felt that 
at this stage in the RDF WG's activities it was wisest to keep the 
changes to the absolute minimum required. Notice that the dark 
triples proposal is not incompatible with any more elaborate 
proposals that might be made later.

?? Nobody is proposing that, I think. If we can come up with some 
syntactic way to indicate darkness of triples, then that is all that 
RDF needs to do. Then OWL can use its own syntactic conventions to 
distinguish those triples which encode its own constructs, and mark 
them as dark. That is all that is required to prevent the kind of 
layering problems that Peter is so concerned about.

I agree that would be regrettable, but that isnt part of the proposal.
