I don't think that works.  Consider a bag {* "aaa" "bbb" "bbb" *}

The 3^2=9 edges would be:

    aaa rdf:_1 "aaa" .
    aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_2 "aaa" .
    aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_3 "aaa" .
    aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .

But, on removing duplicates, which the MT tells us are redundant:

    aaa rdf:_1 "aaa" .
    aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_2 "aaa" .
    aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .
    aaa rdf:_3 "aaa" .
    aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .

Now does that bag contain 2 "aaa"s and 1 "bbb", or 1 "aaa" and 2 "bbb"s, or 
something else?
