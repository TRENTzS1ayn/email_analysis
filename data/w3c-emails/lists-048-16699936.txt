I honestly do not see this interpretation justified by anything in 
the wording of the M&S. Anonymous nodes seem to play a central role 
in the document. They occur in many of the examples given, and are 
central to the accounts of containers and reification. And if there 
is anything that is surely clear about them, it is that they do not 
have labels; they really are *blank*.

I agree, but I think that *your* interpretation of the M&S is quite 
idiosyncratic and unusual; I have never heard it before in any of the 
ongoing discussions, in any case. I don't think that allowing blank 
nodes in the RDF syntax can possibly, under even the wildest 
interpretation, be called 'redefining' RDF or 'introducing' anything 
to it. (I do not know what you mean by 'first-class', so I cannot 
speak to the implied criticism that we have been guilty of class 
elevation.)

I presume that the intent of the WG is that once completed and in its 
final form, the MT will be considered definitive, not merely an 
option. It is the clearest statement of the meaning of RDF(S).

Technically you are right, there are no variables in RDF. The blank 
nodes in an RDF graph are not variables, and one of the great 
features of the graph syntax is that it provides the expressive power 
of a quantifier without actually having a quantifier in the syntax. 
As the MT document is careful to emphasize, the node IDs used in 
N-triples are not themselves part of the RDF graph syntax.

I don't agree that the interpretation of blank nodes is 'trying to do 
logic'. It is merely a clarification of the most natural 
interpretation of the apparent intent of the RDF M&S. And to 
emphasize, we have not 'put' variables into RDF; we have not altered 
RDF syntax at all, in fact. We have simply given a mathematical - ie, 
precise - account of the meanings of the syntactic constructs that 
are already in the language.

Quite.

I am not sure what you mean by 'doing the RDF Logic'. Giving a 
precise semantics to an assertional language can always be described 
as 'doing a logic' in some sense. We have been at pains to avoid 
extending the expressive power of RDF in any significant way, even 
when it was excruciatingly obvious that it badly needs to be 
extended. The section on entailment in the MT document was put there 
largely for pedagogic reasons, to explain how the semantic notions 
'cash out' as relationships which can be used to justify inferences 
of various kinds. In the next draft I will insert more cautionary 
wording to try to emphasize that this is not intended to be a 
description of a logic in any functional sense.

Im not sure  what you mean by 'the normative RDF logic'. Any 
semantics for an assertional language will define a notion of 
entailment and hence a 'logic' in some sense. The MT does not define 
any inference rules or proof theory for RDF, but it does of course 
define a notion of semantic entailment. It could hardly fail to, by 
its very nature. If this much clarity offends you, Im not quite sure 
what you expected the WG to produce by way of clarification of the 
'model'.

Sorry, that is a misapprehension. See above. And in any case, it does 
not address the question.

But an analysis of the query language will presumably make some 
reference to the meaning of the language being queried, and the 
relationship between the assertions used to answer the query and the 
answer itself. While I agree that the actual design of a query 
language is clearly out of scope for the WG, to look ahead a little 
to forsee the likely needs is not out of scope.

That depends entirely on what you want the software to be able to do. 
In any case, you are free to write code which treats blank nodes as 
having labels. It will draw correct conclusions, but not so many of 
them.

I fail to see how an language with a precise semantics can fail to 
have *some* entailment conditions. Whether you classify this as 
'logic' is irrelevant, because meaningless.

This is a pointless distinction. If you have locally scoped names 
which can be substituted without changes of meaning in the enclosing 
expressions, then you have already introduced existentials and 
variables. Whether you call them by those names, or what notation you 
use, are superficial matters of nomenclature.

Well, we could, and indeed did, consider dropping blank nodes 
altogether. But that would have been a major change to the language, 
and so seemed (and still seems to me) to be outside our charter.

You keep saying that, but I don't see any evidence for that 
interpretation in the M&S itself or in what the original authors have 
told us about their intentions.

All we have done is to recognize that the blank nodes, as you say, 
have "first-class status". Seems to me that is about all that they 
can have: Im not sure what other kind of status you have in mind. We 
have not gone 'beyond' this is any way. We have not introduced 
variables or quantifiers into RDF, and have not extended the syntax 
of RDF.  So I don't quite see what it is that you are getting so 
worked up about.
