Then maybe they should be using DAML ? Look, RDF is a simple 
language. Various people will definitely want more than RDF can 
provide. We cannot insert new features just because they are needed: 
then we really would be doing Web Logic, as Massimo has accused us of 
doing.

We could add this, but its not clear what it would do to the 
semantics. I have an uneasy feeling that it might be quite 
complicated. This is a limited kind of a restriction-on-property (the 
container is restricted to things that have the appropriate range 
property) and that seems to rather go beyond RDFS.
