Yes, it can be read that way. I think we need to re-do this picture.

Right.

So, when datatyped, John and Judy have age 25, but Jane has age "25", right?

Right.

><Jane> <ex:age> _:c .
><John> <ex:age> _:c .

True, since we don't know what those values are without the datatyping.

>In the datatyping interpretation (following the picture 6.1.3) this entails:
>
><Jane> <ex:age> _:c .
><John> <ex:age> _:c .

No, not Jane and John. If you had said John and Judy, yes. But Jane's 
age is a string, and John's is a number (when datatyped). I think 
this picture might be misleading.

>but not
>
><Jane> <ex:age> _:a .
><foo> <bar> _:a .

No, it does entail that. Why not? Even when datatyped, those values 
are both the string "25", so the common generalization still holds. 
Adding datatyping only checks that strings are in the proper lexical 
space, and maybe imposes an interpretation on a bnode linked by a 
rdfd:lex to a literal. It doesn't change the interpretation of the 
literal.
