Issue: M&S Spec says that "The Description element itself
   represents an instance of a Bag resource...". Does this mean that a
   parser MUST create a Bag of reified statements for every
   Description Element?

   Proposal:
   The WG resolves that a parser is not required to emit statements
   representing a bag of reified statements for each Description
   element.  A parser SHOULD emit statements describing a bag of reifed
   statements when an rdf:bagID is present in the description element.

(Thanks to DaveB for the proposal - I've wordsmithed it slightly)

Anyone care to do some test cases please.

Brian
