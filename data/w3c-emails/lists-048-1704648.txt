http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf

Issue: RDF has an "open grammar, which is harder to validate simply
   (and nigh on impossible to do properly with DTDs). - Syntax
   validation within the context of RDF embedded in other XML grammars
   would be easier if the RDF syntax were only of the 'Fixed-Schema'
   variety, see
   [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Apr/0346.html
]. Currently, the propertyElt construct, and abbreviated forms of
   RDF are of the 'Schema-follows-data' variety.

   Proposal:

   The WG resolves to postpone this issue for later consideration on
   the grounds that it is out of scope of its current charter to
   change the current RDF/XML syntax to the extent necessary to address
   this issue.   The WG notes however that validation may be helped with
   various submitted (non-normative) XML schemas for RDF/XML pointed to at
   present in the editors draft at
   http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Schemas

(Thanks to DaveB for the proposal - wordsmithed a bit by Brian)
