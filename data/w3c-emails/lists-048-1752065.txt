Actually what is broken, I now think, is that there are several ideas 
in the M&S and they are all blurred together. Each taken alone is 
quite clear, but they are different.

I plan to. I'm drowning in datatypes at present.

(bozon ? Isn't that element number 145, the first nonmetal after the 
Paranoids sequence?)

We need to be clear about the distinction, indeed. Or at least clear 
about the fact that we are refusing to acknowledge it, and have a 
built-in simplified world model. I think either stance is viable, in 
fact. We probably have to simplify this stuff somehow, this is a 
minefield.
