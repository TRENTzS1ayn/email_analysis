OK, let me try to offer an example.

aaa eg:prop "10" .

That's all. That is legal in P, but it is ambiguous until more 
information is given enabling the literal node to be assigned a 
datatype. (Eg by specifying the range of eg:prop to be a datatype 
class.)

This is syntactically illegal in X, since one would have to use a URV 
rather than the bare literal.

I am not sure what the S form would be; as far as I can see, there 
would be no way to say this in S, since the only place for the 
literal to go would be at the sharp end of an edge labelled with a 
datatype, which by hypothesis we don't have at this time. (Sergey, 
can you comment?)

So it seems to me that both X and S, in different ways, simply refuse 
to countenance the possibility of expressing such an 'ambiguous' 
literal.

This could be done in the DC version as follows:

aaa eg:prop _:1 .
_:1 rdf:label "10" .

where there is no rdf:type coming from the bNode.
