I vaguely remember that debate.  I'm not sure that those of us involved 
really had a clear idea what was meant - speaking for myself, I 
didn't.  Looking back in hindsight, I think we were crudely trying to 
distinguish between a "statement" as a linguistic/syntactic entity (a 
"token"), and a "stating" being its interpretation (or its denotation under 
some interpretation?).
