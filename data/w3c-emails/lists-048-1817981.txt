Folks,

Just so folks are clear about what proposals S, P and X refer to:

The naming was first suggested by Jeremy in

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0131.html

I added X.

Proposal P is the Hayes/Patel-Schneider proposal, loosely characterized as:

   a "literal" node in a graph is labelled by a literal string, e.g. "10"
   such a node may be the subject of an rdf:type property with value, e.g.
     xsd:decimal to define its type.  Such labelling may be implied by an
     a range constraint in an rdf schema.

Proposal S was proposed by Sergey in

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0530.html

It can be loosely characterized as:

   typed values, such as the integer 10, are represented in the graph by a bNode.
   The bNode will have one or more  properties defining lexical representations
   of the integer, e.g.

     _:int <xsd:decimal> "10" .

Proposal X is the X-values idea from Patrick referred to in:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0039.html

which be loosely characterized as

   define a URI scheme for typed values e.g. dt:xsd:decimal:10.
