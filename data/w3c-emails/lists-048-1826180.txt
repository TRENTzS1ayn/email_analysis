(a) I agree people write stuff this way, and (b) I agree
it's just plain wrong, so (c) I think it's critical that
this issue (things versus their names, numbers vs. numerals...)
is treated by the primer.

Case in point: folks write
<dc:creator>Dan Connolly</dc:creator>
as if a character sequence "D" "a" "n" ... wrote a book.
It's critical that we teach folks to write
<dc:creator>
  <Person>
    <fullName>Dan Connolly</fullName>
          </Person>
        </dc:creator>

Why is it critical? Yes, it doesn't help that dc:creator doesn't have
its meaning written down formally. But if we interpret: 

<dc:creator>Dan Connolly</dc:creator> 

as if a character sequence created a page, then we interpret:

<dc:creator>
  <Person>
    <fullName>Dan Connolly</fullName>
          </Person>
        </dc:creator>

as if well formed XML element content created a page; in fact in the
RDF-XML context:

Dan Connolly

is XML also. If we're going to beg a nonsense interpretation of
dc:creator's definition, let's at least do it consistently. Adding a few
tags does nowt critical that I can see.
