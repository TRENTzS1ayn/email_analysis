12: Brief update on Primer status


13: Status status of 2001-10-19#2 JanG  produce proposal on Entailment tests and test Manifest for 26/10/2001 


14: Datatyping status and plans
In particular the chair would like a schedule for producing the proposed
document and to ask what resources (e.g. telecon facilities) this team
requires.


15: Issue rdfs-constraint-properties-resources
Propose that the WG resolve:

The current mechanism, rdfs:ConstraintResource and 
rdfs:ConstraintProperty, fails to serve its original purpose and should be
removed from the RDF Schema 1.0 specification. The accompanying text be
amended accordingly.

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-constraint-properties-resources
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0575.html


16: Issue rdfms-resource-semantics
Propose the WG close rdfms-resource-semantics on the grounds that the model
theory says all that RDF is going to say about the nature of resources.
Further specification of the nature of resources is the work of other WG's.

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-resource-semantics


17: Issue rdf-equivalent-uris
Whilst the WG recognises the importance of a mechanism for defining
equivalence of URI's, the WG has decided it does not fit within the
limited scope of its current charter.  The WG notes that DAML+OIL
has an equivalence mechanism which raises the question of which layer
of the stack best suits such functionality.  The WG also notes that
by allowing cycles in rdfs:subPropertyOf and rdfs:subClassOf RDF
Schema provides a related mechanism for properties and classes.

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-equivalent-uris


18: Issue rdf-containers-otherapproaches
Propose the WG postpone rdf-containers-otherapproaches on the grounds
that it is out of scope of the WG's current charter.

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-otherapproaches


19: Issue rdfms-logical-formalism
Propose the WG close rdfms-logical-formalism on the grounds
that the model theory adequately addresses this issue.

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-logical-formalism


20: Issue rdfms-logical-terminololgy
Propose the WG close rdfms-logical-terminololgy on the grounds
that the new terminology introduced by the model theory adequately
addresses this issue. 

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-logical-terminology


21: Issue rdfms-reification-required
Propose 
  The WG resolves that a parser is not required to always emit statements
  representing a bag of reified statements for each Description
  element.  A parser SHOULD emit statements describing a bag of reifed
  statements when an rdf:bagID is present in the description element. It
   SHOULD be possible to instruct a parser to emit bags of
   reified statements for all description elements.

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-reification-required


22: Issue rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf
Propose

  The WG resolves to postpone rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf for later
  consideration on the grounds that it is out of scope of its current
  charter to change the current RDF/XML syntax to the extent necessary
  to address it.   The WG notes however that validation may be helped with
  various submitted (non-normative) XML schemas for RDF/XML pointed to at
  present in the editors draft at
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Schemas

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf
