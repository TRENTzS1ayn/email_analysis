I think this issue:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-rdf-names-use

  Summary: Clarify the legality of the use of names from the RDF
  namespace, e.g. can rdf:Bag be used as a property or can
  rdf:Description be used as a property attribute etc.

is close enough that the resolution will address the ACTION.
I'm not writing the resolution now but I'm going to go for listing
the entire list of the terms in the rdf/rdfs namespace(s) and
defining their legal use in the XML syntax.

So I'd consider the above ACTION complete.

Dave
