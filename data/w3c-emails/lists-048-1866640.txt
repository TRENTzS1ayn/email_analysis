No.  This is requiring a processor has an option in handling RDF/XML,
and I don't want to start doing that without a good reason (this is
the first time optional RDF/XML processing has come up).

  Proposal:
     The WG resolves that a parser MUST emit statements describing a
     bag of reifed statements when an rdf:bagID attribute is present
     on the rdf:Description (or typed node) element.  It MUST NOT
     emit bags of reified statements for rdf:Description (or typed
     node) elements without rdf:bagID attributes.

I don't think we can decide this tomorrow since there are no test
cases.  However, the current draft description for this bit of syntax
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#nodeElement
describes the triple-production in the above way.
