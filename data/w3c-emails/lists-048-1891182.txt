We certainly don't want to preclude it; the DAML+OIL stuff wouldn't
layer on top, otherwise, would it?

No; you can't conclude from no information that there are no others.

And I do think that each of the _:n properties is functional;
i.e.
_:x rdf:_1 "abc".
_:x rdf:_1 "def".
is a contradiction (is that in the model theory? subject/predicate/object
are also functional).

So the best I can think of is that if we have

  _:b rdf:type rdf:Bag.

then there's some _:bc where

  _:b rdfs:bagContents _:bc.


and where any X with

  _:b rdf:_NNN X.

we have

  X rdf:type _:bc.

(hmm... that might end up with a literal subject. That
doesn't bother me, but if it bothers other folks,
I suppose some analog of ICEXT, say IBAG is in order.
Ug... this the second really serious design bug
I've seen with RDF containers).

I'm not sure what a bag-closure is, but if it's the same issue as


   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-seq-representation

then I don't agree not to talk about it ;-)
