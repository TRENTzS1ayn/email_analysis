 From my experience, there lies madness. I wonder if I can
convince folks who haven't walked in my shoes for the last
few years...


In this case, there's just one author of that web site;
let's presume we've communicated that formally...
then we have something that's both
an rdfs:Literal and a foaf:Person. I would
think those classes are disjoint.

Then there's the "turtles all the way down" problem...
if literals work that way in the case of dc:creator,
do they also work that way in the case of foaf:name?
i.e. is

   [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name "Graham Klyne" ]
consistent with
   [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name [ rdfs:value "Graham Klyne" ] ]
or something? can I do it again with rdfs:value? when
do we get to the bottom?
