Indeed, that triple doesn't conform to my proposed idiom, but
that's because the RDF from which it's transcribed doesn't conform.
I don't want folks to write that sort of RDF. I'm not
trying to have my cake and eat it too. I want folks to write

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#me">
   <ex:shoeSize dt:decimal="10">
</rdf:Description>

or

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#me">
   <ex:shoeSizeNumeral>10</ex:shoeSizeNumeral>
</rdf:Description>

Sorta.

 Can we infer one from the other? Both ways?


no.

We don't.
