Your size 10 shoes?  Or should that be size "10" shoes?  ;-)

I don't see that has to be.  Under a suitable datatyping scheme, is it not 
possible for I("Graham Klyne") and I(_:someResource) to be the same thing?

I don't see that arises in this case.  Or maybe it can arise, but doesn't 
add any new information, hence is pointless.

(Though I do see this is a problem with the general idea of saying:
   _:a ex:prop "abc" .
SHOULD be treated as:
   _:a ex:prop [ rdf:value "abc" ] .
)

In the foaf: case, foaf:name could be understood (through appropriate 
schema, or other means) to have a range which is just a literal string, and 
in such a case an identity datatype mapping would provide all needed 
information.  In effect, the regress can "bottom out" by application of:

   I("Graham Klyne") = "Graham Klyne"

And here, I think, is my point.  If some statement like:

   <http://www.ninebynine.org/> dc:creator "Graham Klyne" .

provides all the information that an application desires (presuming some 
suitable interpretation of this which is compatible with a more complete 
description of the creator), then why require more?  An application, for 
example, whose sole function is to answer questions like:  "who created 
?page" with a string that can denote the creator.

Here's my parting shot, for now.  When I said:
[[[
So the statememt:
    <http://www.ninebynine.org/> dc:creator "Graham Klyne" .
should be allowed to be consistent with:
    <http://www.ninebynine.org/> dc:creator
        [ a foaf:Person ; foaf:name "Graham Klyne" ] .
]]]
Note that I said "allowed", not "required".  It would be something 
specifically licensed in the case of dc:creator and foaf:name (by means not 
yet defined, but I imagine some form of application-domain-specific closure 
rules).  Such licence would, in my view, provide the migration path from 
"naive" RDF descriptions to the "rich" RDF descriptions you advocate.
