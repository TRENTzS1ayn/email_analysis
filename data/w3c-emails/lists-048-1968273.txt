?What is the difference? If you can infer that the literal conforms 
to the constraint, then you can apply the constraint, and vice versa. 
The only question to be asked is: is there enough information 
available to correctly interpret the literal?

Why?

Am I the only person who has no idea what this 
normative/descriptive/prescriptive contrast means? As far as I am 
aware, RDF is *entirely* descriptive.

If this contrast is meaningful, we need to incorporate it into the MT 
somehow, so I wish someone would explain to me (as to a child) what 
it is supposed to mean.
