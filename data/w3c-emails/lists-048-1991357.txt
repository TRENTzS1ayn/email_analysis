True, but this seems to be a general problem with any datatyping 
scheme, even the URV idea. If I use a URV with a 'unioned' type name, 
something has to be able to fit the right part of the datatype 
mapping with the particular lexical form it finds itself combined 
with. God help us if we allow a union of decimal and octal.
