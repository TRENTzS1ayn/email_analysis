But like I said in an earlier thread, that seems *obviously wrong*. 
And as you said, it *is* obviously wrong, but all these silly people 
insist on writing these obviously wrong things. Doesn't that suggest 
that they are not writing obviously wrong things, in fact, but rather 
interpreting those double quotes differently?

I just meant to avoid the implication that they were to be 
interpreted as strings, since that interpretation begs the question. 
If we can agree that XML syntax in general should not be interpreted 
using logical canons of notational rigor, then we can leave the quote 
marks there and not call them quotes.

OK, OK, put the quote marks back in; but don't insist on thinking of 
them as quotes.

Ah. So this would be OK, would it?

aa eg:prop _:x .
_:x xsd:integer "10"
_:x xsd:integer "0010"

That does make sense, I agree.
