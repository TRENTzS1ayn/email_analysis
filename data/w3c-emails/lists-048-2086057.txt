I've tried to address most of the comments I've received (in some cases 
I addressed them by ignoring them, but I hope I did it deliberately!) 
There are some inline editorial comments, notes, and other stuff to be 
fixed.  Sorry I didn't get this out sooner (and more completely);  I'm 
still recovering from whatever bug hit me last week (if you hear snoring 
tomorrow morning on the telecon, it'll probably be me).
