I agree with much of what you say ... Pat did a great summary.

I also like your diagram ... I've printed it off and stuck it above my monitor

My biggest concern is for compatibility with existing use:  as far as I can 
tell, P/P++ are the only approaches that support my perception of existing 
use (and also a form of use that I believe will be helpful in getting XML 
folks to migrate their designs to RDF compatible forms).  Pat said that he 
thought Patrick's approach could support existing use, but I'm not sure how 
that works.

I think we'll see a lot of RDF usage like this:

   _:Robby child:age    "12" .
   _:Robby child:weight "14" .
   _:Jenny child:age    "12" .
   _:Jenny child:weight "12" .

i.e. things like number radix and units will implicit in the vocabulary 
(properties) used.

I can also see that one could have a preferred universal form of measuring 
these things, which is equivalent and can be inferred given sufficient 
knowledge; e.g.

   _:Robby SI:age    [ a SI:Duration ; rdf:value "32140800" ] ;
           SI:weight [ a SI:Mass ; rdf:value "14" ] .

   _:Jenny SI:age    [ a SI:Duration ; rdf:value "32140800" ] ;
           SI:weight [ a SI:Mass ; rdf:value "12" ] .
