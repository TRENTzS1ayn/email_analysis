Regardless of the situation with respect to incompatibility with RDF, I
view incompatibility with XML as a fatal problem with both these proposals.
I think that a scheme that is not compatible with

        [possibly some some xml schema stuff that may or may not type the 7 below]
<foo [possibly some xml schema stuff that may or may not type the 7 below]>
  <bar [possibly some some xml schema stuff that may or may not
type the 7 below]>
7
  </bar>
        </foo>

is a non-starter.
