Until we reach a point where XML schema (or its successor) handling and
RDF parsing is just a piece of pluggable technology that you download
off the shelf, I'd have to agree.

PS. XML-schema compatability seems to be more of an "improved RDF

imho, far more important and something that we can address now.
