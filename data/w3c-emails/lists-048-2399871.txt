In fact, my point was just to "label" the entities like m1 or d1 in the
domain of discourse so that we can refer to them unambigously. The
syntactic encoding above that you derived is very much in the spirit of
the S proposal, but something like (_Jenny weightKgOctal "14") would
work as well (in P++) as long as the token "14" in the triples
represents the entity m1 in the figure. My hope is that different
proposals and encodings can be discussed more effectively if we have a
shared sample interpretation.
