This is a very valid concern, I agree.

I believe the above representation could also be utilized in the S
proposal (I think Pat and I are still dashing out this topic on another
thread). In S, the literals "12" and "14" above would represent literal
values, not masses in durations, and child:age would connect directly t2
and s2 in the diagram. However, an application could have a built-in
understanding that

_:Robby child:age "12"

somehow implies

_:Robby IS:age        X
X       IS:inMonth    Y
Y       IS:inDecimal "12"

Given this implicit knowledge, the only valid interpretation for the
IS:age of Robby would be determined uniquely as d1, i.e. "one year". Of
course, in this case the range of child:age would be rdfs:Literal and
not IS:Durations. In other words, if CC/PP uses S, either instances
could be kept "as is", or schema, but not both.

This would also work. However, great care is advised to ensure that
exactly one rdf:value can be attached to a given entity in the
interpretation. Otherwise, conflicts like the one illustrated in
http://WWW-DB.Stanford.EDU/~melnik/rdf/datatyping/fig/units1.gif may
arise.
