Am I the only one who has ever read the RDF Schema spec?!

Have a glance at section 3, titled, ahem "Constraints"... of which
rdfs:range is one.

In the world of data interchange, constraints are what keep systems
reliable. Constraints which ensure that "foo" is not interpreted
as an integer or someone doesn't have seven Fathers.

XML Schema is all about constraints. This very goal of defining an
RDF interpretation of data types for literals is about constraints.

The whole *point* of being able to say that some literal "1010" is
an xsd:integer rather than a foo:binary is so that we can enforce
those constraints on data prior to interpretation so that our systems
don't go BOOOM!

Sorry, but I really *must* be on some other planet if none of the
rest of you are thinking about constraints.

Patrick
