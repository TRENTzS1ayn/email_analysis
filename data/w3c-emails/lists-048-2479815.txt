I'm concerned with terms such as "incorporates" such that we
would be defining an explicit, official data type scheme for RDF
which all data type schemes are mapped to.

I would be very wary of any solution which did not work equally
well for non-XML Schema data type schemes as it does for XML
Schema data type schemes. Surely we want to keep a light coupling
(if any at all) between RDF and XML Schema.

It's one thing to support XML Schema data types. It's another
to require them.

Eh? Or am I reading too much into such statements...?
