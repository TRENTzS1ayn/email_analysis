Please, NO!

It's one thing for RDF based *applications* to support and
utilized XML Schema simple data types and their lexical and
value spaces, but IMO RDF should itself be completely neutral
to any particular data type scheme.

What we need is to ensure that all data type information for
typed literals is defined in a consistent and explicit fashion
and that such information remains persistent and valid until
passed to an application outside of the RDF scope.
