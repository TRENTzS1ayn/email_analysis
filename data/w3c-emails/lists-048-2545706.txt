Now I'm confused. If you read and agreed with our WG's charter before
joining RDF Core, this should come as no suprise.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

[[
    RDF Schema must be expressed in terms of the RDF model, and
    must use W3C RDF syntax. RDF Schema must use and build upon XML
    Schema datatypes to the fullest extent that is practical and
    appropriate. Specifically, the RDF Core Working Group is not
    chartered to develop a separate data typing language that
    duplicates facilities provided by XML Schema data types.

We have a layered design. At some point we'll call out a set of datatypes;
these will be based on the XML Schema work. It may be that the design we
adopt will allow others to plug in something similar. That would probably
be wise, since the XML Schema datatypes themselves may evolve too.
