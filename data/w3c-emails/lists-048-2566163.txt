My sincerest apologies for not providing the summary of this
proposal sooner. Hopefully now things will be a bit clearer.

To clarify, URVs are useful constructs in terms of the X proposal,
but not manditory. The heart of the X proposal is a statement-centric
rather than resource-centric graph model and interpretation.

You can use the X proposal approach and never use URVs.

Please have a look at the summary I just posted.
