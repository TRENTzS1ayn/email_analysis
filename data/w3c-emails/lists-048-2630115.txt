Actually, no. I think the recent "clarification" doesn't
clarify much, and in fact I prefer your present treatment. 

I just thought you might toss in a few tag URIs or similar
to show a little more heterogeny.

Trust me, I understand ;-)

Well, not to be too pedantic about it, but, if this is going to
be an official WG publication (as opposed to a non-W3C publication)
then I think that all examples should be in RDF/XML and NTriples
shouldn't be used at all.

If you want to reflect graph structure, you should draw the graph.

Well, I don't think its as simple as that. The nodeIDs in 
NTriples do not have representation in the graph itself. The
rdf:ID's or rdf:about's that must be used in RDF/XML to 
accomplish the same thing *do* end up with representation
in the graph.

Thus, in the strict sense, nodeIDs have no real representation
in RDF/XML.
