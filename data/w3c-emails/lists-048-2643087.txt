I'll see what it might look like.

Actually, Ntriples is a simplification of N3, which was introduced as
making it easier to *write* graphs, and it is.  I'd prefer to see
Ntriples made more official, if that's necessary.

I'm not sure I understand what your concern is (and there are a couple
of things going on here), so perhaps we could consider an example.  Take
Figure 14 in the M&S.  There's a blank node that represents the value of
the "subject" predicate.  The RDF/XML (just below the figure) has no
"rdf:about" or "rdf:ID" that creates that node;  rather, the RDF/XML
syntax permits you to elide the explicit specification of nodes (with
accompanying identifiers) that, in fact, have to be there in the RDF
graph.  Now, does the blank node itself "have no real representation in
RDF/XML"?  Of course, a nodeID per se has no *explicit* representation
in RDF/XML (the whole point of eliding the specification of nodes is to
avoid having to create those identifiers), but it certainly stands for
the existence of a blank node in the Ntriples representation of the
graph.  The next example (Figure 15) illustrates another blank node, but
slightly different RDF/XML (here, the blank node has a
rdf:parseType="Resource" attribute, but still no ID or about).  What do
you think the problem is?
