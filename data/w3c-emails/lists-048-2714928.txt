Not *that* kind of a model;  the "data model" kind of a model (as in
"the relational model").  The RDF "model" (in that sense), as in "Model
and Syntax", is that of a specific kind of graph.  Ntriples is a way to
linearize that kind of a graph (and I'm not talking about a particular
graph *instance*).  I'd be happy to use "data model" instead of "model"
for this usage, if that would help (ala "the RDF data model" in the
second paragraph of http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3)
