Well, it might not be. If you read rdfs:label not as the relation 
between a thing and its label, but between a thing and what its label 
denotes - ie if you apply the P-style MT to the S-style bNode 
construction - then rdfs:label simply means equality. And indeed that 
is the only sensible way to interpret it *in the P-style MT 
extension*. That means it has a very bad name, of course -  it would 
be better called rdfs:sameAs  or some such - but the MT doesn't give 
a rat's ass what the names are. And with this interpretation of 
course,
"10" rdfs:label "10" .
(both  literals) makes sense and indeed is a tautology, and
"10" rdfs:label _:x .
means the same as
_:x rdfs:label "10" .
