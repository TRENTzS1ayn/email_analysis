There are several decisions there. Which one are you referring to?
This one?

"The model theory will be defined for RDF graphs, not n-triples."

Are you suggesting that issues #rdfms-graph is actually closed,
then? I don't think it's clear what an "RDF graph" is at all.
I think that's what we're discussing. I'm suggesting this
as a definition of an RDF graph:

        terms:
                constants (URIs w/fragids)
                string literals
                bnodes (existentially quantified variables)
        statement:
                term term term.
        formula:
                statement*

I believe that discussion on this issue is still in order.
Please confirm or clarify why not.
