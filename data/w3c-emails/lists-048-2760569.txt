Good point. On the other hand, you do want to say it was that 
particular document you signed, right, not some other document that 
just happened to mean the same thing (still less, *all* other 
documents that mean the same thing.) So I think that in a case like 
this we need at least two notions: the physical (token) document you 
actually signed, and the content (interpretation) of that token.

Hmm, what does that 'assert' mean? (Why didn't you just say, X entails Y ?
(Is the idea that assert(Y) means the RDF triples you would get by 
de-reifying Y, so that Y is an object that can be unpacked, as it 
were, into triples ?)

This raises a classical issue in belief/attribution logics. Suppose 
that X said P and Q is entailed by P; did X say Q as well? The 
objection is that X may not have realized that P entails Q, and if he 
had realized it he may not have said P in the first place. We could 
take the position that it is up to X to check all the entailments of 
anything he claims to be true, but still I bet some lawyer is going 
to want to distinguish the case where X actually *said* Q from the 
case where X said something that entails Q.
