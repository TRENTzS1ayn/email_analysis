On the other hand, I have little sympathy (as far as reading
specifications) for people without either a mathematical education 
or the ability to pick up a small number of not-very-difficult 
mathematical concepts.  [no :-)]

After all, it is probably less effort to pick up the mathematical concepts
required for simple model theory than to understand a normal ISO
specification.  [big :-)]
