Sure, that's what I wrote it for.

Good idea.

OK, though I think we need to be careful about having the strings in 
the interpretation, since the X and P schemes probably won't have 
anything denoting those.

Also, this can be described in several different ways even within a 
given datatyping-syntax option, so we need to be careful not to get 
confused with alternative ways of describing this structure in RDF.

One possibility, though eg (In ascii-graph-art)

_Robby ---weightKg--> "14" ---rdf:type--> xsd:decimal

would be more in the P++ style, and

_Robby weightKg "14" .
weightKg rdfs:range xsd:decimal .

more in the P style.

Ah, I see. That seems rather odd to me, I confess, as it assumes that 
durations are the value space of a datatyping scheme. I would have 
guessed that it was more likely that numbers - the n1-3 in your 
figure - would be in the literal value space, and that things like 
inYears and weightKg would be rdf properties.

I guess the moral is that part of the 'model' must be what datatyping 
schemes are supposed to be in use.
