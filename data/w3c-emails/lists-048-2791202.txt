How would this distinction work out in practice, given that even if you
want to refer to the meaning, you still need to refer to some concrete
representation of it (use a different property perhaps)?  After all, the
point of signing the contract in the first place was to express your
agreement with its meaning, as opposed to your approval, say, of the
artistic way the words were arranged on the piece of paper (is this an
example of the kind of distinction you want?).  If you wanted to do the
latter, you'd be well advised to write something on the paper other than
your signature in the space provided!
