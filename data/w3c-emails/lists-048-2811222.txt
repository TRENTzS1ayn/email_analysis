That looks like it.  I'm sorry about not being more precise first time round.

Issue

Ah, I see.  I read that originally as a proposal for something akin to an 
n-triples like syntax.  Pat and others are far better qualified than I to 
comment on whether this is an appropriate definition of a graph.

If you have an issue with how the model theory defines a graph that would be in 
order.  If there is sufficient *new* understanding affecting the decision to use 
  graphs as the syntax, it would also be in order to request the issue be revisted.
