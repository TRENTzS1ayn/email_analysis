Indeed it does, so much more that it seems to me to be clearly out of 
scope for this discussion and even for the entire WG. You seem to be 
proposing a complete redesign of the entire RDF data model, graph 
syntax, semantics and just about everything else. It seems like an 
awful lot to swallow just to get datatyping right.

But just to keep the terminology straight, this clearly isn't what I 
was calling the X proposal, so  just to keep our wires uncrossed in 
the various emails, let us re-christen the simpler idea the URV 
proposal.
