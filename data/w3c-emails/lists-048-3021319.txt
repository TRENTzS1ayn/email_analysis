Can you please elaborate on this point, with an example, as it seems 
rather important.

I was under the impression that XML Schema datatypes DID satisfy the 
required conditions. To fail, we need the following circumstances: 
two datatypes D1 and D2 with the value space of D1 being a subset of 
that of D2, and the lexical space of D1 intersecting that of D2, and 
D1 having a different, and incompatible, lexical-to-value mapping on 
that intersection from that used by D2.
