If we consider only lexical spaces, none of the lexical spaces for types 
derived-by-list (NMTOKENS, IDREFS, and ENTITIES) are proper subsets of 
the lexical spaces of their immediate superclasses.
 
If we consider canonical lexical spaces, then in addition to the above,
none of the canonical lexical spaces of xsd:integer and its subclasses
are proper subsets of the canonical lexical space of xsd:decimal.

Finally, such a constraint would prohibit the definition of e.g. a
subclass of xsd:integer -- e.g. scm:integer -- that has a perfect
intersection with regards to value space but does not have a lexical
space that is a perfect subset of xsd:integer.

Thus, to enforce that the rdfs:subClassOf relation between data type
classes includes proper subset intersection of lexical spaces not
only excludes XML Schema as-is, but also the means by which disparate
data type schemes can be related in terms of value space.

Cheers,

Patrick
