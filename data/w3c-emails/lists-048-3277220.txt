indeed
I think that following assertions

  "10" rdf:type xsd:decimal.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:string.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:float.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:double.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:gYear.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:gMonth.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:gDay.
  "10" rdf:type xsd:hexBinary.

are making sense, also taken *together*
and their subjects are different nodes
and one could write something like

  "10" rdf:type xsd:decimal; is eg:shoeSize of eg:me.

to say something about a *particular* node
(because the ';' repeats that particular subject)
or something like

  eg:me eg:shoeSize "10", [ rdf:type xsd:decimal ].

(but then we have to assume that eg:shoeSize is an ont:UniqueProperty)

Another assumption is that
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/w3-rdf-mt-current-draft.html
is not excluding literals in the rules for RDFS entailment e.g.

  rdfs3
  xxx aaa uuu . aaa rdfs:range zzz . |- uuu rdf:type zzz .
          ^^^yyy                        ^^^yyy
