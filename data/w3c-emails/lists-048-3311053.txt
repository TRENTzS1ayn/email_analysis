Dan,

would it break your mental model if the above N-triples-like syntax was 
modified to be:

         terms:
                 constant (URIs w/fragids)
                 string literals
                 bnodes (existentially quantified variables)
         statement:
                 term constant term.
         formula:
                 statement*

?

I think that can be used to specify graphs in the sense Pat is using them.
