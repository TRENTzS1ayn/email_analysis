The pairing of a URI denoting a data type having both a lexical
and value space and an RDF Literal constituting a member of
the lexical space (a lexical form).

rdf:type            pairs a literal with a data type URI

rdf:range           suggests a pairing of a literal property value with
                    a data type URI

rdfs:subClassOf     a relation between two data types asserting that
                    the value space of the subordinate type is a perfect 
                    subset of the value space of the superordinate type
                    (no relation between lexical spaces is asserted)

rdfs:subPropertyOf  a relation between properties from which one may
                    infer that the data type defined as the range for
                    the subordinate property has a subClassOf relation 
                    to the data type defined as the range for the
                    superordinate property

I'm not sure how to answer this one, other than say that
examples should employ consistent and explicit means to
define the pairing between lexical form and data type.

> (4) any assumptions about this

I think this is covered in the answer to #2 above.
