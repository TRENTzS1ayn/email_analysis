It denotes a value in a specific value space. And the value
is denoted by the pairing of lexical form to data type identity.

E.g.

  _Robby weight <unit:kg:14> .

The relation between the data type denoted by unit:kg
and its interpretation as e.g. an integer or number in
general is beyond the scope of RDF.

How about the one defined by XML Schema, and also adopted by the X
proposal and 'lit:' ontology, namely a paired value space and
lexical space, the latter of which may have a canonical subset.
