Umm... mental model... dunno. It involves 2 changes:
* no literals in the property slot. no great loss there...

* no bnodes in the property slot. Real loss of functionality.
I don't have a strong argument that it was ever there, but
I use it quite a bit, and I expect there are things we
want to model with RDF that won't work without it.
(in particular: languages with n-ary functions/relations).
