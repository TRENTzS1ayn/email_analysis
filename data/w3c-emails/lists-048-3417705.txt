Dan--


Could you send (or point to) one of your examples of bnodes in the 
property slot used for n-ary relations?  If this is legit, I think 
something should be said about it in the Primer (e.g., in the section on 
"Complex Data").  Also, something ought to be said about this approach 
in whatever replaces the current section 7.3 of the M&S, which describes 
"the recommended technique" for representing n-ary relations in RDF as 
using an intermediate bnode subject/object, rather than a bnode predicate.
