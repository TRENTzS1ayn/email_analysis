Sure.  But I'd also advise against signing either a check or a contract with 

the intent of simply expressing agreement with the layout!  It isn't just
whether you are signing (or annotating, in general) the meaning vs. the
token is it?  It's also what the annotation is supposed to mean in the
given context (expressed by the property associated with the annotation?

The questions in my original response weren't rhetorical.)
