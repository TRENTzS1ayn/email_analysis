I wrote (but you cutted that)

...are making sense, also taken *together*
and their subjects are different nodes
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

and I don't think one needs extra node labeling
(because one can talk about such *nodes*, be it in
the EC subset of Notation3)

sure, the subject is a node written "10"

as Pat argued, it would be better to write that as

  eg:me eg:shoeSize [ = "10", rdf:type xsd:decimal ].

> or

no, I meant what I wrote

  eg:me eg:shoeSize "10", [ rdf:type xsd:decimal ].

or

  eg:me eg:shoeSize "10".
  eg:me eg:shoeSize [ rdf:type xsd:decimal ].

which would require the assertion

  eg:shoeSize rdf:type daml:UniqueProperty.

to conclude that both object nodes "10"
and [ rdf:type xsd:decimal ] are the same thing
(but again you cutted that piece of text)

not lexical of course not
