Right.

No, you are right, and I was being sloppy. I should have said 
something like: ....the value space of D1 being an rdfs:subClassOf 
that of D2...., referring of course to the extensions.

But you know, I feel that a datatyping scheme that would break - not 
just barf, but give wrong answers - when subclass reasoning was 
extensionally accurate, was far too 'fragile' for practical use, even 
if it could be made to work on paper.
