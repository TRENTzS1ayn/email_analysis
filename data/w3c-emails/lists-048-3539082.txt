Actually, I take that back. 

rdfs:range expects a class as its value, and I think it is
a fairly reasonable assumption that data types are classes,
per the semantics of subClassOf, etc. so even though it might
not be strictly stated somewhere that data types are RDF classes,
I think it is fair to assume they are, and perhaps it should
be stated as such.

Cheers,

Patrick
