This definitely appears to be the case.

With all due respect, I have provided examples.

Just what kind of example are you looking for? I won't 
be providing a MT treatment of it if that's what you mean.

My apologies for being so terribly rude. Truly.

I feel like I've been in the Twilight Zone where every word I use 
no longer holds its meaning and every time I write "green" folks
read "blue", and the frustration has been significant.

So, according to your definitions of those slippery words,
I was wrong and according to my definitions you were wrong,
but in reality both of us are right -- we're just not talking
about the same things. Sigh.

I apologize again for my demeanor. I was out of line.

That evidently is the case ;-)

Humble apologies for the heat,

Patrick
