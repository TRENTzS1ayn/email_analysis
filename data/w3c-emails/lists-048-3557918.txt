Not, as far as I am aware:  the DAML+OIL and Web ontology groups are 
building those structures on top of RDF.

Yes: no such means within core RDF(S).

That's my understanding.

That's my expectation.

..

You (and others) might argue that this means RDF(S) is only "half a 
solution".  For some purposes, that may be true, but I strongly believe 
that for many other applications it is enough.  The availability of a 
simple, consistent language for applications to express ground facts is a 
very powerful tool.  Its's simplicity (from a developer perspective) will 
be, in my view, a key factor in getting lots of raw metadata out there on 
the web for more advanced reasoning engines to chew upon and generally work 
their magic.  The logical consistency of this simple language is crucial to 
ensuring that more powerful generic layers (DAML_OIL, WebOnt and more) can 
be built on this foundation.

Here are some notes I used to present RDF to our development team:
