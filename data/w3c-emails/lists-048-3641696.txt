In the resolution of issues

   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity
   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema

the WG decided to allow <rdf:li> elements as typed nodes.  This was at the time 
an arbritary decision, made primarily to ensure that there was a definite answer.

There has been implementor feedback that this was not a good decision.

The WG will also be considering by Friday issue:

   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-rdf-names-use

where it is proposed to disallow names from the RDF namespace in inappropriate 
contexts, e.g. rdf:Description not be allowed on a property element.

I propose

   o Use of rdf:li is an error
   o 
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test005.rdf 
be deleted
   o that the test cases for rdfms-rdf-names-use should illustrate this error.
