Issue

   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-assertion

Summary: RDF is not just a data model. The RDF specs should define a semantics 
so that an RDF statement on the web is interpreted as an assertion of that 
statement such that its author would be responsible in law as if it had been 
published in, say, a newspaper.

Propose that the RDF model theory defines a semantics for RDF and that this 
issue be closed.
