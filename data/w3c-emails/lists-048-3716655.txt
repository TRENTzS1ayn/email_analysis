another way to look at boolean-valued properties is
ala one-place-predicates.

I recommend representing HappyPerson(Fred) as
ex:Fred rdf:type ex:HappyPerson.

i.e. for rdf:is, we have rdf:type

for rdf:isNot, we sort-of/will have rdf:type along with ont:complementOf

so...
ex:Bob rdf:type [ ont:complementOf ex:HappyPerson].

DebM in the WebOnt WG is maintaing a tips/tricks document;
perhaps this idiom could go there, if not in our primer.
