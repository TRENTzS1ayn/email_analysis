Concerning this topic, I think it is important to differentiate
between generic statements, statements attributed to some
authority, and statements asserted by some authority.

These three distinctions are all addressed by the X proposal.

Please see the ontology defined therein and the included
example (if you haven't already ;-)

It also address the reification issue, which has been deferred,
but possibly could be readdressed in terms of the X proposal.

Regards,

Patrick
