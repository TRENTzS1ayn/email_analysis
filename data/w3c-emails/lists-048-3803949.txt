Sure... I accept that.  It wasn't central to my point and I agree it has to 
be addressed in some way.

The current MT, being based on the abstract graph, doesn't have this 
problem because the graph nodes are self-identifying in this 
respect.  Which is fine as a basis for defining semantics. But, lacking a 
lexical serialization, means that we still need some way to present than 
(drawings of graphs or N-triples are our current candidates).

Which, it seems to me is exactly what a formal semantics achieves.

I have come to a view that reification (at least as I see it's uses) 
doesn't need to be defined in the core of RDF.  To understand the formal 
semantics of RDF as Pat has defined it requires some effort of thought, 
mainly (IMO) to learn to think clearly about the distinction between syntax 
(tokens, inscriptions) and meanings (denotations, interpretations).  But 
beyond that, it really doesn't seem to me to be at all complicated.

I think it is a prerequisite, because without a formal semantics everything 
else is built on sand.

Quite.  In RDF, a node can both denote a statement *and* have a URI label:

     <rdf:Statement about="http://example.com/stmt">
       <rdf:predicate rdf:resource="http://example.com/pred" />
       <rdf:subject   rdf:resource="http://example.com/sub" />
       <rdf:object    rdf:resource="http://example.com/obj" />
     </rdf:Statement>

which corresponds to the triples:

     <http://example.com/stmt> rdf:type      rdf:Statement .
     <http://example.com/stmt> rdf:predicate <http://example.com/pred> .
     <http://example.com/stmt> rdf:subject   <http://example.com/sub> .
     <http://example.com/stmt> rdf:object    <http://example.com/obj> .

Your proposal seems to preclude this.

Well, yes, I have in the past found it useful to think about RDF in terms 
of reified statements.  (e.g. 
http://public.research.mimesweeper.com/RDF/RDFContexts.html.)  But I have 
always seen any such view as being underpinned by the basic RDF triple 
model, rather than vice versa.

It was not previously clear to me that you were not promoting this as an 
alternative approach to handling datatyping of literals.  I suppose that, 
at this stage of the working group life, we are really trying to converge 
on some common concepts to present to the world.
