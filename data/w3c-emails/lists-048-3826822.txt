I don't oppose the proposal, but I'd like to note that there's an 
alternative approach, also not requiring any new vocabulary.

A Boolean valued property could be regarded as equivalent to a monadic 
predicate;

    e.g.  (IsLikeThis(SomeResource) == TRUE)  <=>  IsLikeThis(SomeResource)

Treatments of typed logic that I have read (notably Sowa's book Knowledge 
Representation) suggest that a type is just a shorthand for a value that 
satisfies a monadic predicate:

     (FORALL (x:integer) (EXISTS (y:integer) y > x))

is equivalent to:

     (FORALL (x) integer(x) => (EXISTS (y) integer(y) AND y>x))

Which leads to the idea that Boolean valued properties are simply monadic 
predicates which can be represented as types:

     X rdf:type integer .

asserts the truth of:

     integer(X)
