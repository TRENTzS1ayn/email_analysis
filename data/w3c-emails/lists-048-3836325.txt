Fair enough. Not being a mathematician, I can't say, but
I was certainly striving to abstract away from the resource-centric
graph view to get a better (or at least different) perspective
on the primitive bits.

Well, I meant, it is ruled out if *I* am supposed to
define the formal semantics ;-)

Point taken. Quite right. That's an error of omission. There's
no reason why an SNode can't have a uriref label. Thanks for 
catching that bug.

So, in fact there isn't a conflict there.

But the problem arises that, in any context where you must qualify
statements (and that's darn near everywhere, really) you have to 
reify the statements, yet that is an extra step with the current
model, and should be provided IMO for free.

I'm not so impractical as to expect that I can join the party
late and pick all the music ;-)

Though, if you look at the total PRO and CON scores in my
modified table that Pat made, it does get the highest score ;-)

Cheers,
