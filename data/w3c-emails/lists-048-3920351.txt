I would accept your apologies were it not for the fact that I owe you 
more, for all kinds of snotty responses now being emailed around the 
planet, many of them close to libelous. Please forgive me for getting 
hot under the collar.

Some things really should not be put in email before we have had a 
chance to hear one another's voices, I suspect.
