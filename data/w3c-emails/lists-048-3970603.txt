Yes, forget it. I think I was focussing in on 'denotes' too closely, is all.

Right.

Right, I agree that makes sense; but the S/DC proposals don't take 
that route; they have all literals in the graph just denoting the 
string that represents the value, and then have a bNode to denote the 
value. It seems kind of arse-backwards, but I have to admit it sure 
makes the semantics of literals simpler if they all just represent 
strings, period.
