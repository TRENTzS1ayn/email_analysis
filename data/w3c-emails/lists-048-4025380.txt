Well, it just means we are both really, really passionate

I agree.  Though it does afford a certain protection from
heavy and/or sharp flying objects ;-)

While Orlando isn't quite "just down the road from you", I'll
be there for XML 2001 (and a bit before and after), so if you're
in O-town during that time, for whatever reason, it'd be great
to have a f2f.

The same goes for anyone else going to XML 2001, of course ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
