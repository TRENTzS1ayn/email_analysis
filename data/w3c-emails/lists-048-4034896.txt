Shall those of us who will be at XML 2001 plan an 
informal, social f2f in Orlando?

Also I'll be in Burlington/Boston on the 3rd of December, and
have my evening free, so if any of you folks in that general 
vacinity might want to show me some of the better pubs
of Boston...  ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
