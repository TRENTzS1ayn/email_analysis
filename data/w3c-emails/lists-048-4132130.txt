I certainly think this issue can be closed.  At the same time (but not 
really wanting to reopen a closed issue), I'm not sure what "not just a 
data model" means.  Is the intent to suggest that if I say something by 
creating a triple in RDF (say, "Joe created document foobar"), it has 
more significance as an assertion than saying the same thing by creating 
a tuple in a corresponding 3-ary relation in an equally-public 
relational database?  Why?
