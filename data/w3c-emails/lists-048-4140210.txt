Good point.  My take is that they are equivalent now and we are committed to 
keeping them equivalent, so it would be ok to close it given that.  It would be 
hard to argue its urgent to close this, I'm just trying to get some issues 
closed off in parallel with working on the biggies.  How about:

    o The WG believes that:

       - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory
       - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph
       - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model
         and Syntax document

      are currently all equivalent and the WG is resolves to maintain that
      equivalence.

Brian
