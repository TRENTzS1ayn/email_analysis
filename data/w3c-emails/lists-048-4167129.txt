sorry if I may have confused you...
but we were *not* losing context while writing

  "10" rdf:type xsd:decimal; is eg:shoeSize of eg:me.

which is written in the existential conjunctive subset of
TimBL & DanC's N3 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html
we are not loosing context because the ';' repeats that
particular "10" node
OK?

and also *not* loosing context while writing

  eg:me eg:shoeSize "10".
  eg:me eg:shoeSize _:x.
  _:x rdf:type xsd:decimal.
  eg:shoeSize rdf:type daml:UniqueProperty.

which is written in N-Triples (using QNames)
OK?

I agree that the former case, not standing in the
typical N3 {} contexts, is not making a lot of sense,
but it works e.g. with http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/
for RDFS entailment test cases...

sure ;-)
