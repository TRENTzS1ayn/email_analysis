Hmmmm...

I have a certain personal investment in not doing so :), having the only
streaming mode parser that implements aboutEach correctly (tempting fate).
But Dave's arguments hang together. I am hoping somebody from the document
author side will make a good case for retaining it; personally, I can't.


What I believe the previous WG were trying to do was to allow provenance
information to be included in RDF, using pairs of rdf:bagID and
rdf:aboutEach. I think this failed.
Probably we should be having experiments, outside of a standard RDF, in how
best to handle provenance. I suspect a more document centric and less
resource centric approach would be better.

       handles rdf:aboutEach may exhaust memory. I have the design of
       a fix, but it is not high on my ToDo list. e-mail me if you
       wish to move it up."

No-one has taken me up on this!
