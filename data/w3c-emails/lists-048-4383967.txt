I fully agree, which is the default for the X model. A 
statement is just a statement. It is not asserted until
and unless someone makes a statement about that statement
that indicates that it was asserted, e.g. via the
proposed property assertedBy (some authority).

I'm not arguing that. I find the present triple based model
to be much easier to think in terms of from a resource
perspective, and certainly easier for notations.

As I hope I made clear in several posts, but which I 
state again here, I see the X model as a layer below
the triple based model. It does not itself use triples,
and the constructs are not themselves statements, but
they model statements. 

That's an important distinction (I think).
