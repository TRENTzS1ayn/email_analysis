fine up to here; these names are purely syntactic, and I'm
happy to have their syntax limited this way...

I'd prefer not to go there. The nice thing about container
decisions to date is that rdf:Bag etc. are *not* special
syntax; they're just logical constants.

I can live with it, though.

yes, please. rdf:li is syntax as well.

Again, please: no.
rdf:_nnn is a logical constant, not special syntax.

yes, please.
