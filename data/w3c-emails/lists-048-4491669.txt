Er...yes, you could say that. But in the same sense, all subjects are 
nodes, even those with uriref labels. I was presuming that 
'expressible in RDF/XML' meant, using the usual conventions for 
writing RDF graphs in the XML lexicalization.

With enough ingenuity, any graph structure can be *described* in XML, 
of course.

I am puzzled, since this is just true of all RDF graphs: urirefs and 
literals ARE labels of nodes, and nodes ARE unique. Right. So what 
does it mean to say that the X proposal 'defines' this to be the 
case? All of RDF assumes this to be the case, surely (??)

I confess to not really understanding the X model. It seems to be a 
proposal to describe RDF graphs in RDF, a kind of meta-RDF . I don't 
really see what the point of doing this is, or how you would get back 
to the original assertions you started with.

If you had said just 'expressible in XML' then yes; but RDF/XML 
already is an idiom.
