Not in terms of "tidying".

Of course, nodes themselves are unique. What I meant is that
while nodes with the same uriref labels might get merged,
nodes with the same literal labels (or no labels) would
not.

Thus, each literal is "hosted" by its own node and those
don't ever merge. This allows literals (or rather their nodes)
to serve as subjects.

That's exactly what it is. Sort of ;-)

But the assertions are what are being modeled. X model
constructs are themselves not RDF statements, thus we
are not making assertions about assertions in X graphs.
We are just modeling assertions.

I thought an 'idiom' was a way to consistently express something
in RDF which is not apparent by the graph structure it self, such
as e.g. the DC approach where special understanding of certain
subgraph "templates" are needed to interpret the "idiom".

How were you using the term 'idiom'? ;-)
