But how can we possibly do that? That's like passing a law requiring 
vegetables to grow faster. We have no power to control how people do 
or don't meet their social obligations. And the connection between 
bits on the wire and legal obligations is going to get decided by the 
courts, whatever we say about it.

What I find odd about this is the idea that W3C constitutes, or even 
speaks in the name of, a 'community'. The only things that speak in 
the names of communities are their elected or appointed 
representatives, and even then you had better carry a lot of salt 
with you.

Well, that is an interesting claim. Suppose I were to deny it. How 
could we decide the issue? By consulting a model theory? By citing a 
publication of the W3C? (But what if you and I had nothing to do with 
the W3C, and had played no role in the formulation of this policy? Or 
what if I were just to tell the W3C to go to hell?) Or would it in 
fact get decided by a court somewhere? Seems to me that the last is 
the only reasonable answer, since most questions about social 
obligations get decided by court decisions; that itself seems to be 
one of the social rules in the US.
