yes.

In the scenario I gave, the relevant schema was ratified
by the UCC council; i.e. 47 of the 50 united states
(or something like that; see http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/context.html
for details); let's assume we're doing business in those states.

Yes, it would ultimately get decided by a court.
But it would be important for the court (or: expert
witnesses in the court) to be able to cite specs
that say what the intent of the technology is.


I'm pretty sure this has actually happened; stuff
like the following has been read into court records:

9.1.1 Safe Methods

Implementors should be aware that the software represents
the user in their interactions over the Internet, and should be
careful to allow the user to be aware of any actions they
might take which may have an unexpected significance to
themselves or others. 

In particular, the convention has been established that the
GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance
of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods
ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to
represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in
a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that
a possibly unsafe action is being requested. 

Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not
generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request;
in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The
important distinction here is that the user did not request
the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for
them.
