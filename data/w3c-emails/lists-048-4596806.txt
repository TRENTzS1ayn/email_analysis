The reason why this issue is treated rather elliptically in the MT is 
that the great merit of the graph syntax, as I see it, is that the 
issue simply *does not come up*.  There are no quantifiers, no bound 
variables and no scopes to keep track of, it all works out 
automatically. The merging conditions are a joy to state (merge nodes 
required to be tidy, ie urirefs; don't merge anything else.) It's 
beautiful. It seemed perverse to introduce the clunky logical 
notation only to be able to say that we don't have those problems.

If people feel that this issue should be aired more thoroughly, I 
would suggest that I write a slightly fuller account of how the graph 
syntax makes local scoping unnecessary, maybe with a couple of 
examples, and put it into the 'mapping into logic' section, and then 
refer to that from elsewhere in the document as needed. Any 
objections/comments?
