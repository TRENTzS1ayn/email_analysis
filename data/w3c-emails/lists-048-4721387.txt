It is a useful syntactic convenience for folks who
write their RDF/XML instances by hand. One can
put a bunch of resources in a bag and then make
an aboutEach statement. It also IMO can help make
an RDF instance more readable with regards to
common classifications of resources. E.g.

<rdf:Bag rdf:ID="guys">
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Bob"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#John"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Joe"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Harry"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Frank"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Phil"/>
</rdf:Bag>

<rdf:Bag rdf:ID="gals">
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Mary"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Elain"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Jane"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Betty"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Elizabeth"/>
   <rdf:li rdf:resource="#Judeth"/>
</rdf:Bag>

<rdf:Description rdf:aboutEach="#guys">
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="x:Male"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description rdf:aboutEach="#gals">
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="x:Female"/>
</rdf:Description>

This is also very useful for asserting "local"
classifications of resources for third-party
knowledge where you cannot touch the original
schemas.

I know of one standards group which is in the
process of finalizing the decision to migrate
to RDF and is planning on using aboutEach a good
deal, though I'm not at liberty (yet) to say who 
that is.

*Please* leave it alone.

Cheers,

Patrick
