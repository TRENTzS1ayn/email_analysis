I think we should try and apply consistent standards for changes.

I think we should explicit delete "strong call from the community" from the
necessary hurdle for changes.

However, I personally am unconvinced by Dave's case that the change is
*necessary*. aboutEach is unfortunate and shouldn't be in the language but I
feel it is in the category of "don't like but are not really broken."  (In
contrast with the issue that brought the chair into action in October where
the spec is self-contradictory and hence is broken!).

Looking at Dave's implementation overview stuff it seemed to say, aboutEach
is implementable but quite difficult and most people haven't bothered. That
is it is an implementation defect not a spec defect. The main reason for
dropping aboutEach, which isn't such a bad one, is that the corner cases to
do with aboutEach are unclear (in a range of issues raised in part by me).
The easiest way to clarify the corner cases is excision of aboutEach.
Instead of trimming five toenails, it might be easier to cut off the foot.

I suspect that laziness is the reason for not postponing this to rdf 2.
