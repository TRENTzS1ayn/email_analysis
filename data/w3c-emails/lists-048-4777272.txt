I'm rather skeptical at how much that happens :)

For writing by hand, there are, ahem, non-XML syntaxes that are better.

Can now be written as

 <rdf:Bag rdf:ID="guys">
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Male" rdf:resource="#Bob"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Male" rdf:resource="#John"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Male" rdf:resource="#Joe"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Male" rdf:resource="#Harry"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Male" rdf:resource="#Frank"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Male" rdf:resource="#Phil"/>
 </rdf:Bag>
 
 <rdf:Bag rdf:ID="gals">
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Female" rdf:resource="#Mary"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Female" rdf:resource="#Elain"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Female" rdf:resource="#Jane"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Female" rdf:resource="#Betty"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Female" rdf:resource="#Elizabeth"/>
    <rdf:li rdf:type="http://example.org/property/Female" rdf:resource="#Judeth"/>
 </rdf:Bag>

It is a syntax-in-this-document thing; aboutEach over concepts in
other documents is I think, not allowed, since we decided in June
that the aboutEach distributed over top level nodes in the same
RDF/XML document.

  Ora Lassila has stated in a response that it was the intention of
  the working group that rdf:aboutEach attributes should be permitted
  only on top level description elements.
  
  Resolution: On 29th June 2001, the WG decided that rdf:aboutEach
  attributes are not allowed on an rdf:Description (or typed node)
  element which is the object of a statement.

I would rather convince them to use something better rather than
intend to use this mechanism which is poorly implemented - mostly due
to its bad interactions with bagID, and its many corner cases.
