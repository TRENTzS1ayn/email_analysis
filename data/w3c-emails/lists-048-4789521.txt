I'm not saying there aren't. But the spec defines an
XML serialization and that is what the masses will use.

IMO, anyone who things that the web community at large will
adopt a non-XML notation for the interchange of RDF encoded
knowledge is mistaken.

The presumption that problems relating to the XML serialization
need not be of concern because there are other "better" notations
out there really troubles me, particularly if held by WG members.

RDF defines (a) a conceptual model, (b) specific ontologies,
and (c) an XML serialization.

So, please don't tell me (or some other user) that the
answer to their problems is to use some other notation than
RDF/XML!

If and when N3 is an *official* serialization for RDF and
*all* RDF parsers are required to support it in order to
claim conformance, then I'll accept that as an acceptable
answer.

Until then, it is just avoiding the issue.

You are apparently missing the entire point of a

It is if you use standard XML mechanisms for inclusion.

Or rather, one can create a syndicated XML instance from
individual instances for interpretation by an RDF parser
in terms of syntactic constructs.
