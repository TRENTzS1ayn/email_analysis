I take your point, but my point was that a given system (or process)
itself defines the criteria by which statements are selected as
relevant (asserted) and it may utilize particular ontologies to
base that selection on.

Thus, what one process may consider "asserted", another may not, and
yet they all can operate at the same time on the same knowledge base
of statements without their "world views" getting in the way of one
another.

The idea that assertion is a primitive of the statement presumes
that a given knowledge base only holds one world view, so to speak.
