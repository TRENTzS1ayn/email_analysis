Yes, yes. Sorry. Typing in a hurry. I'd normally put

     <rdf:type rdf:resource="&x;Male"/>

and define the URI prefix as an XML ENTITY...

Well, rdf:type was just *one* property that might be ascribed, and
the fact that there is this alternate "inline" type of definition
perhaps makes it a poor choice for example. Also, I may wish to
define numerous common properties to those bag members, e.g.

  <rdf:Description rdf:aboutEach="#someID">
     <x:property1>value1</x:property1>
     <x:property2>value2</x:property2>
     <x:property3>value3</x:property3>
     <x:property4>value4</x:property4>
     <x:property5>value5</x:property5>
  </rdf:Description>

And you can't do that otherwise in any convenient manner, other
than enumerating all those statements for every single resource.

Eh?

Just because it's not "quite right" does not mean it isn't very
useful and shouldn't be retained.

Otherwise, on such criteria, we'd have to toss *alot* more stuff 
out of RDF, eh? ;-)

But the benefit is not to the implementor community. It is to
the content creators. I would be surprised if *any* implementor
would oppose a reduction in functionality requirements if they
are not themselves benefiting from them, eh? ;-)

Why should we wait for "future" specifications to provide
"someday" what RDF already provides now?!

I'm not saying aboutEach is perfect. I'm just saying it's very
useful, and being used.

Is it's limited implementation because causes a headache for 
implementors? Or simply that implementors haven't themselves
needed or used that feature?

I'd love to hear first hand, really...

Come on now! Be fair. Adoption of RDF has been as slow as
molases in January! Just because there aren't hundreds of
examples of use doesn't mean that they are not just around
the corner.

And I've informed you of one official use of this mechanism
(which I hope will be public knowledge soon), so I'm telling
you that there *are* uses of this, and I expect that there
will be lots more.

Obviously. 

I explicitly said it's benefit was as a *convenience*.

As I said above. You shouldn't ask folks to stop what
they are already doing now in RDF because there *might*
be a better way to do it in the future.

That's not reasonable.

Rather, I will restate that I am opposed to the removal
of this feature, and will not likely be swayed unless 
implementors of RDF parsers can clearly explain to me
that it is a major pain in the rear end for them.
