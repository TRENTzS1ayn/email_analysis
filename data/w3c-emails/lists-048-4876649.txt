It's almost a victim of its own beauty ;-)

I completely overlooked the section of graph merging when I responded, 
partly because it was so short but mostly because I wasn't expecting it to 
be in the section on entailment...   (That's not much of an excuse really, 
it is well-enough signposted in the document;  oh well.)

Anyway, a simpler suggestion might be to simply move the definition of 
graph merging up to section 0.2, just after the definition of tidiness?
