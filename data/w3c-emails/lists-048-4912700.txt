To the extent that it is difficult to implement may also a spec 
defect;  i.e. if its benefit doesn't match the effort of implementing it.

I think we also have a problem that if we really think it's a bad idea, we 
ought to drop it sooner rather than later;  if it stays in V1.0 then I 
predict we'll be stuck with it for a very long time.

(Which makes me think that the criteria for dropping bad features should 
probably be less stringent than the criteria for adding "cool" 
features.  For what it's worth, if this were being advanced under the IETF 
standards process, it's seems likely to me that aboutEach would get dropped 
between "proposed" and "draft" standard stages.)
