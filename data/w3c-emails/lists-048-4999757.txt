But why bother with rdfs:range at all?!

Just declare s:age as a subPropertyOf xsd:duration, right,
since all data types are defined using properties...

Am I the only one to see a conflict here? (though that may
not be so surprising ;-)

I.e. what is the interpretation of the following knowledge:

   x s:age "P12Y" .
   s:age rdfs:range xsd:duration .
   s:age rdfs:subPropertyOf xsd:duration .

According to the S proposal, either range or subproperty
relations can define type. Which is it going to be? Both?!

Eh?
