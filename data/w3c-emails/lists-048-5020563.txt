I disagree, having used rdfs:seeAlso to guide an RDF indexing robot around
a Web of RDF/XML files, I find it works pretty well, even without using
sub-property specialization (a technique the RDFS spec explicitly
mentions).

For example, see http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/rdfweb/danbri-foaf.rdf
where I use it as an annotation on partially described resources
(typically people). (please ignore the genid: stuff in that file, it was a
hack to work around my buggy blank-node code).

It go for me. If I wanted to be fancy, my robot would use content
negotiation to request its favoured encodings of the see-also'd URI. In
practice, everyone's used RDF/XML so that wasn't an issue. Pointing to
non-asserted content isn't a problem for rdfs:seeAlso, but one for the
document formats (eg. XHTML, SVG) and protocols (HTTP/1.1, SOAP etc) that
expose such content in the Web.
