<Jema> See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0294.html
<jjc> propose move item 6 to e-mail :-)
<gk> Minutes last meeting; APPROVED
<gk> Volume of mail traffic
<gk> +DanC
<gk> Suggest replace rdfcore with www-archive@w3.org;  but mail overload isn't completely out of order at present
<gk> Chair has a problem keeping up.
<gk> Please try and use subject lines meaningfully
<gk> Discussions tend to wander; difficult to know when to change the subject line
<DanC> my client doesn't grok priorty, fyi
* em priority is not consistent across email clients
<gk> Aaron suggests that message priority be raised for summaries, agendas, minutes, etc (i.e. important key WG messages rather
then general discussion)
<DanC> I'm especially interested in summaries from issue-owners and/or editors.
<em> summaries++
<DanC> danbri_: feel free to use IRC for clarification discussions.
--> sergey (melnik@Barnacle.Stanford.EDU) has joined #rdfcore

* DanC hunts for danbri's "here's my latest draft" mail...
<gk> ACTION DanBri to mail brian which schema issues have been folded into document
<-- bwm has quit (Ping timeout: 182 seconds)
<gk> ACTION brian, new test case from Jos to go onto next telecon agenda; Jos to provide Brian with details
<-- Jema has quit (Ping timeout: 181 seconds)
<danbri_> rdfs working copy is at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/Schema/20010913/ (I should put $Id$ in header..)
<danbri_> linked from WG homepage
<gk> Primer status
<gk> Eric planning on having something by 5PM EST Monday
<gk> Model theory working draft
<gk> Currently in "deep-freeze", pending datatype discussion.
<DanC> danbri, I can't find your "here's my latest RDFS draft" message in the last two
<gk> Sergey will explain how this works;  but asks for help in explaining how it fits with DAML+OIL
<gk> (Pat says it does not)
<gk> ACTION Sergey, get datatype document out ASAP
<DanC> JosD, in general, there's no need to say what the rdf:type of the intermediate node in S, Jos.
<gk> ACTION Frank, clarify architectural issues and concerns he perceives with any proposal
<JosD> DanC, OK but I still think we need a name for the type and the mapping...
<gk> ACTION Jeremy, raise S/P compatibility concerns with WebOnt WG
<gk> ACTION MikeD, raise S/P compatibility concerns with DAML+OIL
<DanC> on AT&T, they don't cut you off.
<gk> ... (joint committee)
<gk> item 14
<gk> Booplean property values
<gk> WG notes that rdf:type can be used to express these.
<DanC> pls note that the ChocolateLover ont:complimentOf NotAChocolateLover.
<gk> Need to work on wording to be clear about this negation issue
<danbri_> proposed replacement sentence: 'We expect additional work on Web Ontology languages [ref] to provide more expressive
constructs (such as ont:complementOf) for such purposes'.
<gk> ACTION Pat, prepare new statement of resolutuion after email discussion
<gk> ACTION Pat, publish new version of model theory with literal datatype issue elided, ASAP
<gk> ... target next Wednesday
<danbri_> ADJOURNED.
<danbri_> --
<-- gk (~GK@host213-120-0-45.webport.bt.net) has left #rdfcore
<-- jandave has quit ("Leaving")
<danbri_> Has someone grabbed the log? (xchat doesn't cut/paste well)
