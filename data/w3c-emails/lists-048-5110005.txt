We will soon be talking about candles in the wind if we go on like this.

Yes, I like that idea.  Put all the graph manipulating stuff into one 
place, then later on explain what it means. I'll try doing that; but 
not in the next-week version; since until we get the datatyping 
sorted out, its not clear what notion of 'tidiness' is appropriate, 
and I want to just slip past that issue at present.
