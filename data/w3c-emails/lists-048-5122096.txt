Yes, I think you outline a reasonable level of intent, though I think that 
getting the words right is likely to be tricky.  I think we should be wary 
about trying to say too much (i.e. in too much detail) on this topic.

Maybe something as simple as this:

[[[
RDF is intended to convey assertions that are meaningful to the extent that 
they may, in appropriate contexts, be used to express the terms of binding 
agreements.
]]]

?
