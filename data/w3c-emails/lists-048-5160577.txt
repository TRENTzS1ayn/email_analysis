But until something gets asserted, we don't even have any ontologies; 
we just have content-free syntax.

I disagree. If they don't agree about what is asserted, they can't 
even know what one another are saying, so they can't do any 
operations on the knowledge base. If nothing is asserted, the 
knowledge base is empty.

Well, it does indeed assume that they agree about what counts as 
being asserted. But I think we have to assume this much agreement 
just in order for communication to be possible at all. If I don't 
know if you are asserting something or just, as it were, holding it 
up to be contemplated, then how can I know what to make of it, or 
what I should be expected to infer from it?
