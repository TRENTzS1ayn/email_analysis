Oh. Then I didn't understand this URV proposal either, it seems.

The above doesn't make sense to me.

What sense of 'implies' do you mean? Is the idea that the URV form 
itself would not in fact be syntactically correct RDF? If it IS 
syntactically correct, what process or semantic constraint justifies 
the translation from the plain URV triple containing <xsd:integer:10> 
to the DC-style triplet graph using rdf:type? On the face of it, that 
seem invalid.

That is not an interpretation. It is a graph. How did you get from 
the first graph to this graph?

No, because we don't have any clear meaning for 'synonym'.

Please, please, let us have these proposals made openly. Say what the 
actual RDF graph that expresses the content is going to be. Do not 
invent some kind of syntactic sugar and then appeal to some undefined 
notion of synonym-expansion or rule-application to generate the 
'real' RDF graph.

As far as I can make out from the above, the URV proposal is in fact 
just a syntactic sugaring of the DC proposal, which was taken out of 
the running in todays telecon; so we should treat the U proposal as 
also taken out of the running.
