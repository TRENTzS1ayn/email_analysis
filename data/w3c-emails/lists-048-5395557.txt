By which you mean, in NTriples:

   x s:age y .
   y xsd:duration "P12Y" .

But that is redundant, since the semantics of
xsd:duration have already be infused into the
semantics of s:age.

With regards to data typing semantics only, you are 
saying the equivalent of

   x xsd:duration y .          (from subPropertyOf)
   y xsd:duration "P12Y" .     (from range)

Such redundancy seems to point to some problems
that perhaps have not been identified yet with this
proposal.

This all seems quite clever and may be good fun, but it's
IMO a bit too radical a change to impose on the RDF community
and also totally blurs the distinction between data type
and property, which I don't consider to be correct.
