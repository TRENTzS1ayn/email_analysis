And then some (but the damn thing keeps coming back to life! ;-)

I agree. Case closed.

They are and they aren't. They are not graphs per the current RDF
graph model. They are RDF graphs in that they represent RDF knowledge.
That knowledge could be represented by either graph.

One may also argue, is the "graph" employed by the MT an RDF graph
if it employs mechanisms which are not defined in the current graph
model?

But let's rather actually not have that discussion here, eh? Feel
free to respond offgroup if you like, though.

I'm sure that is due to my inability to express myself in a manner
and language that you are familar with. Cest la vie.
