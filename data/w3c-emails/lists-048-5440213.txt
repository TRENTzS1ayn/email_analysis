Hey folks,

I just wanted to make apologies for my being absent from
the last few concalls. I have not been able to rearrange
an existing recurring obligation on Friday evenings (FST)
which prevents my participation, and to which I committed
long before joining the WG. I hope to begin participating
in the concalls as soon as possible. Until then, please
accept my sincere regrets for not being able to participate
except via the mailing list.

Regards,
