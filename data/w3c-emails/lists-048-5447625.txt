New proposed:

o resolves that the use of the qname 'rdf:Description' except as the
  name of a description element is an error
o resolves that the use of the qnames 'rdf:ID', 'rdf:about',
  'rdf:resource', 'rdf:bagID', 'rdf:parseType' except as reserved
   names as specified in the grammar is an error
o resolves that the use of the qnames 'rdf:Bag', 'rdf:Alt'
  and 'rdf:Seq' except as typed nodes is an error
