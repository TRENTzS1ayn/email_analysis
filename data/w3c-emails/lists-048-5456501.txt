Thanks for the improvement.

I'm happy to accept DanC's suggestion that we should not syntactically 
restrict the use of rdf:Bag, rdf:Alt and rdf:Seq. I also noticed that I'd 
left out rdf:RDF, rdf:li and rdf:aboutEach from the list of reserved 
names.  Did I miss any more; DaveB you have a list somewhere.  I wonder if 
we can simplify it all to:

   o Resolves that the use of qnames rdf:RDF, rdf:ID, rdf:about,
     rdf:resource, rdf:bagID, rdf:parseType, rdf:aboutEach and rdf:li except
     as reserved names as specified in the grammar is an error.

We also have the case of names not in the name space.  Should the parser 
barf if it meets a property or a typed node like rdf:foo?
