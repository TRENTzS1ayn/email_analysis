There is a possible interaction between rdf:aboutEach and allowing literals 
as subjects.  Given:

   <rdf:Bag rdf:ID="bag">
     <rdf:li>foo</rdf:li>
   </rdf:Bag>
   <rdf:Description rdf:aboutEach="#bag">
     <rdf:value>bar</rdf:value>
   </rdf:Description>

would we expect

   "foo" <rdf:value> "bar" .

Hmmm, what does M&S say about this:

[[[
When aboutEach is specified with Description, the statements in the 
Description refer to each of the members of the container named by 
aboutEach. The triples {p,r,v} represented by each contained propertyElt E 
as described above are duplicated for each r that is a member of the container.
]]]

Not very clear;  Does r have to be a resource?
