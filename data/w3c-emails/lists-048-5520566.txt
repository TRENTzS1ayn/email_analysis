1. That isn't a new interpretation; all the proposals that require 
the MT extension (P and P++ of those on the table, and possibly X) 
all assume that the graph node itself is the primary denoting entity. 
They have to, since the same literal label might have different 
meanings in different contexts. That is why they require that RDF 
graphs not be restricted to be tidy on literal nodes.

2. That isn't what Graham is talking about here (I think).

Obviously, the RDF Core WG. It's our language, and we can say what it means.

The S proposal does not involve the introduction of new vocabulary in this way.
