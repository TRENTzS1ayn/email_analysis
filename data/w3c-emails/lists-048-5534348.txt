The datatyping document I'm working on it available at

http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/datatyping/

It is still very rough, but I'm posting the link so you can ensure that
I'm still on track (I'll be on a Thanksgiving trip Thu-Sun, so I wanted
to have something out before that).

Looking forward to your comments,
Sergey
