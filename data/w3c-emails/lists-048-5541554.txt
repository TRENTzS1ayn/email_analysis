My apologies if this has been answered elsewhere in the
email discussion.

[1] suggests that only the P and P++ proposals involves the
use of rdfs:range.  Is this true?  If so, it seems like
we've missed a major opportunity to capture the intent of
the ontology developer and make life easier on programmers
using the ontology (who otherwise must presumably be
prepared to handle any datatype or instance as the property
value).
