Great. Then at least that is agreed upon.

I think this is opening up a can of worms...  insofar as
it implies that anyone who wishes to use some other data type
scheme other than XML Schema basic types has to do more than
just allocate a URI for each type, but must allocate three
different URIs -- and users have to then keep clear in their
heads the nuances of meaning for each.

Not a very appealing scenario...

So exactly what are xsdv:integer and xsdp:integer, if not
new vocabulary terms?
