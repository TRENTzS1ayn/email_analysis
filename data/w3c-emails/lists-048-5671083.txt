He wasn't using that namespace in his example; his rdf:RDF header was:

 <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
          xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-schema-ns#"
          xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/"
          xmlns:dcq="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
          xmlns:my="http://tunichts.org/">

 .... much elided ...

 <!-- now turn off RDF processing -->

 <rdf:html><p><b>Notes</b></p></rdf:html> <!--@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ -->

 ... more elided ...

 </rdf:RDF>

So rdf:html is NOT handled by para 196 and thus the above is not
legal RDF/XML.  Any application that handle this is not conformant to
the existing M&S.
  
Note the namespace isn't the one for the syntax:
  http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
but another one:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax
or in fact, a whole set of namespaces with URIs beginning with that
prefix - horrible!

I guess this was done in the vein of how XML reserves all attributes
starting with "xml", expecting new RDF terms to be put there, not for
user applications to do it.

However, I feel we shouldn't keep Para 196 around on the grounds of
insufficient use and (correct) implementation.  This the first
attempt at use I've ever seen and I don't remember seeing any parser
that implemented this.

Para 196 doesn't apply.
