I suggest you re-read the charter, Patrick.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

[[
The RDF Core WG is chartered to complete the work on RDF vocabulary
description present in the RDF Schema Candidate Recommendation [..]
RDF Schema must be expressed in terms of the RDF model, and must use W3C
RDF syntax. RDF Schema must use and build upon XML Schema datatypes to the
fullest extent that is practical and appropriate. [etc...]
]]


Hmmm... haven't we been here before? Like 10 days ago?

From http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0325.html

Could you please confirm that you have read the charter.

There may be technical or deployment considerations that count against S,
but as far as I can see it is a reasonable fit with our charter.
