Hmmm... I assumed (unwisely, perhaps) that was a typo in the spec.  (If the 
paragraph is taken in its entirety, that possibility seems more plausible.)

[[[
(P196) The formal namespace name for the properties and classes defined in
this specification is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#.
When an RDF processor encounters an XML element or attribute name
that is declared to be from a namespace whose name begins with
the string "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" and the
processor does not recognize the semantics of that name then the
processor is required to skip (i.e., generate no tuples for) the entire
XML element, including its content, whose name is unrecognized or that has 
an attribute whose name is unrecognized.
