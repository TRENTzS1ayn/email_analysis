Ahh - that explains something in his emails that I missed the significance 
of.  I think he perceives the namespace quoted in para 192 as a simple 
error.  He believes that the intent is that it should read:

   http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

I just checked the errata and no correction is there.

Is there a proposal covering this?
