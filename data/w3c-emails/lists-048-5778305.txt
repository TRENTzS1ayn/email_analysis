I feel Patrick has raised some legimate issues here.

Principally, I understand his message as a vote in the "cannot live with"
category against S; with a coherent explanantion of why: backward
compatibility.

An additional aspect that has come up on WOW is that S is not consistent
with standard XML usage in which strings are implicitly type converted as
necessary e.g.

<record>
  <name>Fred</name>
  <age>40</age>
</record>

I, too, feel much more confortable with P, with some additional typing
mechanism, such as that suggested by Patrick.

I am increasingly concerned about how many changes we feel entitled to make
under our charter. I agree with Patrick that S is explicitly out of scope
according to our current charter. I am concerned that the chair is taking an
increasingly broad view of what changes we may make.

However, I have not strongly objected to S, and continue to not do so, on
the understanding  that we were explicitly permitting our datatyping
discussions to go out of charter. i.e. I believe our intent was to make the
*right* decision on datatyping, and then, if that decision was not one we
could make within our charter we would seek a modification of our charter.

I do not think that S is the right decision, but, apparantly unlike Patrick,
I think I can live with it.
