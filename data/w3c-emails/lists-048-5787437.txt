Folks,

For those of you who have not seen it, Peter Patel-Schneider has posted 
another idea for handling data types to RDF interest.

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Nov/0141.html

I suggest folks take a look at it, and to be inclusive of the community, 
have any follow up discussion on that mailing list.  If someone could 
summarize back to RDFCore that would be helpful.

Brian
