All of my code and all of the code I've seen from other apps
assumes that the object of
<dc:title>abc</dc:title>
is a string of 3 characters. S is completely backwards
compatible with this.

Note that it'sn not the XML parser that type converts "40", but
the application that knows about <age>. The analagous situation
in RDF is: the object of <age> is a string, and the range
of the age property is a numeral, not a number. [this
is the case in S]

You see S as a change? I don't. It's the way I've read
the RDF spec since 1997 or so.
