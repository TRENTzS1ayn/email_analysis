So I feel it was not an error; but was a design choice, allowing a
place (namespace) for future RDF syntax things to belong.  Which has
not been used yet, but can't be since as far as I know, it has not
been implemented in most parsers.  I vaguely remember one of the
original RDF WG members describing this to me at some point.

Nope, but I would propose deleting it because of the reasons I gave:

  * Insufficient correct implementation
  * Insufficient correct use

    ".., I feel we shouldn't keep Para 196 around on the grounds of
    insufficient use and (correct) implementation.  This the first
    attempt at use I've ever seen and I don't remember seeing any
    parser that implemented this."

    -- me, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0611.html

plus the reasons Jeremy gave which including the following:

  * Defines ill-formed documents

    "I would support 'deleting' this paragraph. In particular I feel
    that the new specs should on principle not define the processing
    behaviour for ill-formed documents."

    -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0619.html

which I also support.

Plus on the grounds of general confusion if it was a typo.
