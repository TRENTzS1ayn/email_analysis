The P/P++ proposals are about writing <age>10</age>
and having the value be a number -- the 10th integer --
not a numeral -- the two character string '1' followed by '0'.

In S, all* literals denote strings. The only way to
express a number is ala "the number whose decimal
representation is '10'".

In CC/PP-as-written, the instance data says <age>10</age>
and the schema says
age range integer.

The P/P++ proposal makes sense of CC/PP-as-written-style instances
and schemas (at an unacceptable cost, to me: the
denotation of literals is all mucked up).

To use S, you'd either have to change the CC/PP-style schemas
to say
age range integerNumeral
to match <age>10</age> or
or change the instance to say
<age dt:integer="10"/>.
to match age range integer.

* all except the parseType="Literal" ones, which
denote structured XML thingies, to me; but that's
another issue altogether.
