OK, I mis-read your previous comment (I read "number" for "numeral").

As for the rest... I am not yet convinced that the CC/PP style should be 
dismissed so easily.  I would be very surprised if CC/PP is alone in this 
approach.  (After all, I think it was you who asked us to use the XML 
schema datatypes -- if we'd used the original proposal of ccpp:integer, 
etc., we could have resolved the issue by requiring that type to be a 
numeral string and letting the application interpret that as denoting an 
integer...)

My purpose in saying this is not a game of point-scoring, but to indicate 
that I believe that the usage <age>10</age> to indicate a value that will 
ultimately be interpreted as an integer and described by reference to the 
XML schema integer datatype is one that I think many people will expect, 
and to prohibit such usage would lead to confusion and 
non-interoperability.  Given the extent of support for the S proposal 
--which I'm not (yet) opposing-- I'd like to see more consideration given 
to this issue.
