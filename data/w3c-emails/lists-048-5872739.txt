Hi Folks,

This is the weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  By noon 
uk time Thursday please.

I'm out of the office tomorrow, so haven't given much thought yet to the 
agenda.  I imagine that datatypes will be there along with items we did not 
get through last time.  Jos: I have not forgotten your suggestion.

Brian
