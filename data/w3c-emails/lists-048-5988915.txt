12: Issue #rdfms-rdf-names-use
Propose the WG

  o Resolves that the use of rdf:RDF, rdf:ID, rdf:about,
    rdf:resource, rdf:bagID, rdf:parseType, rdf:aboutEach and rdf:li except
    as reserved names as specified in the grammar is an error.
  o resolves that test case 
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test005.rdf
    be obsoleted
  o resolves that  a copy of that test case be created as an error test case
  o actions DaveB to create test cases for the above cases
  o actions DaveB to identify any similar cases to those above and create
    test cases to cover them also

Discuss use of other names in the RDF namespace with particular reference to:
 
(P196) The formal namespace name for the properties and classes defined
in this specification is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#.
When an RDF processor encounters an XML element or attribute name that
is declared to be from a namespace whose name begins with the string
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" and the processor does not
recognize the semantics of that name then the processor is required
to skip (i.e., generate no tuples for) the entire XML element,
including its content, whose name is unrecognized or that has
an attribute whose name is unrecognized.

13: Issue rdfms-aboutEach
Propose

  o  the WG resolves to remove rdf:aboutEach from the language on the grounds
    - it is not used
    - it is not widely implemented
    - it has confusing interactions with bagID as recorded in
        http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach
    - it prohibits the development of  streaming RDF/XML parsers
    - it requires schema processing in the parser
    - this is the wrong layer in which to implemenent such functionality

  o Action DaveB remove from the grammar in the RDF/XML document

  o Action Brian update the issues list, especially Attention Developers
             


14: Issue: rdfms-assertion
