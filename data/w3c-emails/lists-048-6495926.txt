Ah, that is a nice idea. It has some odd consequences, though. Graphs 
with number labels cannot be stored inside computers, send over 
packet-switched networks, printed, etc... They have to be Platonic 
graphs, not data structures. And why stop at numbers? ;-)

Hmm. That gives us an extra layer of representation, which I find 
clunky. There is the lexicalisation which encodes the 
graph-in-the-machine which represents the abstract graph which 
describes the interpretation....

I am proud to tell you that here in Pensacola, not half a mile from 
my house, is McGuires, the first micro-brewery in the US and still 
the maker of the best Red, Irish Pale Ale and stout you will find 
within 3000 miles.
