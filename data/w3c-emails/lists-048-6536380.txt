The issue

   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-graph

However, I also can recall no formal decision on the set/bag question.  The 
general direction of this thread seems sensible.

I appologies for getting behind on email last week as a result of communication 
difficulties.  Has anyone proposed some test cases.
