In RDF 1.0, there are no integer literals, if that's what you mean.


Exactly what sort of literals there are isn't entirely clear,
but I suggest there are two:

  -- character string literals
   e.g. "abc" which is a sequence of 3 unicode characters
  -- XML content literals
   e.g. the value of <dc:title>a <em>very</em> big dog</dc:title>
   which is (something like) a sequence of infoset items,
   the first two of which are character items, next comes
   an element item whose name is "em", followed by 8 more
   character items.

Quite!
