The model-theoretic semantics for DAML+OIL (March 2001) allows for bare
character strings to have a number of different literal values.  (I also
have a newer version of that basic semantics, which I will post shortly,
that directly addresses RDF and RDF Schema.)

The basic idea is to allow literals to denote any of the literal values
for which they are a lexicalization, as determined by the collection of
datatypes (a la XML Schema).  (Of course a particular interpretation has
to have only one of these possibilities.)  When (and if) type
information is available, this ambiguity is resolved.

One might argue that my scheme is wrong for philosophical reasons, but
it is possible technically.  (At least I think so.)
