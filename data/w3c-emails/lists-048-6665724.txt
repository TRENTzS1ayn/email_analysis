Yes, true. What I meant was, whether we want to allow a graph with 
two identical arcs between the same two nodes as a well-formed graph, 
or if on the other hand we want to say that those two documents 
describe the same graph. Right now there is nothing to rule out such 
a duplicate-arc graph, according to our definitions.
