I guess so, though I feel a bit odd doing this in public.

Ive put up a version at
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/w3-rdf-mt-current-draft.html
which is marked as being the editorial draft, and I will keep that as 
the stable current version. Parts that are marked as needing work, 
notes to myself, etc.. are indicated with @@.  I've added a version 
change log at the end.

BTW, sorry about the delay in getting this finished, I am still 
armwrestling with Peter about how best to handle literals. We want to 
make very sure that the RDF treatment doesn't interfere with the way 
he wants DAML to go, and are still sniffing around looking for 
landmines that would cause him grief. Should be OK soon though.

Also some of the hoo-ha on the email listings have actually been 
quite useful in that they show up ways to misunderstand this stuff 
that I never even thought of. I will add some helpful bits of prose 
to protect against those. Havn't done all this yet, though.

Pat
