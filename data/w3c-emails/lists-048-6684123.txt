Great, and many thanks for checking it. However this example has 
pointed out a bug in the MT document that I hadnt noticed. The 
interpolation lemma uses a slightly different notion of 'instance' 
than the one defined in the text. According to the text definition, 
all the instances of E must have three arcs, so none of them are a 
subgraph of A. I need to introduce a notion of a 'tidy instance', ie 
what you get by instantiating *and then tidying* the graph. I bet 
that is what Euler currently does automatically,  in effect, right?

If its in the language, it ought to be in the model theory; but is it 
going to be in the language?? Not my call. I await instructions.
