not unless they use parseType="integer" or some such.

If you're speaking of DAML+OIL, I don't believe it has
integer literals either.

On the contrary: the RDF model theory should be 100% clear
that RDF 1.0 has no integer literals.

Yes, extensions will have a lot of trouble: RDF 1.0 software
doesn't grok integer literals. I see no reason to hide this fact.

I disagree; I think it's important to be clear about what RDF 1.0
is and what it isn't, and the sooner the better. Perhaps it's
time to design RDF 1.x or RDF 2.0 that doesn't have these limitations.
But we can't do that (inside a W3C WG) until we're done with
RDF 1.0.
