Why indeed. The second half to my thinking is "what to do about it"...

_All_ RDF implementations must represent the graph somehow, yes, and
that usually means an extra layer of representation. I'm not convinced
that this distinction needs to be made apparent in a MT though.

In practice: literals are stored in a computer using some
representation, together with a description of the "type" of literal so
represented.

So that gives us the potential problem, of course, as to determining
which literal types (of a potentially open-ended collection) RDF
implementations should support. I'd say that, at a bare minimum, unicode
strings and langstrings ought to be understood. A nice next step might
be (and I'm not suggesting we adopt this in the WG) the datatypes of
XSD.

Then RDF implementations could offer "best-effort" support for
unrecognised literal types by recording the type indicator of the
literal (as a URI?) together with its lexical representation, and
offering a dumbed-down equality check.

Incoherently yours,
