This issue:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-identity-anon-resources

contains the following questions:

[[

[1.] Should anonymous resources have URI's? 

[2.] If so, should the be clearly distinguishable as parser generated URI's? 

[3.] Should there be a standard algorithm for generating URI's which ensures 
 that different parsers generate the same URI's from the same source 
 input document? 

[4.] How might these automatically generated URI's be affected by changes 
 in the source document? 
]]

It appears questions #3 and #4 above are not explicitly addressed in
the proposed resolution.  I'd like to see the resolution address #3; I'm
indifferent about whether #4 should be addressed in the resolution.

If we're going down the wordsmithing path, I think I'd avoid 
talking about "normal" usage of bNodes; otherwise, it seems like
ab-normal would also need to be defined.  I probably remove the
NOTE part.

It also seems like some test cases that shows how an "un-named
resource" in RDF/XML gets mapped into a bNode (and NOT a URI)
in N-Triples would be useful.  I created some test cases and 
placed them in:
