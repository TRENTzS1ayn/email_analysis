Art,

OK, I'll re-post the with the addition of explicit answers to those points.

OK, I've made that more explicit -- see separate message

This isn't verbatim text for the new document, so I don't think it 
harms.  Meanwhile, I think it's worth having some record of our 
considerations in getting to this point.

Yes, that's helpful, thanks -- I'm checking them:
   Test001 -- OK
   Test002 -- OK
   Test003 -- OK
   Test004 -- OK
   Test005 -- OK (but I don't see that it's materially different from 
Test003 for the purposes of this issue)
