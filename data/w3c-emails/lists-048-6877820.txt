Concerning xml:lang, I agree that would be cleaner.

Concerning parseType="Literal", I think there's still a difficulty:

<rdf:RDF ...>
   <eg:Node>
     <eg:literalProperty parseType="Literal">
       <eg:NotANode>
         <eg:notAProperty>some text</eg:notAProperty>
       <eg:NotANode>
     </eg:literalProperty>
   </eg:Node>
</rdf:RDF

How would this be expressed in absence of parseType="Literal"?
