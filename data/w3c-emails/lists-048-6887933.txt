Having seen some of the confusion that has arisen, I'm sort-of inclined to

... but I think we should not forget that the graph approach was introduced 
to avoid the bNode scoping issue.  If bNodes are used, then their scope 
needs to be clearly stated, and I think that some (probably awkward) text 
will be needed to explain what happens when two separate documents that 
happen to use the same bNode names are combined and/or asserted simultaneously.
