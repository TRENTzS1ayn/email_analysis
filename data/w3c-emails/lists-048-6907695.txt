Jeremy, Aaron, Ron, DanBri, and everybody,

The test data that Art collected...

  Test cases for parseType="Literal"
  Art Barstow (Mon, Oct 08 2001) 
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0095.html

shows that RDF implementations are pretty much all
over the map on this literal stuff.

That suggests, to me, that we should chuck it, like
we did aboutEachPrefix... but only if nobody's using it.

So... is anybody using it? At the ftf meeting

 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20010801-f2f/

you guys told us a little bit about how folks are
using RDF... would you please collect some uses cases/test cases
that show how folks expect to use parsetype="Literal"?

Then I think we can decide, as a WG, what the n-triples
form should be (or whatever measure of interoperability
we choose...).

I suppose, in addition to the tests art came up with,
there's an example in the RDF spec:

Jeremy, as owner of #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure, I'd like
you to show what the n-triples form of that document should be.

I've got a proposal, involving exploding it out as infoset
properties... I think I'll work out the details and put
the results on the table.
