I uploaded test00{1-5}.rdf to:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/

These test cases do not have an associated N-Triples file.

I uploaded error00{1-3}.rdf to a different directory since these
test cases test mis-spellings of the parseType attribute and are
not related to the above issue:
