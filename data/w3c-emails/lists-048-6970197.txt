Right, that is what I had in mind. However, Peter wants a slightly 
different notion, in which the interpretation *does* determine (or at 
any rate *can* determine) the literal mappings. This seems to amount 
to treating literals rather like bNodes with a kind of potential 
datatype constraint on them (that can be inferred from rdfs:range 
assertions in the graph, in Peter's scheme: see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001OctDec/0057.html 
). I have to say, I don't like this myself. But maybe I will have to 
just shut up and go along with the crowd.

Maybe. Actually I'm not sure how to parse that example. Is that two 
triples or four triples?
