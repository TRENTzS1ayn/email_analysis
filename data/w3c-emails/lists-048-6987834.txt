Ah, sorry, I was using N3.  [...] encloses properties applied to a 
bNode.  "a" in property position is shorthand for rdf:type.

Let me expand the above to simple triples:

_:a rdf:type Shoe .
_:a decimalSize _:b .
_:a sizeLabel _:c .
_:b rdf:type type:Integer .
_:b rdf:value "10" .
_:c rdf:type type:String .
_:c rdf:value "10" .
