I think this should be called "Literals have URIs" as it is 
plainly clear that literals are resources.

This is true now to some extent since bNodes can be literals 
(since literals are resources) and bNodes can be the subject of 
a triple. But to simplify things we could just allow:

"foo" <...bar> <...baz> .

Surely, we've given up on that by now as plain things like:

<foo> <bar!*@&> <baz> .

and

<foo> <bar> _:a .
<baz> <bar> _:a .

aren't representable in RDF/XML but it seems silly to disallow 
them from RDF.
