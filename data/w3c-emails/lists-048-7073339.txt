Graham is right as to why we went to graphs.  However, I don't think 
anything *really* allows us to avoid dealing with the scoping issue; 
it's just that how things ought to work seems more intuitive with empty 
nodes.  But we still ought to say what we need to say, and if we do it, 
I suspect pretty much the same text would explain bNodes.
