WRT 2001-09-28#9 - my proposal for obsoleting test cases (TC) is: 

 o leave the test case's file(s) in place (do not remove)

 o add a comment to the TC that clearly states 1. the TC has been 
  obsoleted and 2. the reason the TC was obsoleted

 o when a zip of the repo is created do NOT include obsolete TCs

 o never re-use a TC name/URI that has been obsoleted

 o note in the WD that there may be gaps in test case numbering
  because of test case obsoleting

WRT general maintenance of the repo I propose the following:

 o Currently, the TC WD contains a list of the directories but
  not a list of the individual test cases:

   [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#tc_cert 

  The current 2-column table in [1] will be changed to 3-columns:
  
   1. URI of the related issue
   2. URI of the test case
   3. Status: e.g. Approved, Not Approved, etc.  For Approved test
    cases, include the URI to the meeting minutes where the test
    case was approved by the WG.

  Each test case will be in the table.  The Not-Approved table
  will no longer be needed and will be removed from the WD:

   [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#tc_no_cert

 o When a new WD is published, a dated version of a zip will be 
  created, just like what was done for the first WD:

    [3] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/RDF-Test-Cases-2001-09-12.zip

  A dated zip file will only contain TCs Approved by the WG.

 o Create a zip file (named latest.zip) at the top of the repo.  This 
  zip will be updated as new TCs are added.  This zip may include
  TCs that have not yet been approved by the WG.
