(Largely in agreement).


The manifest file makes a lot of difference to this ...

The manifest file should show the approved test cases only.

Personally I would find latest.zip more useful if it did not include
unapproved TCs.

There is a maintenance issue here - is it realistic to update latest.zip on
every change.


As a test case user I would like to have a single URL that I go to to check
conformance with the latest WG decisions. Obviously that can link to other
URLs. Also a time lag is acceptable.
