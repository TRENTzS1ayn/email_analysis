I created several test cases for this issue and announced them 
yesterday:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0141.html

However, it seems like Agenda 12 for tomorrow's teleconf:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0173.html
 12: Issue: Identity of anonymous resources
 PROPOSE the WG RESOLVE

should have included a link to the tests:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-identity-anon-resources/

and asked the WG members to be prepared to comment on these test
cases as part of the decision to RESLOVE or not.
