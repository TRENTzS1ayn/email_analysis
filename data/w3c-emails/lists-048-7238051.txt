Speaking of the manifest stuff, it was on the Sep 28 agenda:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0409.html
 12: Discuss Test Manifest Strawman

but it was never discussed and the minutes from that meeting:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0005.html

says:
[[
 Discussion of moving test cases postponed since Jan Grant absent,
 awaiting proposal on manifest for test cases.
]]

However, it's not on the agenda for the Oct 12 meeting:

Jan, Brian - what's up?

I think it would be fine to have two zip's: latest_All.zip (everthing
including those TCs not approved] and latest_Approved.zip (only
Approved TCs).

I don't think it's necessary to update the zip upon *every* change
especially given the current rate of new test cases or the rate of
approval.  A couple of times/week should be fine (perhaps automated 
if I can determine how to run cron over AFS).

I'm not following you here ...
