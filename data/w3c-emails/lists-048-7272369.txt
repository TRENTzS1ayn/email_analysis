Officially, I find that regrettable... Infoset is due to become
The Officially Recommended data model for XML any day now...

Meanwhile, I think you've got a point. The XML DSig folks,
when shopping for a data model, picked XPath too. The XML Query
folks are closely collaborating with the XPath data model folks;
they maintain some level of compatibility with the infoset,
but only as an appendix.

I'm leaning more and more toward postponing it. I really
would like to take the idea of an RDF schema for the XML
infoset, tweak it to be more like XPath, and use that
as the official model behind parseType="Literal".

I've done some noodling on a schema for modelling XML in RDF in...

  http://www.w3.org/2001/03swell/xml.n3

I'd like to do more work on that, as par of our obligation to...

  "... provide an account of the relationships between the basic
  components of RDF (Model, Syntax, Schema) and the larger XML
  family of recommendations."

That and datatyping... but not until after we're done
with the RDF 1.0-clarification stuff.
