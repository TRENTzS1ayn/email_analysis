You could rephrase that as "the guy whose memory span is now too 
short to remember all his undergraduate math.."

Well, I'm happy to go along with the more liberal labelling rules, to 
be sure. These restrictions only make life more complicated by the 
need to avoid exceptional cases in the model theory, closure rules, 
etc.. (One of the reasons why I laid out all those conditions on N 
and E labels was to make it easy to erase them one at a time :-)

But this abstract syntax is really just N-triples, and I prefer to 
keep the graph as a separate entity.

Yes, it CAN be done that way. I think its uglier, and also it is kind 
of cheating, since right now we don't have anything in RDF syntax 
(not even in Ntriples) to specify the 'document' boundary. And 
remember how much trouble we had with this at the F2F?

I agree.

Oh, come on, all you need to do is assign a bNode name to each blank 
node, and it's done. Could it be simpler?

PS> I would only put this style of definition in an appendix 
somewhere, just to keep the mathematicians happy. 99.9 % of the 
people who read the spec will be perfectly happy with the single word 
'graph'.

BTW, Seth Russell pointed out that some people take 'multigraph' to 
exclude loops, so its really a 'pseudograph'. I think I will just 
avoid ALL mathematical jargon.
