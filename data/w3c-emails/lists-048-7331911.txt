Jan gave regrets for this week too.

Ideally in my ARP test package I would have a single well-known URL
(e.g. the manifest file) that I go to. If everything works from there
with no other hard coded w3c URLs then that's real cool.
From a time point of view, publications delays are inevitable, and a
couple of weeks is really no worse than a couple of hours.
