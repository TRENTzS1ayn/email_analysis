Attention Primer subgroup... what's the status on the other assignments?

[[
An elevator speech (1, 3, 5 min explanations) was agreed to be of use for 
the first category of people. Ora and Eric agreed to start working on this. 
Due to the fact that both are traveling next week, they agreed to have 
something available two weeks from the meeting date.

[[
?       Basic Data Model: Frank and Pat agreed to start working on the 
Basic Data Model
?       Reification: Bill will work on this as he's spent a lot of time in 
the past thinking/explaining this part of the spec
?       Typing System: Ora will take a crack at the Typing System section
?       Light Weight Ontology: Sean agrees to work on this section
?       Layered Examples (aka 'roll your own'): Frank will take a crack at 
how you layer DAML (and/or presumably other languages) on RDF (i.e., how 
you get from RDF to languages like DAML).
