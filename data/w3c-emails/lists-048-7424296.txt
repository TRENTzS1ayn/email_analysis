I have an action to update our schedule.

At the F2F in August, we decided to aim for making an announcement, preferably 
going to REC, at WWW2002.  I am assuming that our documents will have to go 
through the full process.

I've been looking at the W3C process document to see what schedule would enable 
us to do this.  It looks to me that we would need to issue last call WD's at the 
beginning of 2002.  This would lead to a schedule which looks like the following:

02 Jan 2002  Last call announcement

01 Feb 2002  Candidate Rec

02 Apr 2002  Proposed Rec

    May 2002  Rec

Eric, Dan and others with experience of this process, does this look feasible?

This means we would need to have the last call WD's ready by the end of this year.

We currently have the following documents in progress:

   RDF/XML syntax   normative
   Model Theory     normative
   RDF Schema       normative
   Primer           non-normative?

Are we comfortable with this set of documents?  (We also have to cover our 
charter commitment to explain the relationship between RDF and other XML standards.)

Please could the document editors let me know whether they think the schedle is 
feasible for their document, and let me have a proposed schedule of WD's leading 
up to a last call WD.

Brian
