Well, it's easy in Ntriples, and you can't do it in RDF/XML. What 
more do you want? If you are working in RDF/XML, then you will never 
ever come across such a graph in any case, right?

Actually I'm still not completely convinced that it really is 
impossible to say this in XML.  But I need to focus on the MT for a 
while.
