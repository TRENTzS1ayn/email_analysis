Point taken.  How about this?

[1.] Should anonymous resources have URI's?
  -- No (point 1 above).  However, in order to refer to bNodes in 
N-triples, the bNodes  are assigned local names, of the form '_:name' 
(point 2 above).  These names are not URIs, and their scope is the 
N-triples document in which they appear.

It also might be worthwhile, in order to nail this point down, to change 
point 2 from starting "To reflect un-named descriptions in N-triples" to 
"To refer to bNodes in N-triples".

Graham's point 1 starts off talking about "Resources that are described but not 

named in an XML serialization", so I had assumed that the parser in question was
an XML parser.  Also, as you say, any "parser" reading a graph and generating
N-triples would also need to generate bNode names.  I think one of the things
we need to keep in mind in constructing this (and some other) text is that 
people who had issues with the M&S don't necessarily have this "graph is
central" point of view that we've adopted;  they may very well think 

(encouraged by various statements in previous writings about RDF) that 
the XML syntax is what's central, and the graph is just an expository 
mechanism.   We're going to have to make sure we get the "graph is 
central" idea across.
