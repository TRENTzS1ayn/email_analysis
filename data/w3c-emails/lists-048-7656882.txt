Yes, this merits some discussion...

Compatibility is only valuable if there's something out there
to be compatible with. Note that our charter is rather carefully
worded to put a value on compatibility with *existing RDF
applications*, not just words in the spec:

  "Backwards compatibility with existing RDF applications is a
  priority for the RDF Core Working Group."

In the case of parseType="Literal", the spec is sloppy,
and the implementations don't agree, so I'm looking for
some sense of what this construct is supposed to do for
the users. If they don't know, then it's not worth keeping.

Yes, well-formed is a misnomer. "XML content" or,
to borrow from the XML fragment interchange spec,
"well-balanced XML content" would be better.

No, I think the tests are fine; the spec is just sloppy.
