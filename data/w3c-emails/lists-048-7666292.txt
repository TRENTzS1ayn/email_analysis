You'll have to do better than this. XML well formedness is one of the
few areas surrounding literals where the M&S is neither sloppy nor
ambiguous. The refactoring syntax draft also insists upon well
formedness; it's not sloppy on this point either. Please don't assume
that the tests and specifications can stand in isolation. As things are
I can code two different behaviours against the body of work. That
wastes everyone's time, hurts interop, slows adoption; it's hardly
smart.

Think the spec is wrong? Then propose to kill the well formedness
constraint in view of implementation feedback. The best place to exact
that change is in the refactoring syntax draft, you'll find text to that
effect below. 

Think the tests are wrong? Then propose to change the tests to reflect
the M&S and the refactoring syntax draft. You'll find text to that
effect below.

Bill


Proposal: 

remove the well formedness constraint from to allow certain rdf tests to
stand. Please be aware that this change allows XML literal fragments to
be non-well formed.

Old text: Section 3.1

"6.34 literal any well-formed XML "

new text:

"6.34 literal any XML"



Old text: section 4.20

"4.20 Production literal (was 6.34 literal)
Any non-empty well-formed XML."

New text:

"4.20 Production literal (was 6.34 literal)
Any non-empty XML."


Proposal:

Change the rdf literal tests and errors to be consistent with both the
M&S and the refactoring syntax draft. Add a surrounding element pair
<em></em> to each free text literal element content. Add another error
file without a surrounding element pair and indicate that this should
not generate a triple.
