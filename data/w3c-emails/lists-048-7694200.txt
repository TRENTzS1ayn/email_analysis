Right, that could well be the intention of the spec. And that would be
nice because as you say below we're clarifying not changing.
Unfortunately 'well formed XML' sounds to me closer to 'Well Formed XML
Document' than 'Well-Formed Parsed Entities', but I choose to ignore
that in favour of a sensible reading.

+1; since no-one else implemented the document interpretation, it should
go.

Unless. and I'm backing things up, binning parseType is still option in
this iteration :)
