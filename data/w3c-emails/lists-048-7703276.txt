I'd like for this document (or another document that specifies 
the RDF abstract syntax) to include the N-Triples definition. I 
don't see the Test Cases WD on your list.

Are we also counting on the MT to define containers, reification, etc.?

I'd like to make sure our RDF Schema spec is short, sweet and 
easily replaceable by the specification released by the WebOnt 
WG. I think the best of doing this is split out the RDF 
Schema-specific portions of the into a separate draft. As Dan 
Connolly noted, this covers most of RDF Schema. We probably need 
to add some simple definitions of other the RDF Schema terms 
like label and comment.

Last time we discussed this I laid out my preferred draft structure:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0243.html

I think most of it still applies.
