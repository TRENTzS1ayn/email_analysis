It's a shame we have no WebOnt WG to ask about this but if "A 
Web ontology language, that builds on current Web 
languages [...] (such as RDFS)" isn't an upgraded schema 
language then I don't know what it is.

I've not been able to get a clear definition of what 
distinguishes a schema language from an ontology language and 
all signs indicate that their the same thing. If this is true, 
I'd like not to confuse RDF users further by having to make them 
jump back and forth between the WebOnt, RDFS and DAML specs to 
get their jobs done. I'd like to have one document that explains 
it all.
