Dan--

In one sense I agree with you:  if we're going to worry about text, we 
ought to be clear what the point of that worrying is (and in fact, as 
noted in the IRC Chat Log, I cited your earlier point to roughly this 
effect during the discussion).  On the other hand, Brian said that the 
text would be cited from the issues list as the resolution of the issue, 
and he's right.  Now technically that's not a spec, and I suppose we can 
continue to refer people to the Model Theory, but I think lots of people 
might understand Graham's text and might not understand the MT (or at 
least not as easily).  In any event, none of this has anything to do 
with breaking the original consensus, as far as I can see.

I suspect we're going to have to say these things in several different 
ways in order to get the points across.  As long as all these ways are 
consistent (and we certainly need to make sure of that), and (taking 
your point again) we don't spend an excessive amount of time doing it, 
that's a good thing, it seems to me.  For instance, I'm writing part of 
the Primer, and Graham's text (suitably modified), would be a nice 
addition there, I think.  So getting WG review of that text (which they 
would have to do anyway) was helpful.  (By the way, do you think the 
Model Theory, and possibly the Primer, are the only official specs in 
which we're going to have to discuss things like anon resources?  That's 
still not clear to me).
