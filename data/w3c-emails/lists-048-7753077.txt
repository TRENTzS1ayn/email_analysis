Attached is a draft data model section.  (Thanks to Aaron for part of 
the URI discussion).  As you will see, there are some questions about 
how much should be covered in here, and how fast the material should go 
(i.e., you may think it takes an awfully long time to cover an awfully 
few number of ideas).  Anyway, I'd appreciate comments on this sort of 
stuff (and anything else, of course).

Also, I apologize for no relative links to the diagrams, and other messy 
details like that.  Having (relatively) recently changed to a Windows 
environment (and Netscape 6.1), all my old familiar tools are gone, and 
have yet to be replaced [any suggestions?], so I had to use Word to 
produce the images (yuk!), and Netscape Composer (which is still doing 
funny things).
