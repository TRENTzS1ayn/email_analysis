Nice work on this piece, some comments:

You seem to imply that the character string "John Smith" wrote 
this web page. As DanC pointed out: "I don't think a 10 
character string created a web page."

Also, you continually use "the" in your RDF statement examples. 
Since little-to-nothing is definitive on the Semantic Web, 
perhaps "a" would be more appropriate as in, "John Smith is a 
creator of http://www.foobar.org/index.html".

As the term predicate seems to confuse a lot of people, perhaps 
"verb" or "property" might be better.

Can we use a URI for a property, since literal properties aren't 
allowed in RDF 1.0. Even better, can we use N-Triples syntax for 
these statements. You correct this later, but I think it'd be 
better to keep things correct from the beginning.

You might also want to replace foobar.org with example.org.
