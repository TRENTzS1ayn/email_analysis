Forgive me answering this a week late (telecom italia problems last
week), but this isn't as dire as you might think.

The "platonic"/conceptual graphs are as distant from computer
realisations as, say, the relational model is from your RDBMS of choice.
You've _never_ inserted the number 12 into a relational table - except
conceptually*. But such a mental leap is trivial to make.
