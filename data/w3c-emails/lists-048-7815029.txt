It has always been the case that RDF/XML could not express what was
in the (existing) data model.  Even moreso now.  I will try to ensure
such words appear in the XML syntax document.

Nope - this is not a requirement, and indeed would likely need a
change or an extension to the existing syntax, which IMHO takes it
beyond this WG's charter.  A future XML syntax should have the
requirement to be able to express all (more?) models that the MT can
describe.
