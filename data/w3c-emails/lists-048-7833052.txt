To: RDF core WG<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>

With respect to the "anon-resources" issue and telecon discussion, I'd like 
to stand back from the words.

At the F2F in Sebastopol, I thought it was clearly stated by members of the 
original RDF WG that the *intent* of <rdf:Description ...> without 
'rdf:id=...' or 'rdf:about=...' was to assert the existence of a resource 
with given properties without identifying the resource.

The discussion help then and subsequently seemed, to me, to indicate that 
the current group felt that this is a reasonable requirement and 
interpretation.

(This discussion included some analysis of different options, led by 
Sergey, using a subset of FOL to analyze the consequences of this and other 
interpretations.  I think there was also some exploration of use-cases, 
though I don't now recall the details.)

My text was an attempt to reflect this, but it seems to me that before 
debating my text we need to agree on the general thrust and intent here.  I 
think that was questioned in last Friday's  telecon, so needs to be reviewed.
