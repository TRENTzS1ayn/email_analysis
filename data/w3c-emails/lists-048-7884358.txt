12: Issue: Identity of anonymous resources
The WG did not agree the text in the agenda.

Ron disagreed with there being no URI for anonymous nodes.
Ron had not noticed the decision that bNodes are existentially quanitified.
Frank Manola wanted to question the specific wording.

Frank asked what the text was for (i.e. which document would it go in).
Brian responded that the text was for the issue list.

There was general animated discussion that was curtailed by an unhappy
chair.
The chair argued that consensus on this issue had been reached at the
face-to-face.
The chair was unhappy with late objections.

The chair requests the naysayers to make a substantive case as to what is
wrong with the emerging consensus.

There was an attempt at a vote on the issue. This attempt was aborted since
there was a need for separating quibbles with the wording from substantive
disagreement.

ACTION 2001-10-12#4:  Graham
    Bring identity of anonymous resourcese back to the table for next week.

Graham noted that this involves formulating a simple votable question.

ACTION 2001-10-12#5:  Frank M.
    Respond to Graham's text, see agenda 2001-10-12, item 12.


13: Syntax Sub-group Report

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0119.html

The quick summary was:
   The syntax subgroup likes Relax NG
   Jeremy is working on a transform approach to triples.
   The syntax subgroup has identified the syntactic issues in the issue
list.

Jos asked whether the Syntax subgroup was using XSLT. This question was left
open.


14: Issue rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes:  Review Progress

Sergey reported that e-mail discussion is on-going.
Pat noted that his discussions with Peter Patel-Schneider were progressing
positively.

Sergey preferred to postpone further teleconference discussion of this issue
while the e-mail discussion advanced.

ACTION 2001-10-12#6:  Jos
  Send interpretation properties URL to e-mail list.

ACTION 2001-10-12#7:  Sergey
  Summarise rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes issue for next week's telecon


AOB: 15: parseType="Literal"

  Dan C had suggested in e-mail that this be dropped.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0151.html
  Ron and Dave opposed this.

  There was no support in the teleconference for dropping
parseType="Literal".

  Ron presented three use cases:
  A: In PRISM a particularly editorial style uses XHTML <I> elements within
RDF values e.g.
    <ns:title rdf:parseType="Literal"><i>CRN</i> Interviews: Tom
Cruise</ns:title>

  B: Including XHTML paragraph breaks in RDF values.

  C: For i18n, there is a need for XML markup for bidi and Ruby amongst
other things.

  There was extended discussion that continued after the close of the
meeting.
  Issues included discussion of how namespaces figure with literals, and
whether an RDF Literal is marked as to whether it came from an
rdf:parseType="Literal" production.


The meeting closed without singing the Golden Triples.
