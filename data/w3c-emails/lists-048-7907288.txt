IANA ontologist, but...

An ontology is a catalog of types of things and their relations. A
schema is a catalog of types and their relations. I tend to imagine
ontologies layered over schemas, but that layering isn't always clean.
So you'd use a schema to catalog abstract types (XML Schema) and an
ontology to catalog actual things (Daml Art). People seem to use the
terms interchangeably, or at least call some ontologies schemas.

regards,
Bill
