I would like to propose that the N-Triples format be changed to allow
Unicode string literals in UTF-8, not just US-ASCII with escaping. (in fact
I would like the \uxxxxx unicode escapes to be dropped from the N-Triples
format).

The motivation is two-fold:

+ in an internationalization context in any non-English language to have to
use a clunky non-standard escaping mechanism is unpleasant and unnecessary.

+ An XSLT RDF/XML => N-triple program cannot access the character codes
required by the current N-Triples syntax.

while the same arguments hold for the URI's there is the strong
counter-argument that the label in the graph is the URI (in US ASCII!) and
not an internationalizaed variant, whereas the label in the graph is the
unicode string (not the US ASCII escaped sequence).
