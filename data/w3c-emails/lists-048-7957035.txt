Firstly, rdf:parseType="Literal" is staying in this RDF/XML syntax.

I see this as an editorial change and I am going to do this.

Firstly, I'm likely to merge the empty/non-empty cases and remove
"non-empty".

Secondly, what is allowed (implicitly) is anything that is legal for
the content of an XML element, according to the XML rules, rather
than just well-formed.  I will replace the 4.20 words with something
like that.

The reference Dan pointed out (in the elided bit of the quote above)
in XML section 4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities looks like something
worth referencing:

  An internal general parsed entity is well-formed if its replacement
  text matches the production labeled content.

  [...] 

  [43]   content  ::= CharData? ((element | Reference | CDSect
                            | PI | Comment) CharData?)*

Editors draft is at

I haven't yet merged this in; been working on updating the N-Triples
section of http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/
