A sentence like yours above (but of course more normative) should be
included in the spec somewhere. After all, people want (and will try) to
exchange arbitrary graphs. Do you think it is off charter to include a
new attribute like "localID" in the RDF/XML syntax to make it as
powerful as the underlying graph model?
