Dave, would you please add such a note to the syntax spec?
I think PatH said he'd say something to that effect in the
model theory document. Hmm.. suggested wording...

Note that not all RDF graphs can be serialized
in RDF's XML syntax. For example, graphs with
cycles composed of bNodes[sic], or property
names that don't end in XML name characters.


Maybe there's already one in the syntax draft?
I don't see it in
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/
as of this writing (I'd cite by CVS $Date$ or HTTP
last modified, but I can't find either of those).

It seems most closely related to this issue...
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-syntax-incomplete

Odd. that's not in our enumeration of syntax issues...

Maybe it's too new?

Hmm... the syntax spec doesn't seem to discuss serializing
graphs at all... only parsing them. Dave, have you thought
about a section to explain serializing? Seems quite useful
for implementors... and even users: "don't expect your RDF
to get serialized exactly the way it was parsed; expect
the meaning to be the same, but not the syntactic details."

Yes, I'm afraid it is unreasonable to add such a syntax feature
and call it a clarification of RDF 1.0.

It's a great idea to go along with rdf:resourceQ or whatever,
i.e. an attribute just like rdf:resource and rdf:about except
that it uses QNames.
