See Peter's suggestion, by using rdfs:range, for example. Or, if 
literals could be subjects, by using rdf:type directly.

First way:

aaa integerproperty "200110"
integerproperty rdfs:range xsd:integer

second way (using Ntriples++)

aaa someproperty _:node1:"200110"
_:node1 rdf:type xsd:integer

Right, exactly. See 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0263.html

If you didn't need to distinguish them, you don't need to do this, 
but it would be an option.
