I'll get you next time. :-)

Meanwhile, I'd like to request that for the meeting, 
rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about is put on the agenda. I'd 
like the Working Group to agree to the proposed resolution and 
test cases at:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-
tests/rdfcore/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/

The key part of which is:

"""
Usage of an rdf:ID attribute to identify the subject of a 
description, is equivalent to usage of an rdf:about attribute 
with the the '#' character followed by the URI-encoded form of 
the content rdf:ID attribute.
"""

Please try to send me comments on this before the meeting so I 
can make the necessary changes.

Thanks,
