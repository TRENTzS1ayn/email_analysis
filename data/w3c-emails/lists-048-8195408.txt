Something else. It is supposed to be the following graph, which I 
will try to draw in ASCII-art: (please view in fixedwidthfont)

aaa----someproperty----->"2001100"
                             |
                             -----rdf:type--->xsd:integer

this requires a literal to be a subject, of course, but why not? 
Literals are real things, so why not let them have real property 
values?

Of course if we had an 'inverse' of rdf:type then you could draw the 
second arc the other way around, as I think Graham suggested a while 
back. But you would still need to be able to label a nonblank node in 
the Ntriples form.
