Nope. Oh, well, wait a minute. I guess Im not quite sure what exactly 
a parser for Ntriples is supposed to be doing. If it is constructing 
a graph then it doesnt need to generate anything. If however one is 
using the Ntriples as a primary notation to support inference, then 
yes, it will have to take some care to standardize nodeIDs apart from 
any nodeIDs from *other* documents. But strictly speaking it isn't 
*necessary* to generate new names to do this; renaming is just one 
technique for avoiding name clashes.

That's internal to the graph representation code, though, not part of the RDF.
