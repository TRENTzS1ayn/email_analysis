I've added CVS $Revision:$

I've added this issue as a clear syntax one and put these words in:

   Not all RDF graphs can be serialized in RDF's XML syntax. For
   example, graphs with cycles composed of nodes with no URIs (blank
   nodes in the graph), or property names that don't end in XML name
   characters.  This is a known limitation of this syntax that can
   only be fully addressed by changes to it or a totally new syntax.

This is in CVS version 1.57 onwards

I had thought about it; I've put a section with notes to remind me
See 
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Serialising

in CVS version 1.58 or later

I agree, in a future syntax, not a reworking of 1.0.
