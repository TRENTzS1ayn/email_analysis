My comments for the proposed solution were posted in:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0029.html

This of course led to a fairly long discussion about duplicate 
triples - a discussion for which I'm not sure we've reached consensus.

Brian/Pat - were does the WG stand on duplicate triples?

Jeremy's comments on these TCs were posted in:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0054.html

When I first read test2.rdf:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.rdf

I came to the same conclusion that Jeremy did (this is not related
to the issue).  However, since this test case doesn't explictly state 
what is being testing, perhaps there is something specific to the 
issue that is being tested.  Aaron - any comments here?

Anyhow, I have no problem with moving test2 to some kind of i18n TC
bucket.
