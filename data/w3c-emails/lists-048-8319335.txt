yes, would.

It's not a very attractive alternative: you lose the benefit
of being able to check the content for well-formedness
along with the rest of the RDF. And the user/author has
to make up some other flag to show that it's not just
a string that happens to look like XML content, but
really is to be parsed as XML content.

I've heard enough from the users (PRISM, dublin core,
RSS) that it's clear we owe them a specification of how
parseType="Literal" works.
