BC = "Backwards compatibility"?

How would parseType="rdf:Literal" differ from parseType="Literal"?

We should probably warn people that in the future the number of values
of the parseType attribute will increase, and those values will
probably move to QNames. However, I don't think we need to actually
define a bunch of QNames now.

Dan C. was not on the call.

Probably safest not to expect anything more on this unless the
group discusses it and people want to pick it up.
