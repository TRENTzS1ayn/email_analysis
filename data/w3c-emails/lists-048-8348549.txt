The MT can handle them if people want to allow them. They are 
'transparent', ie duplicating a triple makes no difference to the 
meaning. (If we allow duplicates then some of the lemmas on inference 
will need to be very slightly re-worded to make sure all copies of 
triple are treated the same. )

I have the general impression that allowing duplicates is considered 
to be more of an implementation problem than not allowing them, so I 
would be mildly in favor of not allowing them. Then a graph can be 
identified with a set of triples.
