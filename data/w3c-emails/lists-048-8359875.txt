I hate to say it, but I'd take the opposite view: this seems clunky and
ugly.

I'd say this is admirable, however. Whatever we do, we should not shut
the door to doing it right in RDF 2.

A primary goal seems to be doing some kind of datatyping on Literals.
We're all agreed on this (I'd hazard to say) but opinions differ when it
comes to the details. Certainly, if we do it right then a lot of
problems (xml:lang, parseType="Literal") have solutions which arise
naturally from the notion of typed literals.

I much prefer the explicit typing notion (or the "literal instance"
stuff that's also cropped up recently*) to this construct, which seems
to be mired in printnameism.
