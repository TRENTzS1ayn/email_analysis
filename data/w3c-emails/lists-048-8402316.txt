No; because we can consider the typed datum to be the literal, not its
(unicode) representation. These are all distinct wherever we need them
to be, and the "same" for the purposes of tidyness where we need them to
be. If you do this the problem you describe goes away (I think).

This is an interesting point. What I'm suggesting is that there is an
"inherent type" associated with a literal. This is distinct from any
assertions made in a graph. We can go one step beyond a model theory by
talking about categorising which interpretations we consider to be
valid; for instance, we might require that

integer(23) <rdf:type> <xsd:Integer> .

should be ok in all valid interpretations, but

integer(23) <rdf:type> <foo:NegativeInteger> .

should not be. This becomes less of a problem if you adopt the notion of
multiple "literal instances" as was recently suggested.
