If this is a requirement of the MT, do you require RDF/XML 1.0 to
generate such models?

i.e. should
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:ex="http://example.org/properties/">
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/">
      <ex:foo>blah</ex:foo>
      <ex:bar>blah</ex:bar>
    </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>

generate
  <http://example.org/> <http://example.org/properties/foo> _id1:"blah" .
  <http://example.org/> <http://example.org/properties/bar> _id2:"blah" .

rather than
  <http://example.org/> <http://example.org/properties/foo> "blah" .
  <http://example.org/> <http://example.org/properties/bar> "blah" .

?


> 2. Allow literals as subjects. (optional)

I'm assuming this is optional but recommended?

And RDF/XML 1.0 continues to be unable to generate such models; which
we can record in the syntax doc if/when we make this decision.

Thanks; that was the explanation I was looking for.  Should get
people thinking :)

I suggest these two things, especially #1, are substantial and need
discussion and WG consensus.  This could wait till the next
version of the MT working draft is ready for us to review.  Which is
real soon, yeah?
