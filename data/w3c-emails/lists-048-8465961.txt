editorial/structural suggestions:

 * the "3. RDF Core WG Issues affecting RDF/XML Syntax" section
 doesn't seem like part of the specification. I suggest moving
 it to an appendix.

 * on the other hand, the references (at least the normative ones)
 are not appendixes: lopping them off changes what's specified.

I like the "Infoset Notation"; especially the way it's
quite sax-like. Please make the connection to SAX explicit,
at least by saying something like "this notation loosely
follows the structure of the [SAX] API".
