I called it a "predicate" because that's the term used in the M&S.  If
we've changed it officially, I must have missed it (where would this be
documented?).  Mind you, I like "property" better and, if that's the
official term, it simplifies things all around because, as you say, I
can use it from the beginning without any synonyms.  As it was, I felt
that "predicate" needed some lead-in.
