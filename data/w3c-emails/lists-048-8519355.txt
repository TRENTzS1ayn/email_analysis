Ahh, I'd not been following recent syntax threads too carefully. 
Indeed the document[1] reads:

"""
rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about

What is the difference between using and ID attribute to 
'create' a new resource and an about attribute to refer to it?

Action: rdf:ID="attr" is an abbreviation for rdf:about="#attr" 
and the handling of rdf:ID has been[will be] updated to show 
this.
"""

Which is the jist of my proposal.

That was my hope with this.

Do you think the text above (currently in the editor's working 
draft[1]) is enough to qualify for closing the issue?

I don't see a need to keep the issue open after we've agreed on 
the generally worded proposal. After that I think it's more of a 
specific comment on the draft, rather than a discussion of hte 
issue itself.
