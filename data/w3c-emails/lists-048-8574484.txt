Dave's text is currently neutral vis-a-vis internationalized URI's.
Aaron's text takes a URI-ref to be precisely a US-ASCII URI ala RFC
2396.

I owe the group some work on internationalization, but currently am of
the opinion that we should allow internationalized URIs wherever we
allow uri-references; these being resolved into US-ASCII URIs ala RFC
2396 (as modified by RFC 2732) at the same time as relative URI's are
resolved, using the standard algorithm.
