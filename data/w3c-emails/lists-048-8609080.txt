fine, I've updated that one, however without the 2 extra triples
to "define some Classes"
(see point 3.)

Art, the idea was that
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test001.nt
and
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test002.nt
and
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test003.nt
rdfs-entails
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test004.nt

and some evidence for that can be found at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Oct/att-0016/01-etc.n3

and as you can see there is no need to "define some Classes" because
that information can be RDFS entailed

> 4. axioms.n3 - I propose that NO N3 files get approved at this point.

OK :-|

PS the $Id$ in the .rdf files doesn't seem to be evaluated (in the .nt it's ok)
