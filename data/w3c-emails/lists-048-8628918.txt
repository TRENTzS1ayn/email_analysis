Which I wrote just so people could argue / support.  Plus I own this
issue and want to close it.  :)

There has patently been plenty of implementer and WG confusion given
previous long threads discussing this artifact, lack of coherent
implementation and use, so I was proposing a clarification by
removing it, since it can be done another way.

In addition, it is consistent with the recent rdf:ID="attr"
abbreviates rdf:about="#attr" near-decision; since this rdf:ID
doesn't do that, it is an alternative for rdf:resource

The existing grammar says very complex things near
http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#229 but in http://ioctl.org/rdf/ms/rdfms#232
  "r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or
   a new resource. If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier
   of this new resource."

so the following example is illegal in RDF/XML M&S 1.0

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
           xmlns:ex="http://example.org/schema#">
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/r">
     <ex:property rdf:ID="foo" rdf:resource="http://example.org/blah" ex:prop="lit"/>
   </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>

since rdf:ID and rdf:resource are alternatives.

I am not doing any deletion on old text, but constructing a new one.
However, I was proposing not allowing rdf:ID in the new grammar in
this place, to ease the confusion and consistent with the
rdf:ID/rdf:about choice.

The rdf:ID above is on a property that introduces 2 statements (in my
example; can be more with extra property attributes) so can't reify
both.  It could reify one, but this abbreviated form still seems
rather odd.

I'd rather you proposed this as change rather than ask me to justify
why you want it!

Replacing your proposed change

   Action: The grammar has[will be] been modified to forbid the use
   of an rdf:ID attribute when a rdf:resource attribute is also
   possible. This removes an ambiguity of which statement is reified
   but is relatively harmless since the statement can be precisely
   reified using the non-empty version of the property element with
   an <rdf:Description> block

Hmm, I don't like that at all actually.  Maybe:

   Action: The grammar has[will be] been modified to forbid the use
   of an rdf:ID attribute on an empty property element. This is
   consistent with using rdf:ID="attr" as an abbreviation for
   rdf:about="#attr" and removes the suggestion that it reifys a
   statement, which it never did in the original grammar form.
