"This question" being parseTypes - not yet although the warning idea
is probably a good idea and I'll have a go

I don't do any of the #literal-* issues; they are for the model.

At
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-qnames-as-attrib-values
I've got:

   rdfms-qnames-as-attrib-values

    Suggestion that Qnames should be allowed as values for attributes
    such as rdf:about.

    Action: Will not be addressed in the current RDF/XML syntax since
    it would require changes to the syntax that would not be
    backwards compatible. New XML syntaxes will likely include such a
    feature.
