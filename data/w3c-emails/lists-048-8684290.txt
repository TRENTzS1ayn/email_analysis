Update on where I've got to:

Best bits:
+ Worked example of how the rules generate triples

http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/jjc/snail/example/z213.nt.html


+ Snail home page, "Excruciatingly Slow RDF/XML Parsing"

http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/jjc/snail/
  
------------------


The example was computed by snail which is now working;
 download from:

http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/jjc/snail/download.html


there have been some minor changes to the rules which can be found in:

http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/jjc/docs/triples/


====================================

I would appreciate feedback as to:

+ does this approach clarify triple production in RDF/XML?
+ if so, is it suitable for the Syntax WD
+ if so, should the XSLT parts be omitted or retained?
