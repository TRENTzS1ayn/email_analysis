Jeremy and I talked about the resolution of
rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr after chatting about the syntax WD in
general and agree that we both see the two alternatives as

1) rdf:ID is always allowed and reifys the 1 statement
   <parent node URI> <propertyElt URI> <rdf:resource URI> .

2) rdf:ID is never allowed.  If you want to reify that
   statement, use the expanded form rather than this abbreviation.

Jeremy slightly prefers #1 but could live with #2 ("I could 'concur'
with such a position").  I don't really care as long as we pick one
only way, thus I propose #1.

Both of these answers changes what the existing M&S says but it is
something that hardly anyone used/uses.  For the latter reason, I did
suggest deleting it in my original text but I'm happy with #1, #2 above.

I propose to close this issue by making the appropriate change
to the syntax grammar in production
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#emptyPropertyElt

from
    [attributes]=set((idAttr | resourceAttr)?, bagIdAttr?, propertyAttr*)

to
    [attributes]=set(idAttr?, resourceAttr?, bagIdAttr?, propertyAttr*)

[ WAS 4th clause of 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#propertyElt
 
  '<' propName idRefAttr? bagIdAttr? propAttr* '/>'


Plus more words to say what the combinations of these do when I write
the mappings.

Dave
