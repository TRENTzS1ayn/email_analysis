I prefer a pointer.

I think it's great work, but when I looked at it, I found
at least one bug in the relax-ng thingy; I haven't even
found time to report it.

I'm happy to have it copied into our WD only if, say,
three members of this WG are willing to vouch for it;
i.e. to say "yes, I've looked at it and it agrees
with the rest of the spec".

I could live with copying it into the WD only with
a strong disclaimer ala "this may have bugs. We're
pretty sure it does have bugs. But it's nifty, so
we're including it here so folks can help us work
out the bugs." Of course, that's pretty close
to a commitment to address any comments made
on this relax-NG schema. Dave, are you prepared
to address such comments?
