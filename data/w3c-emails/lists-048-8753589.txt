Folks,

I seem to have caused some confusion. I just posted an empty message as
a marker for this section of the primer (think of it as a directory). I
want to scrape out responses and knowing there's an empty message
motivates me to fill it up with good  words. My apologies, it's just the
way I happen to work. Content to follow Real Soon Now. 

regards,
Bill
