It would need more than that.  There are issues with WG decisions to
change, not change, issues not considered.  WG decisions have words.
The action is the action that was beholden on this document in order
to address the issue.  I think all the WG decisions are recorded as
such.  The WG may decide that the actions I give are suitable to
address the issue in which case a "On date, the WG decided
URI-of-action addressed the issue" text could be added.

I'm going to try careful prose and n-triples, see how it goes.  I
suggested to Jeremy to maybe include the snail rules work (non-XSLT
part) in a separate section and ask for implementor feedback.  My
worry is slight disconnect between stream of sax events and the
actual ntriples out, using Jeremys approach.  On the other hand,
gives very precise, complete, coherent answers which my prose may
not, which was the main problem we were addressing with a new syntax
formalism.
