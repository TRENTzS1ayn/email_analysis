Hi Dan,

Something I am not clear on. You said:

I would have thought that the XML Schema was a separate
document, and it is important to let people update the
external schema documents and make new inferences based
on those changes.

Is a more accurate statement of your intent that "the
truth value of statements in an RDF document shall not
change as a result of changes to any external document, unless
that external document has been specified as required for the
correct interpretation of the RDF document"?
