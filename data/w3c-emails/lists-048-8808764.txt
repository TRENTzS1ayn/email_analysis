I think I agree with the thrust here, but I'd like to clarify 
something:  it may be that access to another document will provide more 
detailed information about what is stated in a document (e.g. knowing the 
domain/range of a property from a separate schema may allow one to make 
additional inferences about resources used in an otherwise stand-alone 
document).

The key requirement here seems to be that the interpretation of a document 
in isolation cannot be invalidated when some external document is also 
consulted.  (This seems to be a kind of monotonicity.)

Thus, I think what you are asking is that the truth under any given 
interpretation of some RDF document is invariant;  consulting another 
document may restrict the interpretations that are considered to be models.
