I'm not sure what it means to say "Internally XML documents are in Unicode" 
.. I though the XML was essentially a serialization syntax (for a labelled 
and annotated tree structure).

Yes, I agree this should go in the syntax document.
But I note that RFC 2396 recognizes three different presentations of a URI:
   original character sequence
   octet sequence
   URI character sequence

I think we'd need to be clear which of these is intended, if that's 
important.  For the model theory, I'm not sure that it is important (as 
long as its not a non-UTF-8 octet sequence).
