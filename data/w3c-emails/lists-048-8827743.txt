Pat, you remember the test case given in "interpretation properties" i.e.

  <http://www.w3.org/> <http://example.org/play#xml-cannonicalized> _:bNode1 .
  _:bNode1 <http://example.org/enc#hash-sha-1> _:bNode2 .
  _:bNode2 <http://example.org/enc#base64> "jd8734djr08347jyd4" .

Another testcase is

  <http://example.org/play#poleq1> <http://example.org/play#root> _:bNode1 .
  _:bNode1 <http://example.org/complex-number#real-part> _:bNode2 .
  _:bNode2 <http://example.org/enc#IEEE-754> "3" .
  _:bNode1 <http://example.org/complex-number#imaginary-part> _bNode3 .
  _:bNode3 <http://example.org/enc#IEEE-754> "4" .

So I think one could always *describe* the real/abstract
things and "4" is *not* the floating point number 4 ...
the node with label _:bNode3 is standing for that 4 and
  <http://example.org/enc#IEEE-754> "4"
is a means to that end and not an end in its own :-)

So I still think the "" delimited thing is just a string
and I also don't think there will be a shortage of bNodes :-)

Also the "nesting" capability shown in the first testcase
is an interesting feature, isn't it?

Of course I agree to distinguish between a bnode and its label.
