Dave,

As you requested yesterday I have had a look at some of the issues
remaining unresolved in revision 1.88.

I've had a go at three of them, and attach my proposals.

The issues I address are: 
  #rdfms-abouteach
  #rdfms-reification-required
  #rdfms-nested-bagIDs


I continue to duck xml:base. Personally I would allow it everywhere! 
But I believe that is out of kilter with WG consensus. I certainly feel
that we cannot prohibit it outside RDF content: for example, on an xhtml
document with embedded metadata. In such a case, we should honour it.
Also xml:base is legal within an embedded XML Literal. Given this, it
seems natural to allow it on the rdf:RDF element. Requiring conformant
implementations to handle all of that we might as well go the whole hog
and be completely permissive. 

This would make up for deficiencies in the syntax of not having
uri-reference versions of reification and rdf:bagID by 
wait for it ...

<rdf:Description rdf:bagID="BagID"
xml:base="http://example.org/bagID/URI#">
   <rdf:value rdf:ID="Reify" xml:base="http://example.org/reify/URI#" />
</rdf:Description>

OK, OK, I know that I'll lose this one.


Jeremy
