I attach some text ...

It's really intended as an overview of what processing is needed to unpack
the full RDF/XML syntax. As such I try to give some explanation of what each
step is, and their interdependencies. I have underlined bits that directly
relate to the order of processing.

I note that my rule 17 is stricter than this text, I think that it is a bug
with my rules.

Also my rules aren't quite as liberal with bagID numbering as the attached
text.
