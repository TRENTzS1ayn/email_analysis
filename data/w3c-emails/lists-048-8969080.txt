As I noted in:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0156.html

I created three test cases that test different permutations
of mis-spellings of the parseType attribute (e.g. ParseType):

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-parseType/

Although there is no associated issue for this in the Issue
Tracking doc, they cover a common error for both new and 
experienced RDF/XML authors.  Consequently, I offer these TCs
as candidates for inclusion in the WG's test case repo and
thus request comments.
