10: Propose approve Pat's suggestion to distinguish between a blank node and its label.

In future the term *node identifier* (which may be abbreviated to nodeId)
should be used to refer label of a blank node in, for example n-triples.
A node in the graph itself should be referred to as a blank node,
which may be abbreviated to bNode.
