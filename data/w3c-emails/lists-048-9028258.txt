I've no particular strong reason for making this change, rather than
just neatness or consistency and as issue owner, I want to get it
closed.  In this case it seems like even if it was not used much, we
can keep it around in the syntax without too much trouble - solving
it with better wording and specification.

Anyone who has a very good reason for a requirement to change this,
please can you give evidence, as Brian asks.

Dave
