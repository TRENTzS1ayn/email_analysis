the issue resolution is
-> Multiple domain and range constraints are permissable
   and will have conjunctive semantics.

so suppose we have
  ex:baz1 ex:bar ex:baz2 .        #test003
and
  ex:bar rdfs:domain ex:Domain1 . #test001
and
  ex:bar rdfs:domain ex:Domain2 . #test001

then we can rdfs_entail
  ex:baz1  rdf:type ex:Domain1 .  #test004
and
  ex:baz1  rdf:type ex:Domain2 .  #test004

now, it is that last 'and' that expresses
those 'conjunctive semantics' i.e.
ex:baz1 in in the intersection of ex:Domain1 and ex:Domain2

the same story for rdfs:range

PS the $Id$ in the .rdf files doesn't seem to be evaluated (in the .nt it's ok)
