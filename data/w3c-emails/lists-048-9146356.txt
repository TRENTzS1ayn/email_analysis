Short version: "SHOULD" in literal equality considered dangerous.


I am not particularly wedded to SHOULD, and next time the WG considers this
I will suggest MUST.

I take that to be specifically out of charter for this WG; in that I find
M&S to be consistent and clear on this and I believe that my suggested
(Unicode String,Lang-Tag?) pair representation of a literal to be a more
explicit rearticulation of what it says.

While that isn't perfect, I believe xml:lang is used by RDF users and there
is no critical problem with it.
