I keep on seeing this. It isn't true. The lang tag might not cause any
new nodes and arcs to be added, but it _does_ add information to the
graph, because the literal node is labelled

(language, content)

and is  distinct from the node labelled

(content)

...even if the contents are lexically identical.
