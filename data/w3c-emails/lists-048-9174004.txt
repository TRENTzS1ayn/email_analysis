I've been asked for an estimate of how many will attend our F2F meeting during 
the tech plenary.  Please could you reply to this message indicating:

   o whether you expect to attend the RDFCore F2F meeting at this event
   o whether you expect to attend the plenary day at this event

This is for estimating; its not a commitment.

Brian
