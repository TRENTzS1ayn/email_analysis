Searching in the mail archive the earliest reference to the contradiction I
could find was:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/1999JanMar/0026.html

which was written a couple of weeks after M&S became a recommendation.

I can't locate a reply to Kajiyama'san. Anyone know if there was one?

I would suggest updating the issue list with this mail URL. He states the
problem very clearly.
