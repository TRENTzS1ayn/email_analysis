Strictly, Brian, a black hole can't be said to be `opening up'.... no,
leave it alone.

Seriously, dollars and deicmals are not types but encodings of data of a
certain type... surely?
The unit chosen maps the integer value into a sequence of numerals in
the same way that the choice of radix does. Therefore `decimal' and
`pounds' belong in the same syntactic position. The type which selects
the semantic domain belongs elsewhere. Radix and unit have the same role
as `lang' - they stipulate how the characters are to mapped into a
semantic sub-domain which itself has a particular type.
