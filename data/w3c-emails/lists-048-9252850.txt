You might also want to look at the (very) recently published erratum E26 to
the XML spec at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E26.

Strictly speaking, it only applies to system literals in XML since, as
Martin correctly points out 'XML processors don't know about most URIs in an
XML doc'.  But I think it does express quite clearly what is the expected
treatment of URIs in general and can be used as a useful guide.
