I attach a copy of
  RDF/XML Syntax
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/
  CVS version 1.95

The syntax now uses the XML Infoset and XPath-like nodeset form for
describing the grammar as a sequence of SAX-like events, plus an
inital attempt at an approach to mapping to triples.

[From the above link you can find the CVS history, diffs, latest
versions]

This document is for review in terms of general approach, as
discussed on the teleconference along with Jeremy's Snail work which
he will be emailing about separately.
