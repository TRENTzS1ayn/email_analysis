This issue came up at today's telecon.
Both chairs indicated that if the WG goes with Sergey's suggestion of using
bNodes for expressing structured literals, and the WG felt that the
lang-string stuff was too much in conflict with this, then we should seek to
be rechartered. (And I think I understood this more generally, i.e. the
charter requirement to move forward on types may require us to request an
easing of some of our other charter restrictions).

For what its worth, using Jena 1.2 does give programmatic access to the
xml:lang read in from RDF/XML. I believe we do not yet do lang tag
comparison in a case insensitive fashion, but I think ARP normalizes case on
input.
