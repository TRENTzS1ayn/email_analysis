You're not saying the XML solution conflicts with what RDF needs,
are you? This issue is so messy that I have a hard time following...
but if I understand correctly, the XML processors can
follow the advice that the XML Core WG has given, and RDF
stuff can be layered on top, and it all works out. True?

If folks are reading in RDF/xml with the intention of 
writing it back out as RDF/xml, I might suggest they
keep the pre-decoded unicode string around as well
as the US ASCII URI....

That's perhaps a useful heuristic for human display, but for
RDF/XML output, it seems unwise. In general, you can't tell
that the %fc%c4 in
http://example/%fc%c4
is intended to be the utf-8 encodong of a unicode character,
or if it's just two octets that the server was encoding
for other purposes.

Hmm... in some sense, it doesn't matter... if you
put the unicode character in the XML file, the RDF
guy on the other end will get the right URI back out.

But on the other hand, any XSLT code in between will
fail to match it. Hmm...
