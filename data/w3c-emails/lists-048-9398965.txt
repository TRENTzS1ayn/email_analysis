Certainly, if you like, and indeed one I could fix by storing a language tag
(or absence of one)
along with every literal. No sweat.

But then, for Dan to be able to use it, he would need built-in functions:

rdf:languageCode a rdf:Property;
    rdfs:domain rdf:Literal;
    rdf:range rdf:String;
    rdfs:label "language code";
    rdfs:comment """Langauge tag of a litteral, indicating the natural
langauge used.
        An ISO langauge code, see ISO _____""".

rdf:stringBit a rdf:Property;
    rdfs:domain rdf:Literal;
    rdf:range rdf:String;
    rdfs:label "string without language code";
    rdfs:comment """The string value of a litteral, without any language
code.""".

to actaully extract the data, or do langauge-independant comparisons for
example.

Not to mention a function to build a complex Literal up from String and
language tag....
