  Need a decision:
  [14:54:05] DanC
  yes, please, let's go this way! note that all XML Schema scalar values
  can be written (uri-for-primitive-type, unicode-char-seq)
  [14:54:57] JosD
  exactly DanC
  [14:55:00] gk
  Do we go the way of using blank nodes for literals, or do we regard
  literals as structured entities....(attempt)
  [14:55:07] DanC
  ... and that the XML Schema spec specifies a canonical lexicalization
  (unicode-character-string) for each value; so there's a well-defined
  mapping in both directions.
  [14:55:38] gk
  Literals as separarate animal in the model theory, or just another
  kind of resource node? (another attempt)
  [14:55:56] DanC
  please let string literals denote strings. hmm... what to do with xml:lang.

and Sergey's proposal S3
[[
  (S3) use bNodes [M&S,TBL]

      Examples: John_Smith weight [units Pounds, rdf:value "10"], or
                John_Smith weight [pounds [decimal "10"]]

I find that a very reasonable path to follow!
