indeed, equivalent
and log:entails is a good name if we are explicit
about the rdf, rdfs, dpo, etc axioms at the lhs
so it is then something like

====
@prefix log: <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#> .
@prefix x: <http://example.org/nt/> .
@prefix y: <http://example.org/n3/> .
    [ log:conjunction x:g1, x:g2, x:g3, y:a1 ] log:entails x:g4 . #@@use/mention

we actually (already) do some forward chaining when we do
auto generated rules for premis and query statements with anonymous nodes
(that comes down to "existential introduction" rules)
well, maybe forward chaining...
but I agree, we will need mixtures of forward and backward reasoning

I'm blushing (and that since a very long time...)

You couldn't be more right than that :-)
