FWIW, I had a student working for me last year who wrote a simple expert 
system shell using RDF for its facts and rules input... one characteristic 
of this system was that it could apply both forward and backward chaining 
over the same rules in evaluation of a given goal.  (I should say that that 
capability was somewhat underdeveloped in the version we released when he 
returned to his studies.)
