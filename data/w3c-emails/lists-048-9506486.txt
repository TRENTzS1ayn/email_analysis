That is not what this particular chair said.

I believe I said, that datatyping was important, that we should 'get it right', 
and if getting it right was in conflict with the charter, we should solve the 
charter problem.

I note ;) that one way to solve this sort of charter problem would be to leave 
such an issue for the next round.  I say this not because I'm advocating that at 
this stage, but just to make sure folks understand we are not necessarily 
running out an liberalising the charter right now.
