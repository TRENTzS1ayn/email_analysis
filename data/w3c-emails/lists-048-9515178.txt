Yes and there are a few more like that, aren't there:

   o Why can't I query the namespace of property using properties?
   o Why can't I query the uri of resource using properties?

Why are you bringing this up again?  We have been round this already.
My recollection is that we examined this issue, we looked at use cases, we found 
some where the M&S spec of how to handle xml:lang was useful and we found no 
major problems with it.

We then put that issue aside for a while to look at other issues with literals, 
since it was not right to make any decision about xml:lang without considering 
those other issues at the same time.  We have since had a look at the parseType 
literal issue and are now considering datatyping.

If you want to bring the xml:lang part of the problem up again at this stage, 
then the question I have is what are these other critical issues to which you 
referred earlier.  Please make the case there is a real problem.
