Actually, I'm not sure :(

Let me try a strawman position:

I agree with Pat that this seems to be more of an implementation issue which is 
hard to discuss without a processing model.  However, using terms like parser, 
loosely:

   o it doesn't seem reasonable to require parsers to eliminate duplicates - 
that  would prohibit the development of streaming parsers.

   o we need say nothing this in terms of representing an RDF graph - it's up to 
the implementor whether they filter duplicates or not.  that way we don't break 
existing implementations of either family for no good reason.

   o Pat seems to reckon the model theory is simpler with a set.  Can we extend 
the notion of a tidy graph so that it removes duplicate statements.  Any untidy 
graph has an equivalent tidy graph, and the model theory is defined in terms of 
that.
