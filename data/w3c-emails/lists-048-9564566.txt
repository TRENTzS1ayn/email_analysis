Actually, we do have a property for that
use case: rdfs:isDefinedBy.
It has to be explicitly stated, but that's the only
thing that makes sense; it doesn't make sense to speak
of *the* namespace of a property, in part because
it doesn't make sense to speak of *the* name of
a property: a property can have lots of names.

Er... in cwm, I can. it's called log:uri.
(and it gives *a* URI, not *the* URI of a resource, provided
it's been told one).

As TimBL explained (Fri, 19 Oct 2001 14:00:37 -0400),
I could enhance cwm to destructure
literals similarly, but the result is extremely distasteful.

Then please point me at the relevant test inputs
and/or the software that handles these test inputs
to the satisfaction of the users.
