After having spent some time this week looking at W3C's SOAP (XML
Protocol) work, which seems (their data model is still underspecified) to
use a very RDF-like graph structure, I now have considerable sympathy for
this view. We are already stuck with the 1.0 syntax not being able to
serialize all RDF graphs. While allowing graphs in the MT that are not
currently serializable would be a pain, I believe repeatedly re-doing the
MT to shadow future new syntaxes (SOAP, non-striped syntaxes, ...) could turn
out to be an even bigger pain.
