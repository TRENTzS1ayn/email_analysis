Jan? Got any example files? What software are you using?

That's the one I keep hearing about. I phoned him about it,
and he said they ended up using properties to represent
language, not xml:lang.

From the same message:

[[[
For example, I tried to do a visualization of the RDF schema
for RDF, using cwm, and I couldn't find a way to get it
to filter the french labels from the english labels... because
the xml:lang information isn't in triple form.
]]]

As far as I know, none of the RDF query systems
allows me to say "show me the english labels
from the RDFS schema".
