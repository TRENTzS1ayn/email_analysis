You use the word 'support' rather more liberally than I would.
The only two other posters in that thread were Pat and Graham, both of whom
expressed reservations about the wholesale replacement but were supportive
about other aspects of your message.

e.g.

I was mainly agreeing with the bit that the model theory should not be
constrained by the current RDF syntax in what it describes:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0193.html
rather then specifically agreeing to your abstract syntax proposal.

Now, obviously the messages can be quoted to indicate where they supported
you, but it wasn't about the thing you highlight.

If it helps clarify I will give a "-1" for N-triples rather than the graph
as the abstract syntax. I find both levels helpful, and would prefer to
retain them both.
