Oops,

I was a little unfair, sorry Dan, I had missed the sequencing of the
messages (I was accessing them through the by-thread interface).

Concerning your statement

it would have been fair to say that there was *one* voice of support, and
you seem to have generated some churn in your support by asserting you had
some :) !
