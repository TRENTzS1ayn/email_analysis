Hi Jan,

Ok, you got me. The MT doesn't preclude a label with two members. But if
we can have both of those forms why not go on to have n-membered
literals (the MT doesn't preclude that either)? I guess then being in a
literal label means you're 'part' of the literal. That wouldn't rule
this label out:

(language)

do we need to sat anything about this case at the MT level, or can we
rely on syntactic restrictions along the lines of no content no literal?

regards,
Bill
