Ok, what IS a literal, exactly? Please write a few of them down so I 
can see them, if you would be so kind.... They have to be things that 
we can include in Ntriples documents and use as graph labels.

If you mean that the literal IS something like an externally tagged 
label, where the tagging is included as part of the literal, then 
that is what I originally had in mind when writing the MT, but that 
has been strongly rejected by others.

So what exactly is the label in the graph? You seem to be saying that 
the problem just goes away by magic if we say that two things are the 
same and also not the same.

>If you do this the problem you describe goes away (I think).

I think that is the solution I originally had in mind. However it 
does not seem to be acceptable to most people, in particular to the 
DAML folk, and it doesn't seem to match up with the general usage of 
'literal'. Also it is still a hedge around the basic problem, which 
is that insisting on uniqueness of literals is a lot less reasonable 
than for urirefs, and is liable to lock us into a box we would rather 
not be in, and there is no real RDF reason why we need to. We 
invented Ntriples ourselves, right, so we can re-invent it just as 
easily.

The type has to be associated with a particular *occurrence* of a 
literal, and the only thing we have in the graph syntax to 
distinguish one of these from another is the node it is attached to. 
If there is going to be *any* kind of way to indicating the datatype 
of a literal by some means in the graph, then we cannot have the 
literal typing done by the literal label itself.

In any case, putting datatype information into the label is just as 
much an extension to the current language; and this generalization 
would not rule it out; so this keeps our options open.

This IS model theory; you are stating semantic conditions on an 
interpretation. But look: what is integer(23) here? A literal? If you 
can tell that its an integer by looking at it, what do you need that 
triple for? And if that triple is true, does

_:xxx <rdf:type><xsd:Integer> .

have to be entailed by it? If its not a literal, what is it?

Maybe I missed that. Pointer?
