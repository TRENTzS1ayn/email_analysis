Wow. In the year 2001, fundamental design decisions in programing 
languages are critically influenced by the need to protect low-level 
hackers from the burden of implementing a simple stack. IBM 704 
assembler beats LISP after 45 years and about ten (twelve?) orders of 
magnitude increase in processing efficiency.

To hell with the DPH. If he can't parse a nested bracket structure, 
then he doesn't deserve the outrageous salary he is probably earning; 
tell him to take up gardening instead.
