Well, I *thought* I was clear as to what was being renamed:  the part of 
the statement that identified the property part of the statement (and 
since there's only one of them, I don't really have a problem with a 
certain amount of overloading, if that's what it is)!  If we want the 
terminology to make this distinction clearer, I see some trickiness on 
the horizon.  The M&S also refers to "property name" (especially in the 
context of the XML serialization), but, as we now know, the property 
isn't identified by a simple "name", but by a URI (even though that's a 
name, in a slightly difference sense).  That also means that the 
property is a resource, so you could have equally written:

 > The subject must (debatably) be a resource
 >
 > The predicate must be a resource
 >
 > The object may be a resource or a literal.

What we want to say is something like "the property component of a 
statement specifies the resource acting in the role of property for this 
statement".  We certainly need to distinguish that from situations in 
which a resource *is* a property, but we're referring to it in the 
subject or object positions of a statement (which are also 
possibilities).  In any event, we probably want to change "predicate" to 
something else, as Pat suggests, since it may be a bit misleading in the 
context.
