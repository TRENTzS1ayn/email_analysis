Right, exactly. Thats how the extended MT would work. A datatyped 
intepretation is an interpretation (of the vocabulary) and a 
datatyping scheme (of the nodes) which together satisfy some pretty 
obvious semantic constraints (that the class extension of a datatype 
name is that datatype, and that every literal occurrence labels a 
node which is datatyped consistently with the class membership of the 
literal value.) Then it all works smoothly in the usual way, where 
the more you know, the smaller the set of typed interpretations gets. 
Since the typing is applied to nodes, it's impossible for typing in 
one graph to directly influence that in another (ie except via their 
mutual constraints on the shared vocabulary used on those node 
labels.)
