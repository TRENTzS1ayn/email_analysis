Nice survey!!  Wish I had read it before I wrote 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0446.html

I have some quibbles, but I think they are important for the conclusion.

Quibble Q1: part of the merit (to me) of the suggestions S3 and S4 is 
that they do *not* require an external schema or rule set, but that 
all the relevant information can be asserted in conventional RDFS 
(with a slight extension in S3 to introduce rdf:value). This is 
important for the reason given in Q3.

Q2. I think it is misleading to characterize this under this heading. 
It only looks that way if you write it in N3. If you wrote this out 
in Ntriples, the typing information is clearly asserted in the RDF 
graph, so this is better called 'schema-based'.

(A general meta-quibble here is that this strong/weak classification, 
though traditional, is only meaningful relative to a particular 
syntax, and is therefore rather shallow, IMHO. I think a much more 
meaningful criterion for us is whether or not the datatyping 
information is available to an RDF inference engine. On that basis, 
S1 and S2 would be classified together (under 'not') and S3 and S4 
classed together (under 'available'))

Q3. This seems meaningless since RDF has no way to express identity. 
So these questions cannot even be posed in RDF; and if some external 
application could infer them, it would have no way to assert its 
conclusions in RDF . So I propose that this criterion simply be 
ignored for now.

>(C3) is typing information self-contained or requires external schema
>[DC2]

I would like to know what 'external' means here. This seems like a 
three-or four-way distinction. Typing information can be:
>>  self-contained or not (ie potentially arising from any general inference)
>>  external (to RDF) or internal.
These seem orthogonal dimensions to me.

>(C4) are multiple type assignments allowed? (e.g. US dollar, decimal)

Better, what happens when they occur? Eg suppose two 
sources/documents/whatever supply different such information; which 
part of the RDF machinery complains?  (the lexical analyzer, the 
parser, an inference engine, or some other datatyping module?)

I prefer S4. It scores high on all of C1, C3, C4 , C5; and C2 should 
be ignored. I don't think that S3 does score on C1, by the way; that 
usage is *incompatible* with the M&S examples. That seems to me to be 
a major score against it.

>It is backward compatible for obvious reasons

Seems obviously not. Am I missing something? Eg a simple usage of a 
literal with no datatyping information:

aaa bbb "56788" .

is unchanged in S4, but would be illegal in S3 and must be rewritten as

aaa bbb _:1 .
_:1 rdf:value "56788" .

>(C1), uses self-contained typing (C3)

Why is it self-contained? Like S4, it imposes typing by making RDF 
assertions (using rdf:type). But any RDF assertion might be a 
consequence of some other assertions, eg about rdfs:range; so S3 and 
S4 seem to me to be indistinguishable on C3.

RDF has a problem with C2 in general, and it applies just as forcibly 
to S3 (see Q3)

S4 (at least in the version discussed in [PH][PPS1/2] ) fits here 
better. S3 doesn't even require such fitting; it fits into the 
current MT without alteration. However, it doesn't fit with 
widespread practice in literal usage in other languages, so I think 
it would be short-sighted to build it into RDF. Also, frankly, the 
use of rdf:value seems ugly and ad-hoc.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'model' here.  S3, like S4, does 
require that datatypes (the things denoted by datatype names) are in 
every satisfying interpretation, and have their 'natural' 
interpretation.

Right, I agree.
