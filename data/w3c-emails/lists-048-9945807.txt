I hope that couldn't possibly happen. The 'equality' being discussed 
above is SYNTACTIC equality, ie whether or not those two strings 
should be treated as the very same string. (It would be better to 
call it something else, "identity" or something.) So for example is 
"Paris" in French the same string as "Paris" in English? (Its not 
pronounced the same way, for example.) But whether you say it is or 
it isn't, it still *means* the same French city in French or in 
English. Similarly you, the guy with the card debt, might well have 
more than one name. So the only case that might be a problem would be 
where the same character sequence had a different meaning in two 
different languages and some dumb engine thought that the two strings 
were identical. But then it would clearly be the engine's fault for 
making unreasonable assumptions :-)
