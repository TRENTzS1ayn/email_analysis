Well, I wonder if before deciding one way or the other about the 
merits of reification, could we first decide what reification 
actually is? I thought I knew, but at the F2F the model theory I gave 
for reification (which I honestly thought was the blandest and least 
controversial interpretation one could wish for, and to directly 
follow the M&S) seemed to cause a firestorm.  We havn't discussed 
reification since then, but if we are going to start, then please 
lets first define what we are talking about.
