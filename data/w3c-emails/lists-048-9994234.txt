I would appreciate any remarks from anyone on what the intended uses 
of reification were. What would it be to 'use reification 
effectively' ? Use it for what? Part of my problem with reification 
has always been that I am unable to see a single effective use for in 
it RDF; every suggested use I have seen has seemed to involve a 
logical or conceptual error of some kind.
