My only comment is that I do hope we can find our way to banishing the odd use 
of URI fragments in RDF except as needed to denote in-line resources attached 
to a particular serialization document.

I, for one, do not use URI fragments in my vocabularies, and at Fourthought, 
we consider it "best practice" not to do so.

Let's keep serialization issues out of the idea of universal identification, 
where possible.
