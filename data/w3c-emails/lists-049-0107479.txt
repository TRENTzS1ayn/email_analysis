No.

Since

1) xml:base applies only to fields that contain URIs that XML
   applications (RDF/XML here) know about.  RDF/XML doesn't do that
   inside parsetype literal content.

2) the <a> has no namespace.  
   RDF/XML doesn't apply to non-namespaced elements anywhere

3) X/HTML don't use xml:base so even if it was an X/HTML fragment
   and element, it wouldn't apply.
