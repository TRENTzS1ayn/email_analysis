Yup.  Was thinking of Jeremy doing test cases for this, but I'm grateful 
for all input.

Just so and RDF can't expect to about all those namespaces.  But it 
occurred to me we could put an xml:base attribute on outer elements in the 
literal, the way we are doing with namespaces.  I'm not suggesting this; 
just asking for my own education.

And I wasn't sure about that.  I believe HTML has a base attribute; I 
wasn't sure if they had endorsed xml:base.

Thanks Dave.
