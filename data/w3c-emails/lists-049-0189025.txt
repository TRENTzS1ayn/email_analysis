Hi all -

the WebOnt requirement document states that the language should support
inclusion of other ontologies.

We argue that this feature would better be located in the RDF layer instead
of upper layers. For example XML Schema supports inclusion, which is in
conflict to the proposal of XInclude, which recommends Inclusion on a
bellow application level.

We wrote up a small document that collects and evaluates existing
W3C solutions for modularity and propose an extension to RDF that
would enable inclusion and import mechanisms for all RDF vocabularies.

I'ld be happy to discuss this document with the group.

If you are interested turn to
http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/WBS/rvo/modular.pdf

It is a short paper (8 pages) 
and quite readable. The primitives for inclusion suggested there
are currently under implementation and will be downable by mid
of May.

Please have a look


Raphael
