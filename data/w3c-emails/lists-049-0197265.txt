For information:

Acting as an individual, I've forwarded a copy of this announcement to the 
ietf-types@iana.org mailing list, in the hope of getting relevant feedback 
sooner rather than later.

I've also asked the IETF area director usually concerned with these matters 
(Ned Freed) for advice on  progressing the registration promptly when the 
specification is stabilized.
