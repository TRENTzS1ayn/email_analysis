According to my understanding of the datatyping proposal, there is 
_nothing_ in this graph that denotes the value 25.  All that is required is 
that there exists some value, not necessarily denoted by anything in the 
graph, that is related to the string "25" by the datatype 
"xsd:integer".  (And according to our shared understanding of xsd:integer, 
that "some value" is 25.)
