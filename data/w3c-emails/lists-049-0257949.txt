Jeremy seems to be expressing concern that there is a problem
that is reflected by this question, and I was simply trying
to clarify if such a problem exists, because if such a problem
does in fact exist, it could have significant ramifications.
Better to know now than later.

I agree that the current proposal provides a 'no' answer to
the question. If, however, the answer is 'yes' then the
proposal is then clearly in conflict with a 'yes' answer.

But it seems that no'one (myself included) feels that the
answer is 'yes' (apart from perhaps Jeremy, though he has
not responded to this question directly) so I'll drop it.

I guess I wanted to clarify whether I was going to have to
re-write major portions of the WD before I finish them. Thus,
I have been practically motivated with regards to this
thread.

Nevermind...  returning to my editing...
