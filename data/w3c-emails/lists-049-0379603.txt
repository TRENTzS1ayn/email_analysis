I suggest we resolve the rdfs-container-membership-superProperty by defining
one:
e.g. rdfs:contains


I suggest we then declare rdfs-constraining-containers as out of scope on
the basis that it can be addressed by DAML+OIL. All indications are that OWL
will contrinue to address this issue.

The DAML+OIL mantra is:



<daml:Restriction rdf:ID="ConstrainedContainer">
  <rdfs:comment>
    This is the class of resources all of
    whose rdfs:contains edges point to a
    resource of type eg:ElementsConstrainedToThisClass.
    To have a Bag, a Seq or an Alt with such a constrained
    declare the resource to have both type Bag and type
    ConstrainedContainer.
    Alternatively construct a new class that subclasses both
    this class and the desired container class.
  </rdfs:comment>
  <daml:onProperty
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#contains"/>
  <daml:toClass
rdf:resource="http://example.org/ElementsConstrainedToThisClass"/>
</daml:Restriction>
