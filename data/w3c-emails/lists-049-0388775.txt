One request, actually, that I would like to make (doesn't have
to be on the concall aggenda, though) is for volunteers to
write brief example sections for the Use Cases appendices
(DAML, CC/PP, DC, etc.).

What I'm hoping for is very brief, example rich summaries which
simply help users make the leap from specification to application
and show "Here's how RDF Datatyping can/is/should be done in XXX",
etc. Max 1-2 typical web browser screens.

Also, suggestions for any other relevant Use Cases that I've
left out.

Cheers,

Patrick
