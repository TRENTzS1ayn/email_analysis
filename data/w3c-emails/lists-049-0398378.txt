Patrick is "fully versed in XML 1.0".


One minor point, you use local entity defs to simulate qnames in attr
values.

This is quite cute, but does go against this para in M&S:

[[[
Note: Schema developers may be tempted to declare the values of certain
properties to use a syntax corresponding to the XML Namespace qualified name
abbreviation. We advise against using these qualified names inside property
values as this may cause incompatibilities with future XML datatyping
mechanisms. Furthermore, those fully versed in XML 1.0 features may
recognize that a similar abbreviation mechanism exists in user-defined
entities. We also advise against relying on the use of entities as there is
a proposal to define a future subset of XML that does not include
user-defined entities.
]]]


I am happy to drop the intent of this paragraph - that seems to be a
corollary of Patrick being "fully versed in XML 1.0" :).
