Is this advice still valid? Is there still such a proposal?

Perhaps we can just disregard the latter part of this
paragraph as obsolete...  ;-)

Well, I want to reflect a consensus of good practice in the WD (not
just my own personal view of what is good practice ;-) but it does
make for much more readable RDF I think. I use the practice of
namespace entities extensively in my own schemas and it is a great
boon to productivity and clarity.

Of course, I use vi to write XML and RDF, so I accept that my
tastes may be considered a bit odd...   ;-)
