Yes.

Yes.

To find the answers to these and other Trivia questions, use Mark Davis'
Web page at:
   http://www.macchiato.com/unicode/charts.html

Just type E9 into the box and press Enter.  The glyph for "?" will be
highlighted.  The edges of the chart give the UTF-8 value.  The left
edge in the "?" row says "C3 A_" and the foot of the column under "?"
says "9", making "C3 A9" when put together.
