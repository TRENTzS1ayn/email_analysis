My understanding of PatH's last proposal is that this graph is not 
satisfiable.  More precisely:

[[[
<Jane> <age> "25" .
<age> <range> <xsd:integer> .
]]]

is not satisfiable because "25" denotes a string and <xsd:integer> does not 
contain strings in its class extension.

[BTW, I tried to find PatH's document for datatyping with tidy literals, 
but it seems to have disappeared from the web ;-( ]

...

I broadly agree with the thrust of the rest of your message, as I 
understand it.
