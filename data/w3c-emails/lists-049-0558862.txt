I'd note that there is no equivalent paragraph in the syntax working
draft and I've seen RDF/XML used in this way by several people for
abbreviations.  Do we really think this is going to clash with XML?

(Aside: not that I like XML entities much anyway; we don't have to
care about them since the Infoset mapping we use removes them.)
