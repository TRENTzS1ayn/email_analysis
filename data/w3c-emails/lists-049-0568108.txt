The previously announced microschedule at:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#L473

shows a first version for review at this week conference call.  This was 
based on your email:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Mar/0379.html

I guess I misinterpreted the term "rough draft to the WG".  I take Graham's 
point about reviewing a moving target.

How about this for a plan:

   - detailed review of DT's WD 19th Apr
   - final review and approve publication 26th Apr

That means we need a near final for review, by say Monday.
