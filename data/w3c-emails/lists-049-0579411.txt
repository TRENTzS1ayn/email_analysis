Is it possible to constrain the members of a container to be of a given type?
 
Propose:

  o the WG resolves that expressing such a constraint is beyond the 
    scope of RDFS.  Such functionality belongs with more powerful 
    ontology languages such as daml+oil and owl.

  o The WG notes that DAML+OIL can express this constraint as described in:

    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0106.html

  o The WG closes this issue
