I don't think we chose a name before; I picked 'member' as an obviousish
one. It reads in the (oft-ignored) prefered style of M&S, ie.
<a> <member> <b> "A has a member b". I don't care much. Help with the
definition would be good though. Anyone want to have a crack at that?

Last time around it was all done in MS Word98, but I don't currently have
a windows box handy...
