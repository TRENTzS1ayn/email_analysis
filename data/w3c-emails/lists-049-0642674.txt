Hmm... on the one hand, I have been looking at each
draft saying "well, it doesn't have the use case
examples, and that's all I care about; I'll read
the next one."

But then I peeked into this one... and I mostly
like what I see.

For my money, it's good enough for 1st WD.

If they editors (Stickler/Hayes/Melnick)
are happy to publish it with their
names on it, I'm happy to see it go out.
