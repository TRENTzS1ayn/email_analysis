I ran into a couple ambiguities while compiling these minutes; this message 
is intended to flag these (and hopefully address them) prior to tomorrows 
meeting in order to save valuable teleconference time.

7: Confirm Status of Withdrawn Actions

...

STATUS: Confirmed

(Note: recalling this from memory, irc log does not support this one way or
another)

---

11: Approve Test Cases

...

ACTION: 2002-04-05#11 josd
   ping pat, danc to look at rdfs-subPropertyOf-semantics tests

DECISION:
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-subPropertyOf-semantics/
approved

(Note: the above ACTION and DECISION seem to be in conflict?)

I believe re #7, all withdrawn actions we're indeed confirmed and with #11 
the test case was indeed agreed upon, thus freeing Jos of the assigned 
action.  Brian (as you memory seems much better than mine :), can you confirm?
