well, I have concerns about the *either* ... *or* in

[[[
   The rdfd:range property imposes a datatyping constraint
   on its subject such that all values of the constrained
   property must correspond *either* to a literal node
   which is a member of the lexical space of the specified
   datatype (a lexical form), *or* to a non-literal node
   denoting a member of the value space of the specified
   datatype (a datatype value) to which is attached by
   means of either the rdf:lex property or a datatype
   property a literal node which is a member of the lexical
   space of the specified datatype.

this sounds like a union...
and I don't see that as explained in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Mar/0151.html
and as I still think we should have
  rdfd:range rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:range .
to keep the benefit of RDFS entailment rule3
  { :rule3 . ?s ?p ?o . ?p rdfs:range ?C } log:implies { ?o a ?C } .

PS there is also some rdfs:Property stuff instead of rdf:Property
   and I think we also dropped rdfs:ConstraintProperty
   also rule2 is not needed given
     rdfd:range rdfs:range rdfd:Datatype .
   and rule3b is my above concern
