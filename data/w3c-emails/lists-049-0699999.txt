This is true if <range> equates to rdfs:range. I presumed it
equated to rdfd:range, in which case, there is no problem.

It really will help, Jeremy, if you use the precise vocabulary
that we have come up with, especially if commenting on the current
WD, otherwise, we have no basis for mutual understanding. I know
that to some extent, you are trying not to beg the question by
keeping some terms somewhat ambiguous, but it makes it too hard
to know exactly what you mean. If you mean rdfs:range, please say so.
If you mean rdfd:range, again, just say so. etc. OK?

Cheers,

Patrick
