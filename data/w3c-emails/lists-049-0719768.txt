It's almost there. I want to go through still and make the
verbage a bit more consistent (there are still some sections
with obsolete or inconsistent vocabulary), and also flesh
out some of the one-liner "stub" paragraphs a bit so they
are a bit clearer -- and of course finish up the rest of the
graph illustrations. But at that point (around Tuesday of
next week) the WG can chew on it for the 19th concall and
if everyone is happy with it then as a first release WD, let
it go.

Cheers,

Patrick
