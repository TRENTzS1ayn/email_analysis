[[[
   Issue rdfs-constraint-properties-resources: Eliminate contraint
properties
   and resources?
   raised Tue 09 Oct 2001 by Dan Connolly

   Summary: Are constraint properties and contraint resources useful. If not,
   the eliminate them.

   Resolution: On 9th Novemeber 2001, the WG resolved:

   The current mechanism, rdfs:ConstraintResource and rdfs:ConstraintProperty,
   fails to serve its original purpose and should be removed from the RDF
   Schema 1.0 specification. The accompanying text be amended accordingly.

   Currently: closed (response)
