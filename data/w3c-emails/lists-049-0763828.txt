last telecon DanC asked, "is there a README for this [test case]"?

I'm running a little behind* but I'm hoping by the end of today to have
populated the existing test cases on a directory-by-directory basis with
manifest.rdf files that describe the existing (approved) test cases.

These will be collated into one larger file that should be readily
machine-processable.

I'll also have some skeleton files for Jos to stick details of his
entailment tests into.

At a first pass, these are going to be fairly minimalist** but there's
room in the file for human-readable descriptions, pointers to emails,
etc. should people feel that a test case requires more description.
Again, this can be done on a directory-by-directory basis and slurped up
afterwards.

I'll be sticking some more words together over the weekend to revise the
existing document; this should be in an internally-reviewable state by
Monday.

I'm away on Tuesday next week so, assuming things go according to
schedule, I could do with a volunteer to translate things into en_US and
check markup, etc.

Cheers,
jan

* "expect the unexpected" is fast becoming my motto :-(
** minimalist = test type, status (APPROVED), related issue, input and
  output files, and an indication if a warning is to be raised.

PS. Current test-case taxonomy:

positive parser test (input: .rdf file(s); output: .nt file; optionally,
an indication of a warning)

negative parser test (input: bad .rdf file)

positive RDF-entailment test (input: .rdf (or .nt) file(s); output: file
containing a valid entailment according t the rules of RDF-entailment)

negative RDF-entailment test (as above, but the entailment does not
hold)

ditto the above two test types but using the rules of RDFS-entailment as
outlined by MT.

Jos: I think this reflects the full extent of your test cases, or are
there others? There are no DT-specific tests here.
