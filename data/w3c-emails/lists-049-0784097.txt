Er, do we have a disconnect here?

Pat, if you're following this:  I note your document that was at 
<http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype23-02-2002.html> is 
no longer there.  Has it been moved?  It would be good if it were kept 
available for a while, since that seems to be our last published point of 
consensus.

Anyway, to resume normal programming...

Ummm... if you mean to interpret <range> as <rdfd:range>, then according to 
something Pat said a while ago [1], that has _no effect at all_ on the 
denotation of anything.  That simply describes a syntactic constraint on 
literal labels in the RDF graph (which are satisfied by the above examples 
so can be dropped without having any any further effect on the semantics).

Right. The point is that rdfs:drange (or whatever we call it) really
says nothing about the actual range: it ONLY invokes datatype
checking. Now, one might reasonably expect that the actual range was
'in line' with the datatype checking, but that could be

No, it doesn't constrain the relational extension. What it does say is that

( <x,y> in IEXT(I(ex:age))  AND  y a literal)  =>
z=L2V(I(datatype:decimal))(y) for some z

ie IF its a literal then its in the lexical space of
datatype:decimal. But if its not, then nothing particular follows.
