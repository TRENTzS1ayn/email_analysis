indeed, we use the entailment rules per indirection of URI's like

  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
  <http://www.w3.org/2001/10/daml+oil#>

occuring in the subject-list of an entailment statement
e.g.

( <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test001.nt>
  <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test002.nt>
  <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test003.nt>
  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> )
  log:entails
  <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/test004.nt> .

it's just a way to evolve...

I'm fine with that Jan, that's what we actually have
