Fair enough.

Note that I've just uploaded the revisions that I've been working
on today (in parallel with email between you and Jos ;-) and that
sections 2-3, 5-7 I consider to be pretty much ready for serious
review. I doubt that anyone in the WG needs the introduction in
section 1 and the relation of RDF Datatyping to RDF Schema
covered in section 4 is not as core to the discussion as the
rest, and may also be impacted on any agreed changes to the
completed sections. If you think section 4 is critical to your
review, I plan to have it done by late Monday/ early Tuesday.

Note: I've opted in this revision for rdfd:datatype rather than
rdfd:range as the latter seems to be causing folks indigestion and I
must admit that when taking the view that it is the datatype semantics
which impose the constraints on the idioms (by providing valid
interpretations of them), all rdfd:datatype is doing
is associating a datatype context with a property, and thus
is not really itself defining any kind of range.

I've also updated the illustrations for the levels of interpretation
and completed all the illustrations for the above mentioned "completed"
sections.

Feel free to have a gander at what's there now
(http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/rdf-datatyping.html) and
tell me if the language better reflects the unique nature
of rdfd:datatype.

Cheers,

Patrick

PS: In case anyone is concerned about keeping track if intermediate
versions, I'm zipping and archiving regular snapshots to www-archive
under the subject "YYYY-MM-DD-rdf-datatyping.zip".
