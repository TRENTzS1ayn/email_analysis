well, I was looking for (but didn't find) the .nt files
one could of course argue here, but there are certainly triples
in those files, and I think we should say which ones
no? Jan?

I think for error001.nt there are 2 triples


<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-abouteach/error001.rdf#node>
    <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>
    <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Bag> .

<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-abouteach/error001.rdf#node>
    <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#_1>
    <http://example.org/node2> .

(remark the .rdf which is OK, but maybe avoid extensions)

and for error002.nt only 1 triple

  <http://example.org/node> <http://example.org/property> "foo" .
