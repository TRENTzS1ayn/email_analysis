I've been in an email conversation on jena-dev with a relative newbie to 
RDF.  I suggested he try out the primer and he commented[1]:

  [[
The link you gave me was exelent and about 100 times better than the other 
releases in W3C, which I first tried to learn RDF.
  ]]

Kudos to Frank, Eric and all those who have contributed.
