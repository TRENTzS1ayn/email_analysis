It's a toss-up here; the files certainly contain bits of syntax which
are no longer valid, so we've got two choices:

1. RDF documents containing abouteach and abouteachprefix are in error,
and are illegal. (This is what Dave's examples do).

2. Constructions containing abouteach or AEP are rendered impotent, but
the files are otherwise parsed as-is, and a warning omitted. In this
case, those tests should be renamed, Jos' triples confirmed as the
results of them, and we flag the tests as raising a warning in each
case.

The "be liberal in what you accept" would lead to answer 2; however, the
syntax document now describes an RDF without the appropriate
productions, so perhaps answer 1 is correct (and maybe the grammar needs
error productions for these?)

It's a sad fact that the word "semantics" seems to have lost all meaning.
