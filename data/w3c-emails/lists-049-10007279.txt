No, I'm simply talking about consistency in the interpretation of
the terms, not that the definition of the terms is machine
interpretable also. I.e. foo:blarg always means the same thing and
it is clear (somewhere, even if only in prose for humans) what it
means and all applications intepret it the same way.

At present, the terms identified in my earlier post do not have
such consistent interpretation because they have no actual
definition of their meaning and thus ambiguity and conflicts are
possible.

If we're not going to give them meaning, fine, but let's be clear
and up-front about it so that (less technical) users are not given
the impression that they actually do have defined meaning, which
IMO their use in examples, in any of the RDF documents, suggest.
