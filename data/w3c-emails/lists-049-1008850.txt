we've updated http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/rdfd-rules.n3
accordingly as well as etc http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/p8e.n3
as you may see we have rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a and 5b
but there may seem something strange with 5a and 5b
the intent is to represent bNodes at the THEN side
anyhow, it seems to work (at least for that test case)

have a very nice weekend!
