Hmmm, I'm not so sure about that.  I think that datatypes as interpretation 
properties will be used, and it was Patrick that argued that he didn't want 
multiple uri's, and Pat's rather neat model theory trick that allows a 
resource to have both a class and a property extension.

If we say that the URI denotes the class, I wonder if we run into problems 
with the fact that its up to xsd to say what the URI denotes and into 
issues with the using the same uri for both the class and the property.

My mental model was that the URI denoted the datatype, as specified by the 
xsd folks - its their uri after all, and we define what the class extension 
of that URI is.
