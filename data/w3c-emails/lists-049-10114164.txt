Since I grubbed around in the source of
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Dec/att-0029/00-rc#
for these, here they are FYI

dfn-blank-node-id
dfn-datatype-mapping
dfn-lexical-space
dfn-value-space
dfn-asserted
dfn-rdf-XMLLiteral
dfn-rdf-triple
dfn-subject
dfn-predicate
dfn-object
dfn-property
dfn-rdf-graph
dfn-node
dfn-blank-node
dfn-URI-reference
dfn-literal
dfn-lexical-form
dfn-language-identifier
dfn-datatype-URI
dfn-plain-literal
dfn-typed-literal

which at some point will all be relative to
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#

Anchors for non-definitions that must remain to keep old docs working are:
  xtocid103646 now section-triples
  xtocid103647 now section-rdf-graph
