But intended by whom? If they are intended by the RDF Core WG, then
they should be normative. If they are intended by someone else, why
should we say anything about them or even include the terms in the
RDF vocabulary.

The purpose of RDF, and the vocabulary defined by RDF, is to facilitate
consistent and unambiguous interpretation across arbirrary disparate 
systems.

The terms in question do not serve that purpose but are actually in
direct conflict with that ultimate goal.

Either they have meaning that users can rely on or they don't. If
users cannot rely on those terms having consistent meaning -- if we
are not saying even that those terms SHOULD have such meaning, if
it's just a MAY (and I believe that's all it is) then we are doing
a disservice to users by not making that clear, as most users will
presume SHOULD if not MUST and will be confused when that is not
reflected by reality.

Again, I have no problem with the wording being changed. I was tasked to
propose some verbage and I gave it my best shot. Obviously it is lacking
in various ways. Fair enough. I encourage recommendations from the WG
that will help make it more optimal and fit in with the present content
of the Primer.

Yes, there are various caveats in the Primer about these terms, but
they are not IMO sufficiently clear and explicit about the key point
that there are no requirements nor guaruntees as to how these terms
might be interpreted by applications.

Precisely. I think that the Primer should reflect, in minimally technical
and accessible terms the normative content of the other documents, and
the examples and verbage for these terms does in fact suggest that RDF
is asserting meaning for these terms which it is not.

Perhaps what is needed is for the Primer to include only the short
comment about these terms, something along the lines of what I
proposed but worded far better than I was capable of doing, and no further 
examples or discussion of them in the Primer at all, and then produce a
separate document, e.g. a Note, that presents historical and/or suggestive 
usage for these terms. 

The more I think about this issue, the more it seems that we have 
really dropped the ball in keeping them in the vocabulary at all. I mean 
kriminy, is there really any point to defining a term without saying what 
it means and thus constraining its use to that interpretation?! Ugh... If
M&S blew it by failing to be sufficiently clear and those terms no longer 
have a reliable consistent interpretation because different folks have
assumed different interpretations, then let's say so and deprecate 
them -- or choose the "best" meaning and say so normatively, even if some 
folks will have to fix their usage...

Quite.
