Sorry, I don't buy it.

I'm not concerned about what COULD be true in some closed environment,
but what IS true globally because there is explicit meaning that is
shared by all agents when interpeting the same terms, based on some
authoritative definition of that meaning.

It may very well be that for some system, some usage of a term may
be consistent and true, but if a given term has ambiguous semantics
such that inferences drawn in one context are true and inferences
drawn in another context are false, that's unacceptable.

I.e. in your system you may say that the value of rdfs:isDefinedBy
is an RDF Schema instance, but in my system, I might presume a broader
interpretation of the term, and hence for my data, your conclusion
that

IF
   aaa rdfs:isDefinedBy xxx .
THEN
   xxx rdf:type schemas:XMLSchema .

may in fact be false because you presume to much of rdfs:isDefinedBy
and the inference is not valid for all usage of that term!

Eh?
