The problem you see with isDefinedBy etc., won't be any different when
it comes to application vocabularies. xyz:Document, abc:Person, def:Event, etc.

Yet we're still encouraging people to go create schemas for such 
things and use them. Do you believe their classes and properties
to be 'meaningless'?
