I'd like feedback from Jos, Pat, JJC in particular on the false document
issue herein.


I'm bringing the manifest up-to-date, but I'd like some quick feedback
on a couple of issues (one of which involves the "always false document"
notion).


Firstly: despite wandering off somewhat and highlighting that we need to
feed back to XML schema,
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest.rdf#semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes
was not approved at the 2002-11-22 telecon. However, everyone seems
convinced of its truth (including DanC, who we take to be our voice of
the XMLSchema WG).

That is, that
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/test005a.nt
[[
<http://example.org/foo> <http://example.org/bar> "10"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> .
]]
entails
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/test005b.nt
[[
<http://example.org/foo> <http://example.org/bar> "10.0"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal> .
]]


If everyone's happy with this as being noncontroversial, can I approve
this?


Secondly: I was actioned to create a test case where a well-formed DT
clashes with a range constraint. (Such a document comes out false
according to the MT). This brings me to address the definition of
entailment test cases; I'd like them (and so would the mathematicians
present, I get the impression) to actually reflect _entailments_, not
some approximation thereof.

To represent the test case I've been tasked to write, I therefore need
to add the notion of a "false document" to the entailment test case
definition. Currently the premise and conclusion document declarations
in an entailment test case can take one of the following two forms:

[[
<test:premiseDocument>
  <test:NT-Document rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/test005a.nt" />
</test:premiseDocument>
]]

or

[[
<test:conclusionDocument>
 <test:RDF-XML-Document rdf:about="http://example.org/blah.rdf" />
</test:conclusionDocument>
]]

I would like to add the following construct as a premise or conclusion
"document":

[[
<test:conclusionDocument>
  <test:False-Document />
</test:conclusionDocument>
]]

That is, a document that always "comes out false" under any
interpretation. It's not constructible using "plain" RDF so I'd
rather just add support in this format. Jos, can you add support for
this?

That being OK, I'm going to add the following test case:

[[
<ex:a> <ex:b> "25"^^xsd:decimal .
<ex:b> rdfs:range xsd:string .
]]

ENTAILS

{ a test:False-Document }



I'll take another pass over the DT test cases tomorrow; in particular,
the ill-formed-literal test case can be simplified as it currently
stands.

Cheers,
jan
