Ah, wait. There are two issues here.

1. Getting XML Schema sorted out. This requires liaison and 
Eric-level cooperation and God knows how much time.

2. Writing up the XSD -as-an-RDF-datatype summary of all the 
XSD-style entailments that an XSD-savvy RDF engine (sorry, Dan) would 
need to assume true, purely as an informative exercise and taking the 
XSD spec at face value, putting the best interpretation on its 
intended meaning (and the one that they are almost certain to settle 
with once they get their terminological knickers untwisted.)  Based 
on - largely a transcript of - the tables in Jeremy's document.

  Seems to me that we can do the latter quite quickly and that it 
would be handy for our readers and also a useful contribution to the 
terms of our charter. This was the thing I was assuming that we would 
want to refer to.
