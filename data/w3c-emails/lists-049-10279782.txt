I am happy with that one
we also have running code for that testcase

yes, see below

Jan, for the moment we've done that in
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/xsd-rules
(but it's very incomplete...)

[[[
### inconsistency/incompleteness detections @@

{ :xsdI1 . ?p rdfs:range xsd:string . ?s ?p ?x^^xsd:decimal } log:implies
{ _:x a test:False-Document } .
]]]

and then indeed we can derive from above that

_:y a test:False-Document .


hope this helps...

O great
BTw, could you temporarily remove/escape the double quotes
in "badly-formed" in /2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/Manifest.rdf
(this is of course not strictly needed, but I am getting
as input corrupted triples from the Jena-1.6.0 N3 output)
