The issue is closed.  We've stopped polishing the decisions.  We are 
finishing the text.

Pat, your brief from the telcon was:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0075.html

[[
ACTION 2002-12-06#1 PatH: suggest alternate text on rdf:value for
   primer by Monday 9th

ACTION 2002-12-06#2 PatH: update the rdf:value desc in the semantics doc
]]

This was in the context of my summary (I think I said this and its 
misattributed in the log)

   http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2002-12-06#T15-15-52

[[
   path: your concern is the stuff in the primer; make sure it does not 
look like formal inferencing from reading the text
]]

which you agreed to:

   http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2002-12-06#T15-15-59

[[
PatH: yes, that's it
]]

You agreed to a request to propose alternative text that made it clear 
there were no formal inferences from rdf:value.

Would you like someone else to pick up this action?

And just so you don't think I'm just beating you up on process, I suggest 
your proposal is fatally flawed.  M&S contains the weight example:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#examples


Section 7.3 has

   <John_Smith> n:weight    _:m .
   _:m          rdf:value   "200" .
   _:m          n:units     n:Pounds .

Whilst this example as it stands wouldn't have a problem with the proposed 
entailment:

   <John_Smith> n:weight    "200" .

I don't think its unreasonable to extend it to include:

   n:weight   rdfs:range    n:Weight .

and then it does.

We've been here.  We made our decision.  Let it stand and let the community 
comment on it.

Brian
