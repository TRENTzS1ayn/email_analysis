Well, OK, not a big deal. I guess I was just worried that what you 
say in the Primer about collections/containers/reification is pretty 
much *exactly the same* as what I say in the MT doc, in some cases in 
almost the same words and with the same examples. So it just seems 
like duplication, is all I meant; and since the MT is, arguably, kind 
of overloaded with expanatory prose in any case (for an MT doc, that 
is), why not do some redundancy-pruning?. I wasnt meaning to get 
involved with normative/informative issues particularly. About half 
the semantics doc is explicitly labelled as non-normative in any case.

No, and I had a perfectly fine formal MT for it, but the WG decided 
that we shouldnt use it. I still am puzzled about this decision, 
which was apparently taken on the grounds of 'RDF style'. Hey ho.
