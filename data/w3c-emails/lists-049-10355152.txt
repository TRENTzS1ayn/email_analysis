I agree 100% about the duplication, and what you suggested made perfect 
sense to me, except that if things said in the MT doc are "meaningful", 
and the same things said in the Primer are "meaningless", then let's by 
all means say them in the MT doc, where we presumably "mean" them more 
(or something).  Sheesh.

Right.  This is a good illustration of the problem.  Can we legitimately 
have a normatively-stated intent for some construct, without having a 
formal MT for it ("intent" as opposed to "we will absolutely guarantee 
you can never use this inconsistently with our intent, and we have 
entailments that describe all aspects of that intent")?  This is 
presumably an example of where we do.  I claim there are other examples.
