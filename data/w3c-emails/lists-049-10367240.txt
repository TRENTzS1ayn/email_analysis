The latest version now has all references to 'engines' purged from 
it, has rdf:value put back into its (very small) place, and has a few 
patches to the treatment of XMLLiteral, which had a few pieces 
missing (there's a new condition in the RDFS semantics and the RDF 
XMLLit conditions have been rewritten more carefully.). To track the 
changes (apart from the elisions) follow the mud-colored highlighting.

Still figure 2 and the XML tagging to put into it, will be done by Friday.
