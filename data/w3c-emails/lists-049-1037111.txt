This appears to be consistent with DC practice.

Should the property dct:mesh actually be dct:MESH? since that
is the URI (qname) of the datatype in question?

As an aside... (really ;-)

Per http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pstickler-val-00.txt I would say

  <val:(http://purl.org/dc/terms/MESH)D08.586.682.075.400>
      rdfs:label "Formate Dehydrogenase" .

This way, you only have to define the label once, rather than for every
single occurrence of the datatype value.

Of course, this also encourages one to just say

  _:page 
     dc:subject <val:(http://purl.org/dc/terms/MESH)D08.586.682.075.400> .

but we won't go there ;-)

At first glance, it looks OK. This presumes that the value space of
dct:DCSV is a subset of the value space of dct:Point (though there
need not be any intersection of their lexical spaces).

It's nice to see the datatyping proposal resulting in some
compression of the DC idioms ;-)
