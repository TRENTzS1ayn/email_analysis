Well, you may have noticed that I didnt take part in that discussion. 
Seems to me that whatever we say is going to get pored over, read, 
re-read, argued about till kingdom come, and whether or not we have 
marked some of it as more normative than other parts isnt likely to 
amount to hill of beans.

Well, yes. Whether we SHOULD or not is another matter, but I'll agree 
to shut up about that until after final call.
