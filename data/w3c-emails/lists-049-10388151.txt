If we have now agreed (and I think we have) that

   rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .

then the text in the Vocabulary doc about rdf:object

"No range is defined for this property since values of rdfs:object can include both Literals and Resources"

now seems incorrect. And in fact, we should explicitly define the
range of rdf:object to be rdfs:Resource.

Right?
