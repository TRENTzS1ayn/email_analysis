Interestingly, the text in the Vocabulary document would suggest that
any value of rdfs:isDefinedBy is expected to be an RDF schema, since
it is a subPropertyOf rdfs:seeAlso, which is described in the Vocabulary
doc as

"rdfs:seeAlso
The property rdfs:seeAlso is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional RDF information about the subject resource."


Perhaps "RDF" is there by accident? "RDF information" sure sounds like

an RDF Schema to me...
