I never said the text in the Primer was meaningless. Only that
it was not normative, and thus, if the only place certain intended
meaning of terms was stated was in the Primer, such meaning
could be ignored and hence the terms had not normative meaning.

I think the Primer itself is top notch. Sorry if you thought I
was making any criticisms of the Primer itself.
