It does. There are now three items to "datatype support" as far as the
test cases are concerned, listed in
http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-tests/

Namely: (for any supported datatypes x and y)
- detection of well-formed literals
- deciding if a^^x denotes the same value as b^^y
- deciding if a^^x denotes a value in y

The last one is an additional requirement to support range checking as
described by rdf-semantics.

Cheers,
jan
