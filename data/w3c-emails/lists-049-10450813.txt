My eye has been off the ball recently, so my apologies if this is covering 
ground already discussed.  I think what I say here is mostly reinforcing 
what Frank said (below).

It seems we're getting hung up on issues of normative and formal 
definition.  I think its clear that a vocabulary can be defined normatively 
("intended" meaning) without being defined (or definable) formally.  True, 
without formal definition said meaning is not accessible to formal 
reasoners, but that doesn't mean it's in all respects meaningless.

So, lack of formal definition for a term doesn't mean it can't be defined 
normatively.

This begs a question of where such non-formal definitions should appear;  I 
think Frank hinted that the vocabulary document might be the right 
place:  "(actually, I think Schema covers that, at least about our 
"intent", and also does so for the other terms mentioned in the 
following)".  That makes sense to me given that the vocabulary document is 
now about more than just the schema vocabulary.
