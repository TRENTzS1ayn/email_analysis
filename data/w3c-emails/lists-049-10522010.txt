Yes, this text has my mind reeling. My understanding of the 
reification vocabulary was that the rdf:subject and rdf:object of a 
reified triple were the things that the subject and object of the 
original triple denoted. In which case the rdf:object is always a 
literal VALUE rather than the literal itself, so yes, indeed, it can 
be said to be in rdfs:Resource. So the range is rdfs:Resource, and 
this should be altered.
