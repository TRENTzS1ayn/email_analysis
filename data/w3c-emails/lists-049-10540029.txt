Good news.

On the subject of pruning, I would encourage you to do so, in general.  I 
was thinking the semantics doc was getting a bit discursive in 
places.  Where there is discursive text in the semantics doc, and the topic 
is covered in the primer and the semantics doc can do its job without it, 
then I'd encourage elimination of the duplication.
