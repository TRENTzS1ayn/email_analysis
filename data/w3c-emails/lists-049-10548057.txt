I think one of the issues we have here is that we are bit behind with the 
vocabulary document and that is leaving a bit of a hole.  In this regard I 
think I am agreeing with some comments Graham made earlier.

I suggest that any normative statements that must be made about vocabulary 
terms, but that are not model theoretic in nature, are made in the 
vocabulary document.

That way, Pat is free to slim down the semantics document.

Please can we just get on and write up the decisions that we have already made.
