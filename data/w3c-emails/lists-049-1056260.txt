This is a fairly long message, and a call for volunteers. Topics covered:
outstanding tests that need approving; entailment tests; manifest files.


-- Outstanding tests that need approving.

Basically, I could do with some spare pairs of eyes to check that
I've not missed anything - I've been back over the minutes a couple of
times, and failed to find resolutions that approve the following files;
some of these have no issue attached to them.

If anyone _does_ find any of these, please let me know directly.
Otherwise, they need reviewing and approving or dropping. There may well
be some in here that were approved at the recent F2F that I've missed.

- entailment tests and manifest files.

I'm currently populating each subdirectory with Manifest.rdf files that
describe the tests in that directory. They're currently minimal. As
issues are decided by the WG, these files should be updated (as of now,
pretty much, I'm going to be using these to drive the test case
document). They're all in a straightforward format suitable for parsing
without the aid of an RDF parser; however, they're also all legal RDF (I
hope!) See

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/skeleton/

for the cheesy hack to stick these together and the sample files. Most
of the current directory contents are based around parser tests - that's
what populate.pl expects to build a manifest file for.


As per the action/decision in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0010.html

I've added the following tests (without a related issue):

statement-entailment/test001a.ntNOT_ISSUEPENDINGhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0476.html
statement-entailment/test001b.ntNOT_ISSUEPENDINGhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0476.html
statement-entailment/test002a.ntNOT_ISSUEPENDINGhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0476.html
statement-entailment/test002b.ntNOT_ISSUEPENDINGhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0476.html

That the entailments in each case should not be drawn is detailed in
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/statement-entailment/Manifest.rdf

(similar file in the skeleton/ directory). I'd like Jos to have a final
rundown of this, to ensure that it meets his needs. Basically, an
entailment test is either positive (if the entailment should hold) or
negative. Included in the test description are one or more
<test:entailmentRules> properties that indicate if the rules for
RDF-entailment, RDFS-entailment (or, in the future, OWL-entailment)
should be used. Again, the format is pretty much fixed.

Cheers,
jan

PS. Incidentally, IMHO the WG is to be congratulated on the consistently
high standard of the minutes. I stand ready to retract this when it
turns out that there _were_ decisions on all of the above that I've
missed :-)
