2002-11-22#1  janG  ensure test cases themselves are named using frag IDs

2002-11-22#2  jang  [test case fix] remove RDFS entailment rules from the 
language-ignored-for-numeric-types cases.

2002-11-22#3  patH  Tie MT datatype to the sec that points out language 
isn't important to DT entailment (except for rdf:XMLLiteral)

2002-11-22#4  jjc  create an example.org DT-entailment showing that 
language is not relevant.

2002-11-22#5  jjc  check that RDF Concepts does not allow a synonym for

Semantics editor's draft and its effect on test cases.

2002-12-06#7  JanG  Find the test cases with rdf:RDF issues (we think

datatyping (sec 4.3 ?)
