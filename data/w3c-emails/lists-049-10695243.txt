I was trying to check a test case to confirm something in 
Concepts/Semantics docs, and found that:

   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/Manifest.rdf

returned an HTTP 403/Forbidden error page.

Also:

re: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test003.rdf
The comment is misleading - there is no xml:lang - though the test is OK, I 
think.

Do we have any entailment tests dealing with language-tagged plain literals?

E.g.

1.

     ex:subject ex:prop "chat" .
?entails?
     ex:subject ex:prop "chat"@fr .

2.

     ex:subject ex:prop "chat"@en .
?entails?
     ex:subject ex:prop "chat" .

3.

     ex:subject ex:prop "chat"@en .
?entails?
     ex:subject ex:prop "chat"@fr .

I think the answer is no in each case, and that would be in agreement with 
my readiong of the docs.
Should these be negative entailment test cases?
