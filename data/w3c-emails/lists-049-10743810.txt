There is now a sentence about subsets of rdfs:Resource generally, in 
section 3.3:

--------
Since ICEXT(I(rdfs:Resource)) is the universe, everything has 
rdfs:Resource as an rdf:type value, and every class is a subclass of 
rdfs:Resource.Such assertions would be redundant, therefore.

Similarly, some domain and range assertions are omitted from the 
above table; in those cases, the domain or range of the property may 
be taken to be rdfs:Resource, i.e. the universe; such range and 
domain assertions are essentially vacuous.
