The last call candidate WD is attached to this email in the form of a
zip file of the content HTML, PNG/SVG images, RDF/XML and NTexamples
and the RELAXNG schema.

This addresses the blank node identifier scoping issue with the words
as agreed in the 2002-12-13 telcon.

This corresponds to CVS version 1.452 of
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/
