A minor problem.  You refer to Figure 5 in the RDF Primer.  

a.  The Primer version
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20021124.html
introduced a new Figure in Section 1, but temporarily numbered it
"Figure 0" to avoid going through and renumbering all the figures until
I "figured" out how many there were actually going to be.  If that gets
changed to Figure 1, all the other Figures will have their numbers
bumped, so Figure 5 becomes Figure 6.  [mea culpa;  I should have caught
this earlier]  However, if folks have no problem with a "figure 0" (in
Section 1) we can leave it alone.

b.  The same version of the Primer has a redrawn version of that Figure
(same topology, same labels, just looks different);  no SVG version of
the new one.
