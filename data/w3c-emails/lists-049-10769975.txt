Right, been over these once more. I reckon that the approved/pending
cases are all ok (but would like verification from jjc / daveb if poss.)

Currently the WD doesn't list PENDING test cases in its representation
of the manifest file - see here instead:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/allTestCases.html

(which is the same table but with everything in it).

That is:

- I'm currently running parser tests using arp + some munging to get new
ntripls out + ntc. I'd like a second opinion (jjc) to run approved +
pending parser tests if poss (positive and negative).


I'll drag a copy of the manifest file, including all approved + pending
cases, into the document over the weekend: that represents LCC.
