[wondering what RSN might mean...]

you've made up a good test vocabulary Jan !!
I'm trying to adapt our running code for that
and for the moment it uses NT/N3 documents, so
I have to do conversions using ARP and/or CWM

for the .../rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.rdf
I get some errors like

[[[
   http://jena.hpl.hp.com/arp/not/a/real/uri/[20:125]: {E201} Syntax
   error when processing attribute rdf:resource.
   Cannot have attribute rdf:resource in this context.
]]]

so I've (*) added a couple of rdf:parseType="Resource" attributes
(as well as test:NT-Document elements for the PositiveEntailmentTest)
and that worked for ARP as well as for with CWM

what I'm going to do is:
  o assert .../rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.nt
  o prove .../rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.nt
    but in the mean time also create/setup new engines per
      eee a ts:PositiveEntailmentTest .
      eee ts:premiseDocument [ ts:NT-Document aaa ] .
      eee ts:entailmentRules [ ts:NT-Document bbb ] .
      eee ts:conclusionDocument [ ts:NT-Document ccc ] .
    so that we can also prove the entailments at the end

[coming back later]
