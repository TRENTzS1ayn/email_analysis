   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0075.html

DanC not present, MikeD was
Minutes otherwise approved



6: Confirm Status of Completed Actions

ACTION: 2002-11-22#6 danc
   review RDF Semantics, with a particular view to "define a language, not 
a software spec"
ACTION: 2002-12-06#1 patH
   suggest alternate text on rdf:value for primer by Monday 9th
ACTION: 2002-12-06#3 PatrickS
   draft one paragraph about rdfs:isDefinedBy and other terms to draw out 
them for readers of the primer
ACTION: 2002-12-06#5 jjc
   Do concepts doc section renumbering/reordering by Tuesday 10th Dec
ACTION: 2002-12-06#11 bwm
   work out the voting process for last call  approval, possibly involving 
email.

All actions approved complete.


7: Primer

See:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Dec/att-0053/00-rc
(posted today)

Aiming for last call candidate by next Thursday (2002-12-19)

Some discussion of example labelling:  left to editor discretion.
Some discussion of rdf:value issue:  this is settling down.  Semantics 
document now has some normative text.  Will change "primary value" to "main 
value".

ACTION 2002-12-13#1, bwm:  update schedule (for all documentss)


8: Concepts Doc

See:
   http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it/jeremy/RDF-concepts/20021121/Overview.html

Checking synonym for rdf:XMLLiteral is not allowed.
Current WG intent is synonym is not allowed, so can be checked syntactically.

ACTION 2002-12-13#2, Jeremy: to revise doc to say datatype *URI* is 
rdf:XMLLiteral...

Otherwise, document is ready as last call candidate (LCC).

ACTION 2002-12-13#3, PatrickS:  review concepts LCC doc in entirety
ACTION 2002-12-13#4, JanG:  review concepts LCC doc in entirety

Timeframe for review:
10-Jan-2003 is time for final decision, so comments should be in with time 
to react.

Purely editorial comments are OK, but editors discouraged from doing purely 
editorial changes at this time.

Note, LCC document with agreed edit was posted during the telecon:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Dec/att-0059/01-rc


9: Semantics Doc
See:
   http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_finalCall.html
a url Brian finds encouragingly named.
The most recent version is:
   http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_finalCall_1.html

ACTION 2002-12-13#5, JanG: review semantics doc in entirety
ACTION 2002-12-13#6, Jos:  review semantics doc in entirety
ACTION 2002-12-13#7, GK:   review semantics doc in entirety
Timeframe as before.


10: Syntax Document

Dave claims document is ready for last call.

One concern raised, see:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002OctDec/0276.html

This is to do with scope of NodeIds and external entity references.
DECIDED:  scope nodeIds to containing document root XML element (i.e. 
unique root element in document infoset).

ACTION 2002-12-13#8, DaveB:  apply change to syntax as noted
ACTION 2002-12-13#9, Jeremy: review syntax
[Scribe:  was only one reviewer collared?]

New syntax document posted during telecon at:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/att-0225/01-rdfxml.zip


11: Schema/Vocabulary document

Work progresses, some delays.
Surprise that literal values are subset of resources.
Aiming for candidate document snapshot next week.
Goal to make final decision for LC on 17-Jan-2003 (or 10-Jan-2003 if poss)

PatH noted that it was sometimes difficult to track down latest versions of 
documents.  Would like a master index of latest versions.  Brian said he'd 
maintain the group overview pages when new WDs (editors drafts?) are issued.


12: Testcases

Some issues, see:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0447.html

JanG needs feedback from Jos, and some other stuff, before having a LCC for 
test cases.

Testcase todo list:
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/todo.html

Jos will aim to validate all entailment tests over weekend

JanG can't find approval for some test cases.  See:
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/allTestCases.html

ACTION 2002-12-13#10, Jeremy: review all unapproved parser tests before 10 Jan
ACTION 2002-12-13#11, DaveB:  review all unapproved test cases before 10 Jan
ACTION 2002-12-13#12, JanG: identify specific reviewers for unapproved test 
cases

Clarification that last call candidate for test case document includes both 
document and test cases.  Not all test cases need be approved before LC, 
but there should be no known errors.

The manifest file is up to date as of today.  Revised today (2002-12-13).

DanC sent a message about container test cases -- JanG hasn't seen/acted on 
that yet.

Target for test case LCC -- next Friday (2002-12-20)

----

Some miscellaneous discussion about all/any documents.

PatH asks about references to non-W3C web sites.  It's OK to keep these, 
but suggested that rather than direct links from text, better link to 
glossary, then externally from glossary.

(NOTE: this suggests more edits for Semantics document;  no specific action 
noted)

Jos requests no quotes in comments in test cases -- causes some software 
problems.


13: Schedule

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#microschedule

Last-call candidates:
   semantics:   today     (2002-12-13)

ACTION 2002-12-13#13, em:  fix up liaison with DC architecture group for LC 
review coordination


14: Publication Process

See:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0518.html

For passing pubrules cross-link requirements, propose maintain all docs in 
CVS space with different URI but same relation as final docs.  Use this to 
check cross-links.  Then do final conversion (with script) on final 
publication.

We will try Jeremy's suggestion.
First, Brian will set up directory structure in RDFcore CVS area.
Brian to proxy access to CVS for PatH.

Nominal publication date (for document naming) will be 2003-01-17


15: LBase Document

See:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Oct/0046.html
