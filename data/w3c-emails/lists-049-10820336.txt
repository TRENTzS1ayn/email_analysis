Ive added the following paragraph to the section on datatype 
interpretations in the Semantics doc.  (I realized that the current 
text was not actually accurate, since it said that the generic 
datatype conditions applied to rdf:XMLLiteral as well as all the 
others, so Ive tweaked that.)

Now, further to the above, what exactly should I link it to???

--------

The semantic conditions for the built-in datatype rdf:XMLLiteral have 
been described in previous sections; but in a datatyped 
interpretation, in addition, a graph which contains a literal with a 
non-well-formed XML string or an illegal language tag, and which is 
typed with rdf:XMLLiteral is always considered a datatype violation. 
These semantic conditions are exactly similar to [those for other 
datatypes] if one defines the lexical space of rdf:XMLLiteral  as the 
set all XML documents and all pairs of XML documents and language 
tags, and L2V(I(rdf:XMLLiteral)) as XML canonicalization. The 
possible inclusion of language tags makes this a special case, 
however: in all other cases, RDF ignores any language tags which 
occur in typed literals.
