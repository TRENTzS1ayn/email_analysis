Actually, I think you should use the dated version.  I suggest using the 
date 20030117 as that is our target publication date.  It'll be broken for 
now, but we can fix that up in the replicated TR space I'm going to create.

What link are you using for the primer?

   http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/

just worked for me.  Temporary glitch?
