If Jeremy responds in time, take his word for it, but in the absence of 
that I'd link to:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Dec/att-0053/00-rc#dfn-datatype-mapping

which isn't exactly right, but the closest.  I'd also put an @@ on it to 
confirm.

Looks good but I don't believe I'm a competent judge in this area.
