I've created a directory TR under RDFCore in the cvs structure.  It contains:

   WD-rdf-concepts-20030117
   WD-rdf-mt-20030117
   ...

for building the last call docs.

The root of each doc should be called

   Overview.html

Editors with CVS access please feel free to populate.  If this works then 
I'll point the ed's working drafts at these pages.

Please report status as you update.

Eric/Danbri - please can you make sure these are publicly visible.  I 
haven't put in a readme of any form - feel free to add if we should have one.

Brian
