Taking a fine-tooth comb to the connection
between the semantics document and the
schema spec, I followed a link and found

"*  A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language
identifier."

in

2.3.4 Literals
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/

We're changing that to

* A plain literal is either a string
or a string paired with a language
identifier.

or

* plain literals are the union
of strings with (string, language
identifier) pairs.

no?

Darn it, it's still there in

I've asked for that 3 times now, haven't I?

Maybe you declined it and told me why not;
but I don't recall seeing satisfactory
justification. i.e. I'm not convinced.

This is a critical comment.

If the editor declines it, please consider
this message a request to re-open
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure

in light of the new info about datatypes
since our decision of 26Feb.
