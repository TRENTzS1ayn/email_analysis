I see:

"Encode the resulting Unicode string in UTF-8 to form the corresponding
XML document."

but XML documents are character sequences,
not byte sequences.

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-well-formed

Er... actually, there might be more than
one entity in a document, in which case
it's not clear that the whole thing is
one character sequence.

Ugh... maybe it's not clear what an
XML document is. But I don't see how
UTF-8 is relevant to the definition
you gave.

I suggest taking it out.
