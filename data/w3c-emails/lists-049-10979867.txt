Hmm... this seems so straightforward
to me that I must be missing something...

Consider: interpretation I1, which binds
my:dan to me in the present
my:age to A1
In I1, EXT(A1) is { <me in the present, 35> }

and interpretation I2 which binds
my:dan to me ten years from now
my:age to A2
In I2, EXT(A2) is { <me ten years from now, 45> }


or even simpler: in I1,
my:thisYear denotes the year 2002
and in I2,
my:thisYear denotes the year 2012

i.e. one interpretation might be the world
today, and another might be the world tomorrow.
Another might be the world as of some HTTP
request, and another might the the world as
of a later HTTP response.

'the set of interpretations'... umm... I don't know what
to make of that... the set of all possible interpretations?
I don't suppose that changes over time (though my brain
hurts to think of what that set looks like).

Right; of course not.

I'm not saying they're temporally parameterized; I'm just
saying that each interpretation is its own world, and
some of those worlds might be sorta like snapshots
of the the one we know and at different times.

umm... this goes well beyond what goes
in the RDF spec, but if you will,
consider a semantic extension that
binds my:now to the current time
(or perhaps the time when some request is received),
and includes a class :YearsBefore2010.
Then take the formula

my:now rdf:type :YearsBefore2010.

It'll be entailed by the empty formula
this year, but not in 10 years.

Maybe this testing point is a total red herring...

Yeah, but entailment is about stuff that works
for *all* interpretations.

I'm just saying that one interpretation might look
one way, and another interpretation might look another way.

Perhaps I distracted you with the word 'consistently'...
I didn't mean it in its formal logical sense.
The formal semantics of RDF aren't constrained by HTTP nor HTML.

But informally, one can use HTTP and HTML to observe
that interpretations that satisfy
<http://www.w3.org/> dublinCore:title "bananas"
are not very closely related to the world in which we live.

One can build semantic extensions of RDF that take
HTTP into account, is what I'm saying, I guess.

Well, there is for example this text in a draft of one
of the RDF specs:

"The social conventions surrounding use of RDF assume that any RDF URI
reference gains its meaning from some defining individual, organization
or context. This applies most notably to RDF predicate URI references. "

Sorry, I didn't notice it. Note that I didn't label it WRONG.
I just said it overstates the case.

Yes, as a formal matter, they're just logical names.
But we expect those logical names to get sorta
connected to the world in which we live via HTTP
and other communications mechanisms, as discussed
in the "Meaning of RDF" section of the concepts document,
right?
