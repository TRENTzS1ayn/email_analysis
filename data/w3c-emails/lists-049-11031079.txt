Well yes, all true if these are just different interpretations; but 
there is nothing in that to actually connect these interpretations to 
any assertions made at a particular time. The times in the 
interpretations, if there are any, and the times that things are 
posted on webpages have got nothing to do with one another. And 
interpretations can carry all kinds of extra baggage so there might 
be time-sensitive interpretations, but there are also interpretations 
in which, say, a property from 1066 is applied to a subject-object 
pair from 1997, and all kinds of stuff like that. Whereas I think you 
have the picture that the interpretations actually are *at* times, in 
some sense, taken as a coherent whole. Which does make sense, of 
course, but only has any actual bite, more than being just a kind of 
mathematical conceit, when one has some machinery in place which 
makes some semantic sense of this temporal indexing, eg say a tense 
logic. Then it makes sense to require that everything is located in 
some timeframe and interpretations are temporally coherent and so on.

Like making sausages, some things are best not looked at.

Some of them might be, but lots more of them won't.

Then we had better not have my:now be a uriref, seems to me. What you 
just said would give you a nonmonotonic logic if 'now' is treated 
just like a name. I think we need to start getting explicit about 
indexicals at some point, but we aren't there yet. If urirefs 
themselves are indexical then we need to re-write RDF from the ground 
up; that will be a major seismic change.

Right, and what I said was about entailment. So if something doesnt 
follow in ten years then it can't follow now either, since the 
ten-year-from-now interpretations are still perfectly fine 
interpretations now, as well. If they aren't supposed to be, then we 
need some way to rule out interpretations at one time that aren't 
ruled out at another time.

I think that what you also want/need is to have the interpretations 
switching on and off as the clock ticks. You want time-dependent 
entailments, right? You don't get them in RDF at present, sorry.

That doesn't refer to HTTP, though, right? The defining authority is 
using the urirefs in names in *its* RDF , same as everyone else.

Well, maybe I was just being crabby. I will draft a rewording that 
tries to not say anything too strong.
