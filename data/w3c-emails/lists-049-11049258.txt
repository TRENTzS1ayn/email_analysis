OK, I take your point. When done (probably late tonight) it will be 
on my website with the ending _2 instead of _1,  I'll leave the older 
one there.

Yes. Those later changes will be more to style than to content.

OK, will do. Content re-edits and fix broken links only.

The big content issue is whether plain literals are XSD strings. That 
needs to be decided, soon, and may require changes in several 
documents. I plan to simply be conspicuously agnostic on this issue 
in this draft of the semantics, by deleting the paragraph that Dan 
objects to. However I don't think that we should go to last call with 
this an open issue, I'd like to get it clear one way or the other. I 
predict that Dan C and Patrick will be at odds over this one. I have 
no axe to grind on this, but as editor Id rather the document was 
clear on the point.

Pat
