Er, well...  The next paragraph says:
[[
These social conventions are rooted in the URI specification [URI] and 
registration procedures [URI-REG]. A URI scheme registration refers to a 
specification of the detailed syntax and interpretation for that scheme, 
from which the defining authority for a given URI may be deduced. In the 
case of http: URIs, the defining specification is the HTTP protocol 
specification [HTTP], which specifies how to use the HTTP protocol to 
obtain a resource representation from the host named in the URI; thus, the 
owner of the indicated DNS domain controls (observable aspects of) the 
URI's meaning.
]]

But note:  nothing here impacts the formal semantics;  this talks about the 
social and technical conventions whereby URIs may gain authoritative 
meaning or intended interpretation.
