Strike that sentence. It is just plain wrong, even ridiculous. Social 
conventions were formed millenia ago. Social specification of meaning 
didn't start when HTTP was invented.

NO!!  It ought to be about *social* meaning, not *technical* 
conventions. There is nothing social about the http protocol 
specification. If it is a technical convention which influences 
meanings then it ought to be at least mentioned in the MT.  You seem 
to have sneaked some formal semantics in by the back door here, 
please take it back out again (or make it precise).

I read this part of the concepts doc as saying that one uses [URI] 
and [URI-REG] to *locate the defining authority*, not to *interpret* 
what the defining authority is saying. If it is saying more than 
that, it needs either to be removed, or to be re-written more clearly 
and unambiguously, and corresponding changes made in other documents.

I would suggest the following minimal revisions in any case, given 
the discussion in this thread.

1. Strike the first sentence.

2. Avoid the use of the word 'interpretation' in the second sentence 
(or give an explicit warning note to the effect that this is not the 
same word as used in the semantics document.)

3. Remove the phrase 'defining specification', which is misleading in 
this context. The HTTP protocol does not define the RDF 
interpretation of http: URIs.  (Right?? If this is wrong then we 
should specify *in the MT* that http: URIs have a particular way of 
being interpreted. That change would be easy to make and would not 
affect any of the formal stuff, but it would greatly increase the 
clarity for readers; assuming that it is true, of course. I am 
currently completely puzzled about this. We seem to have taken a 
180-degree turn on this issue in the last week or so, with no 
discussion (?).  This is far more basic and important than getting 
things like reification right.)
