I think you've confused S with L.

"let ... L be the set of language identifiers [RFC3066]"

but it's no good as a language identifier, is it?

Those are different graphs because
"http://example.org/abc" and
<http://example.org/abc> are different terms,
not because the URI http://example.org/abc
is different from the string 'http://example.org/abc'.
Hmm... I guess that means we can't let
the URI and the string-literal be terms
themselves... they do need to be sorta
wrapped in something, syntactically...

Maybe I'm barking up the wrong
tree here... I need what the term
"http://example.org/abc" to *denote*
a unicode string, but I don't need
the term itself to *be* a unicode string.

But somewhere there's a semantic consition
that literal terms denote themselves, no?

I guess I'll have to think about it some more...
