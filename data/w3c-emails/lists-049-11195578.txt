I think the motivation was to define as few possible ways
to say the same thing in the interest of efficient interchange.

We already have a way to explicitly express a datatype value.

We don't need two "official" ways to do the same thing.

That, of course, does not prevent anyone from using datatyping
properties as a proprietary methodology...
