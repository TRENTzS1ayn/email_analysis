That might be doublethink, but that isnt a correct conclusion. There 
isnt enough in this graph to insist that the application SHOULD use 
25, only that it COULD use 25, if it knew enough about the 'context' 
to know that strings were being used here to indicate their values. 
But it couldnt know that from the RDF alone, since the RDF graph is 
consistent with other possibilities (eg that literals really do mean 
numerals rather than numbers). The MT stops just where the RDF stops: 
it goes that far and no further. Some RDF customers don't want to go 
any further, it seems (eg Dublin Core).

It is UNarticulated because it depends on unarticulated content, ie 
something about the 'context' that isn't represented in the RDF 
graph. But the MT does not rule it out; it just doesn't aspire to 
describe it.

In order to say this we would need to know what 'delivers' means. It 
is quite possible for the RDF graph to in a sense 'deliver' enough 
information to enable some engine to determine that a value (eg 25) 
is in some broad sense relevant, even though there is nothing in the 
graph which actually denotes or names that value. I don't see any 
problem in this situation: the same could be said about RDF without 
datatyping, if the engine to which the RDF is delivered happens to 
know enough about the meaning of some uriref and its intended meaning 
to enable it to draw some extra conclusion, more than is explictly 
represented in the RDF graph itself. There is no way to legislate 
against such a situation, even if we wanted to do so (and I suggest 
that we do not want to, in any case.)

I dont think this has anything to do with the local/global datatyping 
issue as it has been discussed previously.

>  25 whereas
>the other delivers "25" should be made clear in the document

I think that this is clear: each idiom has nodes denoting things 
unambiguously (literals denoting strings and sometimes bnodes 
denoting values) and it also has unambiguous wellformedness 
constraints. There is no ambiguity that I can see.

I disagree, see above. The local and global (ie range-based) 
datatyping machinery all interoperate.
