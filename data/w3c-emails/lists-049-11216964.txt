Running ARP against the zip

all_20021213.zip

I had the following incorrect results (two not mine):

datatyping - my error - test001 test002

rdfms-nested-bagIDs 008 old nt file is correct, new one is wrong.

rdf-ns-prefix-confusion 0007 should be OBSOLETE.

(The version of ARP used is not yet publicly available - it should be in 
the jena2 cvs on sourceforge before christmas).
