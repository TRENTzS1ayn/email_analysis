Yes, you're right.  My apologies.

I thought that was what the text was trying to say.

Checks...
[[
Note: RDF Literals are distinct and distinguishable from RDF URI 
references; e.g. http://example.org as an RDF Literal (untyped, without a 
language identifier) is not equal to http://example.org as an RDF URI 
reference.

Hmmm, yes.  I guess we need to lose at least one of:

(a) URIs are nodes
(b) strings are nodes
(c) URIs are strings
(d) literal nodes denote themselves

I think you're saying that dropping (c) doesn't wash.  Not having thought 
this through, I'd been going with the idea that URIs are string-like things 
distinguishable from strings.  Which I now see is a bit like the XML 
datatype troubles you mentioned.

Hmmm...  <xsd:string,"string"> denotes "string" ?
