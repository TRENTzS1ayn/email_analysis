I'm puzzled by the use of "inconsistency" here .. my understanding is that 
technically, the concept of consistency depends on negation, which is not 
recognized in RDF.

[From Metalogic, Geoffrey Hunter:
"A system S is Simply Consistent iff for no formula A of S are both A and 
the negation of A theorems of S."  He then goes on to define absolute 
consistency for systems with the possibility to express negation of any 
formula.]

My take on this had been that a D-inconsistent graph is unsatisfiable.

Ah, I see you're using a different definition of inconsistency 
(http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_finalCall_2.html#glossInconsistent). 
So my comment becomes simply:  your definition of inconsistency seems to 
be, er, "inconsistent" with some other published definitions.
