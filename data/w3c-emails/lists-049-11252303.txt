OK, the words need to be better, but I don't think this is a 180-degree turn.

The particular words were an attempt to respond to an issue raised by DanC:

Nor did it end when HTTP was invented, surely?  I suspect we're using 
different interpretations here;  I regard the meaning assigned to character 
combinations used by teenagers in their mobile phone text messages to be a 
social convention as much as any word-meaning that was established 
millennia ago.  By "social convention" I mean something like a common 
understanding derived in part from social processes.

What I'm trying to capture here is the idea that there are "social 
conventions" which are in some way bound to technology deployments.  Again, 
using the mobile phone text message for example:  suppose I prepare and 
address a message to a colleague that describes some other person as a 
yob;  if I don't select the SEND function, but merely store it in my phone, 
I don't think I have libelled anyone.  But if I do select the SEND 
function, things change.  And if someone else steals my phone and decides 
to send the message, who is guilty of libel (modulo proof)?  I think the 
answers all depend on social conventions, some of which concern the use of 
technology.

Nothing here has any impact on the formal meaning.  So maybe that's one 
thing that needs to be clearer?

Also, my use of the phrase "rooted in" is wrong.   "derive in part from" 
maybe?  URI scheme registration is, after all, very much a social process.

I don't see how this is formal semantics.  How can this be clearer?

To my mind, technical != formal.

No, it's not saying more than that.  In this example, the technical 
mechanism is used to find out what the defining authority is saying (or not 
saying in the case of a non-200 response code), not how to interpret it.

I thought the relationship to URI scheme registration was an important 
point here.  Dan, help?

Yes, I agree, that's confusing.

Correct.  But it does tell you how to get hold of some "definitive" 
information that MAY be expressed in RDF and hence MAY be defining 
according to the RDF interpretation.   The same information at a different 
http: URI would not carry the same authority.  It was not my expectation 
that "defining specification" would necessarily indicate a formal 
definition, rather one that was authorized.

Which suggests to me:  s/defining/authorized/.

OK, the words need to be better, but I don't think this is a 180-degree turn.
