Then perhaps you should ask to re-open issue rdfms-assertion; the WG
has decided that...

"A combination of social (e.g. legal) and technical
machinery (protocols, file formats, publication frameworks) provide
the contexts that fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary of
some piece of RDF, and which distinguish assertions from other
uses (e.g. citations, denals or illustrations)."

I don't believe so.

I disagree.

'concede'? This has been my consistent position all along;
since long before this WG convened. (modulo quibbles
about 'location' versus 'resource')

I presume you meant http://www.w3.org/.

It denotes a generic web page; i.e. something that,
when sent a GET request, responds with a specific version.
