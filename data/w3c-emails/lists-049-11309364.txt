Well, prf:Numbers aren't specified by the RDF specs.
Plain literals are.

It's not for RDF to say how its own syntax (plain literals)
works with XML Schema datatypes?

I disagree. Our charter includes...

"RDF Schema must use and build upon XML Schema datatypes to the fullest
extent that is practical and appropriate."
 -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

I find it practical and appropriate to use XML Schema datatypes
in this case.
