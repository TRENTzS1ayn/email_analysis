Me too, which is why that sentence is silly. It seems to say that 
social processes were impossible before URIs were invented.

Seems to me that that is exactly what we should NOT be saying. The 
whole point of this stuff, I always thought, was that the 'social' 
notions of asserting publicly, referring to, responsibility for lying 
and being libellous, making promises, etc, etc, are all *just the 
same* as they always have been, that the technology doesnt *change* 
any of that, it just provides new ways to do all that old-fashioned 
stuff. And that RDF is part of that whole process, and should be 
understood as being; just because it is 'formal' doesn't enable users 
to wriggle out of their normal social obligations. Now, exactly *how* 
RDF publication gets treated in this social way is something that is 
not in our purview, seems to me: we ought not to even be trying to do 
that, that's like declaring how words shall be used by novelists in 
the future, or pre-guessing what the Supreme Court is going to 
decide. So for example maybe things will pan out so that at some 
future date, a new mime type is established and a dialect of RDF 
defined to allow 'ironic' RDF which is different in social meaning, 
but not formal meaning, from current RDF. We do not want to go on 
record as saying anything that would prevent that happening or 
require the RDF specs to be re-written if it does.

Right, but one wouldn't expect the phone manufacturer to be making 
pronouncements about usage and libel law, would you?

I really don't see why we even need to mention URI registration 
issues at all here. That seems to be someone else's business, unless 
we want to say that how RDF is interpreted depends in some subtle way 
on URI registration schemes: in which case, we should say what that 
way is, as clearly as possible.

The notion of 'definition' is DIRECTLY concerned with the same notion 
of meaning that the formal semantics addresses. If certain pieces of 
RDF are considered definitions rather than merely assertions, then we 
ought to have that distinction in the MT as clearly and explicitly as 
possible. And if, on the other hand, there is in fact no notion of 
'definition' in RDF semantics, then we shouldnt have a whole section 
of the concepts doc giving what reads like a dense, technical 
explanation of what this nonexistent idea is supposed to mean.

To my mind they are almost identical. Look at the definition of 
'formal' in the glossary.

By whom? To do what?

That would be better, although I think its inaccurate, since 
authorization can be transferred.  The intended meaning of 
owl:imports can be seen as a kind of transference of authorization, 
for example.

In general , this whole issue is a can of worms to get exactly right, 
so the less specific we are, the better, seems to me. We should be 
diluting the colors here, not painting bold clear strokes.

Can't we just say that all uris can be traced to their 'owner' using 
standard (ie non-RDF-particular) protocols and registration rules, 
and that any uses of a uriref in any RDF published by the owner of 
the uriref can be taken to be assertions made by the owner, and hence 
authoritative, but that the owner is not necessarily responsible for 
assertions made in RDF published by others, even if they use the 
owner's URIs. In other words, I cannot be held responsible for 
anything that someone else says using my vocabulary; but I am 
responsible for using other people's vocabulary in ways that reflect 
their published intended meanings.

Seems to me that this is about all that we need to say (maybe with 
some examples) and that it is potentially dangerous to say more than 
this. I would prefer to avoid all references to 'defining' or 
'definitive' or 'interpretation' when talking about RDF meanings.

OK, I see that it isn't. But the fact that I read it as being one 
from your language is what I am now worried about.
