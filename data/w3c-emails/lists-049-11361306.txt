Well, not *inconsistent* with.

My own usage is that 'inconsistent' refers to any unsatisfiable 
syntactic condition, not just those involving negation. 
Description-logic frameworks can become unsatisfiable in other ways 
than having (P and notP ) derivable, since they aren't necessarily 
deductively complete.

But perhaps it would have been better to have used 'unsatisfiable'. 
I'll take that as a last-call fix before final pub, OK?
