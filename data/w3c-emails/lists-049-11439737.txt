Dan

I would value your consideration on one motivation for the original text:

canonical XML documents *are* UTF-8 encoded.

This was what originally motivated the constraint in some other text for
which it was relevant and which got copy pasted into the current context
where it is not so relevant.

I agree with your analysis that the UTF-8 encoding is probably wrong in the
current text; however it does mean that the lexical space consists of
strings, the mapping goes via strings considered as documents, and then the
value space is documents considered as byte streams.

Hmmm,

(Not trying to change anything back - simply sharing some thoughts)
