Guys, the thought occurs to me that if it would help, it would be 
easy to tweak the decision about literals denoting themselves. That 
doesn't have to be taken quite as strictly as it comes out to be when 
we get this fine-grained. I mean, for example if a literal has to be 
a byte sequence then what it denotes could be something more 
abstract, say, like a character sequence. Let me know if you want any 
tweaking done.
