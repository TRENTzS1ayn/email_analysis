OK, all test cases fixed up. I'm going to recreate the large manifest
and slap an updated list of test cases into the document, then check it
in to Brian's CVS space.

This test case _is_ an error, but as Dave says, it requires knowledge of

Theoremhood is positively decidable.
It just takes time at least exponential in the length of the proof.
