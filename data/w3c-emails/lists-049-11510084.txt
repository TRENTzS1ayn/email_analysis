- Added GK's language tests, fixed up according to DaveB's input (+
jjc's), rebuild .zip files for those who want a single dowenload.

- All actions against this document of the form "create/update test
cases" done.

- The table in this document now lists PENDING as well as APPROVED test
cases.

This is available here:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-testcases-20030117/

Note that the status section still lists this as a WD.

Things that need doing for this to move to LC:


- approve all PENDING cases (had good feedback from Jos on the
entailment stuff, from Dave and Jeremy on parser tests).


- Dave's highlighted some test cases that should probably be either
demoted or marked as non-normative, because they test corner-cases that
aren't ours (eg, a mailto: xml base(!))


- Dave has also raised the fact that we're no longer normative on the
i18n stuff. However, there are some interesting test cases here. These
are hard to get right and involve huge swathes of unicode tables.
I'm open to suggestions as to what to do here: we can approve these but
mark them as non-normative, for instance. This is more of a
process/scope question than an editorial one, so I'd like some input
from the chair/staff contact.


Cheers,
jan

Ever see something and think, "I've gotta leverage me some of that?"
Odds are, you were looking at a synergy and didn't even know it.
