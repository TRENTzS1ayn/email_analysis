I'm open to suggestions as to what to do here: we can approve these but
mark them as non-normative, for instance. This is more of a

I think there's a misunderstanding here.

We are no longer normative on Charmod.

The I18N responsibilities were ours, and we have taken decisions informed by
Charmod and reflected in Concepts.

These were:

+ Literals are in NFC
+ RDF URI references are IRIs more or less.
+ RDF processors should use early unifrom normalization
+ Literals beginning with combinging chars are permitted but discouraged.

Of these, the test cases test the first two. The third has been dropped for
pragmatic reasons - Charmod is not baked, and the RDF WDs do not talk about
processing (except for the deleted part of concepts that imported the
concepts of processing from charmod).
