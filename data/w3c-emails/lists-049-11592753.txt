Way to go Frank.

I've uploaded this to

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-primer-20030117/

along with all the figures.

I had a problem with the figures.  They appear to have been loaded into cvs 
as text files and when I check them out they are corrupt, so I had to 
download them individually from the web and load them into the new 
directory.  Seems to have worked though :)

Happy Holidays

Brian
