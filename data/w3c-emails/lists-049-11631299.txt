Yes, both the above noted. I assume that dates and this-version 
things have to be only finally finalized when the thing is finally 
published, if you see what I mean...

Omnigraffle and BBEdit are two really good reasons to use a Mac.

Good idea.

I presume the XML-syntax problems still apply there also (??) If not, 
I agree. But I also no longer really care.... ;-)

Whoops. Yes.

Right, but I think we've WG-decided not to include those, regrettably.

Right. What I meant that to be was like the IP of H, if you see what 
I mean. I ought to make that clearer.

Another way to go would be to use suffices throughout and write IP, 
IS etc as P<sub>I</sub>, S<sub>I</sub> , then this would be 
P<sub>H</sub>.  Peter P-S did that in the OWL documents, and it is in 
fact more correct. But this would make it all look a lot more 
'mathematical'.

Nice quote, I'll try to work it in. I bet it sounds even better in German.

Hard to know where to stop, is the problem. I did have 'mention'  in 
there at one point but I realized that I hadn't used it in the text 
anywhere, so it seemed kind of daft to put it into the glossary.
