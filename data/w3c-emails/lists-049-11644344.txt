Thanks Brian.  I'm on the road now (at a motel), so I'll have a look at 
the uploaded version when I have a better Internet connection. 
Regarding validation, yeah (Eric had taken care of the validation of the 
other versions, so I didn't do it for this one either, not to mention 
being in a bit of a rush).  However, I *did* (this time) validate the 
RDF/XML examples (at least the ones that weren't using extensions, and 
provided namespaces), and found a few glitches (we might want to 
consider filling out some of those other examples so they validate too).
