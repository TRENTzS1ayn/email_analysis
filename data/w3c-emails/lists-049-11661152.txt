Guys, I have an urgent question. In a recent email, Peter P-S claimed 
the following:

If Peter is right then we need to fix something; that is, either 
leading zeros in CMP names should be syntactically illegal, or else I 
need to tweak the RDFS semantics to make those CMP syntactic forms 
have their obvious meaning.

I don't know for sure, however, if they are syntactically legal or 
not. Can anyone answer that question, please?

Thanks.

Pat
