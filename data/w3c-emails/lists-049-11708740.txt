In 1999, W3C published a recommendation that was all about the namespace
called "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#". At that time W3C gave no hint 
that this namespace contained things named 'nodeID', 'datatype' etc. The spec was 
somewhat elusive on whether one could expect in the future for revelations about 
such things to be made. In 2001-3 we've revealed our view that there are other 
occupants of this namespace, ie. nodeID, datatype etc. 

I believe we need to decide whether to 'seal up' this namespace with the publication of 
our specs, or whether to allow the possibility that further occupants of the ns may
be subsequently 'revealed'. Perhaps we can do this incrementally, by saying 
that the ns remains potentially open for future additions, but that we definitively 
assert that it doesn't contain anything with a name beginning with '_0'. 

In other words, we should decide whether we're claiming the RDF specs provide an 
exhaustive account of the things that are named in that namespace.
