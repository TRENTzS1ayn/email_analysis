I think it's a reasonable and pragmatic approach to say that it doesn't 
contain names beginning "_0" (for reasons of possible confusion of 
container vocab.) without saying that the namespace is sealed for all time.

Looking beyond that case, I suggest that it's probably appropriate to say 
as little as necessary about the future population of this (or any) 
namespace.  Maybe it is more important to say what should be the 
expectations of any namespace used for RDF vocabulary (a kind of "cool 
URIrefs don't change" exhortation, maybe)?
