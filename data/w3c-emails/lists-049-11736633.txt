Thinking about it, things might not be that easy.  May need a tweak to 
concepts.

I remember Danbri being concerned about urirefs that don't denote.  We may 
be back into an area similar to the "who defines what a uri means" teritory 
in that might be needing to say in the abstract syntax that undefined names 
from namespaces are syntactically invalid.

Pat, I think we want to say there ain't no such thing rdf:_01.  Is there a 
neat way to say that?
