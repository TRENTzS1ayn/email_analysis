You're right. We didn't want :r1 rdf:_1 "blah" to imply that :r1 was a 
container, since we wanted to allow the _n properties to be used on 
things that weren't containers. Saying that they are all specializations of a 
property with a domain of Container woudl mess that up (I assume there's 
a bit of the MT that fleshes this out).
