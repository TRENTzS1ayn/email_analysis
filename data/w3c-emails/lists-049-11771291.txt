Folks,

I've been working with Danbri an update to the schema doc.  The latest 
version is at:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/Schema/200212bwm/

which I hope is pretty close to a last call candidate.  One issue I'm aware 
of is that there are a lot of missing spaces.  Turns out Amaya seems to 
regard whitespace as optional - I've put them all back in once.  Now I'm 
leaving it to the end to fix that.

Anyway, if anyone is getting bored over the holidays, feedback would be 
appreciated.

Brian
