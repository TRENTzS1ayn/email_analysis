I'm commenting on this because there've been comments on this before 
concerning other documents (and Primer has similar material).  It seems 
clear to me that the XML schema specs define URIs of the form in 
question, because although the concatenation convention may be 
introduced by RDF, the XML Schema datatypes spec (section 3) says 
explicitly "For example, to address the int datatype, the URI is 
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int" (it also explicitly says to 
construct the URIs of datatypes by using the base URI 
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, and the name of the datatype as a 
fragment identifier).  I'm sure they don't care whether such URIs are 
actually constructed using RDF's concatenation convention, or by some 
other means, but they do say the URIs should be of that form.

I think there's a misunderstanding here.  if you go to the W3C XML 
Schema page http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema, you'll see that the XML Schema 
specs are published in three parts.  The third part, "XML Schema Part 2: 
Datatypes", has URL http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/, which is the URL 
our documents (including semantics) cite for XML Schema datatypes.  The 
document at http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema supposedly describes the 
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema *namespace*.  However, it's dated 
several months earlier than the actual specs, and it's not clear what 
official status that actual page has.
