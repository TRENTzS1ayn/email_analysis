I would not recommend that. That would re-introduce all the 
range-inheritance problems assocaited with datatyping. The basic idea 
of the current proposal is to keep range-assignment (ie rdfs:Range) 
and datatyping (rdfd:Range) quite separate, so you can have either 
one without the other (or both if you choose to). That is the only 
way I can see to allow the kind of Dublin-Core sloppiness in a 
rational framework.
