Sergey, I think we are violently agreeing but using terminology at 
cross purposes. When I said lets trash reification, I meant by 
'reification' to refer to the RDF syntax for reification, ie the use 
of 4-triples. I think you mean 'reification' in the sense of 'any 
technique for associating a name with a sentence' or some such very 
general usage. Seems to me that you were saying that  in current 
practice this is not, and should not be, done by using 4-triples. In 
which case, to re-phrase my suggestion less ambiguously, let us 
hereby IGNORE such 4-triples usage.  It is simply normal RDF usage, 
and has no special meaning, so we do not need to even mention it 
(other perhaps than to emphasize that it has no particular special 
meaning.)
