NOt sure I follow which revised global you are referring to 
(pointer??), but I doubt it. Seems to me that there really isn't ANY 
way to use 'normal' rdfs reasoning to connect rdfs:range with 
rdf:type that can possibly be a safe way to do datatyping, and still 
have the bnodes denote values.

If it can be done it would certainly be a plus. I don't see how, though.
