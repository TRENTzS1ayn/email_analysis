Is that 'a' in the first triple in the antecedent shorthand for 
rdf:type?? If so that seems to all make sense, except the first 
triple in the antecedents ought to be

?d a rdf:DataType .

Ie d is in the class of datatypes.  dType is the datatyping property.

  Of course this doesn't actually state the literal-interpretation 
rules, but I don't think you can say those in RDF.

I'd prefer to state the second rule consequent as

?d rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:value .

but I can see that would give you a much longer inference path. Your 
version ought to work, though, in every case I can think of :-)

PS On a different topic, did Ora contact you about the closure rules? 
He has some startling statistics on how redundant they are.
