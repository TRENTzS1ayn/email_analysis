Gotcha.

If nobody uses the 4-triple style, I would agree with you, but I see it
a part of our job to provide some alternative mechanism so that
applications could exchange reified statements interoperably. For
example, we could go as far as to say that rdf:subject etc. to be
treated as syntax only, producing no triples (just like rdf:Description
or rdf:RDF do not produce triples directly). However, even if we move
reification to the syntax in this or other way, we owe some kind of
explanation wrt the graph representation / interpretation of such
"pumpkins".
