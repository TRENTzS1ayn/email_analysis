Hello Jeremy,

Have you looked at the latest charmod draft?
(http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-edit/#sec-URIs)
I'm not sure normalization of IRIs has to be mentioned in
the character model; it would only complicate the specs.

Of course it does :-). But maybe it should say so.
(well, there are a few details we have to look at again)

I agree to make this explicit in the IRI spec. I don't see
the point for Charmod.

Clearing up escape issues is one step before casing issues.
Most escape issues (for a-zA-Z0-9, everything outside US-ASCII,
plus a few specials) are completely independent of the scheme,
they apply to all URIs. Case and the other stuff is very much
scheme-dependent. This is a big difference.

No, it is not. For RDF, it would just mean that when you compare,
you may want to apply it, but you wouldn't convert and stay there;
you would keep the original.
