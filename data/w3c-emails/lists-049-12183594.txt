OK
it's good to go back to such examples

all we said in the beginning was that
  [any big map
   _:s1 <property> <value>]

does entail
  [_:s2 <property> <value>]

****************************************

but I must confess that we *don't* have
that always in Euler...

it is a long story, and I'm not sure
I will be able to explain it,
but it is important to have
a clear decision on that.

I assume that, while asserting
  aaa bbb _:ccc .
  _:ccc ddd eee .
we for sure assert the triple
  aaa bbb [ ddd eee ] .
but *not* the "contents" of the node [ ddd eee ]
(this is N3's [ ] and ako "tree")

this is btw a case of unasserted triples
(just like N3's { } set of triples)

this is just to say how things are in
our implementation, and it would be
quite straightforward to change it
and have extra statements like
  [ ddd eee ] .
for all branches of all trees
(so efficiency would go down)

I'm feeling better now that I have
confessed my sins against MT
and I beg for some help
