Well, by my reading of current M&S, I think is does;  i.e.

    <rdf:Description rdf:about='ex:subj'>
       <ex:prop rdf:id='ex:reif' rdf:resource='ex:obj'/>
    </rdf:Description>

yields:

    <ex:reif> <rdf:type> <rdf:Statement> .
    <ex:reif> <rdf:subject> <ex:subj> .
    <ex:reif> <rdf:predicate> <ex:prop> .
    <ex:reif> <rdf:object> <ex:obj> .

which was my point:  I didn't think the statement resource was necessarily 
a bnode.

(Of course, this entails the bnode case, right?)
