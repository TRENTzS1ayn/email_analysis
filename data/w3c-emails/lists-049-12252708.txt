I look forward to reviewing your joint proposal.

Thank you Patrick.  I think this means that I've seen both you and Sergey 
agree to this.

I think its up to you and Sergey to agree how best to get this document 
done.  However, Sergey's suggestion of keeping it simple (email format?), 
focussing on the core agreements/issues, and starting from Pat's recent 
email, which is neutral territory, might permit a faster and more 
interactive evolution of a proposal/agreement.

Can both you and Sergey make the half hour after this Friday's telecon to 
work out how to get this done?

Time is critical here.

Bummer.  Which week?  Will you have email?

In general, encouraging.
