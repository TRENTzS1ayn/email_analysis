The DC desn't use W3C XML Schema datatypes yet in the DC in RDF/XML
formats.  There has been some investigation of using W3C XML Schema
for validating DC in XML, but no official work on using the datatypes
there, as far as I know.

The nearest is the XML and W3C XML Schema based
  Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML
  http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-xml-guidelines/

which is still under a lot of discussion, not official at all and
again, doesn't use the datatypes.
