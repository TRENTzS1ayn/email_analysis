Dave, this keeps coming up and I would like to tackle it, but Im not 
sure how, or even if, this XML feature is supposed to map into RDF 
triples. If the answer is obvious to you, could you briefly explain 
it, using Ntriples?

Many thanks.

Hmm, thats an interesting idea. What would rdf:value mean if it wasnt 
pointing to a literal? For example what relationship between _:x and 
_:y would this state:
_:x rdf:value _:y .
_:y rdf:value "10" .
