Well, yeh. If you are talking about the abstractions, then they 
presumably exist in Plato's heaven. And if that is where they are, 
then they are *all* there. In MT terms, every interpretation should 
have every possible triple in its universe of discourse, even the 
ones that nobody has invented the URIs for yet. (Actually, to be 
fair, it really only needs to have all the triples that can be 
written using the vocabulary of the interpretation, which doesn't 
sound quite so crazy.)
