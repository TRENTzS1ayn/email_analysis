I finally figured out why 'dtype' is needed, but a corresponding extensions 
to 'range' is (maybe) not.

'type' inferences are intimately bound to subclassing, so the addition of 
subclassing assertions that are quite reasonable with respect to the value 
domains could completely mess up the datatyping.  (I'm sure you explained 
this Pat, but somehow I wasn't hearing.)

This did make me wonder is there might not be a similar problem with 
respect to 'range' and 'subPropertyOf':

    if    aaa range ddd    (ddd some datatype)
    and   bbb range ccc    (ccc some class)

then these statements don't say anything about literal interpretation for 
ccc, even if
     ccc subClassOf ddd
But adding:
     bbb subproperty aaa
also adds an inference
     bbb range ddd
which in turn invokes the dtype relation for subjects of bbb.

Just a thought.
