Frank,

I mentioned that I was working up some words about formal semantics ... the 
first result of that can be seen at the URL [1] below.  The note is written 
with a view to trust modelling, but the middle sections are quite generic.

I've asserted copyright in the whole piece for technical reasons,  but if 
you want to plunder some of the words for the Primer, that will be fine.
