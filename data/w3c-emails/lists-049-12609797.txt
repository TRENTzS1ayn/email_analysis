My mid-meeting action was specifically to double check that the request
I'd put in to the systems team included the right directory; it did.

Jan gave me a DSA rather than RSA SSH key; we'll sort that out when he's
back from vacation. The other three accounts I asked for (you, Dave and
Libby (for SWAD-Europe stuff) were set up, but delayed due to issues
around our access control policy. I've come to a working solution on that
front, so you and Dave should now be able to access the site. I'll send
details offlist.
