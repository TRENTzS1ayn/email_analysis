Yes. This was discussed awhile back in October
within the context of some
query API binding a literal to a superordinate property
and loosing the datatyping context for correct interpretation.

There was a good bit of discussion between Pat and I on this.
C.f. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0176.html

I was myself until just recently unsure of the necessity
of rdf:dtype, but I agree with you that it is needed.

See also my recent query to Pat regarding the relationship
between rdfs:range and rdf:type versus rdf:dtype, which ties
into this issue of the semantics of rdfs:subPropertyOf. We
may in fact need something like rdfs:drange ("deranged"? ;-)
if rdfs:range only implies rdf:type and not rdf:dtype,
otherwise, an application cannot be sure that there is a
valid TDL pairing such that the lexical form is actually
a member of the lexical space of the datatype -- as opposed
to the bNode simply denoting a member of the value space
of the datatype.

It would be good, though, if we could include in the
datatyping summary the "facts" about what rdfs:range,
rdfs:subPropertyOf, etc. refer to (value spaces only).

I try to capture the additional relations between
lexical spaces and canonical lexical spaces in
http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/RDFL.html and
http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/RDFL.rdf which in some contexts
is useful to know. And an application specific ontology
that uses this datatype definition ontology to define
its lexical datatypes:
