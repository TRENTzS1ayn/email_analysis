As pointed out to Pat's message, this doesn't work
because the literal itself is not English. It may
have an English interpretation in a particular context
but the literal itself, theoretically, could have
meaning in multiple languages.

I have the sinking suspicion that both the DC "poor man's"
approach and the dumbing down principle, may need to be
rethought and/or refined in terms of typed data literals
rather than the present basis of strings that are presumed
to have globally consistent meaning (but, based on all
that has come out of these datatyping discussions,
actually don't).

But that's quite another discussion entirely, and one
for the DC lists.

Cheers,

Patrick
