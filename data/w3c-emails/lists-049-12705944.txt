This is intuition; I'm woefully ignorant on all this logic stuff.

3 seems to imply that you need the existence of a statement in a graph to 
entail the reified statement, which is what I'd expect if the reified 
statement represented an *occurrence* of a statement, i.e. a stating.

If one regards statements as the sort of abstract things that the formal 
part of M&S suggests to me (pps, danc and others), then to borrow a phrase 
from Pat, they all exist in "platonic heaven" - no occurrence is required 
to entail them.

So I find the combination of:

   o a reified statement models a statement
   o you need an occurence of a statement to entail its
     reification

tingles my antenae.

I will now curl up into a feotal ball and await a kicking from the logicians.

Brian
