Here I disagree.  I think we need to specify the appropriate semantics of 
any valid RDF expression.  (It might be appropriate for the primer to 
indicate what idioms can then be used to achieve common goals.)

No, please, no.  There should be no proprietary idioms.  Any RDF whose 
intended interpretation is in accordance with the formal semantics should 
be exchangeable between RDF processors, and the level of mutual 
understanding dependent only on whether there is sufficient common 
understanding of externally defined vocabulary.  It should never be 
possible to entail incorrect conclusions, whatever idiom is used.

The role of idioms is to help authors use the language.  Idioms, per se, 
have no part in determining the meaning of the language used.  That *would* 
be the tail wagging the dog.
