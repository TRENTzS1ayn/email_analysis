S-B is critical for anybody who wants to write
<dc:date>2000-12-23</dc:date>
and wants tools to flag an inconsistency when they write
<dc:date>not the lexical form of any date</dc:date>
which is what I thought the DC community was
doing and wanted to keep doing.

If they change their mind and want to write
<dc:date rdfdt:date="2000-12-23"/>
or perhaps even
<dc:date rdf:value="2000-12-23"/>
then I'll be surprised, but I won't mind.
