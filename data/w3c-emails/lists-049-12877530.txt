>and Statement is according to a "yes" on DanBri's entailment test case

A simple way to interpret the vote at Friday's telecon is that we decide 
that an rdf:Statement represents a stating (an occurence of a 
statement).  Would that then imply that the entailment does not follow; 
i.e. that two resources with the same values for their subject, predicate 
and object properties may denote different statings.
