I would be happy taking this route. Several people (including myself) have
expressed concern that "doing the provenance thing properly" could be a
big job. I think taking the route outlined above, where rdf:Statement had
multiple members with the same p/s/o characteristics, would be
very useful progress towards making RDF's reification vocab work for provenance.

Such a clarification of rdf:Statement would set things up so that others
(eg. via a Note, via later work of this WG or another, whatever) could
provide further properties that better describe the characteristics of an
rdf:Statement. For example, DanC and I might define util:predicateURI,
util:subjectURI, util:ObjectURI, each having rdfs:domain of rdf:Statement,
to address the concerns aired in the use/mention/superman thread. By
agreeing that rdf:Statement's members aren't individuated by p/s/o, we'd
lay the groundwork for future improvements to reification.
