Right. Though, not meaning to shake things up... ;-)

Rules 2, 3, 5a, and 5b in the above have been removed in
the latest draft and a new rule added (see below).

Rule 3 above follows from the rdfs:range of
rdfd:datatype defined in Rule 0, and thus is
unnecessary.

Rules 2, 5a and 5b have been removed. Both because they
are unnecessary insofar as the datatyping interpretation
is concerned and also because while all three idioms
may all identify the same datatyped literal pairing,
they do not have identical meaning.

It is similar to the well known "morning star" versus
"evening star" example, where both identify the same thing
but do not really have identical meaning. One idiom thus
does not imply another idiom as their total meaning will
not be the same.

The present rules, as defined in the current revision of
the WD are:

How do those work? ;-)
