Thanks. I've been the "troublemaker" for so long regarding
datatyping, I didn't want to push yet another issue...

(and since I don't believe in instance-specific containers
and do such things differently... ;-)

It occurred to me that since any single instance is static,
that we could define a set of rules that are deterministic
and always produce the same ordering for any parser.

Granted, it may be out of charter, but I think it could be done.

Agreed. Never thought it was an MT issue.

Cheers,
