My take is that the subject would be your wife. The difference
between the statement and the stating is the bNode of type rdf:Statement.
Thus, because bNodes are not tidy, each may uniquely denote a
different stating -- and all statings  having the same S,P, and O
are talking about the same statement, no matter where, when or by
whom it may (or may not) be asserted.

It is that bNode that denotes the stating, and which can take additional
properties to describe the context/attributes of that stating, but all
statings have a node intersection with any actual assertions of the
referenced S, P, and O.

A stating can exist by itself. An assertion triple can exist by itself.
And if they exist together, they share nodes.

That doesn't mean that any properties other than S, P, and O for a
stating modify any other stating, nor that a stating entails the
assertion.
