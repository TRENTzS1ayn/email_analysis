Right, exactly.

Well, it goes outside RDF, but one could argue that if it is known 
that ex:father is functional, ie people only have one father, then

_:B ex:father #Bob .
_:G ex:father #Bob .

together entail _:G = :_B, and then you can get the conclusion by 
substitution. THis does require that extra assumption, though, to be 
a valid entailment, and neither the assumption nor this kind of 
equality reasoning is supported by RDF. (You could do this kind of 
reasoning, expressed in terms of class cardinalities, in DAML.)

I think that some of us are treating RDF entailment strictly in RDF, 
while others see it as embedded in a larger 'web' of entailment that 
might use hypotheses that come from outside RDF. The problem (to me) 
of the latter view is that there is no way to say what might or might 
not be entailed by anything in this case.
