I'd like to offer the following proposal for the RDF datatyping 
abstract.  The key points I'm aiming for here are:
1. intro to RDF, importance for application information exchange
2. interpretation of literal strings in RDF
3. datatyping builds upon the RDF model theory

I think any more, or attempt at explanation here, is distracting and unhelpful.

[[
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for representing 
information in the World Wide Web, with a particular goal of meaningful 
data exchange between applications.  RDF uses URI-references and literal 
strings to denote things described;  interpretation of URIs is covered by 
the RDF Model Theory.

This memo describes a framework for use and interpretation of literal 
strings in RDF, by reference to a concept of well known "datatypes", which 
map strings to values.  It builds upon the semantic framework described in 
the RDF Model Theory.
