Maybe, but it might not, and it looks like a quagmire to me. Eg we 
will need to define that ordering very precisely in a way that nobody 
can argue about (...qnames???)

Id say accept the nondeterminism. The worst that can happen is that 
poor dumb RDF has two bags that it gives different names to, but a 
more bag-savvy engine can see are really the same. But RDF is always 
in this condition; two urirefs *might* co-denote in a way that is 
invisible to RDF, that's always a possibility.

>Anyway, it seems like syntax issue, not a MT one.

Agreed. I think this is only an issue at all because of a lingering 
feeling that RDF ought to be something like a programming language. 
THe moral is, get used to the fact that it isn't a programming 
language.
