In a similar argument to my reply on xml:lang; this means that the
mapping from RDF/XML syntax to model would require the use of RDF +
RDFS + RDF datatyping to model what was previously provided by RDF
M&S alone.

Although since for XML literals, it was previously rather vague on
this - the whole point of resolving the issue - this is something we
have to take care on; it would be moving something to a possibly
non-core (where core=RDF M&S equivalent) part of the RDF.
