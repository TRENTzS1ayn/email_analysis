Or rather, the use of RDF + RDFS + RDF DT provides a solution
that was not realy addressed at all by M&S.

I agree that it may sound like a rather radical suggestion, but
it very nicely puts interpretation (including all parsing issues)
of XML literals into the application space while still allowing
folks to express typing and other knowledge about them.

It was just an idea. I'd love to hear alternatives.
