[c.f. version 11-Apr-2002,  I'm dipping into the spec in pieces, so some of 
my comments are coming piecemeal.]


Section 2.1:
------------
I think the second sentence of section 2.1 should be stated more 
positively; e.g.

[[
A datatype defines a mapping from literal strings to corresponding values.
XML schema defines a number of datatypes that are usefully employed with RDF
(numbers, dates, etc.).  The RDF datatyping framework supports the use of
these datatypes, and any additional ones that may be defined.
]]


Section 2.1.1:
--------------
The first paragraph has key concepts:  I suggest setting them out as a list 
to make them more visible.

Do the concepts of "canonical lexical space" and "canonical mapping" really 
have any impact in the datatyping framework?  I don't see that they do, and 
therefore that they don't need to be described in the RDF core datatyping 
framework.  The three key concepts that serve my understanding are:
- lexical space
- value space
- mapping fromn lexical to value space

If "canonical" representations are significant, then I would prefer to see 
them dealt with separately from these core concepts - in a separate section 
somewhere.
