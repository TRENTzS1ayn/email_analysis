Yes. I thought I explained it. Twice.

Language is not a property of the literal. Language is a specific
context of interpretation. It is similar to datatyping. You don't say that
the literal "5" *is* an xsd:integer, forever and always, wherever it occurs.
Rather, in a given case, the literal may occur with a datatype
context that gives it interpretation.

A literal is not a pair ("string", "lang"). The M&S is wrong.

There, I've said it ;-)

???

So now, 

   <key xml:lang="en">pan</key>
   <key xml:lang="sp">pan</key>

do we get

   xxx key "pan" .  ("en")
   xxx key "pan" .  ("sp")

or 

   xxx key ("pan","en") .
   xxx key ("pan","sp") .

???

Now which represents tidy literals? And does
that mean that for *every* query that compares
literals one must specify language?

And what about comparison of literals where one
is specified for language and the other is not,
do they match? No? Why?

Nope. I don't think that any of our discussions
over the past few months have considered literals
to be anything but the string.
