Patrick, can you refer me to where in M&S it suggests this 
interpretation?  How do you reconcile this position with the text from M&S 
that Dave quoted earlier:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2001Jun/att-0017/01-rdfms.html#221

[[ (P221) The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to 
associate a language with the property value. There is no specific data 
model representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to the data 
model); the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part of the 
literal. An application may ignore language tagging of a string. All RDF 
applications must specify whether or not language tagging in literals is 
significant; that is, whether or not language is considered when performing 
string matching or other processing.]]

in particular:

   [[the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part of the 
literal]]

Are you suggesting that your opinion overrides the specification?

Is this one of the explanations that I missed?

I would be sympathetic to that viewpoint.

Err, I have running code that does for language, as per m&s.

I suggest you have just outlined how.
