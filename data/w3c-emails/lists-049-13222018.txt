I note that you have not responded to the following:

However, I would ask the WG, whether they feel that they would owe me, and 
other developers, an explanation for why, having gone to the trouble of 
implementing the spec correctly, we should be asked to change our code.

and

I have not seen anything in what you have written that comes close to an 
explanation of why this change would be a good thing. If there is something 
I have missed, then could I trouble you please to repeat it, or to provide 
a reference.
