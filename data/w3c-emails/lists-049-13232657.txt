There are situations in which it may be important for a *machine* to know 
the language of a literal;  e.g. when doing text-to-speech transcoding, or 
Google-like content searches.

I think the distinction between recording a fact and mapping the meaning 
can become a bit blurred.  But I suppose you're right in the sense that the 
language doesn't have any effect on the interpretation of literals as far 
as pure RDF semantics are concerned.

Yes, that would be nice.

But isn't a datatype also used as a kind of property of a literal?  Maybe a 
language tag could be a datatype class whose literal and value spaces are 
just character strings, with identity mapping, for the purposes of RDF 
semantics?
