Yeah.  We put it on ice till we had a better idea of what datatypes would 
look like.

Yes.  You wrote up your conclusions, didn't you.  Can you please post a 
pointer?

I'm not sure I'd go that far.  I'd have no problems with cwm, for example, 
allowing literals as subjects and making the lang a property.

Just so.

Fair enough.  Should we discuss that as changes to the syntax WD, rather 
than M&S?

Just so - we aren't defining an api or a processing model.

Yup - I don't think the syntax WD mentions it.
