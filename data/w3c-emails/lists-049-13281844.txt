In keeping with my reputation for crazy, odd, bizarre
and annoying suggestions...  ;-)

Why not define a URI scheme for RDF literals, and map
all literals to it, with a placeholder for language.

E.g.   lit:en:pan       'pan'/English
       lit:sp:pan       'pan'/Spanish
       lit::pan         'pan' (no language specified)

That solves the tidy literal business also, as all literal
nodes become URIref nodes and hence are tidy, and there
are only URIref nodes and bNodes in the graph. No literals
in the traditional sense. ;-)

After all, if literals have structure, and we have to
adopt a structured representation, why not a URI?

OK, crawling back under my rock...

Patrick
