Actually, I think Dave went the other way; you have just outlined Jeremy's 
counter.  Would you care to write it up, along with test cases?

Graham, could I ask you to make a proposal to resolve this question.

True.  However, it also means that tools like Jena will be compelled to 
support it, but won't be able to write it as n-triples or RDF/XML.  I know 
that it is already the case that we can't write all graphs as RDF/XML, but 
Jena will find a non standard way to fix that, and I don't want that 
happening more often than it has to.

No, but this is part of the reification discussion.

True.  Hmmm, model theory question.  If we define a property of containers, 
say rdfs:size which is the number of members, does:

      _:a <rdfs:size> "10" .
      _:a <rdf:_11>   <foo> .

cause any theoretical problems?  Or is just an inconsistent model with no 
interpretation.

That sounds like a volunteer.  Thanks Graham.  Could you identify the best 
place to put this text, and bring a proposal to the WG to resolve the issue 
please?
