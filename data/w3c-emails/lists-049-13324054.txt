Wet towel lashings are for wimps.  Its the vegimite for you :)

I read your reason as something like:

   Most implementations don't do it, so why require them to change when there
   is a better way?

which is something I can recognize as a reason folks can have an opinion 
about, thank you.  Now we can get down to facts and test cases.

Can we establish that most implementations do not support literals as pairs?

ARP does.  Others?

Patrick, what triples do you propose be generated for:

   <rdf:Description>
      <ex:foo xml:lang="en">foo</ex:foo>
   </rdf:Description>
