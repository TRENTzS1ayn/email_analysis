I use an older parser, RDFFilter, which does provide this info.

B is in direct contradiction to the M&S spec.

C does not accomplish the task of giving RDF applications access
to any language tag that  of a literal.

A is what the spec says now.

I realize that you are trying to make a case for changing that,
but do not find the argument "nobody does it that way" convincing
since that is the way I've been dealing with xml:lang.
