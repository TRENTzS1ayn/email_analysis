If we *have* to generate triples (and I would argue that
forcing the generation of triples before "fixing" the serialization,
which has enough problems, is asking for trouble) then

   _:1 ex:foo _:2 .
   _:2 rdf:value "foo" .
   _:2 xml:lang "en" .

The problem with this, is that xml:lang is likely to have a
range such as xsd:lang, and thus what we really need/want is

   _:1 ex:foo _:2 .
   _:2 rdf:value "foo" .
   _:2 xml:lang _:3 .
   _:3 rdf:value "en" .
   _:3 rdf:dtype xsd:lang .

or alternately

   _:1 ex:foo _:2 .
   _:2 rdf:value "foo" .
   _:2 xml:lang _:3 .
   _:3 rdf:value "en" .

presuming elsewhere

   xml:lang rdfs:range xsd:lang .

In either case, it means that the parser needs RDF knowledge
in order to recognize xml:lang as having a datatype range
and generate the appropriate idiom in the graph.

The problem, I think, is a syntactic one, not a logical one
or any problem with the datatyping methodology.

The structured literal (or even URI encoded literal) approach
is clearly easier -- though not necessarily better.
