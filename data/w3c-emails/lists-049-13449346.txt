Insofar as most examples, representations, DT discussions, etc. I.e. that
based on most materials and discussions, it seems to be a rather common
view that literals are simple strings. I've yet to see a single example
where the literal was represented as a string-language pairing.

Clearly, some implementations do treat literals as pairings.

It was stated that ARP does this, but if I enter

  <dc:title xml:lang="en">World Wide Web Consortium</dc:title>

in the W3C RDF validator, I don't see 'en' reflected in either the
triples or the graph. Is it then optional functionality not used
by the validator? Or is that functionality in a later version of ARP
than what is used by the validator?

(this isn't a criticism or refutation, just an honest question)

Agreed.

That sounds like fun (not ;-)
