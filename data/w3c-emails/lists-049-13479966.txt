As Jeremy isn't around, I'll reply.

The W3C RDF validator consists of two components:

   o parser
   o a servlet that implements the web functionality

The parser is ARP and does support literals as pairs.

The servlet does not support language.  This is because the servlet was 
originally written to work with sirpac which I believe is one of the 
parsers which does treat literals as strings.
