You could say "language appears to be non-existent, insofar as many
applications, discussions, examples, etc. fail to represent it in
any recognisable fashion"

I'm not saying "language does not belong in the graph" or "language
should not exist in the graph" or "M&S does not say language is in
the graph" all of which are possible interpretations of the quote
you propose attributing to me.
