Patrick--

Sorry--I don't mean to be attributing things to you that you didn't say 
(although I note that in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0299.html you 
DID say "At present, language is invisible (and thus IMO nonexistent) in
the RDF graph.")  [Sounds like a good example for the reification 
discussions :-) ]

Quotations to one side, I think we're agreeing that something needs to 
be explicitly said about this.
