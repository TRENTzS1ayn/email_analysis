Fine.

Not fine. There are very real reasons (now) why they should not.

If literals become tidy, then literals cannot be subjects. Literals
themselves do not denote resources. Literals, in conjunction with
some context such as datatype or other qualification may participate
in the denotation of a resource, but they themselves do not denote
the resource (if they are tidy).

If we want to allow the literal node to denote the
resource, by hanging all those qualifications off the literal node
so that the literal node becomes a literal-in-context, which denotes
a resource, then the literal node also denotes the context/occurrence
of that literal, and thus literals cannot be tidy.

This was one of the key hot-issues in the recent tidy/untidy debates
and I tried to point out the ramification that adopting tidy literals
precluded literals as subjects (the P++ idiom).

If this still isn't clear, let me know and I'll keep trying...

Cheers,

Patrick
