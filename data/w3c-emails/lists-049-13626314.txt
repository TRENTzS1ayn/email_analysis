Based on this message, and your other followup, I think we may be talking 
at cross purposes here.  I'll try to clarify.

Consider the literal "Wuthering Heights":

The statements:

   "Wuthering Heights"  <rdf:type> <rdf:Literal> .
   "Wuthering Heights"  <ex:length> "17" . # ignoring datatyping

are reasonable and true since the resource "Wuthering Heights" denotes the 
literal "Wuthering Heights" which is both a literal and of length 17 chars 
(if I've counted correctly).

   "Wuthering Heights" <rdf:type> <ex:book> .

is a silly thing to say because "Wuthering Heights" is a 17 character 
string which is a bit too short to qualify as a book.  Under our present 
proposals, "Wuthering Heights" cannot denote the book Wuthering Heights.

This is what I think you may have meant when you said that Literals cannot 
denote 'interesting' resources.

Why allow literals to be subjects?  Well, some folks have said that 
literals meet all the criteria to be a resource, so its a bit strange to 
say that they can't be.

My working assumption is that literals remain tidy - loosely, they always 
denote themselves.  Would you agree that, with that limitation a future WG 
may choose to allow them to be subjects.

But also note, that we cannot tie the hands of a future WG.  Just as we are 
changing things in m&s, a future WG, for reasons of its own, may decide to 
allow literals to be untidy.  But that I think, is a matter best left to them.

With that clarification would you be happy with the proposed resolution?
