This is the usual call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  I need 
them please, by noon, uk time on Thursday.

My current list of possibles includes:

   - current status update
   - preparing for the f2f
   - reification - possible closure
   - data typing status
   - issue resolutions - see my recent post
   - syntax issue resolutions

Looks like a busy agenda.

Brian
