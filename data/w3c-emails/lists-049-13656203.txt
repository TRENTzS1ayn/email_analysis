no.

The exception comes when a serializer is trying to take
a URI (i.e. the full name of a property or class)
and break it into a namespace name and a local name.
If the last character of the URI is a non-name character,
there's no way to do it.

I can imagine some exceptions that a
  createProperty(namespace, localname)
method should raise:
the local name isn't an XML name (e.g. "012")
the namespace name isn't an absolute URI reference
("abc" or "foo:##bar")

and if you have some capacity for warnings, I'd suggest
a warning if the namespace name *does* end with an
XML name character, e.g.
createProperty("http://example/vocab", "myterm")
since we're advising folks to serialize the resulting URI
  http://example/vocabmyterm
as
<vocabmyterm xmlns="http://example/">...</>
which will not XPath-match the serialization that I expect
Jena produces:
<myterm xmlns="http://example/vocab">...</>
