I think we are agreed then, that the WG is aware of no reason why the 
syntaxes could not be enhanced to support tidy literals as subjects.

The original resolution text was:

o the WG notes that it is aware of no reason why literals should not be 
resources and a future WG with a less restrictive charter may extend the 
syntaxes to allow literals as the subjects of statements.

Since literals are tidy, I think, strictly this covers it.  Are you happy 
with this text now, given that we are clear.  If not, then I think it might 
best just to delete it.
