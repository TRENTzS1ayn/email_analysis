Agreed. We might put it into a do-next list for the next WG

Wow, I missed that one. If we said yes, that would have made XML 
Dtyping a hell  of a lot easier! I thought that Dan C. was insistent 
that literals had to be simple strings.

Agreed, toss it to the WG concerned with URIs.

strong agreement. Not our problem.

Agreed. In fact it would be technically harmless, but lets not open 
another can of worms.

Dont decide on this (Pretty please) until another week has gone by. I 
need to send y'all a note on this.

Lets close this. Yes, it does, because technically a graph is a bag. 
It makes no difference to the content (cf MT)  but might be wanted 
for other reasons, eg tracking provenances, dates, etc. .

OK, but check out the very weak meaning given to it by the latest 
proposal; what examples does this clash with???

Actually the DT could use something else. It needs a 'special' link 
between value nodes and literals, but it could be called anything.

Suggest say this is out of scope , cf. decision on

Close the issue, but not the glossary :-)

No. That would sneak a lot of expressiveness in by the back door, too 
dangerous.

Yes it can. Any thing can be both a class and a property, in general. 
If a property has no class extension then subClassOf doesnt mean 
anything much.
