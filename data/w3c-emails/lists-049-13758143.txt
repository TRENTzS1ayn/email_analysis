In the first 10 or 20 messages on the subject, I was
careful to distinguish parseType="Literal" literals
from the normal <prop>val</prop> RDF literals. I got
tired of doing it and dropped it.

RDF has two (or three?) sorts of literals:

<dc:title>A Christmas Carol</dc:title>

which looks to me like a pretty plain string

<dc:title parseType="Literal">A <em>very</em>
Long Story</dc:title>

which I have suggested should be treated like
a programming-language literal, i.e. short-hand for

<dc:title>
  <InfoItemSequence>
    <first><CharacterSequence>A </CharacterSequence>
    ...
        </dc:title>

The third sort has a (non-trivial) xml:lang attribute on
it or one of its ancestors.
