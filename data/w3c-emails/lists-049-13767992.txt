Sure they can. Literals denote character strings. Why cannot a string 
be a subject? I might want to say something about it, eg that its 
written in German.  This has got nothing to do with tidiness.

You are objecting to a more advanced case which would require 
literals to be context-sensitive. Thats a different issue.

The point there was not allowing literals to be subjects, but the 
fact that it made literals context-sensitive in meaning. THAT was the 
killer problem that required untidy literals.  Allowing literal 
subjects is orthogonal.

In haste.
