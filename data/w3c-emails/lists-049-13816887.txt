I really wrestle with this. The M&S spec is quite clear that
the answer is YES, as PeterPS has pointed out in
his message to www-rdf-logic of 04 Feb 2002 13:24:08 -0500.

We don't think that anybody is relying
on that part of the M&S spec, but I'm pretty uncomfortable
pulling the rug out from under somebody who *does* rely
on it, but hasn't followed our recent work.

We can make up a new design, but I think
we should use new URIs for the terms in this new design.

I don't want to delay a decision... but in good conscience,
I may have to vote against this to be sure The Director
takes a look at it.
