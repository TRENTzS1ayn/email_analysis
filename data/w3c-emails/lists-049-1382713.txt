I think yes.  In fact, I think there may be a container test case that does it.

I think yes.

Hmmm... I was tempted to say "why not?".  But in the absence of other 
operations (e.g. comparison) on containers it's difficult to say what that 
might mean.  But, suppose we have a "contains" relation on a bag and a 
sequence:  contains on bag works like subset, and contains on sequence is 
true if one is a subsequence of the other.  Then if two containers being 
both bags and sequences could reasonable satisfy a contains relation.  I 
think where this leads is not to try and say anything:  Bal, Seq, Alt is 
(presently) just hints -- depending on how these hints are used by other 
somponents will determine whether or not it is reasonable for more than one 
of these hints to apply.

Er, OK... this seems to require some explanation for my responses to 1. and 
2.  Basically, it boild down to being perfectly legit RDF, as far as I can 
see, with no good reason to prohibit its use.  Thus it seems simpler to let 
these forms be than to try and kill them off.  And, of course, they might 
even be useful.

(I have always assumed that <rdf:Bag rdf:about='...'>...</rdf:Bag> was 
legal and normal RDF.  Doesn't it match the typed element 
production?   Hmmm... I note that original M&S allowed rdf:ID here but not 
rdf:about.)
