Did you even read what I wrote? I simply expressed concern about
misunderstanding the apparent future ability to have literals as
subjects would allow folks to say stuff like

   "10" rdf:dtype xsd:integer .

which in a context of tidy literals is nonsense!

The whole *point* of having literals as subjects, per the datatyping
discussions, was to be able to do just that, and not have it be
nonsense. And the reason for not allowing literals as subjects was
because of charter constraints. But after that was decided, we chose
to make literals tidy, which would have made the original consideration
for literal subjects a non-issue, and folks may get confused to think
that it still is an option.

I simply said, let's be clear on that. Sheesh!
