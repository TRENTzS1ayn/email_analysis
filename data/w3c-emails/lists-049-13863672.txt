I don't see why we can't have literals as subjects in the model,
especially if it makes things cleaner.  We should just be clear that
they can't be written in the (current) RDF/XML syntax.

If we get onto the rich XML content literals, they might be useful
such that we would want to talk about them but I can't see how we
could use them in the current syntax except as statement objects.

In a future syntax/other syntax, it may be possible to put them as
subjects and we shouldn't limit ourselves based on the current
RDF/XML, if we can see a good use for them.

I agree on the orthogonality
