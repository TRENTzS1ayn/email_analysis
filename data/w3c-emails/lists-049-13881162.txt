Brian--


I have a mild amount of heartburn over the wording of these bullets; 
it's not clear what they means, other than we don't intend to do 
anything more about it.  Specifically:

a.   what does "would extend RDF beyond its anticipated semantic basis, 
requiring unacceptably far-reaching changes" mean (or, even more 
specifically, what is RDF's "anticipated semantic basis")?  Could we be 
more specific?  (Could we cite the charter?)

b.  "the current facilities are adequate for all purposes that do not 
over-extend RDF" sounds like bureaucratese for "the current facilities 
are adequate for all purposes that do not require other facilities".

I'd like for us to be more plain and straightforward about such 
justifications if we can.

Maybe I just need some more sleep (if I had some, or knew more about the 
subject, maybe I'd concoct an alternative)
