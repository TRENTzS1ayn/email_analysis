I think it means RDF doesn't support negation.

Well I guess that ought to be rule, - there ain't no objections without a 
counter proposal.

or alternately we could try a different tack and apply what I think of as 
"Connoly's Law"; if in trouble finding words, switch to test cases.

The WG resolves that:

Boolean valued properties can, in part, be expressed using rdf:type, for 
example:

   <http://example/George> <rdf:type> <http://example/ChocolateLover> .
   <http://example/Thomas> <rdf:type> <http://example/ChocolateHater> .

The WG notes that RDF(S) defines no built in mechanism for expressing that 
ChocolateLover and ChocolateHater are disjoint classes.  The WEBONT WG
are defining mechanisms for such expressions.
