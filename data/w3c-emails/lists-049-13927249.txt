As expressed, I would agree with that sentiment; its hard for me to accept 
that the idiosyncracies of a particular programming language should have 
much to do with what we do.

However, I think the real issue here is not about programming languages, 
its about representing closure.  I think (DanC please confirm, you raised 
this), that the question is "How do I represent the fact that there are no 
more members of this container after rdf:_nnn".

I rather like your end marker technique Pat.
