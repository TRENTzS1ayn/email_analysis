Brian--

I like your rewordings.  The original statements sounded too much like 
the Cabinet Secretary's 5 minute convoluted descriptions of some 
situation in "Yes, Prime Minister" to which the Primer Minister would 
reply "What the hell are you talking about?", and the Secretary would 
translate it all to something like "We did a deal."
