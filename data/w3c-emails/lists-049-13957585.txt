It seems clear to me.  Experiemental explanatory text:

[[

A resource of type rdf:Alt is an ordered collection.  A collection may be 
given the type rdf:Alt, as opposed to rdf:Bag or rdf:Seq, as a hint to the 
reader that typical processing by an application will be to select one 
member of the collection for processing.  For example, a schema designer 
might use rdf:Alt to represent the collection of mirror sites from which a 
file may be downloaded.  In all respects, other than this hint, a resource 
of type rdf:Alt is just like an rdf:Seq.
