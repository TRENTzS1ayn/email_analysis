I agree that the *sentiment* was not to shoot it, but I don't believe 
there was an explicit resolution taken about the 4-triple syntax.  I 
view this as "saying explicitly what was decided", not "moving 
backwards."  (NB:  If we *really* want to move backwards, all we need to 
do is keep leaving stuff like this inexplicit, and watch it come up again.)
