Right.  My original idea was something like that even if you were 
somehow "logically compelled" to admit these entailments (by which I 
meant they would be proper if you did them, although I didn't think you 
actually had to), there wouldn't be any reason to do them.  Pat's 
comment on the "logical compulsion" aspect that "the 'world' being 
described by an RDF graph isn't required to include the graph itself" 
was further clarification.
