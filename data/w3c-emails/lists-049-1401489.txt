Having an rdfd:range [[or substitute current vocab]] associated with a 
property tells you nothing about the denotation of an object of that 
property.  I.e. it does nothing to help "obtaining a datatype value 
unambiguously and reliably".  (I found that trying to make it do so leads 
to contradictions.)

All it does is limit the allowable literals at the property's sharp end.
