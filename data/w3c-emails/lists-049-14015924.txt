It may be worthwhile in this connection to mention that this issue may 
have wider ramifications.  The current draft W3C Ontology Requirements 
discuss RDF Support for their various design goals (under the 
presumption that RDF is going to be the foundation for Web ontology 
languages.) Under "3.8 Internationalization", they discuss RDF Support 
for internationalization by saying:

"To the extent that XML supports internationalization, so does RDF. The 
RDF Spec states that the xml:lang attribute can be used to support the 
internationalization of labels, but does not accomodate it in the data 
model."

The requirements are at http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/owl/
