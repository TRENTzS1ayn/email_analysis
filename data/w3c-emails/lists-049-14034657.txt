I read PeterPS' message on RDF-logic, and was not convinced by it that RDF 
M&S is clear about this issue:

[[[
If you read the RDF M&S there are quite clear statements of the status of
reified statements.

         A statement and its corresponding reified statement exist
         independently in an RDF graph and either may be present without the
         other. [RDF M&S, 4.1]

This sentence does not admit multiple reified statements for a single
statement.

RDF M&S is also quite clear that only one statement can exist with the same
subject, predicate, and object.

         There is a set called Statements, each element of which is a triple
         of the form {pred, sub, obj} [RDF M&S, 5]

Just afterward there is more wording that indicates that a statement can
only have one reification

         ... we can express the reification of this as a new resource
         ... [RDF M&S, 5]

So, for any triple there is at most one statement, and for every statement
there is at most one reification.
]]]

1. I agree that M&S allows only one statement with given sub, pred, obj.

2. M&S may not specifically admit more than one reification of a statement, 
but it also does not (to me) clearly deny the possibility.

3. The sentence containing "express the reification" would suggest only one 
reification, but that's a lot of consequence to hang on one use of a 
definite article (as opposed to an indefinite article).

So, while the spec *can* be read as indicating only one reification per 
statement, I would disagree that it is clear about this.  I wouldn't design 
software around that assumption on the basis of what I read in M&S.
