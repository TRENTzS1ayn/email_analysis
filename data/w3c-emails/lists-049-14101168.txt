Absolutely.  Thank you Aaron.

I don't remember that.  There is no such issue on the list.  My bad maybe?

True.

I could live with us describing parts of resources as well.

Kinda blows rdf:ID out of the water too.

Cute.

Side show just for fun: not the main thrust this response:  the domain of 
rdf:type is rdf:Resource, right?  Therefore a fragment is also a 
resource.  Therefore it can be named by a URI.  What URI?  If there was a 
general way to turn a URI with fragid into a URI, we'd be fine?  The other 
format would just be syntactic shorthand.

Good goals.

The way I've been thinking about this is that (I think) I can see
a model for URI's with frag id's that would work for RDF as is.
We've passed this issue to the TAG for consideration.  If they rule
the right way we need do nothing.  If the rule differently, then
RDF will have to change, but it should have a solid definition of
what a URI plus frag id denotes to work with.

What I'd rather avoid is making a change, then having to change
again when the TAG rules, assuming it accepts the task.

You're approach of warning "here be dragons" is interesting.

I'd like to hear from the folks with knowledge of user communities
(PRISM, DC, CC/PP, ...) their reaction to this suggestion.

Hmm, now I've got a list of actions somewhere that need doing ...
