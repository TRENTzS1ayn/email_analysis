Folks,

I shall be unavailable to participate in Friday's telecon, but I'd like to 
chime in with my view of the datatyping discussion.

I think Pat Hayes' latest proposal [1] represents the most satisfactory 
basis for proceeding on the datatyping issue, combining as it does:
(a) tidy literals in the RDF graph
(b) simple model theory/semantics -- no model theoretic gymnastics
(c) flexibility in use

I think the key to achieving all this is the recognition that rdf:value (or 
whatever it may be called) has a special syntactic role, with corresponding 
rules of interpretation in the formal semantics.

"I commend it to the house"
