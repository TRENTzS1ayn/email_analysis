Strictly, in terms of the formal semantics, I think this is true.

But because the formal semantics is mostly (deliberately) non-committal 
about interpretations of vocabulary, I think it is still possible for there 
to be some value here documenting some interpretation of the reification 
vocabulary that may reasonably be commonly held, even if it doesn't provide 
any specific entailments at this time.  DanBri suggested an interesting 
position that additional properties could be associated with the 
reification quad rdf:Statement resource.  I can imagine that the common 
reification vocabulary might be the "Rosetta Stone" for combining the 
results of various experiments that will probably be conducted in this 
area, as we try to find useful ways to reason about provenance, modalities 
and related ideas.
