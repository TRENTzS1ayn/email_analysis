Aaargh!!  No, we don't. Such use is ESSENTIAL. How else can one 
ontology use the names used in another ontology??

My goal is prevent URIs becoming completely unusable in web ontologies.

Wait a minute. Whats the 'bug' here? If RDF (and DAML and OWL and...) 
are required to use urirefs  for all identifiers, and if urirefs have 
no way to be [a name as used inside another ontology which is in turn 
identified by a URI], then the entire semantic web is dead in the 
water. This absolutely MUST be possible somehow. Syntactic problems 
with URI formats are a comparatively unimportant technical issue. I 
would be very unhappy indeed if we were to go on record as 
deprecating the use of # if there isn't anything else to take its 
place. Without that, or something equivalent to it, web ontology use 
is impossible. And it had better be reasonable to use. That 
four-triple monstrosity is unusable, in particular.
