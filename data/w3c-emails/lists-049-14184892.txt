OK, and I think he is right. But on the other hand the M&S is often 
confused on use/mention issues, and this could plausibly be seen as 
one of those, so maybe that aspect of the M&S can be taken with a 
pinch of salt.

OK again, but I really don't think that this will pull the rug out. 
At worst it might shake it a little. If someone wants a reification 
to mean the proposition or the 'abstract' triple, and we say it means 
a concrete token of the triple, then all they have to do is to 
re-interpret their properties to mean 'bears the <whatever> relation 
to the *triple/proposition encoded by the inscription*....', where 
the *..* words have to be inserted. This is very similar to what we 
are doing to people who want to write
<mary> <age> "10"
where by insisting that literals ARE strings, we aren't actually 
saying that they can't write triples like that; only that when they 
do, they have to think of <age> as meaning, '...age is the *number 
indicated by the numeral*...' rather than '..age is ...'.

What the 'more particular' interpretation does, in both cases, is to 
force a reification to be more particular: to have more information 
in it, in a sense. You are always free to ignore that extra 
information, however, and use the particular to stand in for the more 
general. But the reverse doesn't work; if we go for the more abstract 
notion, anyone who wants to use it for eg provenance, is screwed.

Well, by all means, but please make sure that the case is made out to 
him by a good lawyer.
