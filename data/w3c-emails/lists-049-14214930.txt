It occurs to me that the obvious way to do that would be to have 
another special property <rdf:source> of a reification, so the 
'normal' case would be 5 triples (a quintriplet?) rather than 4, 
where the extra one links the subject to its source, using an 
appropriate URI, eg (check it out)

      _:r <rdf:type> <rdf:Statement> .
      _:r <rdf:subject> _:x .
      _:r <rdf:predicate> <http://example.org/dt#USdate> .
      _:r <rdf:object> "05-08-67" .
      _:r <rdf:source> <http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/p7.nt>

Then we really could say some MT stuff about what it has to mean, eg 
this is *false* if that graph doesn't contain the described triple.

Incidentally, this example makes me wonder: if one reifies a triple 
containing a blank node as subject, what exactly does one say is the 
object of <rdf:subject> in that case??? Seems we need a way to say

_:r <rdf:subject> _:x .
_:x <rdf:type> <rdfs:BlankNode> .

??
