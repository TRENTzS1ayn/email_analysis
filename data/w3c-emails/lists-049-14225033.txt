Hmm, I remember (Dave Beckett, I think it was) trying to close some issue
and I asked that a new issue be put on the table. Maybe I'm thinking of
something else...

Sure, I came up with a proposal for this once, but I recall it being
dismissed as crazily strange. I'd have no problem with that.

http://example.org/foo#bar
 ->
 http://example.org/foo?frag=bar
 or maybe
 http://www.w3.org/2002/02-frag/?uri=http://example.org/foo&frag=bar

What is the right way? RDF may be able to work as is, it's the rest of the
Web working with RDF that I'm worried about.

Hmm, can you provide a pointer to your email? I didn't see it on the issue
list or in the www-tag archives.

I've explained this to the Dublin Core and they are continuing to use (as
they have always done) namespaces without '#'s.

I hope they're identified by URIs and not URIviews. ;-)
