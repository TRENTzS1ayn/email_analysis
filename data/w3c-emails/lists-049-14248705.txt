Seems I must have been unclear, since you misunderstood me too. I meant
people choosing identifiers for new terms and vocabularies.

Then this is fine, since I'm trying to make sure everyone uses URIs. Only
folks who are not using URIs are affected here.

I don't think RDF and DAML were _required_ to use fragments in their
identifiers, and OWL has been required to do just the opposite in their
requirements:

DanC recently vehemently defended this requirement:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Feb/0028

So OWL _must_ use URIs, and thus are safe from this change.

I showed how you can identify the thing that most people mean with a URIref
in my proposal. Are you talking about something else?

Well, we could define the current usage as syntactic shorthand for it.

I have other proposals in my response to Brian's message. I think this may
be the least of our problems...
