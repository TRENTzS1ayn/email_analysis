RFC2396 does not say that a URI+fragid does not identify anything.
RFC2396 is silent on what a URI+fragid identifies.

I was there, and I don't think it was an explicit design decision;
it was consensus by exhaustion. The software for URIs
handles fragment identifiers. The specs are a little more conservative,
but not inconsistent.

All the software works with fragment IDs today. It has since 1989
or so.

I disagree: a URI with a fragment makes sense as an identifier
in the global scope of the web.

A part of a document is 'something with identity', i.e. a resource.

yes, it does.

Why would you expect to be able to? That's not how they work.

Yes, and how is that a problem?

Yes, a fragment identifier is qualified by the stuff before
the #. That's how it works. How is that inconsistent with
RDF?

I still don't see the bug.

Can you give a specific example of a failure mode?
