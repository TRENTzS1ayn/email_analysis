Hmm... that's an angle I hadn't considered.

But how do you reconcile point 2. with text like
  A statement and its corresponding reified statement
? That's pretty clear that they're in 1-1 correspondence,
no?

I'm still trying to decide whether I care enough to
go on record as opposing this decision.
I think the argument we made for removing
aboutEachPrefix applies pretty well to reification.
