Do you mean that the name has only the last name character,
or the maximal number of final name characters? I.e.

   (http://abc.com/foo#ba) (r)

or

   (http://abc.com/foo#) (bar)

???

The latter would be much more intiutive, much more
frequently "correct" and much more closely reflect
common usage.

The latter also fits with the recommendation that
namespaces end in a non-name character, which if
both recommendations are followed consistently, would
provide reliable round-tripping of actual URI->qname
partitioning.

Could we suggest the latter treatment, please (if you
meant the former) and make it clear regardless?

Thanks,

Patrick
