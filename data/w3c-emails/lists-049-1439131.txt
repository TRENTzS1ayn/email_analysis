Was it? ;-)

Was the kick to test if was firmly planted, or to ensure
that it remains firmly planted?

I either don't fully follow you, or disagree (or both ;-)

If RDF Datatyping cannot provide a consistent and unambiguous
interpretation resulting in a specific datatype value, then
we're just wasting our time.

If a given approach to reaching that goal results in contradictions,
then there is something wrong with the approach, not the goal, and
I believe that the approach defined by the present WD achieves that
goal without contradiction.

Can you show that it does not? (if so, then that would be very useful)

Cheers,

Patrick
