Right.  I misread the original.

I've removed my "value add" and made a change to respond to Patrick's point.


(e) in order to break a URI into a namespacename and a local
name, split it at after last XML non-name character. If the URI

ends in a non-name-character throw a "this graph
cannot be serialized in RDF 1.0" exception.
