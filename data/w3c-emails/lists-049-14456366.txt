Oops. The variants

  <dc:date rdf:value="2002-02-14" rdf:dtype="&xsd;date"/>

  <dc:date xsd:date="2002-02-14"/>

should produce different triples

  xxx dc:date _:1 .
  _:1 rdf:value "2002-02-14" .
  _:1 rdf:dtype xsd:date .  (note the URIref, not literal)

and

  xxx dc:date _:2 .
  _:2 xsd:date "2002-02-14" .

OK?

Patrick
