I think this is a great example of what *could* be done with reification.

But I don't think that means *we* (i.e. this working group) should feel 
compelled to do it.

But if different folks do different things, the agreed-upon 'quad' 
vocabulary may be the thing that helps the various ideas to be cross-related.

(Pat, I think I'm mostly agreeing with sentiments you've expressed here and 
elsewhere.)
