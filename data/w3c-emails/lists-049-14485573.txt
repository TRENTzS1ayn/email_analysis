Right. OK. So long as values for rdf:dtype are always
treated as URIrefs, that's fine.

Right. So the only needed tweak is treating rdf:dtype
the same as rdf:type to always get a URIref.

That simplifies the decision between rdf:value and rdf:lform
since it doesn't impact the parser.

That's what I thought. Thanks Dave.
