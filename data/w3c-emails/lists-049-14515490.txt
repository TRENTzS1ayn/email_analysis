We could bat words about, but in a specification I don't think anything 
less than an explicit statement ala "any statement has at most one 
reification" would qualify as "clear", so I don't buy the argument "do X 
because M&S clearly says so".

I don't plan to lose sleep over this one either, but I think a couple of 
points have been offered:

DanBri:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0270.html

Me:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0396.html

Bottom line:  defining the vocabulary and being clear that there are NO 
special entailments may be a useful option.  Also "mostly harmless", even 
if it turns out not to be useful.  Since the vocabulary exists and has been 
defined it seems appropriate to make this kind of clarification rather than 
deprecating it.
