true - its a different triple structure as Dave said.  I'm not clear what 
value the greater "locality" brings.

Hmmm, I expect datatype aware implementations to recognise that xsd:date is 
a datatype.

I don't expect the parser to care whether its a datatype or not.

I don't know what you mean by the "actual" literal value.  However, I don't 
believe there is any ambiguity in the triple structure.

I don't see that at all.  The transform to triples is schema independent.

Where is that specified?

I see no issues.

That kinda depends on what you mean by proper.  In my view xml:lang can be 
handled properly without schema knowledge, and in fact it would be highly 
improper to require it.  Parsers parse.
