???? yes, there is. Perhaps it's not described
in that document, but there is such an idiom.

Nope.

Yes, that's what I mean by S-B.

Your repeated use of argument by assertion is tiresome.

But I can play that game too:

Yes, S-B is a perfectly reasonable datatyping idiom.

Yup. All I want to do is constrain which literals
can be the value of some property.

Nope.

Mystery?

No, I wouldn't. Please don't put words
in my mouth.

Again, argument by assertion.

I have a choice to use S-B whether this WG
endorses it or not. If this WG endorses
it, I'm likely to get more interoperability;
I'd like that.
