Yes - this is the point of the resolution along time ago of

rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema

Yes

It is not inconsistent (said with a straight face!).

A Bag indicates that here is a container with possibly multiple repeat
entries (i.e. a multiset)
Applications may wish to read Bags with conjunctive semantics

An Alt indicates that here is a container with possibly multiple repeat
entries (i.e. a multiset). The first element is distinguished (value of
rdf:_1).
Applciations may wish to read Alt with disjunctive semantics.

Seq indicates that here is a container with possibly multiple repeat entries
(i.e. a multiset). The elements of the container are ordered.

Something that is both a Bag and an Alt is from the RDF Model Theory point
of view just fine. From an application point of view, sometimes a
disjunctive reading should be taken sometimes a conjunctive reading - not
particularly helpful, but possible.

We have decided not to formalise these differences. I am assuming the
normative text like that in M&S that states these things informally will go
into the model theory. Such text will leave open issue like is

<rdf:Seq rdf:_1="a" rdf:_2="b"/>

intended as the same as or different from

<rdf:Seq rdf:_3="a" rdf:_4="b"/>

(at the model theory level these are clearly different).

I understood the WG decision to close #rdf-containers-otherapproaches as a
decision to not clarify these questions.
