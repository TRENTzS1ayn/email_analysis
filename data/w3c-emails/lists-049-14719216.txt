Well, 'corresponding' doesnt have any real teeth, so its not clear 
what it means.

I think the point is that the way we are going, there is no real need 
to officially 'remove' it. In effect we are marginalizing it, so that 
it is permissible but kind of harmless and almost content-free as far 
as entailments are concerned. That allows people who want to use it 
to go on doing so without feeling that they are being dirty, and it 
doesnt really hurt anyone else as its no real burden on developers. 
So it seems like a win-win.

PS, whaddaya think of the idea of allowing a source as a property of 
a reification? Are there any obvious black holes in it?
