Wait a minute. Are you saying that every 'genuine' resource must be 
an document?? And that part of a document cannot be a resource??? 
That is an impossibly narrow view of 'resource'.

RDF hasn't done it. The entire SW effort needs this. DAML and OWL 
need this. We all need this.

This is an impossibly narrow HTML-centric view  of the world. There 
are more things on the Web than just DOCUMENTS.
