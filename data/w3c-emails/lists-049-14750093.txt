I read it, but I don't follow it. I get the impression that vested 
interests are grumbling at having to rewrite code, but (a) I don't 
know why they have to and(b) I don't really care. I still don't know 
what the *technical* problem is here. Is there a technical problem, 
in fact, or is this purely a political issue about who controls a 
definition?

I really don't follow the distinctions being made, or understand what 
the problems are. Suppose I use some wierd way, known to all RDF 
software, for referring to things inside RDF ontologies on the web. 
If I give one of these wierd ways to a browser, maybe, it doenst know 
what to do with it. So? Who gives a damn? It couldnt do anything with 
it in any case, its not an RDF engine; it handles HTML. My RDF 
inference engine can't understand HTML either. So what is the problem?

Maybe you didn't see my reply to that. :-)

OK, but as far as I can see, your proposals are no better than the 
use of #, they are just longer, require more typing, and make an 
already virtually unusable notation even more unusable. So why bother?

I still don't see what the actual problem is.
