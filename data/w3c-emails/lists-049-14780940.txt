To:w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org

Do we have a clear consensus on what name we are going to give to the 
property that links a value to its literal? We've been using 
rdf:value, but people want to protect that for legacy purposes.

Bear in mind that it has the bnode denoting the value at the blunt 
end, and the literal itself at the sharp end, so if it says 'value' 
then it ought to be 'valueOf'

Possibilities include

rdf:dlit
rdf:dlex  (to suggest the LEXical space of a Datatype)
rdf:valueOf
rdf:nameIs

whatever.... ??
