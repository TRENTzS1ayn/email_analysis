Absolutely. We need to allow users to specify whether
a range constraint involves only the value space, only
the lexical space, or both.

All three cases should be covered in my recent use cases
exercise, though the constraint only to lexical space
is a bit cumbersome, I think -- and I will suggest an alternative
way to express that when I provide my own "interpretations"
of the use cases.

Cheers,

Patrick
