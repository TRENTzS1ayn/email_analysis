The first complete draft (excluding introductory and non-normative
material) is available at

   http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/rdf-datatyping.html

and is presented to the WG for review.

Please note the following:

1. The introductory material (section 1) is not complete, but
folks are free to comment on what is there.

2. The appendices and thereafter (sections 7-9) are not complete
and are not expected to be reviewed. The material in section 7.1
(levels of interpretation) may be useful/interesting to some,
but still requires a good deal more description and discussion.

3. Editorial comments are in red. There are some general questions
presented in the comments which folks are free to suggest answers
to.

4. At this stage, I am primarily interested in recieving comments
of a technical nature (though all comments are welcome) and expect
to still do a bit of polishing and whatnot on the verbage to
improve readability/clarity. I would prefer to worry about style
and language issues later, once we have nailed down the technical
issues, especially since polishing a section that may get tossed
out is a waste of time ;-)

For posterity, this particular revision is archived to www-archive at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Apr/0039.html

Have fun! 

Patrick
