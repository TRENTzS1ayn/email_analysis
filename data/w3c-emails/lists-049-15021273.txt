Could my posting

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0464.html

please be added as a "Further Discussion" reference for this issue, if
that can be done even after it is agreed to be closed?

I did not bring this up during the telecon as I did not feel
it should delay approval of the action or that rewording of
the resolution was manditory. Nor did I wish to consume
further valuable time on it.

Still, I would like for there to be some kind of mention somewhere
about the tidy/untidy, meaningful/nonmeaningful subjects issue, and
I think my use case referenced above is a reasonably specific and
precise summary of the issue.

Thanks,

Patrick
