Yes, and moreover, the URI RFC says that this is specifically not the case:

"The semantics of a fragment identifier is a property of the data resulting
from a retrieval action, regardless of the type of URI used in the
reference.  Therefore, the format and interpretation of fragment identifiers
is dependent on the media type [RFC2046] of the retrieval result."
 - RFC 2396, section 4.1

I think DanC and I agree that this is the core issue of debate.

Dan claims that this doesn't restrict the meaning of URIs-with-fragments
(i.e. they can be treated like any other URI), I claim it restricts them as
to make them useless for our purposes.
