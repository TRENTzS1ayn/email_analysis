No, the issue is what URI-references name. I think it's pretty unambiguously
clear and I've seen Roy Fielding, Al Gilman, and many others say the same
thing. I guess we could take it to the TAG if we wanted to be absolutely
sure, but I'm not sure how they can say anything different than what the
spec says.

I think the question is answered (feel free to look at the text in RFC2396
and decide for yourself). But yes, I think we should discourage their use as
a way to stop things from getting worse.
