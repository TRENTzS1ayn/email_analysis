Would you please given an example that does?

I disagree; RDF has had existential/conjunctive semantics all along.

quite.

no? I think it does. (and I helped design DAML+OIL).

I don't think that's entirely clear. The DAML axiomatic
semantics gives them exactly this meaning.

I'm not convinced.

I still think we should work on fixing that; i.e. being careful
about what entailments follow in OWL so that paradoxes don't arise.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.

DAML+OIL is just a collection of terms for use in RDF syntax, no?

Until I can look at some specific proposals and examples, I don't
have any way of evaluating that claim.
