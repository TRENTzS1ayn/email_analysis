Yes, although the adjective 'value' here is potentially misleading in 
this context. LIterals can be values in this sense.

Right.

Yes, but here we are using the datatype as a property, rather than a 
class. Its the range of that property that Im  talking about.

Right, and the datatype name used as a value denotes the inverse of 
that mapping.

Thats wouldn't mean anything; range constraints apply to properties, 
not classes.

Well, except that being a datatype property, it is required to have 
the lexical space of the datatype as its range. That's part of the 
semantic requirements on a datatype property.
