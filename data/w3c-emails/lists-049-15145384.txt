I would like to "go round the table" of the WG on the latest datatype 
proposal.  By go round the table, I mean to solicit the views of each 
member of the WG, without initiating a debate on members views.  We can 
then summarize those views and deal with issues arising.

Please answer the following questions:

   o Does the datatyping proposal meet your
     needs and the needs of your users?
     (Who are they?) (What is missing?)

   o Are there features that could be dropped and
     still meet the needs of your users? (Which?)

   o Does the proposal 'work for you'?

   o Are there any concerns with the proposal
     you would like to raise? (What are they?)

Brian
