No. Two things are missing:

(a) enough RDF/XML examples to get going in monkey-see-monkey-do fashion

(b) S-B, i.e. a way to use rdfs:range to restrict the range
of a property to the lexical space of some datatype.

I think these are straightforward additions; they're as much
about emphasis and documentation as technical specifics
(though using rdfs:range this way requires that the model
theory admit literals as subjects.)

I could live without doublets (rdf:value/rdf:dtype).
I don't mind them being there, though.

I think so.

I'm not sure I understand the question.
