I fear to tread in these waters, but could this be resolved by 
regarding RDF as being like a media type? That is, RDF applications 
will treat fragment IDs in a particular RDF-ish way, as far as the 
rest of the Web is concerned (so the view from RFC 2369 is that RDF 
is a media type) but in fact are treated uniformly by RDF in the 
privacy of its own application environments (thus satisfying the RDF 
feeling of freedom expressed in the first quote.)

??

If this is complete nonsense, ignore it.
