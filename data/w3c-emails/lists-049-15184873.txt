I very much doubt it.  Everything Ive read about what URI-references 
name or mean has been almost impenetrably murky and so ambiguous as 
to be meaningless, if taken literally.

RFC2396 seems to be pretty clear that frags, while not technically 
part of the URI, are expected to be used with URIs (why else exclude 
'#' from the URI BNF ?.)  I really do not understand what the problem 
is here, from reading RFC2396. It says quite clearly that urirefs CAN 
contain fragIds.
I would also observe that all the web browsers I use seem to be able 
to handle fragIds without any problems.

That text certainly does not say that such use is discouraged or 
deprecated. To me it gives a very strong impression in the other 
direction, eg section 4.3
"   A URI reference is typically parsed according to the four main
    components and fragment identifier in order to determine what
    components are present and whether the reference is relative or
    absolute. "
which seems to assume that parsing a URI reference should take into 
account any fragIds, rather than ignore them.

I still fail to follow exactly in what way the situation is bad here.
