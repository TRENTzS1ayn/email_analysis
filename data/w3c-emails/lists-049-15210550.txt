OK, I guess. But then why not use the rdfd: namespace idea? That 
would make things easier for people, seems to me, since they could 
very quickly see whether or not datatype magic was being utilized, 
and we could isolate the 'special' aspects of the MT to a distinct 
namespace, which I like on aesthetic grounds.

In any case, can we please get this sorted out, as it is a pain in 
the anatomy to have to re-draw the diagrams just to change the 
vocabulary. Thanks.

Pat
