well, I actually (before your email)
wrote it here on a piece of paper
for
  :Jenny :age "35".
constrain
  :age rdfs:range _:1.
  xsd:number rdfs:drange _:1.
or
  :age rdfs:range _:1.
  _:1 rdfs:drangeOf xsd:number.

another possibility is to say
that :age is the chaining of
_:age and xsd:number but we
don't have property chaining...
