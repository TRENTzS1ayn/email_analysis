Hope you don't mind if I consolidate your questions into one message...

This seems to me like just continuing RDF's charade of living in its own
little world. I thought the idea was to have RDF describe the Resources in
the rest of the Web, not to create it's own sense of Web Resources and
describe that. If we're going to create our own little world, why not go the
whole way?

I meant a Resource in the general RFC2396 sense of the word. I know you have
problems with this definition, but "anything with identity." I believe
fragments are restricted, because they are based on a retrieval action
(getting back some bits).

Of course, as it states:
"""
   The term "URI-reference" is used here to denote the common usage of a
   resource identifier.  A URI reference may be absolute or relative,
   and may have additional information attached in the form of a
   fragment identifier.  However, "the URI" that results from such a
   reference includes only the absolute URI after the fragment
   identifier (if any) is removed and after any relative URI is resolved
   to its absolute form.  Although it is possible to limit the
   discussion of URI syntax and semantics to that of the absolute
   result, most usage of URI is within general URI references, and it is
   impossible to obtain the URI from such a reference without also
   parsing the fragment and resolving the relative form.
