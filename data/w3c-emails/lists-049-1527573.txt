Unlike the formal specification, I don't think the primer needs to explore 
every nook and cranny, to describe every edge condition.  I would expect 
the primer to follow a kind of 80-20 rule:  to explain clearly how to use 
the 20% of RDF that achieves 80% of the desired results.  (Or substitute 
your own preferred non-zero values for 80 and 20.)

In this case, I think it's reasonable to recommend that only one of the 
container types be applied to any given resource, without being dogmatic 
about it.
