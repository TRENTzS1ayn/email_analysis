That's because they perform a retrieval action. I suppose RDF users can grab
files and talk about their hashes, but using them as generic resources
causes problems, even on the web. Perhaps some background would be good, I
suggest reading Roy Fielding's description of the REST model as applied to
URIs:

http://www1.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm#sec_6_2

And REST Architectural elements:

http://www1.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_
5_2

And as Roy explains:

"""
At no time whatsoever is the resource transferred across the network when
doing a GET.  Only a REPRESENTATION of that resource is transferred, and the
fragment refers to a target within the representation and not within the
resource.  That is why fragments are media-type specific.
"""

   Are URI-references bound to resources?
   Roy Fielding, May 11 2001

I hope this makes sense.
