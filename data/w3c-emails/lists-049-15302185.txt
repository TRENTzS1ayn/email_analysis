Almost (there's nothing critical missing really, but...)

I think that the adoption of the union interpretation of rdfs:drange

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0469.html

and the addition of one more range property rdfs:lrange to constrain
property values only to the lexical space of a datatype,

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0481.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0482.html

would be desireable -- because it allows for the use of the inline
(S-B) idiom as a datatyping idiom, and thus provides both for better
backwards compatability with present usage as well as for the most
intuitive, basic idiom to be retained and used for datatyping.

The datatype triples idiom. Though it's OK to keep it.

Yes. Though the union interpretation of rdfs:drange and
addition of rdfs:lrange round things out nicely and would
be a better final solution.

Nothing major.
