Keeping an eye on it...

Well, maybe, but as I understand things according to Pat's last proposal:

     Jenny age "10" .
     age rdfd:range xsd:integer .

Tells us _only_ that the thing denoted by the node at the sharp end of 
"age" is the 2-character string "10".  Which is exactly what you have in 
absence of the rdfd:range statement.

As far as it goes, that's pretty clear and unambiguous.  But to conclude 
that Jenny's age is defined by the number 10 would be to draw upon 
information that is not sanctioned by the graph and its model theory.

For some value of "that goal"... yes, I agree.  See above.
