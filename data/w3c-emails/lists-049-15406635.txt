Yes, in that (as far as I can tell) I can attach datatypes to literals.
(I think some practical examples showing how to go about handling
literal enum types might be helpful; I'd like to see the other "use
cases" which Sergei collected and which Graham and others contributed
large lists of things to worked out both from the instance and the
schema specification point of view)

Of the datatyping options presented, I prefer the doublet approach, for
what it's worth.

As clean as the resulting MT may be, I still find this construction
ugly.

While I don't share DanC's worldview about what a literal is, S-b (of
some kind) needs support. If you accept the worldview that comes with
this proposal, then that's fine - but the existence of this won't stop
any of the bad modelling that's already going on. I'm kind of concerned
that we've got to sell a construct like this to the RDF world. I think
we may be sowing confusion.

I'm concerned that the focus of literals is on printable forms, not
values; the former ought to be solely the concern of a parser. However,
a "fix" to this would involve a bunch of things including syntax
support, which I don't think we could swing in RDF 1.0x.

The light I see at the end of the tunnel is the bottom half of Pat's
first figure:

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/dtypeFigDoublet.png

where the integer (not the numeral) 35 appears in the graph. This
looks like a diagram produced by an enlightened mind - as long as we
don't rule out the possibility of doing something like this (maybe in a
future spec?) I'd be happy.
