The way I have come to live with this, for the time being, is that RDF 
resources are a superset of Web resources;  i.e. RDF resources are the same 
as Web resources when labelled with a URI-without-fragment, but when RDF 
uses a URI-with-fragment-identifier it is referring to something that 
doesn't (necessarily) have a direct Web-resource counterpart.

I don't claim this is Right or Good.  Just a personal strategy for 
coping.  (There's no need to throw out everything just because one part 
doesn't fit.)
