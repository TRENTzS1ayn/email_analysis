Noting that rdf:ID is _not_ an XML ID-type attribute, can't we define 
rdf:ID not to be a same-document reference in the sense of RFC 2396?  Then 
it can be defined as generating a URI relative to the current xml:base?

Seems reasonable.

Seems reasonable.

I think I agree.  I think one could conceivably follow RFC2396 to allow 
combination of a base URI scheme with an opaque_part path, but I can't see 
why that might be useful.
