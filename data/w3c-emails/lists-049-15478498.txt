What I'm trying to do with the "round the table" approach is to collect 
together the concerns/issues of the WG, and then collectively decide what 
changes need to be made.

It seems like there is strong support in the WG for supporting S-B, but I'd 
suggest that it is still worth waiting till we see the whole picture before 
proceeding.  I think the WG owes you a single set of changes to make, and 
maybe some help making them.
