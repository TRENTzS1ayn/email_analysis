We have already defined it to be rdf:about="#

Even if we somehow managed to fix rdf:ID the problem of rdf:about="#frag"
would be with us.

RFC 2396 is unfortunately clear that "#frag" is not an absolute URI or a
relative URI but a same document reference. The algorithm in section 5.2 is
equally clear, and feels inapplicable to me.

Also the usage rdf:about="" is recommended by DAML, and this too is a same
document reference in RFC 2396, and treated as one by the recommended
algorithm.
