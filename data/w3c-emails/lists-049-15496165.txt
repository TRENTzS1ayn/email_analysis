I'm sorry about the repeats.

I see what you mean here, and I agree with it, though I think you express 
it a bit too forcefully.  There was no model theory in M&S at all, but 
folks seem to have managed to do useful things with it.  Thus, even without 
model theoretic semantics, the reification vocabulary can be used, and 
provided you understand the semantics attached to it by a particular 
application, then you can do useful things with it.

But I agree with you, that it defines no semantics that apply across the 
board to all applications.

We have run out of time.  However, there has been talk on this list of some 
folks getting together and proposing new vocabulary, possibly publishing as 
a note.  That could be a way forward.

There has been strong support in the WG for the position we have now 
reached.  I have not officially closed the issue, though I plan to put it 
up for closure this week, if Frank agrees that is appropriate.
