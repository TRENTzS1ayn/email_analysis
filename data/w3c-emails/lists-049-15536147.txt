Brian, Sergey--

Let me to refer you to: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0452.html 
(my earlier reply to Sergey's post)

and to:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0449.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0459.html

(discussion with Ron Daniel about his provenance use case, and the value
of having the reification vocabulary)

I think that:

a.  There *is* value in having the vocabulary
b.  We can assign useful meaning to the terms in that vocabulary
c.  The vocabulary by itself doesn't do what you want "reification" to
do for the uses described for it in the M&S.  I don't see how a decision
for "statement" rather than "stating" changes all that much about the
definition of the reification vocabulary.  Even more, I don't see what
good it does to be able to interoperate via this vocabulary if the use
of that vocabulary doesn't allow you to express what you (presumably)
want the applications to interoperate about.  Is there some major use
case other than provenance that we don't know about?

I think it's probably appropriate to ask if people think we've done
enough or, at least, what else they think ought to be done to "declare
victory".  My own view (expressed in my message to Sergey) is that we
can't just "wash our hands";  too much has been made of "RDF
reification" in the past.  That means we probably need to be more
explicit about what our "revised position" is about reification, e.g.,
for guidance of any editor that needs to write about it.  (In other
words, here's an invitation for anyone who wants to "declare victory" to
write the "victory declaration statement".)
