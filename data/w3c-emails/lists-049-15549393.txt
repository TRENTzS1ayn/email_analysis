No, the point is to allow RDF to live in a much bigger world. RDF 
graphs can be about *anything*, even things that are not remotely 
like documents, and cannot possibly be 'on' any kind of web (things 
like unicorns and galaxies.) But that means that RDF (and other) 
ontologies must be able to *use* (not refer to) names inside other 
ontologies. Just pointing to a document is far too coarse-grained an 
access mechanism to support the conceptual precision that an ontology 
language needs.

and the resources in distant galaxies, or inside possible worlds (as 
in action planning and counterfactual reasoning), or in a moving Army 
vehicle in Afghanistan, or in the past or future. NOT (just) the 
things that are whisked around on the current web and used to make 
colored patterns on screens.

I want to go the whole way, but to describe the entire universe, not 
just documents and GIF images.

IE anything whatsoever, right? (Name me something that doesn't have 
an identity.) OK, Im taking that idea at its face value, to mean 
*anything*. I want to be able to name *anything* that is named in any 
other ontology, for sure. I want to say more in my ontology about 
some thing that is named in another RDF ontology, and that ontology 
is in a document with a URI.  How do I get to that one name, without 
somehow adding something to the URI to tell the RDF ontology which 
name Im using?

Thats a use/mention confusion. The fragment isn't the thing, its a 
NAME FOR the thing. Its the names that we need to be able to identify.

Right, another passage that seems to make my point rather than yours, 
in its last sentence.
