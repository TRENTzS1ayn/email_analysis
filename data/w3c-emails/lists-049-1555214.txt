I'm not saying otherwise.

But I'm not saying that. I'm saying that the combination of the
inline idiom and the rdfd:range/datatype assertion designates
the pairing <xsd:integer, "10"> and that pairing is the basis
for any datatyping interpretation. I.e., the knowledge in the
graph unambiguously identifies a single value by designating
a datatyped literal pairing. What that actual
value is, we don't know *at this level*. But at a higher level
where the full knowledge of xsd:integer is available, then
we know that the pairing <xsd:integer, "10"> identifies the
value ten.

The RDF Datatyping MT is not saying the value is ten. It is
saying that it is whatever value is identified by the interpretation
of the lexical form "10" within the context of the datatype
xsd:integer.

That may seem like a very slight distinction, but it is
a very significant one.
