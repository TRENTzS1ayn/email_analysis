I fail to see how.

But Dan C. doesn't want the second triple to say that. He wants it to 
say that the ppp value of aaa is the string '10', regardless of 
datatyping.  We have established this point now many times.  You keep 
trying to fix something that isn't broken.

? unions aren't partitioned, that is  precisely the problem. A union 
is just a big set that contains everything in all the other sets. 
Think of mixing two colors of sand. So if the datatype class is this 
union, then a range statement refers to the entire union, which 
hardly restricts the datatyping at all. Also, some datatypes (eg some 
date formatting) may have value spaces which overlap lexical spaces 
of others, which would produce even more confusion when unions were 
formed.
