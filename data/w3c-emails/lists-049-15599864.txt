I think the fact that a statement is an assertion should certainly be
covered in the Model Theory somewhere shouldn't it?  That's our basic
"semantics" document.  If it isn't clear enough right now, maybe we can
make it clearer (?)  The Master Specification sounds to me like the
Primer, but (a) covering more than is currently there and (b) in less
text.  I guess I don't understand the intended distinction here (not to
mention how you're going to cover all those topics in 3-4 pages). 
However, far be it from me to discourage anyone from writing something!
