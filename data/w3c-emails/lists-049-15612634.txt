Putting it in the MT is a possibility, but it's not really a semantic 
comment, as such, but a social comment ("RDF is intended to achieve 
_this_").  Having formal semantics is (part of) how we achieve the goal in 
question.

I see a big difference between the putative "master spec" and the 
primer:  the master spec is normative;  the primer isn't.   (If I'm wrong 
about that, I think the primer is mis-named.)

As for covering all the topics -- the goal isn't to 'cover' them, so much 
as to say just enough about them to help a reader find the relevant 
documents of the specification suite.  As much as possible of this document 
would be of the form "for information about ... see ...".  (Though, if we 
had a master document, we might then find it expedient to migrate some 
other parts into it, but that's another matter.)

Anyway, I'm not wedded to this idea, just trying to see if we can't focus 
some debate on what's needed ... so thanks for your comments.
