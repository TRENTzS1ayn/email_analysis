Guys, Ive put up a quick draft of a simplified version of the 
datatyping proposal at

  http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype

I think this version is simple enough for the DPH. It uses the 
datatyping triple idiom:

Jenny ex:age _:x
_:x xsd:number "15"

as primary, and treats rdfs:dlex as a kind of 'empty case' for when 
you don't know the datatype, and then links rdfs:drange directly to 
that, so you don't need to use rdf:dtype or the doublet form at all 
unless you want to. This keeps everything simpler and also much more 
robust against clashes.

BTW, notice I have NOT said that all datatype properties are 
subproperties of rdfs:dlex. There isn't any need to, and that would 
introduce a lot more potential clashes if we did. Also this way of 
doing  it means that 'local' dtypes always take priority over 'range' 
dtypes, which seems right.

Anyway, for your amusement.

Pat
