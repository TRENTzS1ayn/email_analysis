That's a pity, because there are lots of users of RDF who can't
read or understand the MT. So...

There are many different kinds of "customers" who will read the
RDF Datatyping specification, and we need to be sure that it is
clear and approachable -- and ultimately *usable* -- to them all.

The MT, IMO, stops short of the line. It gets 95% there and fails
to actually say how to get to the finish. It fails to capture
the ultimate "why" of the idioms.

If you want the MT to be the only level addressed in the RDF
Datatyping specification, then could we consider giving datatyped
literal pairings a formal definition in the MT. They need no
explicit denotation in the graph, no more so than the datatype
mappings do. They only need definition. Eh?
