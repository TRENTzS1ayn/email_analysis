My counter proposal was made a while ago:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0018.html

i.e.

[[[


  An rdf:ID attribute is permissable on all property elements and always
refers to the resource that is the reification of the triple corresponding
to that property element.

]]]


The only issue seems to be whether this is a change or a clarification.
I don't care which.

Given that we are trying to make reification usable for provenance and to
force a "reification is intended for provenance" reading from M&S, I think
this is sensible.

With what I understand of the lack of uniformity in the other proposal
actually using the syntactic mechanism for reification becomes a
hyper-specialized activity.
