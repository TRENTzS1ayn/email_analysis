It was specifically to provide this support that I suggested
the union interpretation of rdfs:drange, so that it would
provide a consistent interpretation for both the S-B idiom
and the bNode idioms.

Folks can still use the S-B idiom *without* any defined
range constraints to interpret all such inlined literals as just
literals. If you have long range datatyping, you are doing
datatyping. Tough. If you don't want any datatyping in your
application, either strip out range constraints or just
ignore them.

But CC/PP and other similar applications can use the inline
idiom and datatyping to obtain a consistent interpretation.

I appreciate your comments, Pat, about the weaker nature of the
union interpretation, but the point is to obtain consistent
interpretation of (mapping to) values, and the union treatment
of rdfs:drange provides that, as my long list of use cases in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0469.html
demonstrate.

You can. You could say

   client-property:dpi rdfs:lrange datatype:number .
