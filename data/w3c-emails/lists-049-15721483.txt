My proposal before we put it on hold was in the overly long:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Sep/0378.html

[[[
[1]
An RDF Literal is a Unicode string, optionally paired with a
language tag (as defined in RFC3066).
]]]

in that thread we identified equally rules as follows:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0375.html

suggesting that such pairs are equal
  if and only if
  the unicode strings are equal
and
   the lang tags are either both absent, or both present and equal (as lang
tags, i.e. case insensitive).




This then works orthogonally with:
- the graph syntax
- model theory
- datatyping
- any treatment of Unicode string normalization
