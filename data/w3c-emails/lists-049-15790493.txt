The Model Theory document already says:

(section 0.1) "This document describes a model theory for RDF(S) which 
treats the language as simple assertional language, in which each triple 
makes a distinct assertion and the meaning of any triple is not changed 
by adding other triples."

(section 1.3) "Asserting an RDF graph amounts to claiming that it is 
true, which is another way of saying that the world it describes is, in 
fact, so arranged as to be an interpretation which makes it true."

(section 1.4) "The use of the phrase "asserted triple" in the third 
condition is a deliberate weasel-worded artifact, intended to allow an 
RDF graph or document to contain triples which are being used for some 
non-assertional purpose. Strictly speaking this phrase is meaningless, 
since strict conformity to the RDF 1.0 specification [RDFMS] assumes 
that all triples in a document are asserted..."

If the above needs further elaboration to say what the director wants, 
it seems to me we could reasonably do the elaboration.  That, of course, 
doesn't preclude our saying the same thing elsewhere(s).

"For information about" is fine;  but the outline suggests that the 
document is doing more than that (like explaining what the "abouts" 
are).  As far as being normative vs. non-normative, if the document is 
"guidance" or "explanation" rather than "specification", it's not clear 
why it needs to be normative (what is it defining "norms" about?).  It 
may well be that the Primer is mis-named, but that might be more due to 
the content than its status;  and I'm mainly commenting on the degree to 
which the contents may overlap.

I'd like to encourage you to produce a draft along the lines of what you 
have in mind (as I said, far be it from me to discourage anyone from 
writing something).  I think we've had a lot of discussion about what 
ought to be in the Primer (and in other documents) already, and it's 
pretty hard to have a very meaningful discussion without having some 
text in hand to actually look at.
