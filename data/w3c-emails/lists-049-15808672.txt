Agreed.

I wouldn't go that far.

We do still need a means to express local typing. Otherwise, type
safety cannot be assured. One context may assert an octalInteger
range and another a decimalInteger range. We need to be able to
state what we mean in each case locally so that we can trap
type conflicts.

This is true.

We can drop the doublet idiom. We must at least retain one local idiom.

I think my recent posts suggest how the remaining idioms work together.
