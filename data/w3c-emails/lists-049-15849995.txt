An example of the kind of "master specification" I mean is RFC 2305 [1] 
(which has nothing to do with RDF or the Web, but illustrates my thought).

It's 13 pages long, of which just over 3 are the specification 
content.  The specification content effectively says a number of things on 
the lines of "for <this> function, use <this> specification", with just 
enough additional material to fit the pieces together.

(I now see my previous description "for information about" wasn't quite right.)

Keeping the content short is one way to avoid overlap.

As for drafting this, I would take a stab if I were confident that it might 
be useful to the group, but I'm really not keen on putting time into it if 
nobody wants it.
