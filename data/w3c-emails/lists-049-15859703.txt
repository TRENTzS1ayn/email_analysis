To: RDF core WG<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>

Apologies to all, but it seems that I need to change my position.

All my fault -- I just missed something, as noted in my earlier message.

(a) No
(b) CC/PP, myself
(c) A defined way to constrain a property range to the lexical space of 
some datatype;
e.g. for CC/PP:

    _:SomeClientComponent client-property:dpi "100" .
      :
    client-property:dpi rdfs:range datatype:number .

(a) The new section 10 (drange, etc.)
(b) rdf:type rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:dtype .  (as noted separately)

Not quite.  See above.

I'm concerned about use of schema statements on rdf/rdfs vocabulary to 
switch idioms.

See separate messages.
