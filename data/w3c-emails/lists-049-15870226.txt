Sorry then. (& despite my bravado I wouldn't be surprised if my Prolog was
buggy - it'll be close enough though).

I was probably a bit offensive.

No. You are quite right there is an open world/closed world issue here that
is non-trivial and is part of RDF containers being defective.

Personally I think the fixes to make RDF containers OK are decidedly
non-trivial, and I would guess out-of-charter.
