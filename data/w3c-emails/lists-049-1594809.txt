Yes it does and we finally got a rundown:
@@ NegativeEntailmentTest <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/statement-entailment/test001b.nt> true
@@ NegativeEntailmentTest <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/statement-entailment/test002b.nt> true

As already said, we run cwm --rdf Manifest.rdf --n3 > Manifest.n3
and try to proof that against itself (creating engines on the fly)

I had to add some rdf:parseType="Resource" attributes to the RDF/XML
as well add some test:NT-Document elements (and I updated the repository)
BTW I'm not sure wether we should avoid - tokens in qname local parts

that's indeed the "core"!
