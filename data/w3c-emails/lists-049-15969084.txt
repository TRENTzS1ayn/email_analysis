I don't think that the union idea works mathematically, is the 
problem. But I think we can get the same utility (and the same 
behavior on the examples) without using the union construction as 
such, though based I think on the same intuition.  And Im beginning 
to see that it is very useful to have an explicit name for the 
lexical class, to be sure.

Let me get back to y'all on this later in the day.

Well, OK, as long as you are prepared to accept that this is a 
non-monotonic construction. That is going to stick in many craws, 
however.
