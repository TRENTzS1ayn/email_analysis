This would also be a good place to say clearly some of the things 
that RDFS *isn't*, eg it doesn't DEFINE a vocabulary, it doesn't in 
itself provide NORMATIVE constraints on intended meanings (though 
y'all could use it for that as long as y'all agreed to obey some 
extra rules), etc. .

BTW, the webont group is wrestling with how to tell the world this 
basic stuff right now as well, maybe we could get together with them 
on writing a master document, or at least liaise to make sure our 
terminology is mutually consistent. See 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Feb/0068.html & 
subsequent thread.

Definitily a rathole, but might be worth putting up a warning flag.
