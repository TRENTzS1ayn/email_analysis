Agreed, but I want to raise the nonmonotonicity issue (5 minutes in 
telecon) if we decide to include the S-B. (I get the distinct 
impression that this is required, but also have a nagging feeling

it to mean, are not compatible. So we have to choose.)

I'll try to have a draft circulated by Friday.
