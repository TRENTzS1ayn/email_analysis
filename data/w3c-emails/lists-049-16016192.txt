Another item: what can we do about providing a notion of context to 
RDF? (relates to issues
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-contexts
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-quoting

I want to raise this issue for discussion and suggest that we take it 
seriously (Brian, relax) and if not do it, at least acknowledge it as 
something that needs to be done as quickly as possible by the next 
WG. There are political reasons for doing this that are fairly urgent 
in a wider SW context ('layering'), and I think that we can do this 
fairly rapidly. I would like to have about 5 minutes to explain this 
on the telecon.
