Yeah... I don't know how I missed it...  I guess I've been looking at so 
many proposals over the past couple of weeks I'm just not seeing the wood 
for the trees.

I think both have their place:  (1) is how CC/PP currently works, but (2) 
provides a more flexible way of modelling going forwards.

I have no problem with that bit ... I just want to be able to say that not 
all strings are valid here, only those which can represent (in this case) 
Jenny's age.  (It doesn't really matter to CC/PP what the "10" formally 
denotes, but I don't want to avoid the possible conclusion that 
person:Jenny ex:age "Humpty Dumpty" is equally meaningful.)

Also, I don't think they have to be available for the same property, though 
they may be needed for different properties in the same graph;  e.g.

    person:Jenny ex:age "10" .
    person:Jenny ex:weight _:x .
    _:x xsd:number "10" .

(Did you mean to use rdfs:dlex in your example above?)
