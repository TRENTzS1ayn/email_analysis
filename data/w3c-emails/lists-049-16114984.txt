AAARGH!!!  I wish you would say what it is you DO want. People keep 
contradicting themselves, no wonder we cant get to a resolution of 
this damnable issue.

I thought that the whole point of the B idiom was that it DID allow 
datatyping to alter the denotation of the literal. If CC/PP doesn't 
need that, we don't need to allow the inline idiom to be sensitive to 
datatypes.

Please will you say EXACTLY what you want to be able to do. Then I 
promise I will hit your target. But for Gods sake keep the target 
still for a while.

Yes, the point being that in both cases the datatyping information 
can come from 'outside', ie  by dranging ex:age.
