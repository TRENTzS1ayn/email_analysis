Yes.

It depends on how much of the datatyping interpretation is
intended to be captured in the graph.

If we agree that a literal denotes a literal always, and at
some level above the graph, we may determine based on the
combination of a literal and a datatype that the literal is
string equal with a lexical form that denotes a value, great.

But we don't then have to say that the literal node *denotes*
the value. It still denotes the literal.

Datatyping interpretation can happen above the graph. The
knowledgeg necessary to make those interpretations consistently
and unambiguously is captured in the graph. And in the graph,
a literal always denotes a literal.

Where is the problem?

Cheers,

Patrick
