It does if you don't insist on literal nodes denoting a value.

If they consistently denote just a literal, and their treatment
as a lexical form denoting a value lives in the interpretation
alone, within the context of a datatype, then it works fine,
I think.

RDFS range and domain constraints *are* non-monotonic. You can
have one range constraint in your graph, and I can have another
in my graph, and when we merge our graphs, both our values
will get different interpretations than for each graph separately.

Cest la vie.
