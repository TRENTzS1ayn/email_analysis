I probably should have posted my union-based proposal to the
list (I was trying to spare the general WG membership from the
gory details of yet another datatyping discussion ;-)

But if we take that even more constrained, simpler proposal
(I'll repost it) then we don't need any new vocabulary at
all, only rdfs:range, and things work as folks seem to have
been presuming, that the type of inline literals is specified
by rdfs:range, plain and simple.
