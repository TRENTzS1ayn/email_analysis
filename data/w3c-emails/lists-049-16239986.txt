Right. This basically adopts the earlier suggestion in conjuction
with the first versions of the convergence proposal that in the context
of datatyping, any inline idiom could/should be treated as a value
triple -- in fact, it was suggested that the inline idiom would
be treated as a contracted form of the value triple idiom, and
always result in a value triple in the graph.

That

   <ppp>foo</ppp>

is just syntactic sugar for

   <ppp><rdf:Description><dlex>foo</dlex></rdf:Description></ppp>

It just leaves such a transformation as "virtual" and provides
that interpretation in the MT/semantics (which is fine).
