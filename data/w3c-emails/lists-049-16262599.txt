Here's a quiz, with answers based on the "Datatyping for Dummies"
minimalistic solution.

Facts about the graph semantics are flush with left margin,
facts about the datatyping interpretation (above the graph) are
indented under the heading "Interpretation:".

1a.
xxx ppp "zzz" .

"zzz" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
"zzz" denotes the literal "zzz".
"zzz" is a member of the RDF class ddd.
Interpretation: undeterminable.

1b.
ppp rdfs:range ddd .
xxx ppp "zzz" .

"zzz" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
"zzz" denotes the literal "zzz".
"zzz" denotes a member of the RDF class ddd.
Interpretation: undeterminable.

1c.
ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
ppp rdfs:range ddd .
xxx ppp "zzz" .

"zzz" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
"zzz" denotes the literal "zzz".
"zzz" denotes a member of the RDF class ddd.
Interpretation:
   ddd denotes a datatype DDD.
   "zzz" is a lexical form of DDD.
   data value is obtainable from DDD("zzz").

2a.
ppp rdfs:range ddd .
xxx ppp _:1 .

_:1 rdf:type rdfs:Resource.
_:1 denotes a member of the RDF class ddd.

2b.
ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
ppp rdfs:range ddd .
xxx ppp _:1 .

_:1 rdf:type rdfs:Resource.
_:1 denotes a member of the RDF class ddd.
Interpretation:
   ddd denotes a datatype DDD.
   _:1 denotes a member of the value space of DDD.

3a.
xxx ppp _:1 .
_:1 ddd "zzz" .

_:1 rdf:type rdfs:Resource.
"zzz" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
"zzz" denotes the literal "zzz".
Interpretation: undeterminable.

3b.
ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
xxx ppp _:1 .
_:1 ddd "zzz" .

_:1 rdf:type rdfs:Resource.
"zzz" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
"zzz" denotes the literal "zzz".
Interpretation: 
   ddd denotes a datatype DDD.
   _:1 denotes a member of the value space of DDD.
   "zzz" is a lexical form of DDD.
   data value is obtainable from DDD("zzz").

4a.
ppp rdfs:range ddd .
xxx ppp _:1 .
_:1 ddd "zzz" .

_:1 rdf:type rdfs:Resource.
_:1 denotes a member of the RDF class ddd.
"zzz" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
"zzz" denotes the literal "zzz".
Interpretation: undeterminable.

4b.
ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
ppp rdfs:range ddd .
