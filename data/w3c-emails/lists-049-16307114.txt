In principal, I think that would be an excellent idea.

Jeremy, please could you suggest a statement of purpose for the meeting and 
objectives, and possibly an agenda.

Do we do this a small subgroup from RDFCore meeting with the i18n folks or 
as the whole WG.  Who from RDFCore would like to participate in such a 
discussion on RDF conformance to charmod?

Misha, can you suggest times when it might be possible to meet.

Brian
