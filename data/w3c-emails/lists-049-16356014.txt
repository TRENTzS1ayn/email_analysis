11: Datatypes

A proposal for datatyping was produced last week and  comments round the table have been sought this week.  The WG should now accept the proposal or propose specific actionable ammendments to it.  Based on the discussion and feedback this week:

Propose the WG request that the proposal should be ammended, if neccessary, to reflect the following:

  1.  The proposal should include support for the following idiom:

        <mary> <age> "10" .
        <age>  <range> <integer> . # for some appropriate <integer>
                                      # for some appropriate <range>

  2.  That in case 1, the value of the age property is a 'string' which is
      constrained to conform to lexical space of a datatype indicated by
      <integer>, i.e. the node labelled "10" denotes the string "10".

  3.  That the doublet be dropped from the proposal (the rdf:value idiom).

  4.  That the datatype triple idiom be dropped from the proposal.

Each requested ammendment will be considered in turn, in order.

12: Issue rdfms-fragments
Please see the description in the issues list.


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-fragments


13: Issue rdfms-identity-of-statements
[[
 "There is a question whether or not there can be two different statements with the same subject, object and property. Most people seem to say "no". I have suggested that this should be allowed because it can be expressed in reified RDF statements and that there should be a 1:1 correspondence between what can be expressed in an RDF model and its reification. "
]]

Propose:

  o the WG resolves that the entailment decision made in the previous
    weeks telecon resolves this issue, that the answer is yes and that
    this issue be closed.
