The problem for me is that none of this makes the any sense at all. I 
have no idea what you are talking about.

1. If a literal always denotes itself, then datatyping information in 
the graph (in particular, about ranges expressed using rdfs:drange 
for example) cannot influence the meaning or truthvalues of any 
'in-line' use. That is how my first 'simplified' proposal worked, but 
I gather you did not like that.
(To emphasize: if "15" denotes "15", then

Jenny ex:age "15" .

says that Jenny's ex:age is "15". It does not, cannot, and never will 
say that Jenny's ex:age is 15, no matter what you do above, inside or 
underneath the graph. End of story; nothing more to be said; nothing 
can change it (short of re-writing the entire RDF MT from the ground 
up.). )

2. I do not know what you mean by a 'level above' the graph, and in 
any case that is irrelevant, whatever it means, since we are here 
talking about the graph.

3. I do not know what you mean by the distinction between a string 
and a lexical form. Seems to me that lexical forms *are* strings. 
(They sure look like strings on the page.)

4. What kind of interpretation happens 'above' the graph? And how can 
it make any difference  to  what the graph means?
