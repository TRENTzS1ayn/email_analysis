OK, thanks. Also apologies for low-blood-sugar-induced howling in 
previous messages.

OK, but hold on there. There is no way to PREVENT anyone saying 
anything in RDF, right? What you mean, I hope, is that if someone 
does say the following, then a datatype checker will barf or maybe 
bark, right? I'll assume so unless you disabuse me.

OK. But you don't care how it gets to be false, as it were.

OK, point taken. I had been misunderstanding this point all along, it 
seems: I thought the point of all those idioms was to get the 
denotations right. What worries me now is that other people may have 
been under the same impression.

Yes, we were stumbling. I took it to mean that.

OK, let me get back to y'all on that.

Pat

PS it occurs to me that if you are happy with the denotations being 
anything, then maybe this proposal could make everyone happy. The one 
person Im most worried about is Dan C....
