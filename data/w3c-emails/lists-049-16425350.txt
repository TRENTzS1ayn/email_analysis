OK, then lets go that way. Following Patrick's recent Occam 
suggestion, we can also abandon rdfs:drange, and just use 
oldfashioned rdfs:range, thereby getting rid of almost all the extra 
vocabulary. The only cost is that now asserting a range to be a 
datatype gets you datatype checking whether you want it or not, but I 
guess that is unlikely to be a problem in practice (and there is a 
hack to avoid it in any case which we can put into an appendix so as 
not to frighten the DPH).

I'd rather not punt on the MT, if only to keep things as clear and 
unambiguous as possible. Its not like its hard to do an MT for this, 
after all. (And I have an ulterior motive, which is to use this as a 
kind of proof-of-concept for a more general 'layering' technique, so 
I'm asking y'all to bear with me on this. I'll write it up and post 
it tonight.)
