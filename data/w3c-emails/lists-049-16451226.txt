Well, bear in mind that one isn't obliged to 'lock it down' in this 
way. You can just say nothing and use undatatyped literals, and then 
you are being vague about exactly what they denote. That is always an 
option which will not produce any clashes. Of course then it is 
vulnerable to a foreign datatype take-over, as it were; but I don't 
see how we can have it both ways. Datatypes really CAN clash, so if 
we use them explicitly, then a clash can happen and be detected; and 
if we don't use them, then our intentions might get mistaken by 
someone else with a different datatype in mind.

I don't think it will be that bad. Plain RDF is always safe, after all.

Oh, indeed, indeed.
