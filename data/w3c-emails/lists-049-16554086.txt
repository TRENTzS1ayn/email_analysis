This confused me too, since this is not what the "Dummies" proposal
suggested, which was that literals are tidy, and always denote
themselves in the MT interpretation.

The contextualization is a matter of the datatyping -- whereby an
application which knows about a given datatype treats a literal
as a lexical form of that datatype and applies the single mapping
to a value.

The MT at least is able to tell us, in the presence of rdfs:Datatype
typing, that a given literal should be treated as a lexical form
of some datatype, even if it can't tell us which value exactly
it maps to for that datatype.

Or perhaps just on the way between my "Dummies" post and Pat's
attempt to capture it in terms of the previous convergence MT.

Or simply rework the MT for the "Dummies" convergence proposal
in terms of tidy literals, literals denote literals, and rdfs:Datatypes
as unions...
