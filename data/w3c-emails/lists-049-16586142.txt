Purpose
=======

Clarify conformance between the RDF working drafts and charmod (and any
other I18N issues).


I would build an agenda around an intro to the RDF graph for the I18N people
and then the three I18N issues that we have identified:
- xmllang
- normalization of string literals (NFC)
- IURI, IRI, URI in rdf

There is a further topic which is N-triples and what are its I18N needs.
DaveB, can you give a five minute intro to N-triples at our meeting - what
its purpose and scope are, rather more than what the syntax is.

Jeremy
