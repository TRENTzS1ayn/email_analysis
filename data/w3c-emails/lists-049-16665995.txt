Or offline email. Phone is tricky across the Atlantic.

OK, fair enough. There is a trail of documents which record the 
various 'simplified' options which Ive been trying to adapt to 
people's expressed wishes, as follows. The latest of these was pretty 
conclusively trashed at the todays telecon, however, so might be best 
to pop the stack once.

All of these were written in an 'informal' style, in an attempt to 
illustrate how this stuff could be presented so as to be reasonably 
easy to grok.

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/DatatypeSummary.html (2/7/02) 
The next three extended this to include more idioms under the same 
basic MT, and the documents are mostly the same with new bits added 
in various colors, so you could go straight to #4:

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/DatatypeSummary3.html
(2/14/02)
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/DatatypeSummary4.html
(2/17) That was the one Brian asked for a roundtable vote on, and 
which he (and others, including me) decided was just getting too 
complicated, so...
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype.html
(2/19) This cut back on the doublet idiom, abandoned rdfs:Datatype, 
and proposed making triples of form
_:bnode <datatype_name> "literal"  .
the primary 'local' option.

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype1.html
(2/20) minor changes; *best current option*, though this document 
doesn't state the MT very precisely. Also there is no need to use 
rdfs:drange. rdfs:range will work, as Patrick pointed out.

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype2.html
(2/21) allowing datatype-sensitive in-line literals, in contrast to previous.
Trashed in telecon.  However, its worth noting that the actual 
changes needed to go from rigid literals to type-sensitive literals 
are in fact quite minimal, both in the graph and in the MT, which is 
interesting (to me, anyway :-)

There seem to be genuine disagreements about what some of the idioms 
OUGHT to mean, is now my main problem. Until those are resolved we 
seem to be slightly stuck. I will try to put up a document 
summarizing what I take to be the current state of play, and the 
sticking points, and the options for resolving them,  by tonight.

And I'll include the date in the URI from now on, so this will be
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype2-22.html .
