They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and if so, here
are four pictures that attempt to capture what was meant by
my apparently incoherent "Datatyping for Dummies" prose.

It is important to note that the interpretation depicted in
slide 3 may or may not be captured by the MT, and may not
need to be -- it simply needs to be expressed in a sufficiently
explicit and formal manner for humans (not machines) to
understand and apply.

It is also important to note that the interpretation in
slide 4 will always happen outside of RDF-space, as it
depends on datatype semantics not known to RDF.

Hopefully these will prove useful to someone...

Regards,

Patrick
