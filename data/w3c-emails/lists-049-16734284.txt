No. The single specific value that is obtained by the mapping
from that lexical form as defined for the specific datatype.

If the pairing is (xsd:integer,"34") then the value denoted
is 34. 

But the knowledge needed to actualy get to 34 is extra-RDF knowledge
and therefore all that the RDF semantics can provide is the pairing,
not the actual value.

Yet the pairing of lexical form and datatype *do* map to a single
specific (though unknown to RDF) value.
