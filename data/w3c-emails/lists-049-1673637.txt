It is valid at the RDF level. It is a datatype clash at a level above
RDF where the full semantics of the datatypes in question is available,
since both pairings do not represent the same value.

The RDF datatyping MT defines two pairings. But the validity of any
particular pairing cannot be tested at the RDF level.

See my reply to Jeremy in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0233.html

who, interestingly, provided the exact same test case ;-)

Well, ahem, just because the word does not occur does not mean
the pairing does not occur. Pat often uses the term "associate"
in that sense. To associate a datatype with a literal is to
define a datatyped literal pairing.

To be specific, L2V(I(xsd:integer))("10") is a datatyped literal
pairing.

Furthermore, as a point regarding process, the "stake in the ground"
represents a common consensus, insofar as its technical properties
are concerned, not a common presentation or prose for its definition
or discussion. So just because some particular word does not exist
in the "stake in the ground" materials, does not mean it cannot
exist in the WD -- otherwise, just publish the "stake in the ground"
document and be done with it.
