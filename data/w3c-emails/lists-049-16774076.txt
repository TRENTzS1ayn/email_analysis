Howdy folks,

In the interest of trying to play around with something concrete...

Attached are some N3 files that define CWM log:implies rules for
identifying datatyping pairings based on the four idioms discussed
most recently (inline, datatype triple, value triple, doublet).

I've used the namespace rdfd: for the sake of neutrality.

Included are tests for each idiom. The test for the datatype idiom
works fine. The others don't. I don't know why (I'm very new to
CWM). CWM seems to go into an infinite loop thinking...

Perhaps one of you CWM gurus can see what the problem is.

Each of the rules should ultimately have some means of restricting the
binding of the variable :l to an actual literal in the graph.
I had thought that rdfs:Literal might provide that, but apparently
that is an incorrect (or at least unsupported) use of that
class, and some other means should be found. Perhaps CWM has
a way to do that that I am unaware of?

Anyway, I thought these might be helpful, and I do want to
get them working at any rate.

Cheers,

Patrick
