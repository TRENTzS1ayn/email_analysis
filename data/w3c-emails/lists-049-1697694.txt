From my action 2002-04-05#7 after approving the list of names in the
rdf namespace in the syntax WD, needed them recorded in test cases.
See the http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-rdf-names-use
and the resolution which defines them.

subject to me expanding them to 1 test per file.

The perl script is written, I just need to run it to generate the 101
tests.  Yes; there really will be 101 - testing all the names as node
elements, property elements and property attributes.

Aargh!  This test case will not die.  I want it to and we discussed
it for weeks.  Several WG members cannot agree on the right answer or
even if there is a well defined one.  Remains NOT approved.

There are no test answers to these.  I proposed adding them and
hearing no objections last week, will do so.

Actually these do have non-error answers now; they are warnings and
generate ntriples.  I'll have a go at writing these too.
