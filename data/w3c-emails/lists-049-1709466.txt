It hasn't changed.

As far as I know.

I was thinking we'd wait until we decided on the whole namespace,

Keep reading ;-)

It's in section 6.

I'm actually not sure what your asking. rdfd:Datatype is
an RDF Class that exibits the characteristics defined for
RDF Datatypes.

Instances of rdfd:Datatype may also be datatype properties.

I tried to keep the examples minimal, including only the
statements necessary.

Can you elaborate on how it was unclear or confusing, so I
can better understand how it could be improved?

If the namespace stays, definitely.

Right. I wanted to show both forms for the sake of clarity. Most
folks will probably want to use the contracted forms, but the
expanded forms better show the relation of the XML to the graph.

Right. I should add that clarification.

Well, rdfd:lex *is* an RDF Property. But it is not a member of
the class rdfd:Datatype.

Because of the datatype property idiom, members of rdfd:Datatype
*are* odd. That's just the way things are.

Is the nature of either rdfd:Datatype or rdfd:lex unclear, or
is it just that there is oddness?

Quite.

The rdfd:datatype property associates an rdfd:Datatype with
a general RDF property.

Right.

Well, the section is comparing RDF Datatyping mechanisms with
those of RDF Schema, and the choice is between rdfd:datatype
and rdfs:range, so the term 'versus' seems correct.

It's a matter of perspective. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that
one is constraining the datatyping interpretation, such that invalid
lexical forms or undefined datatype contexts have no interpretation.

I thought I did ;-)

Right.

Right. I can put a mention of the RDF Schema up front for folks who don't
bother to look at the TOC ;-)

The class is not a property. But its instances are.

It's reasonable for the label of rdf:Property to be "Property". Likewise
it's reasonable for the label of rdfd:Datatype also to indicate that
it is a Property class.

It's the duality of rdfd:Datatype that's odd and confusing, not the
label. The label is quite accurate.

That's what you get from the datatype property idiom.

That remains an open question for me.

Unless and until I see something like

   rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Resource .

in the RDF Schema spec, I consider the above to be correct.

Dan?

How could I? rdfd:Datatype is not a property, therefore has no
range or domain itself.

However, the closure rules defined in section 5.1 provide the
fixed domain and range for instances of the rdfd:Datatype
class. The domain is defined explicitly by rule 1a and the
range is inherited from rdfd:lex by rule 1b.

So that's covered.

Feel free to suggest an alternative. That's the best I could
think of ;-)

I'll let Aaron respond to that ;-)

Have them where? In section 7.1? Everywhere in the WD?

These are all very good comments, thanks.

As I said, I'm focusing at the moment on the technical details and will
be doing alot of polishing and whatnot once that is nailed down.

I'm sure ;-)

Thanks for your comments,
