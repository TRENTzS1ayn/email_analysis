1. we get Jena's protest

http://jena.hpl.hp.com/arp/not/a/real/uri/[115:7]: {E201} Syntax error
when processing general start element tag.
Cannot have another XML element here.
(Maybe one object has already been given as the value of the enclosing property).

2. isn't the intent to say

<testcase> test:inputDocument> [ test:RDF-XML-Document <uri> ] .

which is what we tried in the version of last sunday
(which I just overwrote BTW, but I guess it's still in W3C's CVS)
