Hi folks,

I'm sorry that this is late again;  I've been in a meeting all day.  This 
is the usual weekly call for items for this weeks telecon.  On my list of 
possibles are things we didn't get to on last weeks telecon, the datatypes 
doc as a possible for first publication.  I'm behind on the email; its 
great to see there has been a deal of enthusiastic activity on the test 
cases doc but I'm not sure of the present status - so for now I'll just say 
if there is text or test cases in need of review, please review them; Jan 
if you can provide some guidance on what would be most helpful to you, 
please do.

Brian
