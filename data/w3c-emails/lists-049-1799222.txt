Right. In fact, it would strictly speaking be in contradiction to the 
content of the RDF. Jenny's actual age probably is ten, but Jenny's 
<ex:age> is *definitely* the string "10" according to this RDF. That 
is fixed and unambiguous no matter what the datatyping information 
is, and we should be clear about that.
