Right, and please DONT say that because that is WRONG. Or else it is 
meaningless (I'm not sure what 'designates' means, but certainly 
those pairs are not the basis for a datatyping interpretation in the 
current MT. If you want to change the MT so as to introduce them, 
then go ahead and try, but I fear for your sanity. Getting this far 
drove me batty. )

Of course the value is there in the value domain, in some Platonic 
sense. But the graph doesn't always refer to, or say anything about, 
that value. In particular, the inline idiom does not refer to it in 
any way.

It also 'identifies' membership in a lexical domain (in the inline 
idiom), membership in a value domain (if you use that uriref as a 
class name in a rdfs:range assertion, for example) and a particular 
lexical-to-value mapping (if you use it as a property name). It can 
identify all these things, and maybe more besides. That is why we 
need so many idioms.

No, it isn't saying that. It doesn't refer to contexts, and it is not 
saying that the lexical form identifies a value. That is a very 
misleading and confusing way to describe what the MT says, since the 
MT says very clearly that any literal denotes a string, even when it 
is 'associated' with a datatype, and even in the 'context' of a 
datatyping interpretation.

I agree it is significant, which is why I would like to get it right.
