Agreed, but that is a matter of giving a good tutorial exposition. I 
think that can be done without mis-stating what the MT says.

Patrick, you want to ALTER the MT, clearly. The trouble with your 
position, however, is that the place you want to get to, that last 
5%, is a place we have already surveyed, and we found problems with 
it. Some of our customers definitely do not want to be located there. 
They WANT to be able to be sloppy about datatype values, mix talk of 
strings with talk of integers, etc., and still they want to invoke 
lexical form checking using datatypes. They see RDF not as an 
ur-Java, or a simple data modelling language, but more like a kind of 
rather floppy semantic tagging language for attaching bits of 
half-formalized content to chunks of text. We need to be able to 
leave these sloppy Dublin guys enough flexibility to do their thing 
without having their RDF break. If we insist on the kind of tight, 
clear, sharp datatyping that is close to your (and my own) heart, 
where lexical forms *must* indicate values, then we are making RDF 
unusable by about half our user base.

I don't see how this will help, or even what it really means. The 
current MT is completely unambiguous, and I don't think it would be 
easy to add anything to it without breaking it somewhere. But 
chiefly, there seems to be no NEED for this. The various idioms 
provide all the precision (or lack of it) that anyone seems to need, 
as far as I  can see. If you want to talk about values, you can using 
datatype properties or dlex. If you want to insist on lexical form 
checking, you can do that. If you want to be sloppy, you can be; or 
you can state your rdfs:ranges as exactly as you want them to be if 
precision is close to your heart. Whatever makes you happy. Whats 
wrong with that?
