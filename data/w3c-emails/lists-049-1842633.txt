Hmmm, good question. 2b does seem *valid* and it doesn't follow from 
the others (does it?) so it did ought to be in a complete set of 
closure rules. Of course that shouldn't be taken to mean that one has 
to use it on every occasion, but it should be stated in the document 
somewhere.

I guess I didn't spend too much time worrying about getting the 
closure rule set 'right' since it can't completely capture the idea 
of datatype entailment in any case, so it didn't seem to be so urgent 
as it was for RDFS, since there isn't going to be a 
datatype-entailment lemma. But let me think about that a bit more. 
Maybe there could be.

True, but its not clear that is a good thing when giving closure 
rules. The empty set of rules is always a good conservative choice :-)
