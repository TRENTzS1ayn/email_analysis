Oh, bad reasoning. We have an extensional language here, so we 
shouldnt be invoking intensional examples to block valid inferences. 
BUt since I can no longer see rules 5a/b, I don't know what the point 
was here :-)

Not sure that is a good idea. I had this in an earlier version and 
took it out, for a technical reason that I can now no longer 
reconstruct exactly. I know it caused trouble, though.  Its not 
strictly valid according to the current MT, in any case (since the 
semantic conditions on subProperty are not iff, just if), so I'd lean 
to omitting it.

Let me get back to you on this.
