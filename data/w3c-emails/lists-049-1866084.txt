Help.

I notice that Patrick is using a 'mathematical' convention to 
indicate triples in his datatyping draft, like this:

<ex:Jenny, ex:age, "10" >

Last time I looked, Ntriples syntax would have that as

<ex:Jenny> <ex:age> "10" .

Jos writes them using an N3 variant:

ex:jenny ex:age "10" .

Maybe we should agree on a common publication format? If so, which is 
it? Guidance, anyone??

I ask now because I would like to get it right in what might be the 
final version of the MT document.

Pat
