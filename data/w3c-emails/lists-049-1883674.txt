I usually avoid being the N-Triples police for the sake of not
interrupting the flow of the conversation.  However since invited,
to answer :)

Yes.  This isn't N-Triples.

Actually this is N-Triples but the ex: things are not namespace
prefixes but URI schemes.  The N-Triples is generally more verbose:

  <http://example.org/Jenny> <http://example.org/age> "10" .

That is legal N3, with the namespace prefix ex: defined as http://example.org/
earlier.

The MT must use legal N-Triples (not N3) since those are what the
Syntax document generates from the XML.  So, tedious and verbose as
it is,

  <http://example.org/Jenny> <http://example.org/age> "10" .

is the one to use.

I guess I should put an N-Triples validator online
