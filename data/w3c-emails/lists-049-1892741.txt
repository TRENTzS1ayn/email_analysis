I'm wary of that sort of thing...
that sort of thing being: a notation that sorta
looks good to the eye, but isn't fomally specified;
in particular, we haven't implemented and tested
a conversion to/from RDF/xml.

We depend on eyeballs to get it right if we go
this way. I don't like to do that. I like
to have the machine help.

er... technicall, that's legal N-triples; but
<ex:Jenny> is a full URI reference; it's not an
abbreviation for something longer. i.e.
if you mean

<http://example/vocab#Jenny>

then you have to write that in full.

If you can use real n-triples without it being
unmanageably verbose, I suggest that. Otherwise,
I'm kinda partial to the "N3 variant."

Note that n-triples doesn't have metasyntactic varables.
i.e. no "if you see AAA BBB CCC. then include XXX BBB CCC."
stuff. We don't have a formal notation for that sort
of rule; don't confuse the reader into thinking that
we do.
