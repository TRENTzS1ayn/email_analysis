Compared to what?  Reification? Data types? Seems like a dewdrop in the 
Atlantic!  :-)

I'd like to see some amplification of the "they are not necessary" point 
before we make any decision on this.  The other points may be 
procedurally correct, but may be less important than the "semantics" of 
the issue (if you will).  For example, regarding the fact that they are 
not in M&S, presumably we're allowed to consider the new situations in 
which RDF may need to be used (e.g., supporting WebONT) that have come 
to prominence since M&S went to CR?  Even if we made a decision to drop 
this matter, I'd like to see us say something constructive about the 
issue of unasserted triples for the record (rather than just drop it as 
not being in charter).
