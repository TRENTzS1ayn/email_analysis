well, the best I can remember are PatH's words

[[
More generally, however, I would suggest that we take care to keep
functionally distinct aspects of the language as distinct as
possible, and that referring to/pointing to/whatever some ontology
ought to one thing, and any speech act (assenting, asserting,
denying, questioning, expressing doubt about, saying it is connected
to foo, saying it entails foo....) involving it should be something
else.

It would be OK to have a default case where if you just 'say' it
without any further comment then that is taken to be an assertion
(assention?), but it ought to be *very* easy to override that
assumption. And I think it would be best to have an explicit 'we
include this here' marker, like DAML's 'import'.

so we could do much more than just asserting RDF triples
