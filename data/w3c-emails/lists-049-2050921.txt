>Dear Chairs,

>The original Last Call for the Character Model for the World Wide Web
>started on 26 January 2001:
>    http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-charmod-20010126/
>
>Owing to the large number of comments:
>    http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-lc/
>it has taken the I18N WG till now to process them all, resulting in the
>current internal draft:
>    http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-edit/
>
>And, owing to the large number of changes, we'll be going to a Last Call
>#2 (I'm reminded of Steven Pemberton's quip at the recent Technical
>Plenary regarding the meaning of "Last" in "Last Call").

>The I18N WG decided today to go to Last Call #2 on 30 April, or sooner
>if ready:
