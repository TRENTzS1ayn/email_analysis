And here is where I disagree. At the level of the non-datatyping MT,
the meaning of the literal node is the string "10", but the datatyping
MT says that "10" is a lexical form of xsd:integer, and that association
of "10" with xsd:integer identifies the value ten.

That's the whole point of datatyping, to get to datatype values.

No, it doesn't change the denotation of the literal node itself,
but the value ten is identified by the RDF graph, and it is the
value ten that ultimately is useful to an application.

The datatyping MT doesn't change the meaning of "10", but it still
provides the value ten.

The inline idiom is IMO just a short hand for the lexical form
idiom which simply doesn't provide for explicit denotation of
the datatype value -- but its purpose is still to express the
identity of a datatype value.

If that is not so, then let's remove the inline idiom from the
datatyping specification.
