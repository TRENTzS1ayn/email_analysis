Would it help if we rather changed the name of the class to
rdfd:RDFDatatype?

Thus, rdfd:datatype associates an rdfd:RDFDatatype
with a given property.

The reason why I moved away from using rdfd:range is that it
is not the rdfd:range property which is constraining anything,
it is the semantics of the datatype itself, which is completely
opaque to RDF. All that the rdfd:range/datatype property does
is associate a datatype with a property, so that all datatyping
idioms used with that property are interpreted in terms of that
datatype.

The datatype itself constrains the literals to the members of
its lexical space and the bnodes to the members of its value
space based simply on the presence or absence of a lexical
to value mapping from the literal/lexical form to the value.
If there is none, then either the literal/lexical form or
value (or both) are invalid.

Thus, there is no range like semantics asserted by the
rdfd:range/datatype property itself in the same manner
as the rdfs:range property. So I wouldn't want to revert
to rdfd:range.
