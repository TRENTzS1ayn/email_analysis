I don't see how you are adding any semantics to rdf:type. You are
simply saying that ddd is a member of the class rdfd:Datatype,
and we've defined what the properties must be for all members of
that class, namely a lexical space, a value space, a lexical
to value mapping, etc. etc.

This is all true, but... that's not actually what I was asking ;-)

Rather, do we need a rule that assigns the datatype value
to the bnode of the datatype property idiom? Defintion 4 does this
for the lexical form idiom. It seems that there should be
an analogous MT definition for the datatype property idiom.

Eh?
