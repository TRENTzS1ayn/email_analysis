You continue to misunderstand what I am saying. For the record,
and please print this out and paste it somewhere where you will
always see it:

 Patrick Asserts: A literal node always denotes itself, the literal string.
                  The meaning of a literal node never changes.

There, now let's try again:

A literal *AND* a datatype *TOGETHER* identify a single, specific
datatype value.

The fact that a given literal represents a particular datatype value
according to the lexical to value mapping of a particular datatype
does not change the meaning of the literal itself.

OK?

If you disagree with that, then we disagree about the very
foundation of what RDF Datatyping is, and we need not bother
to go forward.
