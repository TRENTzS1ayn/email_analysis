I'm not yet convinced that we need a completely separate tutorial.

I see two primary issues with the present WD:

1. The use of the "datatyped literal" terminology. I am quite happy
to remove that and try to capture the significance of the association
of the literal with a datatype in some other way.

2. Whether the inline idiom, the combination of literal and globally
asserted datatype, identify/express/communicate/whatever a datatype
value. I say it does. Pat seems to say it doesn't. I consider the
MT to say it does. Pat seems to say the MT doesn't say that.

If it is the consensus of the WG that the datatyping MT does *not*
say that, then I strongly assert that it should.

The debate seems to border at the RDF/extra-RDF boundary, as to
what is or is not denoted explicitly in the graph or what RDF
can or cannot say about a given lexical form.

I get the impression that Pat and I are simply viewing the issue
from different perspectives. I'm focusing on what we need RDF
Datatyping to accomplish, and trying to fit those needs/expectations
into the present definition, and the application of the present
definition to the "big picture", including considerations that
lie beyond the graph. Pat seems to be focusing on the
minimum of what the MT says, and strictly at what is explicit
in the graph. Both are valid/needed perspectives.
And I think we may actually agree, but can't see it yet.

It won't be the first time we've agreed yet stumbled over
words (mostly mine ;-)
