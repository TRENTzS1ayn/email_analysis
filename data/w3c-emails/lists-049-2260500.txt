I agree.

Well, the MT certainly doesn't say that; it is careful not to. It 
refers only to a lexical form being in a the domain of the mapping, 
not to the value of the mapping.

That might well be true.

And my concern is that by doing this, Patrick is imposing one 
particular viewpoint of how RDF is to be used. My concern when 
designing the datatyping model was to allow for a number of different 
such viewpoints to all coexist. There were more than I had bargained 
for, and its not easy to satisfy them all. The needs of a 
database-modelling user community and those of a text-markup user 
community are quite different. We should not pre-judge what our users 
want to do, particularly when that would violate the norms of 
existing user communities like Dublin Core. There are several 
different big pictures here.

Right, and I think moreover that we are mandated and required to do 
exactly that. That is our job, to make the RDF graph as unambiguous 
and useful as possible, and to state *exactly* what is the 
information content of the graph, no more and no less.  I think it 
would be a serious mistake to do anything else.
