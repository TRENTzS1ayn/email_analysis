YES. That is what the proposal says, unambiguously. The point has 
been flogged to death and I don't think there is any point in going 
back over it now. Literal meanings are FIXED, and the meaning of the 
inline triple is then determined by the ordinary RDF MT to be that 
the extension of <ex:age> contains <Jenny, "10">, not <Jenny, 10>. No 
ambiguity; fixed, firm, a done deal.  Datatyping in this case is 
wanted, by some users, in order to provide a lexical form constraint 
on the literal. (I think this is kind of dumb as well, but that's 
what they want.)

Well, not everyone agrees with you on that.

Well then you really shouldnt have written it in that form, because 
that ISNT what it says in RDF. Which illustrates the importance of 
being clear in the spec. If a user wants to say that Jenny age is 
ten, they they should use a different idiom. We have several they can 
use: they could use a datatype property, or use dlex with this range 
datatyping, either will work. BUt what IS important is that we tell 
them quite clearly that the inline idiom does NOT say that. If we 
tell them that the MT says one thing, but don't worry about that 
because we all know that *really* it doesnt mean that, you know, ha 
ha, that's just for those semantic geeks, then we are seriously 
misleading them. Because for any conforming inference engine (or 
indeed for any conforming engine of any kind), that IS what it means.

On the contrary. It says what the meaning is very precisely, and the 
idioms offer users the possibility of being achingly precise in 
saying what they mean.

Saying that the literal "10" denotes the string "10" IS saying that 
Jenny's <ex:age> is the string. That is what the MT tells you. There 
isn't any way to make it say what the MT says it doesn't say: 
defining what it says is what the MT is FOR.

It works, but it doesnt work in the way that you want it to. But what 
if someone WANTS a property value to be a string? You saying that 
should be *illegal* in RDF???
