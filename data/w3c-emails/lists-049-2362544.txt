Fine. But what Jenny's (real) age is, is NOTHING TO DO WITH US. We 
are giving a spec for the RDF. The RDF uses the uriref <ex:age>, so 
the meaning of that is what we are concerned with. And in the 
example, the meaning of that is that IEXT(I(<ex:age>)) contains 
<I(Jenny), "10">, not <I(Jenny), 10>. So that is what we should say 
about it, clearly and unambiguously; so that if someone wants the 
relational extension to contain something else, they can know to 
write their RDF differently.
