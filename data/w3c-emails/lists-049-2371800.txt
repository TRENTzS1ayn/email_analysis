OK, Im getting tired of this debate and also beginning to think that 
might be the easiest way to go. That will help to drive another nail 
into RDF's coffin, which might in the long run be the best thing for 
the world in general in any case. And it might an interesting 
experiment for one WG to simply tell another WG to shove its request 
up its ass. That might at least produce some interesting stuff in the 
coordination group email archive.

Well, if you insist, but the MT makes the pretty clear, doesn't it? 
Dark triples mean exactly nothing in the MT. They have no RDF 
entailments. I could make up a test case if you really want one, but 
it wouldnt be very interesting.

No, that would not work. The whole point is to have triples but not 
have them asserted. The point is not to make them vanish, just to 
have no *semantic* import.
