I understand. No Qnames. I just wanted to get something that was the 
shortest syntactically legal example possible. I gather that the 
minimal requirement on a uriref is that it contain a colon, so that 
<a:b> is in fact a legal uriref, right? (I wouldn't expect Omniweb to 
know what to do with it.)

Hmm, how do we write things  like <xsd:number> properly, then??

I'll do that in examples, but use the XXX BBB CCC style for stating 
closure rules, how's that? The idea being to make it very obvious 
that these are intended to be stand-in meta-variables rather than 
actual RDF.

I was thinking of saying things like 'where XXX is any uriref and AAA 
is any literal', that kind of thing. These should only occur in 
tables of rules (and maybe in the proofs of the lemmas, but that's 
math in any case.)
