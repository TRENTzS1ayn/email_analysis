I haven't been in contact with Eric since the last telecon, so we're a 
bit out of sync here.  However, here's the situation:

There is a new version of the Primer at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020418fm.html

This is primarily to give those interested something new to read(!) 
This version contains:

a considerably rewritten RDF/XML section (much more tutorial)
a considerably rewritten Schema section (much more tutorial, and with a
    pointer to DAML+OIL and WebONT)
a new container section
a new Dublin Core applications section
a new XPackage application section (thanks to Garret Wilson and Patrick
    Stickler)
a placeholder for a new "RDF as a data model" section
a bunch of small fixes

Eric was working (asynchronously) on addressing some of the comments 
we'd received on the first 3 sections (which I mostly stayed away from), 
but as I said, we've gotten out of sync, so those changes aren't in this 
version.  When I get his material I may have to change some of the later 
sections to correspond.  As a result of this, I'm not sure this is ready 
  to be a "latest version", since people won't necessarily see that 
their comments are being addressed (but it could be an Editor's Draft 
off the WG page I suppose).

Additional things to do IMO include:

a bunch of editorial notes that are in the document, and I still haven't 
addressed yet (including the fragments business, heaven help me!)

fixing up the new (crude) figures I drew to correspond with Eric's much 
nicer ones (too busy writing and going to meetings to install IsaViz)

incorporating Ron's Prism material (hint!)

editing the "Intelligent Routing" section (once I see what the Prism 
material looks like)

addressing other comments we've received (e.g., the format of N-triples 
we used)

writing the "RDF as a data model" section (which I think is kind of 
important).

dealing with the use of rdf:value (2002-02-25#17--I saw this on the 
telecon agenda, but haven't a clue as to what this is about...)

other miscellaneous issues either I, Eric, or anyone else comes up with

However, I think we've now got the bulk of the material I had in mind 
for the Primer in there (less the fragments and data model section...and 
maybe something on reification...yeah, I guess we ought to explain that 
a little).  If anyone thinks the Primer should cover anything else, let 
me know.
