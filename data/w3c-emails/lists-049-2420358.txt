I wouldn't want to see n-triples in the general examples. In the MT
section(s) they are more concise than XML, but I've been thinking that,
if n-triples are not normative, then we shouldn't have them in any
normative sections.

Thus, we should use only RDF/XML and graphic representations in the
normative sections of all specifications.
