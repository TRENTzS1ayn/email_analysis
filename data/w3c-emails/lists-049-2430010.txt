But that's primarily what's relevant to the *purpose* of RDF datatyping.

I'm arguing that there *should* be, even if it does not have explicit
denotation in the graph. That is the point of providing a datatyping
interpretation -- to get to those datatype values.

If that doesn't make sense, then RDF Datatyping doesn't make sense
and we can all just stop here.

And I'm not, and *NEVER* have said otherwise.

Again, I've never said that. And I've said that I've never
said that so many times that I can't understand why it hasn't
gotten through to you  that that is *NOT* what I am saying.

Sheesh!

Literals always denote literals and datatyping does not change
the meaning of literals, ever, in any way.

Literals always denote literals and datatyping does not change
the meaning of literals, ever, in any way.

Do you see that I've said that now?

Can we now focus on what I am really saying, which you also
seem to understand from the above, but seem to consider to be
irrelevant.

Literals and datatypes together identify specific datatype values.

That's why we bother with all this datatyping crap. To communicate
datatype values. That's what *MATTERS* to the applications needing
to do datatyping in RDF. If the present MT considers this to be
irrelevant, then it is not capturing the very reason why we are
spending so much time and energy on defining a standardized way
to communicate about datatype values.

I'm not. You continue to misunderstand what I am saying, or continue
to insist I am saying something I'm not.

Forgive me for not using your language. I only have mine to use. They
don't appear to be the same.

You also seem to have a problem understanding qualifying clauses,
such as "according to", "insofar as", "in terms of", etc. You
seem to take the base clause of the sentence, strip off all
qualifications, and then comment on how it is wrong in isolation.

I'm not challenging that decision. You only percieve that I am,
because you misunderstand me to be saying that the meaning of
a literal can change, which  I'm not saying, nor have said.
