And here is where we dance around with words. For the MT to identify
a specific datatype value is not to assign that value to any node
in the graph. It may also do that, as in the case of the lexical form
and datatype property idioms. But in the case of the inline idiom,
it does not. Yet it still provides an unambiguous interpretation of
all of the idioms which identifies a specific datatype value, and
that is the utility of RDF Datatyping for users and applications.

Firstly, I don't agree with your summary of what the text-markup
users need (being one of them myself). To constrain strings to
the lexical space of a datatype is to assert that their proper
interpretation is in terms of that datatype (or they are insane).

Secondly, Dublin Core would only ever use the datatype triple idiom,
or not do datatyping at all. Because DC does not impose any particular
datatype interpretation on its values. Users may only express how
*they* are intending their values to be interpreted, by use of
the local datatype property idiom, but to assert a datatype association
with a DC property is to say something about DC that is not specified
by the DC standard.

Granted, a given system could do so, to indicate those datatypes it
can handle, using errors to filter out unsupported content, but
that's a special case.

The rdfd:datatype assertion is intended for Ontologies where the
datatypes for the properties are part of the formal specification,
and thus, are imposed on all usage of the ontology, even if users
specify local datatyping.

That is *one* of our jobs, or one possible (narrow) interpretation
of what our job is. I disagree insofar as how that should be
accomplished and at what scopes of precision. That's not to say that
a solid MT is not *part* of our job, but it is not *all* of our job.
