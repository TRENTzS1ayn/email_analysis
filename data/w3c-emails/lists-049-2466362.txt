I would not like to see 'range' in the property name, since
it is not the assertion of the property that is constraining
the interpretation, it is the semantics of the datatype,
and the association of the datatype can be done in two
ways, either globally by association with a property or
locally by the explicit datatype property, but in either
case, it is the datatype that asserts the constraints.

I think that rdfd:datatype and rdfd:RDFDatatype communicate
most accurately the semantics and are sufficiently different
to avoid upper/lower case typos or confusion.

Eh?

Patrick
