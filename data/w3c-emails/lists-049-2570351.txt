I disagree. The Dublin Core users are free to comment.

I never said we should ignore them. I'm saying the MT should
capture the above. Yes, it does so by defining syntactic patterns
and their meanings, and there are some side effects in addition
to the primary goal, such as assigning the value to a blank node,
but the primary goal is to communicate a datatype value. If a
datatyping idiom does not communicate a datatype value, it is
broken and useless insofar as datatyping is concerned.

Please remember that I said that.

Again, you seem to be having trouble with qualifying clauses.

Sigh. Isn't that what I just said above?

Uhhh... well, since the values cannot be known or compared in RDF,
how can they clash in RDF?

You now seem to be positing constraints on RDF knowledge which
are imposed outside of RDF yet supposedly are part of the RDF
interpretation.

Well, I disagree with much of the above, so I guess the WG needs to
say something.
