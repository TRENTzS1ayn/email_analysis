I'd like something clarified about this.  First, isn't Test Cases 
normative?  If it is, excluding N-triples creates a bit of a problem 
doesn't it?  Second, isn't what's normative in RDF the graph in the 
mathematical sense?  Both N-triples and the drawings are legitimate 
representations of (mathematical) graphs aren't they?  Finally, it seems 
to me the WG has been fairly consistent in acting as if using N-triples 
actually clarified things.  If that's true, they ought to be great in 
examples!
