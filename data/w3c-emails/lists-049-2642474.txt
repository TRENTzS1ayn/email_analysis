I was too quick to second DanC's proposal.

The linkage that was clear to Pat between the weasle-words and dark triples,
was also clear to me.

For Dan's sake here is the explanation.

A dark triple is just another name for an unasserted triple. In the Model
Theory such a possibility has always been present; but since no mechanism
(syntactic or otherwise) for creating a dark triple has ever been present in
RDF the Model Theory section has been there for future extension. Since
WebOnt has formally asked for dark triples, it would be an odd response to
remove them.

WebOnt has had difficulty in clarifying WebOnt's need for dark triples.
Currently the two groups are attempting to clarify what problem we are
trying to solve, and whether dark triples actually does solve it, and
whether dark triples is the consensus solution.

My view is that we either should be serious about dark triples, in which
case there should be a mechanism for creating them; they should be in the
MT; and webont should use them for layering; or we should leave them out.
The latter is just like all the other nice to have features that we might
like in RDF2 and might be useful for something or other and that we have
left out of our clarification of M&S.

Thus I guess that the right order to go in is:
1: webont to clarify its needs sufficiently for informed consensus
2: consensus to be reached about using dark triples or not in webont
3: RDFCore following that consensus and either extending or deleting our
current treatment of dark triples

Double or quits?

Jeremy
