Well, Graham and I certainly are in sync on this one ;-)

I just suggested the exact same two changes, so I guess that must
mean something (or then, not ;-)

I think that this last closure rule, which provides the
datatype value interpretation for the combination of the
inline idiom and the global datatype assertion is the
solution to the present disagreement (presuming we all
can agree that the closure rule is acceptable).

It doesn't change the meaning of the literal node, it just
says that if you have the two statements together in a graph,
the inline idiom and the rdfd:datatype assertion, then you
can infer that a datatype value has been identified as a
value of the property.

Eh?
