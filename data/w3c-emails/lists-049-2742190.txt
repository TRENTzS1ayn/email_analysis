I spent wednesday with Brian here in Bristol, going over the RDF Schema
document in some detail. The results of our labours will be circulated on
monday.

How does this relate to schedule? monday is 22nd. W3C suspends Tech Report
publications from May 1st for a couple of weeks due to WWW2002 and the AC
meeting. That leaves a slim window for publication of a working draft
prior to the conference. We would need to approve publication of a WD on
friday 26th (ie. next week). The document will have some significant
editorial changes; we should find out early next week whether any of them
seem contoversial to WG members. I don't feel in a position to predict
schedule beyond this WD; feedback on that WD is needed before we can
accurately plot a path to REC.
