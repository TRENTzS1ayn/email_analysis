No. That is like saying that a Java application is expected to run in 
a way that isn't supported by the Java VM. It is *not* expected to 
interpret RDF in a way that is inconsistent with the MT. The MT isn't 
some arcane piece of mathematics just put there for window-dressing. 
It is the reference point for RDF meanings, and moreover it is the 
ONLY reference point that is accessible to developers of RDF 
inference engines. So any other interpretation placed on an RDF graph 
is liable to become invalid as soon as any conforming inference 
engine draws any valid RDF conclusions. That would makes RDF 
completely irrelevant: it would no longer be a bearer of 
machine-accessible information.

They may 'communicate' it, but they do not mean it.

NO. It should not, because there is no way to encode 'intent' other 
than by interpreting the RDF, and that is interpreted according to 
the MT. If I want to send you some content in RDF, all you get is the 
RDF. You don't get a meta-commentary telling you my intent. So if 
someone has the intent of saying one thing, and they use RDF in a way 
that says something else, then they are using the language not 
according to the spec. Now, some users might want to ignore the fine 
points of the spec, and use it in their own way, particularly 
'in-house' where they can be sure that the readers will understand 
their quirky ways. Fine; but that, to repeat, is not our problem, and 
I would submit is not something that we should endorse or encourage.

You just contradicted yourself. The meaning of the nodes on the graph 
IS the semantics/interpretation. That is what 'semantics' MEANS.
