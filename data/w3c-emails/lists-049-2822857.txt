Oh, I see. Hmmm, I think that reasoning is slightly misleading, 
actually, since the *constraint* strictly speaking is applied - 
asserted, if you like -  by our semantic conditions, not by the 
datatype. (The datatype is just a piece of mathematics as far as the 
semantics is concerned.)

I actually do like having something that sounds slightly "range"-ish 
in order to convey that it is being applied at the sharp end of the 
property (the object not the subject of the triple), but maybe that 
is just a private obsession.

I guess I don't like using 'datatype' (the noun) for the property 
associating a datatype to the arguments of a property. One can read 
rdfs:range as "....has a range which is....", and similarly for 
rdfs:domain, rdf:type, etc. , so to me  rdfd:datatype tends to read 
like "...has a datatype which is...."  which is misleading, since 
this doesn't attach a datatype to the *property*, so much as kind of 
empower it to attach it to its objects.

rdfd:objectDatatype ??  Nah..... I'll try again later, I seem to have 
lost my naming inspiration.
