Well, there is a relevance here in that what I say in the following 
message is pretty much what I was going to put into the next draft of 
the MT, and I was assuming that it was kind of broadly accepted. If 
it isn't, and if this vision of RDF containers isn't close to being 
right, then I don't know how to put them into the MT. Which is fine, 
but not if we expect to get a final draft of a complete MT by next 
week, as I promised on the telecon today. I need a non-moving target, 
guys.

God, I HATE looking through old minutes. Hmmm, I had totally 
forgotten that, I confess. And at this date I have no idea what I was 
going to say about it. I think it was just going to be a kind of 
elementary observation that there is no natural way to define 'rest' 
in an ordinal representation without doing arithmetic.  Nothing deep, 
Im sure.

PS in that same minutes I found this, BTW. So why are we still 
talking about it??

19: Issue rdf-containers-otherapproaches
The design of the RDF Model collection classes exhibit various
awkward features. Might these be augmented with a 'better' design?

Propose:

   o   the WG resolves this issue is out of scope for this WG
       but places the issue on the list of to be considered by a
       future WG.

See:
