AP Newswire, 20 April: Brian Powell, special
negotiator in the W3C RDF Datatypes conflict,
skillfully negotiated a cease-fire early
Friday morning Boston time. All parties agreed to
give Brian a few days to devise a longer-term
nation-building strategy.

Later that evening, parties to the cease-fire
resumed heavy shelling. Casualties have
been severe.

...


Seriously, guys; in yesterday's teleconference,
Brian asked for a break
in the datatypes discussion for a few days.
I elaborated on the point just to be clear
that we were to leave the datatypes threads
as they are. I know for certain Graham heard
me because he responded.

I thought we were pretty clear about giving
Brian a few days to sort this out.

Let's keep our part of the deal. Let's show
the chair a little respect.
