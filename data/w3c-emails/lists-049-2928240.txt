I think we are talking only about closed-containers, which was the
daml:collection issue.

Otherapproaches I saw as a much more general rethink.
(Procedurally I think I am the only one who might want to go this route ...
if discussing daml:collection is currently out-of-order because the
rdf-containers-otherapproaches issue is closed, then we may well have enough
support to reopen it; which I would like in order to discuss other things. I
am clear that this isn't the desire of the group).
