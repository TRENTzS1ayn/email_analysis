I agree with Pat.

(I mean this in the sense of:
- I did not see the contradiction
- I imagine others did not either
- now that Pat spells it out, it looks to me as if he is reasoning correctly
- I think others may be interested in my confirming opinion as to the
correctness of Pat's reasoning.

i.e. no axes being ground here).
