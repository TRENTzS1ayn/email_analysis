Hi Folks,

Well, I had a weekend off for once, if you can call building bookcases "off".

I see there has been some traffic over the weekend.

If things have gotten a little tense, I must take responsibility.  I see it 
as part of a chair's job to keep process on track and calm things down when 
necessary.  My attention has been elsewhere.

As we agreed Friday, I have the action to figure out how to move datatyping 
forward.  I'll be working with folks to do that.  I hope I can count on all 
to set aside anything that may have been said or written in a moment of 
haste, disappointment, frustration or even anger and focus on getting on 
the job finished.

Brian
