Very well.

My thinking on action items is: if nobody else
in the group remembered it in the next meeting (or two or three)
then it must not have been all that important; i.e. my
'what ever became..' question is somewhat rhetorical.
The action item was implicitly withdrawn.

Well, there's a nearby issue, rdfms-seq-representation that,
for some reason, is still open. I'm not sure if that's on
purpose or not; as I said:
