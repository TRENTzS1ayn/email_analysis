Please allow me to retract my inappropriate remark, and offer my 
apologies to you and the WG. I meant only to express my conviction 
that we, as editors, should respect the decision of the WG on the 
appropriate semantics to use; but I used a form of words that was not 
appropriate on a public forum, and did not intend you to take me this 
seriously.

I really do think we can find a way for the document to be worded in 
such a way that we can both be happy with it.

Pat
