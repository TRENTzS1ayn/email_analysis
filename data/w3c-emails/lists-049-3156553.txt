i.e. it's a "hook".

My engineering experience says: don't put
hooks in until you have tested at least two ways to exploit
the hook and be sure it's of the right size and shape.

W3C process calls for implementation of whatever features
are in a spec before granting Proposed Recommendation status.

We have (or at least: I have) become very aware of
the trick where, when groups can't come to consensus,
they put in a hook so that everybody can be happy; but
then they never test the hook, and it just becomes
an interoperability nightmare, with various implementors
ascribing various meaning to it.

If the hook stays in, I'll be sure to look in
our request for Proposed Rec status for evidence
of interoperable implementations.

I'd really rather just take it out until we're more
clear about how to use the hook.
