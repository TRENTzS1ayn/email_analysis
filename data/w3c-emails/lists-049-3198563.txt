To be more specific - PRISM does not use daml:collection. People
writing PRISM code might do so on top of a parser that understood
daml:collection. But for those of us still using older parsers like
Megginson's RDFFilter, our code will throw a syntax error since
daml:collection is an unknown parse type.

I've been meaning to move to a more up-to-date RDF parser. If I get
the chance to look into this more I'll let you know although
if someone wanted to use it in the middle of a PRISM description

Massive agreement.
