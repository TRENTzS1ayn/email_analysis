If you look at the current defn of URI-refs in N-Triples

http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#absoluteURI

you will see that there are no \u or \U escapes allowed
as described in http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#sec-uri-encoding

This might be a problem for resolving this issue.

I expect I need to change the definition of N-Triples in order to
express a resolution of rdf-charmod-uri since I noticed you (Jeremy)
used examples such as:
  <http://example.org/#Andr\u00E9> <owes> "2000" . 

  -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0113.html

which is currently not allowed.

Dave
