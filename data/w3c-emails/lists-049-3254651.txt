We have already approved the 'black charmod-uri tests 1 & 2

(and threw out the grey ones in favour of words in the syntax WD,
that I already have added)


The issues list reports this as closed

So these two tests should be in the test suite and N-Triples thus 
needs to change.

The N-Triples answers to the above tests are not in the above links.

Jeremy rewrote them inx
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/att-0116/01-charmod-uri.htm
for the i18n wg but the latter are not yet approved, and the
discussion has stopped.

I'm mostly wondering whether to change the N-Triples language
before we make the final decision, since it seems that is the way
this is heading.
