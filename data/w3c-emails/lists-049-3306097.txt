It does? Where did that come from?

The nice thing about a model theory is that it *eliminates*
things like vague noises. I hope we have no vague noises
anywhere in the model theory spec.

No? I read it (and I think lots of other people would read it)
as saying "well, you know those entialment tests? sometimes
they work, but not always. It depends, really, on
fuzzy stuff that we're waving our hands around but not
actually specifying."

Yes, and the syntax spec tells us the connection between
a hunk of XML and what's asserted (i.e. a graph of asserted
triples). I want to make sure that the connection between
RDF/XML and the various entailments is rock solid, with no
weasel words in between.

That's not vague at all, to me. If you think it's vague
in some way, please give me an example so that we can
put it in the test suite to make it crystal clear.

I accept that as your opinion. I disagree.

On the contrary: without a solid mathematical basis for RDF,
it has no role to play in building the Semantic Web.

I could be wrong. If so, I'd like to find out sooner rather
than later.

If being clear about what RDF is makes it clear that it's useless,
I'd prefer that to weasel words that allow everybody to be
happy when nobody actually agrees as to what's going on.

I prefer to resolve conflicts at the earliest possible opportunity.
If the layer cake goes up in smoke as a result of being clear
what a hunk of RDF/XML means, then so be it. Let's do that
quickly so we can get on with something else.
