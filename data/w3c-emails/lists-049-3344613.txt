It's a big change, yes. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with it.

The longhand-OK option is acceptable to me, but I dunno
if it'll fly in the WebOnt WG and community.

The other options, i.e. techniques for enhancing
the <rdf:li> style collections to express closed
lists (a) have to be at least as powerful as first/rest
in order to get the job done (I think?), and (b) look uglier.
