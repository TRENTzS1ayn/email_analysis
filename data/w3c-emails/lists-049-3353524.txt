I'm kind-of uncomfortable with this:  it seems to be a big semantic 
addition to the nature of RDF, which I thought was going to be dealt with 
at "higher" layers.  With this, adding triples to a valid graph can force 
an inconsistency.

Now, if the first/rest triples were considered to be "dark", I might feel 
easier (though there's still this new idea that a bunch of triples can 
somehow be ill-formed).

I'm finding first/rest lists to be very useful in practice, but I'm worried 
about the possibilities for unintended consequences here, especially adding 
features so late in the WG cycle.
