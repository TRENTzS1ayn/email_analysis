My take on this was that if one chooses to merge the vocabulary definition 
with the statements that use that vocabulary, the model theory gives a 
consistent reading of the resulting graph.  The meaning is well defined, 
but whether one chooses to merge the graphs in this way is less so.

Again, my take was that dark triples, if present, must be clearly indicated 
in some syntactic way to avoid this kind of vagueness.

I guess this means referring to a separate graph, and saying it's not 
asserted, which I've heard mentioned.  I'm very uncomfortable with that.

I think the model theory is silent about the meaning of multiple graphs 
*until they are merged*.  SO if we are to have dark triples, I think they 
need to be distinguished within a single graph.

Yes.

The layer cake is a useful pedagogical device, in that it illustrates some 
future goals, but I have my doubts that the various pieces will turn out to 
be related just as shown there.
