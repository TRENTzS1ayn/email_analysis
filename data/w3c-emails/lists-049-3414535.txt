I've added the tests for this issue that have already been approved:

  [[7:  charmod-literal issue closed]]

  -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0056.html


and I added them in the new manifest format to

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-charmod-literal/

Jan: please check if I got this right

Dave
