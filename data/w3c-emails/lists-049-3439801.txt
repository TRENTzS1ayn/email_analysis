Yes, this is what I thought (until yesterday) the proposal amounted 
to. I like this as it keeps RDF's hands clean but also lets WOWG do 
what it wants to do. On the other hand, one could take the line that 
if this is all that RDF is providing, why do *we* need to do it? I 
mean, they could just use the daml:collection vocabulary, right?
