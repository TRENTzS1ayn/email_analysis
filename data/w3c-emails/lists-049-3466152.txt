OK

old text:

  absoluteURI  ::=  character+ with escapes as defined in section URI References
  -- http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#absoluteURI

  3.3 URI References

  URI references are defined and encoded using the rules defined in
  [Charmod] section Character Encoding in URI References.  That is,
  disallowed characters are represented in UTF-8 and then encoded
  using the %HH format, where HH is the byte value expressed using
  hexadecimal notation.

  absoluteURI  ::=  character+ with escapes as defined in section URI References
  -- http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#absoluteURI

  3.3 URI References

  URI references are sequences of US-ASCII character productions
  encoding Unicode characters that form an Internationalized 
  Resource Identifier (IRI) [IRIs].

  Disallowed IRI characters (see [IRIs] 2.3 part B) are represented in
  UTF-8 and then encoded using the %HH format, where HH is the byte
  value expressed using hexadecimal notation.

  Characters above the US-ASCII range are made available by the \u or
  \U escapes as described in section Strings for ranges [#x80-#xFFFF]
  and [#x10000-#x10FFFF] respectively.

  Characters [#x0-#x1F] and #x7F are forbidden in URI references.

but I'm sure Jeremy could write something better :)
