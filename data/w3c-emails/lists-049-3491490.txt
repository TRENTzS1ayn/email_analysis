Guys, I would like some advise on the preferred terminology to use 
when discussing reification.

If we start with a triple

a b c .

and reify it, we get a graph of four triples

_:x rdf:type rdf:Statement .
_:x rdf:subject a .
_:x rdf:predicate b .
_:x rdf:object c .

1. I think it is correct to refer to the second graph as "a 
reification" of the first triple, is that right?
2. Is there a preferred terminology to refer to the bnode which 
denotes the triple in the reification, ie _:x in this example? (If 
not, I will have to make one up.)

Thanks.

Pat
