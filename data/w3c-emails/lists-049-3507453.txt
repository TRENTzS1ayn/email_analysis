Concerning the new MT draft, I dont think I will have a publishable 
version ready by Friday as promised. I will post whatever I have 
managed to get done at a URI by tomorrow so folk can take a look at 
it, but it still needs copyediting, diagrams fixing, additions to 
tables, lemmas rewriting and other PTDBD stuff I will have to get 
done early next week. Sorry.
