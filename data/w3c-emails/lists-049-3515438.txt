An incomplete but readable draft of the MT with containers and 
reification added and tidy literals can be found at 
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/w3-rdf-mt-draft-42402.html.  @@ 
indicates comments or work to be done. I know it is scruffy, bear 
with me.

I will post updated versions with a similar URI format reflecting the 
date of posting.

Feedback welcomed, particularly on the reification section.

Pat
