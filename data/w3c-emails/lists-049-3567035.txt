Frivolous comment: I used to have a somwhat unflattering nickname
("weasel")*, so to read of their demise was quite a blow :-)

Anyroadup: I was thinking about this yesterday when sketching out a
separate unix-style filter to output the rdf(s)-closure of an ntriples
document.

However, it is easy to see that the rules will indeed terminate
on any finite RDF graph, since there are only finitely many
triples that can be formed from a given finite vocabulary.

Unfortunately, this isn't true when you include closure rules for RDF
containers - since any graph presumaby entails (for example)

<rdf:_n> <rdf:type> <rdf:Property>

for any value of n in <rdf:_n>. It's simple to say "throw in all of
these" (I'd be happy with this) but a naive approach to implementing
Pat's closure rules will take a looooong time :-)

PS. This isn't too much of a hardship for pure entailment tests, since
there's an obvious getout.

* got it off a guy named "Womble", go figure.
