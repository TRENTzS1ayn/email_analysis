I am sorry this is so late.

* F2F in June:

Yes it does.


* 11: How to represent triples in documents.

DECISION 1:
Triples should be represented using correct n-triples.

* 12: Datatyping WD
* Is this document ready for first publication?  Are the editors agreed?

The editors are not agreed.

DECISION 6:
Do not publish Datatyping WD at this time.

>2002-04-19#13:  bwm propose how we move forward with datatyping

* 13: Issue: rdfs-online-char-encoding
* Propose:
* o action Eric to update the schema file with the appropriate character
    encoding declaration
* o close this issue

Hasty looking at file.
It seems to be OK.

DECISION 2:
Close rdfs-online-char-encoding.

* 14: Issue: rdfs-container-membership-superProperty

DECISION 3:
rdfs-container-membership-superProperty: there will be one.

Discussion included:
- entailment works one but not the other.
>2002-04-19#14:  danc do entailement test case for container with
rdfs:contains
- rdf:member or rdf:contains
>2002-04-19#15:  danbri propose name for container-membership-superProperty
>2002-04-19#16:  danbri review effect _NNN-superProperty on primer

* 15: Issue: rdfs-constraining-containers
[[[
Propose:

  o the WG resolves that expressing such a constraint is beyond the
    scope of RDFS.  Such functionality belongs with more powerful
    ontology languages such as daml+oil and owl.

  o The WG notes that DAML+OIL can express this constraint as described in:

    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0106.html

  o The WG closes this issue
]]]

DECISION 4:  proposal agreed.

16: Issue: rdfs-subClassOf-a-Property
[[[
Propose the WG resolves:

  o an instance of the Property class may have an rdfs:subClassOf
    property

  o the meaning of such a property is defined by the model theory

  o this issue be closed
]]]
DECISION 5: proposal agreed.

Discussion that resolution is unhelpful.

>2002-04-19#17:  pat respond helpfully to rdfs-subClassOf-a-Property raiser
>2002-04-19#18:  jan produce test case for rdfs-subClassOf-a-Property

* 17: daml:collection
Small amount of discussion but time runs out.

Meeting adjourned.

* 18: Issue: rdf-charmod-resources
Not reached.

* 19: Suggest after hours discussion of dark triples
Suggestion was followed (profitably!).
