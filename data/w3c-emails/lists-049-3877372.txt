Jan, Jos,

I'm supposed to do a (negative) entailment
test that shows rdfs:contains does *not*
entail rdf:_1.

I got as far as putting the premise and
the (non-)conclusion in

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-container-membership-superProperty/not1P.n3
and
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-container-membership-superProperty/not1C.n3

but I'm not sure what else to do. Er..
I guess I can convert them to RDF/xml...
ok; done.

But I'm not sure what to do with
all this <test:premiseDocument> stuff; is that something
you guys would please do for me?
