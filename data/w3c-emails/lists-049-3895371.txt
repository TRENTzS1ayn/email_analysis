There is a new version of the Primer at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020424.html

This contains:

*  all the material in the version most of you were reviewing: 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020418fm.html
which Eric modified on April 23 to synch up both of our revisions
(so if you've been commenting on this version, it wasn't wasted)

*  a new application section on Prism (thanks Ron!)

*  a few @@ sections deleted or reorganized

*  some minor formatting nits fixed (some still remain)


[NB: This does NOT deal with rdf:value].  


Eric and I feel this is ready to publish as a new WD, once the WG 
reviews and votes on it.  Due to the W3C publishing moratorium (see 
below), and due to the fact that you're just getting this revision, 
actual publication may be delayed.  I'd like to suggest that in the 
meantime, this version get linked to off the RDF Core WG page as the 
Editor's working draft (at the moment, the version listed as the 
"editor's working draft" is *older* than the current WD).

Regarding schedule, Eric and I put our heads together and came up with 
the following proposal (Eric:  correct me if I'm wrong here):

draft to WG:  26 April [this one]
WG vote: ???
publish:  15 May [or later, depending on moratorium]

draft to WG:  7 June
WG vote:  14 June
publish:  17 June

draft to WG:  12 July
WG vote:  19 July
publish:  22 July [Last Call]

PS:  I've received some very helpful comments from Martyn Horner 
(thanks!).  Keep those cards and letters coming in folks...
