If it is in fact decided that the namespaces must change, I propose
that there be a single new namespace for all RDF, RDFS, RDFD terms.

A common source of typos and confusion for new users is keeping
straight whether to use rdf: or rdfs: (and soon even rdfd:) etc.
so I think that having a single namespace would be beneficial.
