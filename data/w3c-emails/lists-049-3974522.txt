*If* we changed, I'd argue to put RDF 'model' and RDFS properties and
classes in a common schema, and datatyping in a separate one. Unless we
get rapid community buy-in on our datatyping design, which we're yet to
see. Another namespace for syntactic constructs (rdf:about, rdf:resource)
seems plausible and neater, though I don't see any great demand for it.

That said, I don't think we should change the namespace.

We should instead be clear about taking this seriously, and poll the
tool and content creators whose work this will affect. My instint is that
they'd support us staying with the old namespace URIs.
