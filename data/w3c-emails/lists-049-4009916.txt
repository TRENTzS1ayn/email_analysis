3.3 URIRefs



The uriref production expands to a string which must be a URI reference as
defined in [IETF RFC 2396], or must result in a URI reference after the
standard escaping procedure is applied. The procedure is applied when
passing the URI reference to a URI resolver. The standard escaping
procedure is described in [IETF RFC 2396] using UTF-8 as the character
encoding.

We could add a non-normative link to xlink for the full procedure, we could
just copy-paste from xlink, there is also the rfc 2732 issue that my text
doesn't deal with.

I am hoping we will have time to consider the choice at the telecon today.
I am fairly easy as to whether to have the link to IRI or not ...

I believe Dave's proposed text and my proposed text differ in their
treatment of bidi IRIs!
(not that I've read that bit of Martin D?rst's draft).
