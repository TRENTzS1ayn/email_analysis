Points:

1: There should be three miscellaneous tests

rdfms-nested-bagIDs/test010 thru 12

not six parser tests.

Every parser will fail one of 10=>10a or 10=>10b.

2: has this one been approved?

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-uri-substructure/error001
.nt

It's another miscellaneous one.



I am happy with publication, with or without changes addressing the above
points, and with or without changes addressing the IRI issue.

Jeremy
