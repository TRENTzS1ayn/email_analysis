Before we contemplate changing what we're calling a "schema" to an 
"ontology", I'd like to get WebOnt's official blessing on the idea that 
what we actually have in an RDF schema is an ontology (primitive, 
perhaps, but an ontology).  Do they really consider RDF Schemas to be 
ontologies?  There have been very extensive debates in various circles 
on exactly what you have to have in a language in order to claim you 
have an "ontology" and, if we're going to get involved in such debates, 
I'd want to make sure the W3C semantic web groups at least are speaking 
with a reasonably common voice.  My own response to someone who asked 
whether an RDF Schema was a schema or an ontology would be "it's not an 
"or" kind of question".   If they asked whether an XML Schema was a 
schema or an ontology, my response would be "depends on what you intend 
to use it for" (we have some XML schemas that claim to be ontologies, 
and in a sense they're probably right).
