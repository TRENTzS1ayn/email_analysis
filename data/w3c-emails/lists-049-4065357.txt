This is my view too. My own response would be that a _specific_ RDF
Schema is an implementation (or embodiment) of a _specific_ ontology. To
the extent that an ontology can be expressed in a variety of ways,
`schema' is the more precise term. If you speak of schemas and
ontologies in general terms then they tend to become interchangeable.

Perhaps you can use the words `program' and `algorithm' to illustrate a
similar contrast.

For these reasons it seems right that we should talk about schemas (the
embodiment) and WebOnt should talk about ontologies (the abstract).
