Opposed.

There are practical problems in RDF serialization.
At some point the specs need to acknowledge this, and indicate to
implementors what they should do.

In RDF2 I would hope to fix this, e.g. allow the "_:nnn" bnode syntax as
matching uriref production in the grammar.
That was out of charter.

The charter allows us to clarify M&S.
The clarification is "this is screwed up".

I think a minor change highlighting that the meaning of the graph has
changed in such a serialization may improve the document.
