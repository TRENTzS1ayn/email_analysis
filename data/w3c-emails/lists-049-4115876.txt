The following is what I consider to be the key issue that
arose regarding what the WD prose says and what the MT says.

I'm presenting it here so that folks can comment on it, either
to agree or disagree with my assertions and conclusion.

   I assert that:

   1. The most commonly used, and most desired idiom is the inline idiom.

   2. The vast majority of users need a solution for communicating datatype
      values (not just lexically constrained strings).

   3. The present MT does not communicate datatype values via the inline
      idiom.
   
   Therefore, the present proposal does not meet the datatyping needs of the
   vast majority of RDF users, and is unacceptable.

My earlier acceptance was based on a misunderstanding of what the MT was
communicating to applications. I considered that even though the datatype
value for the inline idiom did not have explicit denotation in the graph,
it was nevertheless unambiguously identified ("nearby") and was available
to applications. This appears not to be the case, and if the inline idiom
cannot be made to communicate a datatype value to the application, I
would need to retract my support for the present 'stake in the ground'
proposal.

Cheers,

Patrick
