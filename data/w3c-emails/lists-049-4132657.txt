Correct; that's noted in the descriptions of those tests. I'm unsure
what to do here - since these tests are, in a large part, for human
consumption, this seemed better than any kind of disjunctive encoding in
the manifest (I preferred to keep it simple in this case).

I'd rather keep these as is with the note, in the first instance (and
await other comments).
