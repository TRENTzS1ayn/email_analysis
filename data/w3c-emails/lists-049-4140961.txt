Ah, we disagree.

Agreed

Offer guidance, sure. Provide pseudocode -- perhaps in a Note.

The current text provides an algorithm for taking an RDF graph and turning
it into an RDF/XML document whose meaning is different from the graph's.
Our decisions on bNodes make this clear.

Yup.
I'd do it a bit differently: unique bnode labels could be (just about...)
done as unambiguous properties of a resource. (as could URI names, imho,
but definitely RDF 2 territory there).

This doesn't help folk tying to serialize the 1.0 spec graphs, and having
guidance in the doc (or a doc) is useful. I want to write a serializer in
Ruby, for eg., and guidance much appreciated.

Having a serialization algorithm that directly contravenes one of our most
painfully drawn out decisions also feels a bit wrong. I'd rather the spec
stayed silent or we introduced a better version of the id/idref linking
syntax (which'd take time) than include the current spec.

If the meaning changes, it's not a serialization so much as a
transformation...
