I don't think so; I don't think it makes the case for why
we should be able to keep the old namespace name even though
we're changing the language.

It suggests that there is a case to be made, but it
doesn't make the case.

I'd like to help write it, but I'm not in a good position just now.

That's another promise that I'd like fullfilled before we close
the issue.
