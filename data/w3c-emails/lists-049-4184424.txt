Hi folks,

Brian asked me to bring this issue to the WG for decision, namely,
we agreed at the f2f that the entailment put forth by Jeremy was
important, but did not decide whether it was true or false. This
was presented in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0635.html

I would like to present two entailments derived from Jeremy's
original posting rather than the original, to avoid the issue
of multiple variant properties (ageA vs. ageB) and also to
contrast the presence or absence of a globally asserted datatype
for the property in question, which appears to be central to the
issue.

Jeremy, or anyone else, feel free to trounce and flog me if you
feel these do not capture the essential aspects of the original
entailment.

Entailment 1: No global datatyping assertion

Does

   Jenny age "10" .
   Tommy age _:b .
   _:b xsd:integer "10" .

entail

   Jenny age _:x .
   Tommy age _:x .

???

Entailment 2: Global datatyping assertion

Does

   age rdfd:datatype xsd:integer .
   Jenny age "10" .
   Tommy age _:b .
   _:b xsd:integer "10" .

entail

   Jenny age _:x .
   Tommy age _:x .

???


Note that the above questions have to do with whether these
entailments *should* be true, and *not* whether the present MT
says they are in fact true.

My own answers to the above two questions are:

Entailment 1 should *not* be true.
Entailment 2 *should* be true.

Regards,

Patrick
