11: Document status

Model Theory:
PatH is running a little behind schedule
Important changes:  simplification of literals, expunged weasle wording 
about (un)asserted triples, some discussion of containers - not complete.

ACTION 2002-04-26#6, PatH: If possible, submit new MT document to Eric for 
publication by 29 April, AM.

Datatypes:
bwm:  need to take care that datatype spec and model theory don't say 
different things;  some issues to be resolved between PatrickS and PatH 
about what the MT actually says

No resolutions here.


12: Primer

Frank:  message sent out last night - new version 20020424 has all of 
material from reviewed version PLUS new section on PRISM plus editorial 
changes.
See:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020418fm.html
Does not deal with use of rdf:value.  Eric and Frank believe it's ready to 
publish.
DanBri:  hasn't reviewed schema section yet;  would like warning on that 
... or blanket warning about possible mis-sync between documents.

Discussion about whether URI should be %-escaped to US-ASCII, of left as 
Unicode in Normal Form C (NFC).  No overwhelming opinion, but in absence of 
adequate guidance from I18N and other standards, we need to make a decision.

PROPOSED:  Leave URI reference as un-escaped Unicode (alternative is to 
convert to %-escaped US-ASCII)
Opposed:  bwm, aaronsw, josd
Abstain: frankm
All others agree or concur
Some test cases (Item 13) resolved in light of this decision...
