yes, that would be something like

  { :rule3a . ?p rdfd:dcrange ?d . ?p rdfd:valueProp ?q . ?s ?p ?o }
      log:implies
          { ?s ?q [ :f ( ?p ?d ?q ?s ?o ) ] } .

  { :rule3b . ?p rdfd:dcrange ?d . ?p rdfd:valueProp ?q . ?s ?p ?o }
      log:implies
          { [ :f ( ?p ?d ?q ?s ?o ) ] ?d ?o } .
