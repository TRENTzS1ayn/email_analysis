I follow you up to this point, but don't see how 10 is required
to equal "10". You have two sets of statements, which equate
to essentially

   "10" ex:PPP "10" .

and

   "10" ex:PPP 10 .
   10 rdfd:lex "10" .

I don't see where 10 must equal "10". No'one has declared that
ex:PPP is a daml:uniqueProperty. There is no reason why _:x
cannot have multiple, different values for the ex:PPP property.

[and, as an aside, you can't use daml:uniqueProperty and both
the inline and bnode idioms, ever, given the present MT which
has literals always denoting literals]

I'm probably missing something here (like several years of
formal math training ;-) but I don't see where the equality
of 10 and "10" is actually asserted or required.
