Fair enough, I'm happy to add that as a precondition, though I don't think 
its really necessary in this case.

I was under the impression this one was subject to some criticism:

   a) Pat proposed it did not work (supported by Jeremy)

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0341.html

   b) it has unfortunate interactions with things like 
daml:uniqueProperty.  What if ?p is unique?

The form I suggested is sufficient for the Cannes entailment, which of 
course is why I resisted your rewriting it.

Because that is what xml schema uses.

Every occurrence?

True.  But the xsi mechanism may allow us to use DTD's and schemas to 
override the interpretation of existing RDF.
