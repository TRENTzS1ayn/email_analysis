The problem with owl:UniqueProperty exists regardless of the
proposed closure rule.

If you have both

   Jenny ex:age "10" .

and 

   Jenny ex:age _:x .
   _:x xsd:integer "10" .

in the same graph, you will still get the conflict with

   ex:age a owl:UniqueProperty .

since "10" will denote the literal and _:x will denote
the datatype value.

This is a fundamental incompatability with the coexistence
of the inline and bnode based idioms and owl:UniqueProperty,
and may even be construed as evidence of a problem with
literals always denoting themselves...
