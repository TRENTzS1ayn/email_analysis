Are all 'resources' in the MT members of rdf:Resource?

If so, then literals are members of rdf:Resource, right, in
which case, rdfs:Literal should be rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource,
right?
 
If all 'resources' in the MT are not necessarily members of
rdf:Resource, then some further clarification is needed.

This seems to conflict with what the Schema spec says, which
is that a member of rdfs:Literal is self-denoting. A uriref
is not self-denoting and therefore cannot be a member of
rdfs:Literal.

Do we have a conflict here between the graph syntax and
the general semantics of RDF Classes?

Perhaps rdfs:Literal is not an rdfs:Class? Perhaps it's
something different, a primitive "type" at a level below
that of rdfs:Class?
