I was fine with this until I noticed DanC's comment.  Here's some suggested 
extra text to replace your first point:

- that it does NOT intend to create new namespace URI references to name 
the RDF Schema namespace[1] and the RDF model/syntax 
namespace[2].  Although there have been changes to the definition of some 
RDF vocabulary in this namespace, we believe the changes do not change the 
meaning of any existing RDF for which there is an unambiguous and 
widely-used meaning.
