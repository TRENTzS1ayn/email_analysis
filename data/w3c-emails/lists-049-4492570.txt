Without wishing to hijack this debate, in some recent work of mine I have 
noted a possible motivation for dark triples; see 
http://www.ninebynine.org/RDFNotes/RDFForLittleLanguages.htm#xtocid137228

[[
7.4 Implications for "dark triples"

As I write this, the RDF core working group has been giving some 
consideration to "dark triples" (i.e. unasserted triples) in RDF models.

Using RDF graphs to encode my "little languages", I have no idea if the 
corresponding subgraphs are satisfiable in the RDF model theory [10]. 
Practically, this doesn't matter for my applications: they work fine. But 
is there a problem lurking if the same RDF data is used by advanced 
reasoners that make full use of the RDF entailments sanctioned by the model 
theory?

This uncertainty would be banished if the RDF core language explicitly 
recognizes dark triples, and provides a syntactic or other mechanism to 
designate certain statements as "dark triples".
