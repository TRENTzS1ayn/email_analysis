Roughly, I think that this is what we currently have.  RDF know's nothing 
about the nature of "10", but further knowledge may come from out-of-band 
information.

EXCEPT: the "really means" implies that the original statement interpreted 
according to the current model theory may be not true (i.e. <I(jenny), 
I("10")> is not in the relational extension of I(age)), which I think would 
be broken in the face of the tidy literals decision.  SO, I think there are 
two sub-choices for this fix:

(a) "knows" with tidy literals (i.e. I("10")=="10")
(b) "knows" without tidy literals

I think adding rules to RDF is a substantial change and out of 
scope.  Especially this late in the WG cycle.

Again, this is a substantial change.

Also, it doesn't help CC/PP.

I agree.
