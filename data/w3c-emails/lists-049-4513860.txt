I disagree somewhat on this issue.  I don't think the problem is in the 
initial statement that RDF classes are something like OO classes (which 
they are).  The problem is in failing to go on and clarify what the 
difference is (which none of the Schema specs ever really did very 
well).  I've tried to do a bit of that in the latest Primer version (you 
might want to look at what's said about this in the Primer, and see if 
it's clear enough for you).  I'm not sure it's appropriate to rely on 
the Primer for all this explanatory material (but if we're going to do 
it, you guys better look at the Primer too, because if that's the only 
place explanatory material is going to be, that's where people will take 
their explanations from).
