There is a near-publication-ready (needs version URI and date 
updating) MT draft now visible at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/w3-rdf-mt-draft-42802.html

I'm happy for this to go out, if nobody has any objections. (Oh, it 
may need some extra header wording to cover the new pub rules, sorry 
I forgot about that. )

Changes:
1. many small changes to notation & wording to provide internal 
consistency.  Ntriples are used correctly throughout, BUT y'all might 
want to check out the [abbreviation convention] described in section 
0.2 and used extensively later in the document.
2. Reification/containers write-up more complete
3. Lemmas section shortened (the material removed is now in appendix B)
4.  The rdf/rdfs-specific stuff has been reorganized so as to put the 
actual MT together in one section and the entailment/closure rules 
stuff in another section. I think this makes the exposition clearer.
5. Closure rules now cover reification and container vocabulary
6. Several bits of explanatory text have been inserted to catch 
possible misunderstandings.
