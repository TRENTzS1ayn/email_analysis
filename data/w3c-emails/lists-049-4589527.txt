Yes. That is, rdf:Resource denotes the universe IR in any interpretation.

NOt necessarily, as the MT is currently set up. (We could do it 
differently so that all interpretations were required to contain all 
strings, but there doesnt seem to be any need for that.)

Does it say a member of rdfs:Literal, or a literal?

A uriref isn't, sure. But (1) a uriref isnt the same thing as a 
resource, and (2) the issue is whether the resource referred to is in 
that class. RDF doesnt have any way of talking about urirefs: it uses 
urirefs to talk about resources.

I don't think so.

>Perhaps rdfs:Literal is not an rdfs:Class?

Well, Im assuming it is a class, so it can't be the set of literals. 
That is my point. If y'all want it to actually be the set of 
literals, then we would need to re-think this whole issue.
