1) maybe I am misunderstanding it but
[[
Axiom: Opacity of URIs
The only thing you can use an identifier for is to refer to an object.
When you are not dereferencing you should not look at the contents of
the URI string to gain other information as little as possible.
]] -- http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#opaque

2) RFC2396 the URI spec so far, and I have to build
stuff like our R representative mechanism on top of that
