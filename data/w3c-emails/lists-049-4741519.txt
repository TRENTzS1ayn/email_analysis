Thanks.

I'm tidying up some loose ends this morning. One thing that might be of
interest is an image I'm adding to the Examples section. There isn't time
to do a full worked example in this version, but the image does set the
scene for the rest of the document and for a worked example / test case
that can run throughout the document.

The yellow colour in the diagram corresponds roughly to the world of RDF
application data; the remainder of the diagram shows the interplay of RDF
Schema vocab and application-specific schemas.

If someone could check that it prints ok I'd be grateful...
