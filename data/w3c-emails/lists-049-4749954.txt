Less than we might think.

I agreed with all the facts you laid out; only disagreeing with the action.

A different action could be:
- add some test cases to clarify the difficulty
- indicate that often we have to serialize an "instance of" a graph rather
than the graph itself. (see model theory section 0 for defn of "instance
of")
- add sufficient warning text
- change status to non-normative

Test cases:

error001.nt
_:foo <eg:test> _:foo .

has no corresponding RDF/XML (we already have one of these error001.nt
somewhere).

B:

<eg:sk1> <eg:test> <eg:sk1> .

C:

<eg:sk2> <eg:test> <eg:sk2> .

Then two entailment tests and four non-entailment tests (between the three
graphs above) clarify the relationships between these graphs. By referring
to these test cases in the serialization text the limitations of the method
can be made clear.

It's a fairly small transformation, and that smallness can be made clear
model theoretically.
