1.  I see this as a change.

2.  No case for making this change has been made.

3.  I am wary of building on other specs that are not stable and well
     understood.  I see no strong advantage to RDF in supporting this
     now and it increases our risks.

4.  As most implemenations don't support it now, it will decrease
     interoperability

5.  This is pushing our charter; it violates the closest thing I have to
     a principal for what is in and what is out of charter

There is no strong reason to do it now.  There are disadvantages to doing
it now.  Don't do it know.

Brian
