Thanks Brian

It feels somewhat bad mannered to ask for your reasons and then try and
rebutt them, but I guess that's the process ...

I think that a clear case has been made for the need for clarification.
A case has been made for making this changeHH^Hlarification; however
you have not found it compelling.

I agree, and I am not advocating building on the IRI spec for that reason.
I believe that RDF Core has responsibilities to the international community
which cannot be addressed simply by saying that the IRI spec is not cooked
so we will leave things vague.
I think this decision does need to be backed up by comments on Charmod, IRI
draft (and XML 1.1 vis-a-vis namespace identifiers) that indicate where we
are going and getting consensus around that.

interoperability of US-ASCII URIs is not impacted.
There is no current interoperability of non US-ASCII URIs because no spec
indicates whether upper case or lower case % escaping should be done.

I think this reflects item 2. You find the need for clarification less than
compelling; hence you have doubts about whether this is in-scope.

If we are convinced that this change is right, it costs less to make the
change now than in the future.
