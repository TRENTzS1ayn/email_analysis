Why does the spec need to tell implementors what to do? There are 
several well-known techniques for handling local variables, and the 
choice is up to the implementor.

Fix what?

Wait: its not screwed up. The MT is about as clear as it can possibly 
be on this issue. Bnodes are not urirefs, and it is *invalid* to 
replace a bnode by a uriref, even a 'new' one.  Sorry about the 
practical problems, but life is like that.

I vote to scrap the misleading wording in section 6.
