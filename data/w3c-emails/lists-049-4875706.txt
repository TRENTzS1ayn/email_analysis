Correct. Actually, the strict RDF+OWL conclusion here would be that 
10="10", which presumably would be ruled out by the datatyping 
constraints.

Well, lets not overstate the case. Obviously it is inconsistent to 
say both that a property is a UniqueProperty, and also that it has 
several distinct values for a given subject. However, I don't see 
that as being a 'fundamental incompatibility' or evidence of any kind 
of 'problem' (except maybe in the mind of whoever made those 
assertions.)
