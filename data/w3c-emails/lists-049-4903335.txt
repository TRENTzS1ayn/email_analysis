What's wrong with the term "RDF Schema", and, if its definition is not
precise enough, creating a precise-enough definition?  I repeat what I
sent to DanBri on this subject:

If people are going to have trouble telling an "RDF schema" from an "XML
schema", imagine that "RDF" and "XML" are namespace prefixes, and spell
them RDF:schema and XML:schema respectively.  If people can't keep them
straight then, we need to go back to the XML namespace folks and tell
them it'll never work.  If the problem is with the definition of "RDF
Schema", how does changing the name help?  (Let's call them "RDF
frogs"...oops!  "frog" is in use already, and someone might think an RDF
frog had a sticky tongue...)
