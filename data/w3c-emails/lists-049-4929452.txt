XML Schema has not only the 9 or so
primitive types, but also bunch of facets
for user-defined types ala "integers
between 5 and 10".

I don't think any of the recent datatyping
proposals allows me to express that datatype.

Is that a problem[ftf]?

I suggest, tentatively, that it is.

[crud; I was gonna write a bit more, but
I've got another meeting. I think I better
send this now, though, before I put it
off for another three weeks...]
