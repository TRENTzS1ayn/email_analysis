Graham,

Thanks for this! A lot of fair points, a few of which (the typose at
least) may have been addressed in the now-published WD already. I'm off to
Hawaii for WWW2002 shortly, and will be taking a little break from RDFS
the next 2-3 weeks, but I do think you raise a number of points worthy of
discussion. The notion of restriction in RDF needs better presentation.
This is connected to the removal of the 'constraint' vocabulary from RDFS.
I believe range and domain do restrict the interpretations of the RDF
graph (in the MT sense), but they can't be read as restricting in the XML
Schema  / DTD validity sense. That wasn't very articulate! I'll try to
come up with some words for this while on the road...

thanks again,

Dan
