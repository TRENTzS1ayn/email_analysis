I will not be able to participate in this Friday's telecon, but will
resume participation thereafter.

If there is a vote regarding tidy/untidy literals this Friday, please
accept this as my vote in favor of unitidy literals and against tidy
literals.

I also propose that the WG adopt untidy literals, both syntactically
and semantically, and task the editors of the datatyping WD to complete
the WD ASAP for publication.

Thanks,

Patrick
