Looking at the various responses to the survey, it seems to me that there 
isn't a clear community consensus about what is desired or 
needed.  Following the lead of others [1,2] I'm thinking it's time to 
reduce the problem to something we can agree on.

Agreeing with Jeremy, I think nobody has problems with the local typing 
idiom.  Maybe the global datatyping idiom, however seductive, is just a Bad 
Idea?  I'm ready to throw in the towel on that bit.  I think it's better 
not to try and specify it than to specify it badly.
