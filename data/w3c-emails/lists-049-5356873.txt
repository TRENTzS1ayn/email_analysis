Sorry about that; I agree, but I didn't have the energy to fight harder.
I did put the HTTP-NG type system on the table, which had a nice
design for rationals (hm... reviewing, it seems to be fixed-point,
not rationals... anyway...). Sigh.

Well, floating point numbers are not restrictions of rationals.
Floating point multiplication and addition are not, strictly
speaking, associative.

There's a great piece on that in the proceedings of the WG...

Aha! there it is:
