7) New Document 

A new draft of 'Resource Description Framework (RDF): Overview and
Abstract Data Model' is now availiable

See:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0177.html

Last week we had people sign up to review this, I'd like to vote on a go
for first working draft.

8) Datatypes

This is the bottleneck that is keeping us from completing our work; I'd
like to spend the majority of time on this call to figure this out.

Some ready-reference notes/context:

a) 

My analysis digging through the working group and interest group posts
on this issue is right in line with Graham's

[[
Looking at the various responses to the survey, it seems to me that
there 
isn't a clear community consensus about what is desired or 
needed.
]] -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0002.html

More to the point, I think Graham further summed up my views beter than
I could articulate these ...

[[
Following the lead of others [1,2] I'm thinking it's time to 
reduce the problem to something we can agree on.

Agreeing with Jeremy, I think nobody has problems with the local typing 
idiom.  Maybe the global datatyping idiom, however seductive, is just a
Bad 
Idea?  I'm ready to throw in the towel on that bit.  I think it's better
not to try and specify it than to specify it badly.

b)

Patrick has sent regrets, but has a clear position on this - 

[[
If there is a vote regarding tidy/untidy literals this Friday, please
accept this as my vote in favor of unitidy literals and against tidy
literals.
]]

c)
