Hi

Here is a new version of the LBase / 'Semantics for Languages of the SW'
document, based on a tidy up of a version Guha sent me last week. It is
not quite Note-ready, but getting into shape. The section numbering /
table of contents needs fixing up, and I'd some feedback on the 'Status of
this document' section from members of the WG.

Re the 'status', I tried to capture the sense that this was a proposal
that had spun out of WG discussions, that related to WG requirements
(cited), and was being published by the WG as a way of documenting some
techniques we're using, rather than as the WG's proposal for a SW layering
architecture. There may be some more work to do on this, ie. making sure
the 'Abstract' and 'STatus' sections strike the same tone. Comments from
the WG and authors on this, and -- of course! -- on the substance of the
document would be useful.

I don't propose to do any more on it this week. BTW Guha/Pat, if you send
me a revision, please work from this XHTML'd version.

Please note that this is *not* yet a W3C tech report. I've used a generic
W3C stylesheet and prep'd things for publication as a Note, should the WG
decide to do so. This should be reasonably clear from the doc itself, btw.

cheers,

Dan
