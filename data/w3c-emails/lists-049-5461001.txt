Well, I share similar blame ... I had an opportunity to register dissent

Good point.  I was only considering representation and comparison.

I still think that rationals would be a good basis for integers and fixed 
and some other numeric values...

... but I agree there's a compelling case to treat float and double separately.

(An alternative might have been to have only integers, and compose 
rationals, -- this is roughly what XML schema WG said to me -- but it's not 
clear to me how one would have a standard definition of comparison -- which 
question the WG did not answer.)

Anyway, I guess that's all water under the bridge, and we have to get on 
with life?
