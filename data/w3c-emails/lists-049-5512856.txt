The current review target, released Monday and also lodged in www-archive, is:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-basics/2002-07-29/Overview.htm

(See:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0177.html
for the www-archive URI.)

(There is an accessible editors' working copy, which Dave cited in his 
recent message.)
