Isn't true because the registration process isn't complete, or because of 
the assertional nature claimed?

Regarding the latter, I can't find any definitive documentation of this -- 
the new document was intended to provide that (among other things) but I 
understood that was the intent of the working group;  it's an assumption 
that seems to me to have permeated many discussions we've had; e.g.

[[
As was clear in Dan Connolly's draft[1], it is important that the media type
specification make this point clear. I have included the wording:

     Because RDF is a format for semantically-meaningful information, it is
     important to note that transmission of RDF via HTTP, SMTP or some
     similar protocol, means that the sender asserts the content of the RDF
     document.

I concede that nothing here is definitive, and in reviewing the various 
discussions I think I've maybe focused too exclusively on MIME type -- but 
the idea that protocol context (which IMO includes MIME type) goes toward 
determining if some RDF is asserted I think *is* a common understanding.
