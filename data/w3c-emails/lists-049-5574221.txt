This is a quick review of
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Jul/att-0056/01-Overview.htm

General points...

I can't help but think we're trying to do 2 very important (but
distinct) things in this document

1) Defining/Spcifying RDF's Abstract Data Model (something akin to the
goals of http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-absyn-20020729/  or
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)

and

2) various 'other' things - other technical aspects of RDF that do not
fall under the topics of formal semantics, XML serialization syntax or
RDF schema and vocabulary definitions.

my gut reaction here, however is that they *do* full under the
(relatively large) umbrella of the primer and as such belong there.

If this is the case (more specifically if the group agrees) I'm willing
to help figure out how best we can integrate these pieces most
effectively into the primer.


Specific points...


Section 1. Introduction

Ordering here seems odd to me.. suggest something like

* RDF model definition language (RDF Model)
* RDF vocabulary definition language (RDF Schema)
* Formal semantics
* XML serialization syntax

(I think the first bullet may be the title for what you're defining here
and sync's with the other doc)

Also I think its ok if this document is short and simple; there isn't a
lot to the RDF Model :) This is a feature, not a bug...


Section 2.2.4 XML-based syntax

"RDF has an XML-based serialization form which, if used appropriately,
allows a wide range of "ordinary" XML data to be interpreted as RDF
[STRIPEDRDF]."

hmm... i'd remove this citation as this an rdfcore spec (and actually
subjective). I'd rather see this sync'ed with the Syntax documents
current wording, examples.


Section 2.4.3 XML serialization syntax

I would drop this and prefer to sync with RDF Syntax specs


Section Acknowledgments

This looks good (other than the fact that its missing me :) and
something i'd like to see in all of rdfcore documents.

....
stopping
....

Arrg... I'm having to difficult of a time reviewing this document as I
keep fighting my biases for this to only focus on the Abstract Data
Model. I'm afraid as such, I'm not the most helpful in providing
constructive feedback. Sorry.
