I want to confirm the required changes that were agreed in the telecon:

 From the 2002-08-02 telecon minutes:
[[
DECIDED:  to go ahead with WD publication, subject to:
- removal of RDF-as-XML/striped syntax references
- addition of note that some material may move to other documents
- repeat abstract material in introduction
- clarify normative intent
]]

Also, there's the matter of linkage between MIME type and assertional 
intent;  in the absence of an agreed position, I'll remove the current text 
per DanBri's comment, and replace it with a note to discuss extent of 
possible linkage between mime type and assertional intent

Have I missed anything important to get right before 1st WD publication?
