in the meeting I argued
[[[
[14:43:02] gk-scribe
JosD: don't buy triple-bloat argument -- prefer's
"interpretation properties" approach, and believs
it is scalable
]]]
-- http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2002-08-02.html#T14-43-02

a bit later from MikeD
[[[
[15:02:02] gk-scribe
MikeD: triple-bloat argument -- has a number of
databases in the 0.5million triple range -- taking
these to 2 million would be a problem.
]]]

I really have a very hard time evaluating that
so called "triple bloat" argument...
Let me take (although this shouldn't be usual)
our implementation.
In the worst case that all RDF objects are literals
and that they are all typed (i.e. no strings)
we go from 6x java objects to 8x java objects
which is an increase of 33%.
In a more typical case, I would guess maybe 3%
or less which is far from that mentioned 300%

also

"The all knowledge is contained in here"
is not true (*)

and

we can translate from the more precise to
the less precise; one way

    this is at least true for this message, RDF
    and Graham's meeting minutes :-)
