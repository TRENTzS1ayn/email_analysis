If the literal is intended to be a number, then I think yes.

But a possible issue then would be that RDF engines without knowledge of 
XML schema datatypes would get different answers from engines that do have 
such knowledge.  I don't know if that's a problem.

Hmmm... I'd need to consult XML schema details for that.

And what about:

<rdf:RDF>
   <rdf:Description>
     <eg:prop xsi:type="xsd:float">2.0</eg:prop>
   </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

In this case I think the answer is no.  (For reasons mentioned in the 
message Dan cited recently -- 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-schema-comments/2000JanMar/0130.html)

The question raised, I think, is does constructing the correct abstract 
graph depend on knowing about the datatypes?  If so, then I think 
extensibility has just been comprehensively denied.  (Which is not too 
surprising, if one considers the way programming languages typically 
distinguish syntactically between literal types -- the range of literal 
types is often prescribed by the language, though complex values may 
sometimes be constructed from them.)
