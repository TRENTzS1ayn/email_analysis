Don't read into a proposed N-Triples syntax change more than I wrote.
I could have put it has datatype(decimal, "2.0") or somesuch.
Specifically don't read that as qnames but evocative of how XSD is
used in XML; similar how the xsi:type is being used in this RDF/XML -
a special attribute.

But I'm still waiting for the triples for these RDF/XML + xsi:type
examples.  Which is hard to do if they have no n-triples syntax.
I'll create a better N-triples if needed when I'm clear what (if
anything) has changed in the graph.  Catch 22.
