I can only speak for myself, but one of the things going on here from my 
perspective is that it's not 100% clear to me what we've agreed on now. 
  You've made the above point about our having reached full concensus in 
several recent messages.  I don't necessarily disagree with this, but 
these lengthy back-and-forths about various pieces of this "concensus" 
are not clarifying things for me.  Is there a *single* description of 
what we've supposedly agreed on that you could point me to (*not* the 
statement in the minutes of the F2F).  I'm talking about something like 
a single description of the whole datatyping idiom you've referred to; 
e.g., if it was one of the options in the message Brian sent to 
rdf-comment, you can point to that);  and I'm not talking about a 
lengthy justification of that idiom either, just a description of what 
it is.
