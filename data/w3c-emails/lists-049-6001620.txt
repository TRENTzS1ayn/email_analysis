Eric,

ref:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-basics/2002-08-05/Overview.htm

I've applied the updates agreed on Friday, and lodged a copy in www-archive:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Aug/0002.html

One point to be clarified (or text excised):  per F2F decision, the front 
page cites Brian as series editor, but he's not had an opportunity to 
approve this going out under his name.
