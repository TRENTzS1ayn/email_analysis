This is not my reading. The first sentence of the paragraph refers to a 
usual case when the type is determined by the type associated with the 
XML element in the schema (i.e., no xsi:type is used). However, when 
xsi:type is there, its value is a QName, nothing said about it referring 
to an XSD type definition or anything else.

Correct me if I'm wrong...
