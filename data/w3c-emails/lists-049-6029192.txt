Your question seems to be addressed to the chair.
Note that Brian is on holiday and EricM is ill.

At W3C, WG consensus is not a matter of opinion; it's a matter
of record. We have reached consensus iff it's recorded
that we did (and the record has been reviewed, etc).

And keep in mind that meeting records are somewhat ephemeral.
The fat lady has not sung until we've published a WD,
gotten community feedback, considered it, and decided we're
happy.

This WG has not gotten any where near there for datatypes.

It's not clear that there were any relevant WG decisions
in Bristol; the record is in dispute:

I don't see how that makes the proposal out of order.
Adopting the proposal might involve reversing earlier decisions.
That's part of life, no?

We haven't even seen the proposal yet. (er.. I haven't, anyway).

Because we didn't have WG consensus; not in the form of a published,
reviewed WD. And it's not even 100% clear that we had a
recorded WG decisions.
