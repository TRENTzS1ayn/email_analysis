I've always understood our charter's ibts and pieces about XSD
integration to be less than neutral; anyway, I'm not part of the
consensus on this.

Given the above, our task would appear to be to come up with a

stumbling blocks, then this needs a(nother) rethink, or a retreat to an
earlier proposal.
