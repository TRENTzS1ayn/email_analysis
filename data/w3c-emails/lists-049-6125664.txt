I didn't see any substantial feedback suggesting this.
A few outspoken respondents does not constitute an
overwhelming concensus of community feedback.

Furthermore, the inquiry to the community had nothing to
do with this, and the proposals reflected in that inquiry
provide *full* support for all XML Schema datatypes.

The WG has *agreed* that any deviations from the stake-in-the-ground
proposal would be motivated by clear technical and practical
considerations -- i.e. fatal flaws or errors in the proposal.

The built in datatypes suggested by Dan's N3 examples are
*not* necessary and do not provide any functionality over
the present proposal. Furthermore, they increase the 
implementational burden on RDF parser and query tools
to provide native support for such datatypes -- when a
great deal of RDF processing can be done without recourse
to resolving the actual lexical to value mappings or
testing lexical validity of property values.

In short, we should not be spending time on this.

Read the archives.

Rather, it is the burden of those who think there should be
built-in native datatypes to demonstrate why the current
proposal as reflected by the latest WD does not work.
