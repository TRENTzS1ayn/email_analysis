It's not OK as it requires that 'float' be understood
as a native datatype of RDF.

I wasn't suggesting a final syntax. That's why
I said "something like"...

Also, I suggested

   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float>"61.25"

so "61.25" is not part of the URI.

Also, we're talking about the RDF graph syntax, not
URI syntax. So, as long as the partitioning between
the datatype URI and the lexical form is clear to
RDF, all is well.

They are only tidy if 'float' is a constant in RDF. Otherwise,
they are just as ambiguous as "61.25" alone.
