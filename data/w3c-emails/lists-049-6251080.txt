7) Datatypes

[[
Here is a summary of the new proposal. It does not yet address test 
cases and several important issues that we discussed offline and that 
were raised on the list. We hit the deadline, so I'm sending off a 
current snapshot to continue the discussion on the list.

8) # | /

(Jos) May I propose following (short) agenda item:
  for the testcase-schema use namespace prefix ending in #

i.e. use
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/testSchema#
instead of
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/testSchema/

the motivation is given by DanC in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Jul/0319.html
i.e.
  [[[
     (a) I get 404 there. No fun.
     (b) it ends with /, rather than #. Best not to conflate
     property/class names with web page names.
  ]]]

and another relevant message is from DaveB
