Thus, 'number(10)' is just an alternative expression of a URI,
since it globally and unambiguously denotes a value resource.

I.e. one can also say that

   Jenny age <val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23integer)10> .
   Bob age <val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23integer)10> .

mean that Jenny and Bob have the same age.

Now, I'm all for TDLs being formally recognized, as I've
long seen them as the very kernel of how RDF datatyping
works, but...

1. You're not going to have 'number(10)' in the graph. You'll
have something like

    (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer)10

and then you'll have to define most of the qualities that URIs
have for tidyness, etc. for these new components of the graph,
and every single parser and every single triples store will have
to change to support the new, mostly redundant in nature, typed
literal node.

I simply don't see the benefit over just using a URL. RDF won't
be able to tell you *anything* more about what number(10) means
than about what val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23integer)10
means. An external application is going to have to do that
anyway -- and external applications parse URIs all the time for
many different reasons.

2. Also, can the new typed literal be a subject? Can you say

    (DDD)10 rdf:type <DDD> .

???

You *can* already say

   <val:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23integer)10>
        rdf:type http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer .

I don't see anything new or beneficial here. Only more work
for the WG and more questions to be answered in the final
stages of what has been a very long process.

Er, kinda like using rdf:type, URIs, bnodes and RDF classes?

There is nothing new here.

The rdf:type attribute would be a more optimal and correct choice, IMO.

Taking vocabulary terms from XML Schema is both unnecessary and 
risky.

I don't know what that means.

Ummm, and where are those number classes defined?
And are all datatypes then number types?

No, a graph node such as

    (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23integer)10

is *NOT* a literal. It is something else. And even if
tidy literals were adopted where such actual literals
(sans any datatype) would be self-denoting, such
typed literal constructs as above would not be self-denoting
but would denote a member of the value space of the 
datatype -- otherwise, what's the point?!

They would not be self-denoting anymore so that a URI
would be self-denoting. Both are globally unambiguous
names for resources.

It's not unclear in the stake-in-the-ground proposal.

And what then is "10" in 

   Jenny age "10" .
