Fine. Whatever. Put it on your wish list for RDF 2.0. We're
out of time, and we have already agreed that the stake-in-the-ground
is "it" unless it is demonstrated and agreed to be lacking.

The only issue remaining is to decide between tidy and untidy
literals. Let's decide and wrap up.

I have yet to see any abstract syntax that is datatype framework
neutral, other than the ones I have suggested myself.
