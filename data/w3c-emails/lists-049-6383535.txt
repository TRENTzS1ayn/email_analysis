These are all provided for by XML Schema primitive datatypes,
and can be supported without making such datatypes native
to RDF.

MOF and RDF can be just as well aligned using the
stake-in-the-ground mechanisms without native RDF
datatypes. I see nothing compelling here that would
require such datatypes to be native to RDF.
