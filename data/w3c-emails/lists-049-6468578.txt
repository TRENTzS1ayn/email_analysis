For today's agenda I plan on discussing
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0080.html

Patrick has raised a very fair question regarding the process associated
with this being introduced [1].

Since I'm still very much under the weather and the telecon is looming,
i'll cut and paste responses from others that reflect my position on
this.

[[
At W3C, WG consensus is not a matter of opinion; it's a matter
of record. We have reached consensus iff it's recorded
that we did (and the record has been reviewed, etc).

And keep in mind that meeting records are somewhat ephemeral.
The fat lady has not sung until we've published a WD,
gotten community feedback, considered it, and decided we're
happy.

This WG has not gotten any where near there for datatypes.

The proposal from Guha, Sergey, Pat and Mike (I believe) is reflective
of additional previously mentioned work by Patrick, Brian, Jang, DanC
and others and I think is worth considering.

Further, I think Graham provided an excellent job summarizing how we got
here and relates this to what we have agreed to -

[[
And I think the "stake in the ground" still remains:  I think nothing
we're 
trying to do now is inconsistent with the stake-in-ground principles,
but 
we are trying to do less so the full reach of that stake may not be
needed.

One issue thats come up however wrt this proposal (that I would like to
offer a temporary stop-gap solution for todays call) is the use of
xsi:type for associating datatypes.

Its clear we don't want to use something in a way in which it wasn't
intended. I've asked the xml-cg about the range of xsi:type.  For
today's discussion I think we should assume that range of xsi:type is
open and permits any datatype. 

When I receive confirmation regarding this assumption, I will report
back to the group.
