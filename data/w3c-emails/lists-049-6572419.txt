That's an interesting idea. Like I said, in my experience I was able to
use multiple schemas and still do "syntactic" long-range typing, but I'm
semi-persuaded that global implicit might be useful. You (Pat) say
you've got examples where it is necessary: could you extract the
corporate secrets and present an example of what's left?

I'd go for this, with the proviso that I haven't thought much about it.
Are there monotonicity problems? We certainly seem now to be able to
produce inconsistent graphs (which I don't have a problem with)...

<s> <p> "LLL" .
<p> rdfs:range <xsi:integer>
<p> rdfs:range <xsi:date>

(plus datatype declarations, although I'm not totally convinced
they're necessary)

Now, that would appear to be inconsistent. However I was under the
impression that one of the things you wanted from long-range typing was
type intersection, which doesn't appear possible. Are you prepared to do
without it, or is there something I've missed?

Good weekend also folks.
