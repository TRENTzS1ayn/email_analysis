I believe there is a strong technical reason why URIs don't work 
here.  According to the model theory 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#sinterp), URIs can denote anything according 
to the interpretation that is used.  There is no provision for treating 
different classes of URIrefs differently in this respect.

Conversely (and as Jan pointed out long time ago - 
http://ioctl.org/rdf/literals) a literal is a fixed value, not subject to 
reinterpretation according to the "possible world" being described.

(It might be possible to redraw the model theory to use URIs in the way you 
suggest, but I think that would be a far greater disruption than what is 
being proposed.)
