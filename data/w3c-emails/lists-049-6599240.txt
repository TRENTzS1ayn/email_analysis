The "char c" case actually does work (at least with JDK 1.3
on my Mac).

My point is that I as a developer often don't have to be
concerned about the exact numeric type chosen by the
developer of a class (schema/ontology) that I'm using, and
don't have to litter my code (literals) with those types.
