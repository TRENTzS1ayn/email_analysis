Value typing and (implicit or explicit) (compile- or run-time) coercion
vary across programming languages; Eiffel, for instance, doesn't suffer
(if that's the word) as badly as, say, Java, which has made some attempt
to inherit primitive numeric type coercion from C.

Where this coercion occurs - ie, at the parsing/semantic checking stage
or late at evaluation - depends on the language of choice.*

I'm sure everyone can find a programming language (whether traditional
or scripting) that backs up their viewpoint. Maybe we should pick one
and just do what that does. My vote would be for scheme - or possibly
intercal.
