Subject: XMLP WG Issue 314 Resolution
Date: Tue, 13 Aug 2002 04:48:12 -0700

Dan,

You made several comments on the SOAP 1.2 Last Call WD[1,2] which were
recording as Issue 314[3] in the XMLP WG Last Call Issues List[4].
During a recent face-to-face meeting the Working Group closed the issue
with the following comments:

1. 
The XMLP WG will not define a mechanism for assigning URIs to
graph edges. For the purposes of SOAP Data Model and Encoding, QNames
are sufficient.

2. 
The XMLP WG will not specify an algorithm for generating URIs
from QNames. We note that the RDFCore WG have previously considered a
similar issue[5]. We also note that the TAG are considering this
issue[6]

3. 
The XMLP WG will remove the ID property from nodes. It's
presence was an oversight on behalf of this editor. IDs are only needed
at serialization time and hence only need to appear in the encoding not
in the data model. We also note that the navigation model for the SOAP
Data Model is one of traversal rather than one based on node identity.

This end the resolution of Issue 314[3]. I hope this clarifies the
issues you raised. If you are unsatisfied with the resolution please let
the XML Protocol WG know as soon as possible.

Regarding other questions you raise in Issue 314[3]

You asked:

Q1: What is the relationship between node types and edge label types in
SOAP encoding?

A1: Not defined.

Q2: Can they be mixed freely?

A2: Yes

Q3: Can I use node types defined (somehow...) by one application, with
instances of that node using edge
labels drawn in multiple other schemas?

A3: Yes

Q4: Are there any rules constraining the sensible combinations of node
and edge types.

A4: No

Q5: Specifically, does the type of a node determine the edges that be
attached to it?

A5: No

Q6: Does each kind of edge label have node types that they can point to
and from?

A6: No

Note that the answers to the above are based on my own understanding of
your questions and how the SOAP data model works. I should note that I'm
not ENTIRELY sure I understand what you mean by 'node type'. You could
mean:

a) The type property of the node

b) Whether the node is a generic, struct or array

c) Something else I've not though of

However, if it's a or b then the answers stand. If it's c then get back
to me ( on xml-dist-app@w3.org please )

Regards

Martin Gudgin
