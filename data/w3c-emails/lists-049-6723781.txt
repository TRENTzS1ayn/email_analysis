Dan,

You made several comments on the SOAP 1.2 Last Call WD[1,2] which were
recorded as Issue 316[3] in the XMLP WG Last Call Issues List[4]. During
a recent face-to-face meeting the Working Group closed the issue with
the following resolution:

We broke the issue into several questions:

Q1: How do applications describe what they send/receive?

A1: We consider it to be out of scope for our spec to define how
applications that use the SOAP encoding to encode data describe their
data structures.


Q2: When should I use the SOAP encoding?

A2: We do not consider it to be the job of our specification to tell
people when to use the SOAP Encoding ( i.e. it's out of scope )


Q3: May a graph contain more than one edge with the same originating and
terminating node?

A3: Yes

Q4: And can such a thing be serialised?

Q4: Yes

Q5: In the current Encoding rules?

A5: Yes. E.g.

<narcissus id='me'>
         <name>Martin</name>
         <bestfriend ref='me' />
         <otherfriend ref='me' />
</narcissus>

Q6: In other hypothetical encodings?

A6: Yes ;-)


I hope this clarifies the issues you raised. If you are unsatisfied with
the resolution please let the XML Protocol WG know as soon as possible.

Regards

Martin Gudgin
For the XML Protocol Working Group
