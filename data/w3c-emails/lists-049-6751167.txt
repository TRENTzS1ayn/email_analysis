My regrets as well, for the same dates. I'm traveling to two conferences...

I hope (like everyone else who's off ;) that by the time I'm back we 
have a story on datatyping. We seem to be reaching an agreement on the 
URI-encoding issue 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0123.html).
On the other hand, there was only moderate feedback on untidy literals 
(thread
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0125.html), 
so maybe it is not something we definitely want to have just now.

Best,
Sergey
