I've been trying to catch up on where we have got to with datatypes whilst 
I've been away.  Here is my short summary so folks can straighten out kinks 
in my understanding.

1)  There has been a proposal to have tokens representing datatyped values 
as nodes in the abstract syntax, replacing (?) the bnode with property 
mechanism for representing typed values.  This proposal relies on 
extensions to the concrete syntax, e.g.

   <age xsi:type="xsd:decimal">10</age>

This proposal has been attracting support, particularly from 
implementors.  There remain a number of issues to work out the details.

2)  This proposal is orthognonal to the issue of whether "old style" 
literals are tidy or not.  No one has as yet written up a summary of the 
feedback we got from the community.  I will try to do a draft tomorrow.
