I chatted with Mark Butler yesterday, including some discussion of 
datatypes in cc/pp.

One of the ideas that Mark favours is to define an XML Schema for the cc/pp 
language.  This would enable:

   o validation of incoming cc/pp profiles to a server
   o the use of default attributes to insert datatype attributes such as 
xsi:type="xsd:decimal" automatically, thus providing global implicit 
datatyping in the parser.

Whilst not perfect, does this technique go some way towards meeting the 
need for global implicit datatyping.
