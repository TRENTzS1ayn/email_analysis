This is the usual weekly call for agenda items which I need by noon uk time 
Thursday, please.

On my list of possibles I currently have:

  o approving concepts and abstract model for publication
  o reviewing against schedule
  o datatypes

I  may well not be properly back up to speed, so please let me know if I 
missed anything obvious.

Brian
