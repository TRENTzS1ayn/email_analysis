Ouch! that would conflict with a requirement I hold
near and dear, that literals be syntacitcally evident.
i.e. that you can take an RDF/XML document and
tell whether it's true or false in an interpreation
without appeal to a schema or whatever.

It's all well and good to use XML Schemas to check RDF/XML
documents, but to use them to supply default attributes
isn't workable.
