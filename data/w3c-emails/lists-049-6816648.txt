Your 7Aug message was in reply to a proposal in
which they *are* literals; you suggested
that this proposal was the same as your val:
proposal, and I was pointing out a difference.

Yes, in your val: proposal they're URI denoted resources.
But not in the syntax-level typing proposal.

I accept that as your opinion.
I disagree.

In my opinion, RDF literals have always had the
property that if they look the same, they denote
the same thing, and if they look different
(modulo a few things like &#65; vs A),
they denote different things.

In my opinion, RDF has always had string literals and
XML infoitem literals.

In my opinion, what is bein proposes is that
RDF have integer literals, along with string
literals and XML infoitem literals.

It might help if you would make an effort to distinguish
matters of fact and matters of record from matters
of opinion.
