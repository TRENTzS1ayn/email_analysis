Datatypes:

Scribe's note: this was a long discussion and took up the remainder of
the telecon. I'll attempt to provide the (unbiased, I hope) gist here.
Note the discussion carried on immediately following the telecon by
email. The details are in the transcript.


Nobody present had much of an objection to the "typed literal" proposal,
as it stood.

Patrick Stickler was keen to point out that this was "local typing"
only, that it did not address the issue of literal tidyness (although
Dan C has since argued that it does, indeed, offer such a viewpoint).

It also meant that long-range typing, that is the "global implicit"
idiom was not supported, and that long-range typing was either
impossible or had to be syntactic in nature.

The remainder of the discussion centred around -

1. member opinions about the necessity of the global implicit idiom
(unanswered: what does DC want to do? What about CC/PP?) and whether or
not it was possible to support "syntactic" long-range typing, and/or
reasonable to require all literals in a serialisation to appear with
their corresponding types.

2. whether to "seed" the RDF proposals with particular specific
datatypes, and what those might be.


Dave Beckett expressed concern about 11th-hour changes to the syntax
specs.

There appeared to be more agreement regarding this proposal amongst WG
members than might at first be expected.
