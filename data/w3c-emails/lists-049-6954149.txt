I think this reveals some of the problems you get into when you define a 
data model (as RDF is) without explicitly defining any operations, in 
this case, some kind of equality test on literals.  Of course, you 
(Patrick) are correct in saying "literals in RDF were simply a way to 
capture raw data that would be interpreted and utilized by higher level 
applications", but I also think Dan's right.  Certainly the natural 
assumption in my opinion is that, in RDF as it is (without datatypes), 
literals are of type string, and there is a "built-in" equality test by 
string comparison.  Of course, RDF applications know this, and hence 
they know how to deal with the results of a string comparison in 
determining whether <ex:age>10</ex:age> is equal to 
<ex:weight>10</ex:weight> (or whether to use that comparison at all), 
but that involves application semantics over and above what is currently 
built into RDF (just as RDF would determine that ex:age and ex:weight 
weren't the same property, and an application might know that they 
were).  What we are contemplating in the datatypes proposal is whether 
(and how) to change this situation.
