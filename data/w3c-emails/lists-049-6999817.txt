RSS and Dublin Core folk are trying to use rdf:Alt and it's painful to
watch :(

Which spec owns the problem of helping these folk? MT? Primer? Schema?

Considering the following example from
http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/04/14/dcq-rdf-xml/:

<rdf:Description rdf:ID="17">
   <dc:identifier>
    <rdf:Alt>
     <rdf:li rdf:resource="http://dublincore.org/"/>
     <rdf:li rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/"/>
    </rdf:Alt>
   </dc:identifier>
</rdf:Description>

Does this mean that one can say that the identifier of online:#17 is
http://dublincore.org/, or that its identifier is a collection of
alternative values of which http://dublincore.org/ is the first prefernce?

In other words, given the general definition of
http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier as:

<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-US">An unambiguous reference to the resource
within a given context.</rdfs:comment>

Can we reasonably infer from the above snippet that http://dublincore.org/
serves this purpose with relation to online:#17 ?
