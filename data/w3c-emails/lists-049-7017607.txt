Well, certainly the Primer is a candidate.  You might look at what the
Primer version at
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020725.html says about
Alt and see what you think.

I don't know about this last bit;  it depends on what Dublin Core means
by "unambiguous reference".  Some people would interpret the existence
of alternatives in this position as being inconsistent with an
"unambiguous reference" (even if one is understood as preferred).
