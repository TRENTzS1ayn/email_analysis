Hello Aaron, dear RDF Core WG,

On ietf-types@iana.org and some related list, we were just looking
at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/#sec-MediaType which containes
some instances of text like this:

    Same as ... of application/xml as specified in RFC 3023[XML-MT]
    or the most recent specification that supercedes it.

There seemed to be general agreement that a moving target is
not a good idea.

Josef Reagle told us that he got that text from:
http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/rdf-mediatype.html

I wanted to tell you that you may want to fix this.

Regards,   Martin.
