This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon, 
which I need by noon uk time Thursday.

Currently on my list of possibles:

1. Using XMLSchema-instance attributes in RDF/XML Syntax (fwd)
2. rdf:Alt's relationship to individual statements
3. datatypes (use cases in cc/pp, dc and p3p) and community feedback
4. formally closing rdfms-assertion
