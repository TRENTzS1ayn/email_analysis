Brian asked me about Dublin Core and datatypes and to make a use case
that shows the kind of thing that might be used.

I took a look at Dublin Core's

  Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML
  http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/07/23/dc-xml-guidelines/

which in section 5.3 has an XML record with XSI types.  The result is
quite close to RDF/XML with datatypes, so I've created what I think
the equivalent would be.

I've used a new rdf:dtype attribute with URIs as values instead of
xsi:type and qnames - this is just my expectation that we use URIs,
not qnames in RDF to identify stuff.  This syntax detail is NOT the
point of the example.

In my opinion, the value of the dc:title element (RDF property) below
has no extra information and the DC community would not expect that
the value would be unique such that another dc:title with the same
value would mean it was the same.

However, for <dc:subject rdf:dtype="&dcterms;DDC">062</dc:subject>
the use of the dcterms DDC - Dewey Decimal Code - is known by the
definition in the DC terms definition to be unique, so that these
values would mean the same concept in DDC.
