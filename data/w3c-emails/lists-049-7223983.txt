I've added these to the agenda as requested.  A couple of comments below:

Converting this to a test case, (which may or may not capture Frank's 
intended question), I suggest that an RDF processor is not required to 
conclude

   _:b rdf:type rdfs:Class .

from:

   _:a rdf:type _:b .

That is a job for rdfs reasoning on rdfs:range.

I'm not sure how to reduce this to a test case.  If the intent is to ask 
whether any processor capable of implementing the above entailment, must 
implement all of the RDFS closure rules, why might we be tempted to say that?
