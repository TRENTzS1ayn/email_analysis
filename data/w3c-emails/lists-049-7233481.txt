9: Status of new Concepts and Abstract Data Model WD
2002-08-16#3  EricM  publish rdf concepts and abstract data model WD


See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0067.html


10: Relationship between XML Schema and RDF
Specifically, suggestion to ignore attributes from the xml:schema
namespace to allow processing by both xml schema processors and rdf
processors.
             

See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0165.html


11: rdf:Alt's relationship to individual statements
They should be using repeated properties, not Alt, right?
Each spec in its own way should help answer this problem.


See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0157.html


12: rdfms:assertion
I could find no record of us formally closing this issue.  Therefore:

Propose the text in section 2.3.2 of the Concepts and Abstract Data Model document resolves this issue and it be closed.


See:
  http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-basics/2002-08-05/Overview.htm#section-Social


13: Meaning of rdf:type and relationship between RDF and RDFS
(a) must any RDF processor understand the object of an rdf:type property as being an rdfs:Class (and hence understand what an rdfs:Class is)?

(b) must an RDF processor that understands what an rdfs:Class is also
understand the rest of the RDFS vocabulary?
  

See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0173.html


14: Datatypes
Summary of after hours discussion last week
Progress on datatypes WD
Uses cases - DC, CC/PP, others?
