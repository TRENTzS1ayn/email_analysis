Rats. Well, perhaps something other than a comma...

I thought so too.

No, because well-formed XML is specifically not typed. It is simply well formed.
It's like a arbitrary untyped Unicode string versus a lexical form for xsd:integer.

Also, one want's to know both the type and that it is XML (i.e. that it is a 
complex datatype rather than a simple datatype) ideally without having to
go looking out in the graph for information about the datatype in question.

Well, we have two alternatives that I see:

1. Find some punctuation other than a comma, and not an XML Name
character, which can be used to delimit qnames and the XML flag.

-or-

2. Find some other means to denote XML literals than 'xml' which
would maintain the explicit delimitation between the prefixed 
datatype qname and the literal.

I'm happy with either. I just want to see consistency between
non-XML and XML typed literals.

True, but we use qnames in most of the NTriples examples in the specs,
so we still need to be able to use qnames with typed literal nodes.
