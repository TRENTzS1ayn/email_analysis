Well, no actually.

If literals are untidy and only in the object position, then you
don't need to give them ids in N-Triples.  If at some point literals
were allowed in the subject position, then you will have to give them
ids.  We haven't made that decision yet, and N-Triples only needs to
change when that happens, not before.

And delete the qnames.

I thought the group already agreed that a document convention of
using 'xsd:decimal', 'rdf:type' and so on for the appropriate URI is
OK.  It happens the primer and MT use that in N-Triples, the syntax
WD doesn't.
