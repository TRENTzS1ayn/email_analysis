Hmmm...

I seem to recall alot of test cases that appeared to rely on
distinct naming of (untidy) literals, but perhaps that is 
simply because they were assuming tidy literals and had
to resort to distinct names to force the untidy semantics.

If that's the case, then great. Not having the local names
is much cleaner for sure.

Though, in tools such as the RDF Validator, I'd want to see
untyped literals denoted by unique nodes, to emphasize that
they are not one and the same thing.

Right. Well, again, I'm taking a slightly broader scope
than just N-Triples, so the qnames have a role there.

The DT WD does ;-)
