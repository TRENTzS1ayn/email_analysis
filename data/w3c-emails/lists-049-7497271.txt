I don't really follow what you are saying.

Are you talking about the XML bit and language code? Or something else?

The the unicode string portion of a literal, as literals are presently
defined, without the XML bit and language code, is a member of the
lexical space of a datatype, and within the context of that datatype
serves as a local name for the value in question. There is a strong
correlation between namespace+name in XML and datatype+lexicalForm in
RDF datatyping. Both have local names which must be interpreted within
a given "namespace".

Yes, it would be cleaner, I agree, to just have the string and not
the other 'cruft' that is residue from the RDF/XML, but I don't think
it's all that horrible to have it there either, so long as it is clear
that it has no relevance to the semantics of RDF datatyping.
