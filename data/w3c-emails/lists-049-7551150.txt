There is a new Primer version at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020823.html

Unfortunately, it's still not complete.  However, it would be worthwhile 
for people to review:

*  the new material in section 2 oon URIs, their relationship to URLs, 
and the fragment business

*  the new discussion at the end of section 2.4 on using blank nodes

*  the rewritten RDF/XML section

*  the rewritten RDFS section

*  the new section 4 (particularly the new reification material, and 
section 4.3)

*  the new examples of RDF applications (section 6.4 has been rewritten, 
and an example added;  sections 6.6 and 6.7 have been added).

Rael Dornfest has agreed to write a section (currently 6.5) on RSS.

In the meantime, I'll soldier on.
