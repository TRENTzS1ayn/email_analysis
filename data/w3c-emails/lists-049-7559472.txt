Anything that deals with RDF?

After 2 years on a WG, I'm no longer sure :-)

I agree in principle that informal language and anthropomorphisation of
the global pulsating hyperbrain or any part thereof should be avoided in
specs.

"understand" here is a shorthand notion to express, "process (by which I
mean 'draw entailments from according to', etc.) the rdfs:Class
according to the spec which describes it, along with any and all other
processing requirements given in that document". I think in informal
debate, it's a perfectly usable term.
