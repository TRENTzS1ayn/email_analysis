I don't know. I use 'grep' to search my RDF stash.

I've avoided 'processor' in RDFS, where we note that...
[[
For example, while an RDF schema can assert that an author property is
used to indicate resources that are members of the class Person, it does
not say whether or how an application should act in processing that class
information. Different applications will use this information in different
ways. For example, a data checking tools might use this to help discover
errors in some dataset, an interactive editor might suggest appropriate
values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer additional
information from instance data.

[[
The goal of this activity, and of RDF specifically, is to produce a
language for the exchange of machine-understandable information using the
Web.
]] RDFS Status section

also

[[
Facilities to put machine-understandable data on the Web are becoming a
high priority for many communities.
]]


I'd be happy if we managed to avoid the word, but it's scattered around
quite widely. There may also be aspects of the meaning of classes and
properties not captured in our current formalisation; hence the desire to
appeal to 'innate' knowledge within some processor.
