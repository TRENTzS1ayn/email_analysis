I don't think we can say either of these. It certainly isn't the 
first; but if we say the second, then the identifier is a collection, 
so its definitely not either of http://dublincore.org/ or 
http://purl.org/dc/  (neither of which are collections.)

I think the best way to say it is that its means that the identifier 
is EITHER http://dublincore.org/ OR http://purl.org/dc/, but we don't 
know which it is.
