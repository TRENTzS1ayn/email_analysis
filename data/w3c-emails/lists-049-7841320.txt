Per Brian's request, a static copy of the latest datatyping
proposal has been posted to www-archive and can be found here

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Aug/0100.html

Unless otherwise stated, comments on this proposal will be
considered to refer to the above static revision.

The working version can be found (for the moment) here

I've incorporated the changes/comments/suggestions provided
during Friday's telecon as well as via email to date, including
making explicit that it is not a WD but a current proposal that
does not yet reflect the concensus of the WG.
