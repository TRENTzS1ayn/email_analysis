Please refer to static revision of 26 August located at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Aug/0100.html
for purposes of review.

Done. Included in static revision.

I will add this. It is not in the static revision posted for review.
I'm away from the office for a couple of days, so it may be nearer the
end of the week before it gets added.

> (3) DC examples in appendix should be RDF/XML not N-triples

Done. Included in static revision.

> (4) don't use abbreviations in first examples (e.g. &xsd;):

XML entities are still used in the RDF/XML but fully expanded
URIrefs are used in the N-Triples for each example, so hopefully
this is now clearer.

Please refer to 26 August revision for review. Thanks.

Done.

Also, I'm presuming there is an action on the other two editors to
also review the latest revision ;-)
