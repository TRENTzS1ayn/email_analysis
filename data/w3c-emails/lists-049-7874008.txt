Huh?  Neither of the URIs is a collection, the Alt is a collection, right?

It seems to me we need to be clear here about whether we're going to use 
the special "Alt" semantics associated with the Alt collection or not. 
If we take the model theory intepretation, what Pat suggests here seems 
to be the correct interpretation, but that's not the "intent" (at least 
as suggested by M&S).  The Primer characterizes Alt has a kind of "hint" 
as to how the contents of the collection are supposed to be interpreted, 
but notes that RDF doesn't (because it can't) actually enforce this 
interpretation.  But if we're going to ignore this type of thing 
entirely in telling people what things like Alt mean (or, at least, how 
they might use it), it seems to me we'd be better off eliminating it 
entirely.
