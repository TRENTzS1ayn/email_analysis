I know the feeling ;-)

Well, as Brian points out, the last straw poll actually showed
a mild majority in favor of untidy literals.

I don't think that is presently the majority view of the WG. I
thought the "round-the-bar" discussions last week were very
encouraging that we may in fact be able to reach concensus
about global datatyping. But then, I've been known to hallucinate ;-)

I don't see how it would not be ready for standardization, since
it is little more than current rdf:type and rdfs:range semantics
and it is precisely what most folks seem to have been expecting.

It also is a technically sound solution. The proponents of tidy
literals are of course free to disprove that assertion, if they
can.

If using rdfs:range to assert the rdf:type of untidy literals
is unsound, then general rdfs:range and rdf:type semantics are also
unsound and should be removed from RDF.

Recent comments from Pat indicate that OWL cannot live (at
least healthily) with a tidy MT. Also recent communications with 
the CC/PP community reflect a clear desire for untidy global 
datatyping.

The present situation, as I see it, is that

1. OWL wants untidy literal semantics (Pat, please correct if not so)
2. CC/PP wants untidy global datatyping (e.g. rdfs:range with datatypes
   asserting that datatype for inline literals)
3. The original expectation of the first RDF Core WG was that there
   would be something like rdfs:range based global datatyping, as
   DanB recently pointed out
4. The community clearly favors untidy literals
5. The last WG straw poll favored untidy literals
6. Tidyness must be decided irregardless of datatyping
7. Choosing a tidy MT precludes any future untidy semantics as the RDF
   layer

I consider all of the above, combined, to be more than sufficiently
compelling to adopt untidy literals and global datatyping as
defined in the latest working draft

http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/rdf-datatyping.html

No, that doesn't mean that every member of the WG is in favor
of untidy literals, but I think that the above 7 points clearly
reflect a very strong preference and need overall for untidy literals
(and global datatyping).

The WG should review the latest working draft, and base discussion
and decisions using that as a basis, IMMHO.

Regards,

Patrick
