Aaron,

Looking good, some comments...

Typo: 'denals' above.

With reference to DanBri's comment about assertion:  I think the intent is 
already conveyed by section 2, so the 2nd para of section 4 can be dropped 
without loss of meaning.

Hmmm... I'm uncomfortable with that... what is this "thing identified by 
the URI alone"?

How about:
[[
However, when a URI with fragment identifier is used within an RDF document,
the URI part is presumed to refer to an RDF document, and the whole URI
reference indicates a concrete or abstract resource described there
(using rdf:ID or rdf:about in an RDF resource description).
[Reference section 4.2 of "Resource Description Framework (RDF):
Concepts and Abstract Data Model for further explanation.]
]]

I think this paragraph would usefully go at the top of this section.
