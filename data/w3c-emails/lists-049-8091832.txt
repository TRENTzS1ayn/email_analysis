In reviewing the datatypes draft, I find I'm a little confused about what 
we're trying to specify.

I had the idea, reinforced by [1,2] that the current plan was to develop 
Guha's [3] and Jeremy's [4] suggestions to thrash out a minimal form of 
typed literals sufficient to deal with numbers and other simple values, and 
leave the more difficult issues of remote typing to a later specification.

Have I misunderstood?
