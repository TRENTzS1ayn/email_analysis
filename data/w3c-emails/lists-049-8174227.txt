I agree. I would be able to vote for part 1 (subject to future corrections
etc.)

I would tend to say "better" if the alternative is a document that has
substantially less consensus behind it.

I agree with your point that we will need to decide tidy versus untidy, but
remain of the opinion that this will be less controversial without any
global datatyping.
