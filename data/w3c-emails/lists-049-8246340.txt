Focus on part 1 of Patrick's new consensus building document 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0257.html

which is intended to capture those aspects of datatyping we agree on,
noting DaveB's issue with the syntax:

10: rdf:Alt's relationship to individual statements
2002-08-23#1  DanC  review primer text and propose alternative that clarifies
               status of Alt
2002-08-23#2  DaveB  initiate dialog with DC community about the issue of
                rdf:Alt usage.


See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0157.html


11: Relationship between XML Schema and RDF
Specifically, suggestion to ignore attributes from the xml:schema
namespace to allow processing by both xml schema processors and rdf
processors.
             

See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0165.html


12: Meaning of rdf:type and relationship between RDF and RDFS

Has this been resolved by discussion of removing term "rdf processor"?

(a) must any RDF processor understand the object of an rdf:type property as being an rdfs:Class (and hence understand what an rdfs:Class is)?

(b) must an RDF processor that understands what an rdfs:Class is also
understand the rest of the RDFS vocabulary?

                 model document to rectify concerns with conflicting use of
