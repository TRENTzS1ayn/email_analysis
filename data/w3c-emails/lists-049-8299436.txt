No, it's not extensible that way.

No, don't go there either. xsi:type makes sense (to me)
as part of the syntax of a literal; it doesn't
make sense (to me) as a subPropertyOf rdf:type;
we don't want parsers to have to theorem-proving
to distinguish one literal for another.
That's sorta the point of literals: you can see,
just by looking, whether they denote the same
thing or not.
