Yes, I think it is confusing. Reading that draft I immediately 
thought, so what can be a subject? Can my auntie Nance be a subject, 
or a sodium atom? Or is it supposed to be something syntactic??

I wish they weren't so elusive-seeming. They are a very simple idea, 
and they ought to seem very simple.

It might be too implicit, seems to me. We know what these things are: 
they are essentially bound variables, but we don't bother to give 
them a name. If someone wants to be sure that enough bnodes exist, we 
can say that they can use bnode identifiers as bnodes.

I don't think it is circular to say that bnodes are some set of 
things that are not urirefs or literals and are called blank nodes, 
and that they can be in triples. We don't *define* them, because we 
don't need to. But we can say that there are denumerably many of them 
and that they are therefore in 1:1 correspondence to bnode IDs. So if 
anyone wants to use bnodeIDs for bnodes, they are free to do so.
