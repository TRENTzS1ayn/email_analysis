I would like to add stress to this point from Pat. RDF datatyping
provides a framework for talking about a certain class of things,
rdfs:Datatype, which have particular characteristics, and which
may have relationships with regards to subset relations of their
value spaces which can be captured by rdfs:subClassOf. 

XML Schema defines numerous datatypes which may be talked about
using this RDF datatyping framework insofar as they exhibit those
characteristics embodied by all members of rdfs:Datatype. 

If, however, some of the relationships between those datatypes are
unclear, insofar as the datatyping semantics of rdfs:subClassOf is 
concerned, then while it is to be expected that we would work
with the XML Schema folks to help clarify those issues, it is not
our responsibility to do so in the RDF specs or as part of the
process in completing the RDF specs. 

Clarifying whether xsd:float and xsd:decimal are related or whether
"10"^^xsd:byte == "10"^^xsd:double is *outside* the scope of our
charter and should not in any way impact the work at hand of getting
the RDF specs done. 

Yes, it's important, but it's not the job of the RDF Core WG.

Patrick
