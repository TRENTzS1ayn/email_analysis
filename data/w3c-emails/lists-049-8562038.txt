The next version of concepts (i.e. for review by WG prior to last call) is
basically ready.

An editorial issue is:
  Section 2 is fatter than the rest, the editors would prefer to flatten it,
expanding it to sections 2, 3 and 4. This will cause nearly all the section
numbers in concepts to change.

This is cosmetic.

We can either do it now or do it after last call.

This will cause some work for the other editors (in that all links to
concepts will need checking). Us making the change now would allow any
errors to be caught in last call review; making it later might be less
pressured.

Any thoughts?

Jeremy
