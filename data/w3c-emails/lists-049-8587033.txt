Right now, we say explicitly that it has no particular meaning.

Nothing in the MT provides any connection in meaning between the 
third and fourth triple of the first graph.

I was under the impression that we had formally decided NOT to 
support this kind of usage. Wasn't that part of the local-datatyping 
no-fancy-idioms decision?

I agree.  Either we should not mention this stuff, or else we should 
back it up with some semantics. It wouldn't be hard to do and it 
would also enable us to do some neat datatyping  entailments that 
people seem to think are obvious, such as (with appropriate 
wellformedness caveats)

aaa ppp "sss"^^ddd .

-->

aaa ppp _:x .
_:x rdf:value "sss" .
_:x rdf:type ddd .
