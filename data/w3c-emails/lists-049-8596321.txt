I assume you mean beside the fact that they both have the same subject? 
Anyway, this isn't specific to rdf:value is it?  I mean, you couldn't
make the inference if you'd used a datatype "weightInKilograms" either. 
You'd need much more machinery than RDF has.

Well, that doesn't seem to be the principle on which we've been
operating!  If we're going to deal with this, let's do rdfs:isDefinedBy
too!

Yes, keeping in mind that rdf:value can be used with more complicated
relationships too (i.e., _:x could have multiple properties qualifying
the value, not just a single one).
