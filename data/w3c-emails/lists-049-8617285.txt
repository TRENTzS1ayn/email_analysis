OK, great. Let me suggest the following. I will rewrite the Datatype 
section of the MT to refer to Dtype interpretations as relative to 
kinds of 'information' about a set of datatypes. That is normative; 
but in an informative appendix, I give (the ntriplification of) this 
as an illustration of the kind of thing that is being talked about. 
Would that be a good idea?
