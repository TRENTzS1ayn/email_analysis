Well, yes. I mean, there isn't any formal support for that (or any 
other) entailment involving rdf:value

>Anyway, this isn't specific to rdf:value is it?

Well, it seems to me that rdf:value is being used in a way that kind 
of expects a semantics that it currently does not have. SO maybe we 
should give it one.

The point wasnt to do with the particular datatype, but the use of 
rdf:value. Right now rdf:value might as well not be there as far as 
the MT is concerned, it has no meaning at all. You could get the same 
effect by writing ex:foo instead.

I would if I thought it had any meaning. The trouble with that one is 
that 'is defined by' really, really is meaningless when applied to 
pieces of RDF. RDF *never* defines anything, it can't possibly define 
anything since it doesn't have negation. So forget about 
rdfs:isDefinedBy, OK?

Right, that's the limitation, but we can get that from the MT as well.

So more generally, to the WG: should I give rdf:value a model theory? 
Speak soon, guys. Unless I hear otherwise I will do this:

aaa rdf:value "bbb" .

means that there is some conventional mapping M from lexical forms 
under which I(aaa) = M(bbb). Doesn't say much, but it might be 
useful, particularly if we say that any datatype L2V mapping counts 
as a 'conventional mapping'.
