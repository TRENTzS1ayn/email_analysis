Well, yes, it would, but isn't that appropriate? I guess it might 
make sense to say

aaa rdf:value "10"^^xsd:string .

but one might as well omit the type in this case; and it would never 
make sense to say

  aaa rdf:value "10"^^xsd:integer .

since integers aren't lexical forms.
(If this does make sense, what is it supposed to mean?)
