Pat--

Back up a minute.  The "historic" use of rdf:value was for the cases
like

my:cat rdf:type ex:DomesticCat .
my:cat ex:weight _:x .
_:x rdf:value "15" .
_:x ex:unit ex:Kilogram

Now that we have datatypes, the extension of this usage to 

my:cat rdf:type ex:DomesticCat .
my:cat ex:weight _:x .
_:x rdf:value "15"^^xsd:integer .
_:x ex:unit ex:Kilogram

seems perfectly straightforward.  You're being more precise about what
the value is (it's a number, rather than a string), and you need other
properties anyway to specify the units (and anything else).  I'm not
such a fan of rdf:value, but it seems to me that restricting rdf:value
to preclude this usage might seem somewhat artificial to those already
using it.
