No, but it doesn't have to explicitly import them in order for their 
meaning to be constrained by what is said about them by their owner. 
Thats part of the point of the example: the shreds of meaning 
attached to a name at its source still apply even if you only *use* 
the name. Thats what I meant by caveat lector: its up to the reader 
of what I publish to check that the meaning I attach to my terms is 
what he wants to inherit by his use of those terms.

Formal entailment, yes, but that the point of talking about these 
issues in a social setting.

Right, exactly.

Well, at the least one cannot reasonably claim to be using the terms 
in a way that does not inherit that source meaning. Thats not quite 
the same thing as asserting it yourself, but its close enough.

I would strongly recommend that we don't go there. Owl:imports is a 
minefield of unresolved issues and half-digested confusions. Webont 
would do well to abandon owl:imports and just use rdfs:seeAlso.

I agree. And we should be careful about using the D-word.

Good point to make. If you use terms from sources that you don't 
trust, they may have consequences that you don't intend. Caveat 
lector.
