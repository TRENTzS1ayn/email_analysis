Or may be built-in to the engine?  (Technically, I think that's covered by 
your description, but I think a casual reading might overlook this.)

Or may render the assertion meaningless?

Isn't 3d technically implied by 3a-3c?   Do you mean that 3d could be 
provided without 3b/3c?

The rest looks sensible to me.
