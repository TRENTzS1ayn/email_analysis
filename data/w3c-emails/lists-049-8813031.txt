Wouldn't that be caveat scriptor?

Jeremy:

maybe there are a few words that should added to the Concepts draft?  e.g.

[[
In publishing a statement with potentially significant legal or social 
consequences, one should take care to use vocabulary whose meaning is 
well-defined, stable and known to correspond to the intended meaning.  For 
important documents, such as contracts, this may mean that use of 
third-party vocabulary is restricted to terms defined by legislature, 
recognized standards bodies or other reputable organizations.  Using terms 
from untrustworthy sources may have unintended consequences.
]]

In view of this discussion, maybe this can help to clarify some of the 
relationship between third party vocabularies and meanings?  I think it 
does address at least one of the comments we've received.
