I think it would be useful to provide, in that it at least captures
the (apparently) non-controversial relations between the XML Schema
datatypes.

I'd also love to see an extended version including Jeremy's noted 
additional relations, e.g. xsd:unsignedInt rdfs:subClassOf xsd:long,
though with perhaps a caveat that some may interpret the XML Schema
specification in a way that would preclude those additional relations,
etc. 

As an exercise, a stab at the extended version is attached ;-)

In short, the following are added to the earlier schema:

   xsd:base64Binary rdfs:subClassOf xsd:hexBinary .
   xsd:hexBinary rdfs:subClassOf xsd:base64Binary .

   xsd:Name rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NMTOKEN .

   xsd:IDREFS rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NMTOKENS .
   xsd:IDREFS rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ENTITIES.
   xsd:ENTITIES rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NMTOKENS .
   xsd:ENTITIES rdfs:subClassOf xsd:IDREFS .

   xsd:anyURI rdfs:subClassOf xsd:token . 

   xsd:NCName rdfs:subClassOf xsd:anyURI .

   xsd:NCName rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ENTITY .
   xsd:NCName rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ID .
   xsd:NCName rdfs:subClassOf xsd:IDREF .

   xsd:ID rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ENTITY .
   xsd:ID rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NCName .
   xsd:ID rdfs:subClassOf xsd:IDREF .

   xsd:IDREF rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ENTITY .
   xsd:IDREF rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ID .
   xsd:IDREF rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NCName .

   xsd:ENTITY rdfs:subClassOf xsd:IDREF .
   xsd:ENTITY rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ID .
   xsd:ENTITY rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NCName .

   xsd:language rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ID . 
   xsd:language rdfs:subClassOf xsd:IDREF . 
   xsd:language rdfs:subClassOf xsd:ENTITY .

   xsd:QName rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NOTATION .
   xsd:NOTATION rdfs:subClassOf xsd:QName .

The following are omitted, as they are all implicit in
other subClassOf relations:

   xsd:ID rdfs:subClassOf xsd:anyURI .
   xsd:IDREF rdfs:subClassOf xsd:anyURI .
   xsd:ENTITY rdfs:subClassOf xsd:anyURI .
   xsd:language rdfs:subClassOf xsd:NCName .
   xsd:language rdfs:subClassOf xsd:token . 
   
Though if/how/where/when it is published is not an easy question to answer...
