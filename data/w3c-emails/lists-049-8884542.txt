Well, OK, I guess. BUt the point is that if I invent a term and 
'define' it and then you read it and use it some way that isnt in 
line with what I said about it, then you, the reader of what I wrote, 
have the responsibility for the mistake (and any of its 
consequences). Put another way, I can't be held responsible for other 
people's misunderstandings of my meanings.

Yes, I like the above. But I think that the general principle goes 
beyond just the 'significant' legal cases: it applies everywhere.
