Ah, I see your point.  This suggests a slight rearrangement;  the general 
case, leading in to the 'significant' concerns:

[[
When making statements that use terms defined by a third party, one should 
take care that the third party definition is consistent with ones intended 
meaning, or the statements may have unintended consequences.

In particular, when publishing a statement with potentially significant 
legal or social consequences, use only vocabulary whose meaning is 
well-defined, stable and known to correspond to the intended 
commitment.  For important documents, such as contracts, this may mean that 
use of third-party vocabulary is restricted to terms defined by 
legislature, recognized standards bodies or other reputable organizations, 
or that otherwise have socially well-established meanings.
