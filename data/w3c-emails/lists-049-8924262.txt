I agree that determination of "principal" is in the mind of the 
beholder.  The obvious examples are, well, obvious.  In the case of a 
more complicated structured value (or a simple value where the semantics 
are less common), it might be difficult to figure out which should be 
considered the "principal" value (the Primer sort of suggests that). 
However, keep in mind that saying something normative about the intended 
meanings of such constructs may require a bunch of additional writing. 
For example, we'd need to describe the intended meaning of Alt a lot 
more clearly than it's currently described in any normative document I'm 
aware of.
