Delete it and deprecate rdf:value. See comments below...

Well, this seems to preclude the scoping usage where the semantics of
rdf:value is essentially equality.

Including, or rather, usually a typed literal. Right?

OK, that would seem to suggest a typed literal, since the 
set of simple string literals is infinite and any subset
constitutes a datatype (IMO) where the L2V mapping is simply 
equality. E.g. xsd:language

Including rdf:value? So rdf:value denotes a context?

As Graham points out, how does one reliably know which property
of such a resource is "primary".

I've always understood rdf:value as having "equality" to
some degree as part of its semantics, but even that is hard
to pin down with some usage.

Whoops! Wrong. A plain literal is *not* a lexical form. If it is
a lexical form, then it is fair to presume that the datatype is
known, and that it denotes the value to which the lexical form maps 
to. Dangerous language there...

This pretty much sums it up for me.

I suggest that rdf:value be deprecated as having no true utility,
since it has no consistent semantics, and offer recommendations
as to how to better model present usage of rdf:value, such as
the use of URIs or explicit properties that more accurately
capture the intended semantics.

Folks can still continue to use it, since deprecation is not
deletion, but it's not considered "best practice" given the
potentially conflicting application-specific interpretations 
and ambiguity arising from its use.
