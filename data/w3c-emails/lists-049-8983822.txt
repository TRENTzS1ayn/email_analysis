Fine by me.  Did Jeremy suggest a variation on this wording?

I'd support your slightly against.  I think we are in a phase where we only 
make changes when we have good reason to.

I support having a changes section.  I think its a mandatory courtesy to 
help those who have reviewed an earlier draft in detail, unless the changes 
are such that a complete re-read is necessary.

I might suggest just documenting the changes between this WD and the last, 
but its not a big deal.
