Pat,

I'm leaning towards deprecation.  But in case the group doesn't like that 
option, there's a suggested version below based on your words.

Question:  is it required that rdf:value object be a literal?  I think that 
gets messy as a requirement, though it does fit with its intended usage.

Suggested reworking:
[[
The intended use for rdf:value is as part of a construction that indicates 
the value denoted by its subject.  Some examples are given in 
[RDF-PRIMER].  It can used, for example, to indicate a quantity associated 
with some unit of measurement, such as a weight in kilograms or a length in 
yards.  Or it may be used to indicate a textual value interpreted according 
top some coding scheme;  e.g. a Dewey Decimal code.  The object of 
rdf:value will typically be a literal of some kind, and the subject a blank 
node denoting the value in question, and whose other properties indicate 
the context in which the value is to be understood.  For example:

<ex:thing> <ex:weight> _:x .
_:x rdf:value "12.36"^^xsd:float .
_:x <ex:weightUnit> <ex:kilogram> .

<ex:doc> <dc:subject> _:x .
_:x rdf:value "020-Library Science" .
_:x <ex:classification> "DeweyDecimalCode" .

Since the subject of rdf:value can denote any value, and the object can be 
a plain literal indicating a textual representation or a typed literal 
denoting the numerical value, there is no way to give a complete formal 
specification of this intended usage.

Users are cautioned that any such use will be context-dependent and is 
liable to be misunderstood if removed from its context.  A single triple 
involving rdf:value has no particular meaning in isolation.  Such 
ambiguities can be avoided by replacing the rdf:value construct with more 
precise RDF constructions or more explicit vocabulary.

I don't like the two-way inference here.  I could accept '-->', but the 
reverse inference seems too much to even hint at given the non-semantics of 
rdf:value.

>aaa ppp _:x .
>_:x rdf:value "sss" .
>_:x rdf:type ddd .

Overall, this is messy enough that I think deprecation is the easy way 
out.  I think the most we might say formally about rdf:value, consistent 
with example of use seen so far, is that:

    _:x rdf:value _:y .

means that there is some property p such that the range of p is in the 
lexical or value space of some datatype, and:

    _:x p _:y .

which is pretty weak.  Specific application assumptions may be able to 
assign more specific meaning to collections of statements containing 
rdf:value, but these additional meanings are not accessible to general RDF 
applications.
