What the previous text does not say, and concerning which there was a 
comment on the Concepts document, is that even though third-party 
vocabularies are generally unconstrained by opthers who may use them, there 
may yet be some that are sufficiently well-trusted for serious use.  If you 
don't want to go into legal territory, the final sentence might be pared 
down to, say:

[[
For important documents this may mean that use of third-party vocabulary is 
restricted to terms defined by reputable organizations (e.g. recognized 
standards bodies), or that otherwise have socially well-established meanings.
