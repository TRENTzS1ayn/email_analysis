I wouldn't consider a decision to deprecate rdf:value as "arbitrary".
Clearly there's been alot of thought and discussion about it, and
the fact that it has no actual semantics in the MT suggests that it
has no place in the RDF vocabulary.

The problem is that it is used in different ways by different
folks, and no RDF processor has a clue what it means apart
from application specific knowledge which may conflict between
different cases. That's exactly what our specs are supposed to
eliminate.

Fair enough. And DC can continue to use it, as a deprecated term,
until such time as a future version of DC provides a more satisfactory
treatment by migrating to a term with clear semantics; e.g. dc:value

The problem is explaining it in a way that is (a) useful to users
and (b) reduces ambiguity/conflict/confusion. The lack of any
real semantics seems to be making that difficult at best to
accomplish.

If we're not going to actually say what it means, then we should
deprecate it. It's no different than introducing some term
rdf:blargh which folks are then free to assign any arbitrary 
semantics to.

The same is true of every other term that doesn't have a proper
definition in the MT, not just rdf:value.

The role of the Primer, as I understand it, is to provide an easy
to understand presentation of the more formal content of the 
specifications. Having the Primer suggest uses for a term that
has no formal semantics seems rather dubious.

This doesn't seem to me to be a huge change. It's a choice between
adding verbage that tries to clarify the legacy usage of rdf:value
(without actually suggesting any actual semantics) or simply saying
it's deprecated. 

I'd think the latter option is less change overall.
