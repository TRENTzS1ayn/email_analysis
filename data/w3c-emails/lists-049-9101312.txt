Reviewing the mailing list archive, the discussion of the semantics of 
rdf:value seems have originated in:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0648.html

[[General comment, not specifically Primer:  the description of rdf:value is
fine, but how does it relate to a normative specification?  What can we say
formally about rdf:value?   What formal semantics (interpretation) allows
us to make inferences like: ...]

[[
Resolution: This issue was discussed by the RDFCore WG on 11 January 2002 
which resolved:

o resolves to not change the name of this property at this time on the grounds:

- insufficient reasons to make this change

- will cause existing uses to be illegal - such as examples in m&s

o resolves to recast this issue as a need to clarify the semantics of 
rdf:value.

At the February 2002 face to face meeting, the RDFCore WG resolved:

     * that rdf:value is a property defined in the RDF namespace
     * that the model theory state that rdf:value is a property
     * that no other model theory semantics is defined specifically for it
     * the issue be closed.
]]

In the absence of new information this issue will not be reopened.
