It's logged, with links, at:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/DocIssues/RDF-Concepts/022-SocialMeaning.html

The comment being:
[[
Similarly, the tying of the meaning of a URI to the ill-specified
intent of some organization poses a giant bar to the deployment of
RDF.  Under these circumstances how can any organization use an URI
that they do not own?  The owning organization might, after all,
choose to change the meaning of any URI they own at any time.  This
seems to me to be a bar to any communication between organizations
using RDF.

OK, let's try again:

[[
For important documents, the use of third-party vocabulary should be 
restricted to terms defined by trustworthy parties (e.g. recognized 
standards bodies or reputable organizations), or that otherwise have 
socially well-established meanings.
