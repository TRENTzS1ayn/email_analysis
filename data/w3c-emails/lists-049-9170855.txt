Well, its not being arbitrary to say that the existing use cases are 
so confused that we are unable to give a coherent account of what 
this is supposed to mean. Which seems to be the position we are in 
with rdf:value. If we want to keep DC happy then we could try to 
identify their use pattern and make it official. Or we could just 
tell DC that they need to mend their ways.

I was under the impression that we had eliminated it when we made the 
simplify-datatyping decision. I know I was wrong, but I would have 
spoken out earlier if I hadnt been under this impression.

Removing something isn't a big CHANGE exactly, since it can only 
result in other deletions in other documents.
