Then they should not be in the language. They can be in user 
ontologies, of course, but then its up to said user to describe them 
to their own satisfaction. Seems to me that we have a responsibility 
to give clear specifications for the meanings of the vocabulary we 
provide, or else to say clearly that they have no meaning. I'm quite 
happy to say that rdf:value has no meaning; but then I don't want the 
primer to explain this nonexistent meaning in intuitive terms.

I would like to throw out rdf:seeAlso, but at least we are honest 
about it being meaningless. As for Dublin Core, if it were up to us 
to say what it meant, yes, I would throw it out in an instant. 
Fortunately however it is not up to us to do that.
