OK, fine. But then I have a new issue, which applies to rdf:value but 
also more generally.

In cases where the WG has resolved that the model theory provides no 
semantics for a construct in the RDF namespace, I suggest that none 
of our documents, including the Primer, should be written in a way 
that suggests that the construct does have an intended meaning that 
could support any valid inferences. That is, we should be consistent 
about meaning: when things have no meaning but are being kept for 
essentially political reasons, we should say that clearly.
