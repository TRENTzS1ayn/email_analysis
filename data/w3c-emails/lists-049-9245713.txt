Sorry I have been sleeping ...

Your text looks fine to me, with one word addition

"It is acceptable to use l without any changes"
==>
"It is often acceptable to use l without any changes"


We use to have a normative ref to XC14N in concepts, this in turn
normatively refers to C14N.
So, moving the XC14N ref to syntax, and having a C14N ref in concepts is
*not* adding to the normative refs burden, just clarifying its size.

On the comments issue the mapping from the syntax to the lexical form was
agreed as with or without comments at implementation descretion.
Hence the minimal requirement is without comments, which is why your text is
good.
However, IMO, if the implementation chooses to keep the comments in the
mapping to lexical form, then it should also keep them in the datatype
lexical-to-value mapping.

This last point I decided arbitrarily at editor's descretion. (invitation to
challenge/discuss that judgement) I guess it would be consistent with the WG
decisions to also allow that dattaype l2v mapping to be implementation
dependent. I prefer to localize the implementation dependency in one spot,
and the syntax doc seems the right place (sorry).
