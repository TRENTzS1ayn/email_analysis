This link will be preserved and point to something that explains what one
is. As I indicated earlier, it does not feel like a normative part of the
abstract syntax. Does this need to be normative for you?

I don't think the defining text is changing much.

It doesn't give you a syntax for these things though - I note that the XML
balnk node ID and the N-triples blank node ID have different syntaxes.
