Updating and inlining:

 This specification allows some freedom to choose exactly what string
 is used as the lexical form of an XML Literal.  Whatever string is
 used, it MUST correspond to an XML document when enclosed within a
 start and end element tag, and its canonicalization (without
 comments, as defined in [XC14N]) MUST be the same as the same
 canonicalization of the literal text l.  It is often acceptable to
 use l without any changes but this is incorrect if, for example, l
 uses entity references or namespace prefixes defined in the outer
 XML document.

I'm wondering about the phrase 
  "MUST be the same as the same canonicalization of the literal text l"

what does "the same canonicalization of the literal text l" mean?
Does that mean "the same XC14N of the literal text l" ?

Yeah, I realised that after I wrote it.

You say "we use"; do you mean "we used to"?  Are you removing this
normativeness from concepts?

That seems appropriate and I'm happy with that.
