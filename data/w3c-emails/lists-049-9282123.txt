I'd like a WG decision on this (and also about similar things, like 
rdf:Alt) then.  In particular, coverage of rdf:value was added to the 
Primer at WG direction, and the text has been sitting there for some 
time.  NB:  The text currently says (near the end):

"You need not use rdf:value in these situations, and RDF does not 
associate any particular meaning with it. rdf:value is simply provided 
as a convenience for use in these commonly-occurring situations."

but this may not satisfy Pat's concern.

On a more general note, I'm not a defender of rdf:value, but I will say 
it seems to me that saying nothing, or practically nothing, about some 
of these legacy pieces of syntax (aside from saying they have no 
meaning) is not particularly responsible on the part of the WG.  We owe 
it to newcomers to RDF to explain why stuff is there (people are bound 
to wonder;  it's the WG's job to tell them), and we owe it to those 
already familiar with (and possibly using) RDF to explain any changed 
status.  I think some more straightforwardness about this is needed (and 
not only in the Primer).  Perhaps we need a new document:  "RDF 
Deprecated Vocabulary".
