Dan,

Since Lbase now wont be going out the door until after we freeze RDF, 
let me suggest that before finally emitting it, as it were, that I 
will give the version on my website one more go-through to make sure 
that it is exactly aligned with the appendix in the RDF semantics 
doc, and that you take the version from there as the pub copy. There 
have already been a couple of tiny tweaks to the Lbase axioms for 
XMLLiteral required in order to keep things straight (I omitted the 
normalization part in the draft you have), and there could still be a 
few more to come. I guarantee that the Lbase doc on my site will 
track the RDF sem doc by no more than few hours, and will send you an 
email when it is done.

That OK with everyone? I think it fits within editorial discretion/no 
need for re-review.

Pat
