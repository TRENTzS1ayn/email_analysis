Frank, your prose in section 4.1 of the primer mentions rdf:li as a 
convenience element generic XML version of container membership 
properties. My recollection is that we had decided to deprecate or 
even forbid rdf:li in this way, however (??) on the grounds that 
there was in general no way to assign numerical properties to the 
instances of rdf:li.

We ought to get this straight one way or the other. If we still have 
rdf:li, can anyone tell me how to map RDF/XML into a graph?

Another matter, if we keep rdf:li, then your reference to 'list 
element' is potentially confusing given the use of 'list structure' 
in the next section to refer to something completely different.
