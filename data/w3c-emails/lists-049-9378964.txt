After reading through the Primer, particularly section 4, I propose 
that almost all of section 3 of the semantics document be simply 
removed. It's all in the primer section 4.

Semantics section 3 should just list the RDF vocabulary that isn't 
being given a formal meaning, say explicitly that it isn't, and refer 
to the Primer for the informal meaning. If anyone feels that there 
are any subtleties in section 3 that aren't in the primer text as it 
stands, then lets put them into it. I don't think there are many, if 
any, in fact.

Anyone object? Frank??
