I forgot to mention. You used the term 'primary value' to refer to 
the value of rdf:value (if you see what I mean), and I avoided it 
deliberately because in this context particularly it might suggest to 
someone with a DB background that rdf:value was being used to 
indicate a primary field in a DBS, and nothing could be wronger.  I 
havnt checked whether or not you follow this usage elsewhere in the 
primer.

Also, I had to sneak in a new example property exterms:quantity in 
the code examples, so you might want to change the name or put it 
into a list somewhere.

BTW, I don't like the wording "Uses like this have an inherent 
wastefulness, in the sense that the special value has to be stated 
twice " now I re-read it, this would be better:

"This use of <tt>rdf:value</tt> requires that the 'main' value be 
mentioned twice," But Im too tired and hungry to edit it again :-)
