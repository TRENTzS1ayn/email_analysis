I think that Jeremy should get primary credit based on his material in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0588.html
would serve as an excellent foundation for such a document, adding
in the RDF Schemas (reflecting different levels of contention/ambiguity)
as appendices to that work, or referenced from that.

And that would serve as good input to the XML Schema WG, perhaps with
the goal of evolving it into a joint Note with a single RDF schema 
reflecting the concensus of the two WGs.

Eh?
