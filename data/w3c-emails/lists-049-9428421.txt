Not necessarily. In cases where the rdf:value property is being
used as a scoping mechanism, the semantics of rdf:value are
essentially equality. E.g.

   aaa ppp _:x .
   _:x rdf:value vvv .
   _:x x:scope sss .

which entails

   aaa ppp vvv .

which is true, though only within the scope sss, etc.   

Thus, in this case rdf:value has identical semantics with
either ppp or is simply equality.
