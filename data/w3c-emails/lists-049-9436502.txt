The MT states:

   rdfs:Datatype rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal .

This doesn't seem correct to me.

Is the datatype class xsd:integer an instance of rdfs:Literal?
I don't think so.

Note that xsd:integer is not rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Datatype, but
is rdf:type rdfs:Datatype, so if the above assertion is intending
to say that "10"^^xsd:integer is rdf:type rdfs:Literal then
that's not right.

Rather, what we need is a closure rule such as:

IF
   ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
THEN
   ddd rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal .

Eh?

That is of course, if we consider the following to be true
(syntactic invalidity aside):

   "10"^^xsd:integer rdf:type rdfs:Literal .
