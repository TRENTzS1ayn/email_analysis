I think you are a bit confused Pat.  rdf:li is a syntax name; it has
never been an RDF property, class or whatever.  We have thus never
deprecated or forbidden it.

Just to be clear; RDF as we have revised has changed two names in the
RDF namespace
  rdf:aboutEach rdf:aboutEachPrefix - syntax only devices, now removed

(we've added some of course)

The definitive words for rdf: things:

  5.1 The RDF Namespace
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Namespace

including:
  [[Syntax names - not concepts

    RDF Description ID about bagID parseType resource li nodeID
    datatype
  ]]
