That's wrong in several ways.

    rdf:List
    rdf:first
    rdf:rest
    rdf:nil

These terms are not historical - they are new to this revision of RDF.

    rdf:li

Never a property; a piece of rdf/xml syntax scaffolding.

    rdf:_n
    rdf:value
    rdf:Bag
    rdf:Seq
    rdf:Alt
    rdfs:comment
    rdfs:seeAlso
    rdfs:isDefinedBy
    rdfs:label 

None of these are deprecated and should not be described in any way
as historical.  They remain used, useful and staying that way.

"no valid inferences"!  Rubbish.  Don't say such things.  Triples
with these terms are valid.

This is saying again that the primer is informational, but rather
negatively.  The primer is informational and useful; the formal
meanings of the terms are in other docs, which are pointed to.
