+1 on What Dave Said.

I feel like some of us are on different planets here. Vocabulary 
meaning is not exhaustively accounted for by the MT/inferential story. We 
admit that implicitly when we allow that two classes may have the same 
extension yet be considered usefully different entities. 
Attempting to divide the 
RDF world into 'good' properties (those that are mentioned in some rules 
we've written) and 'bad' ones (the rest) is imho a vast oversimplification 
of the situation.
