That might be a bit dangerous to state formally, if ppp has to be 
different from rdf:value, since it amounts to an existential over 
properties. I don't think we need to go there formally, though 
intutitely that is clearly what is often menat, though see Patrick's 
scoping example.

The real lowdown is that rdf:value is *almost* equality, although 
sometimes its *almost* a kind of inverse of the denotation 
relationship (a rdf:value b  iff b denotes a) ; and its hard to pin 
down its meaning in isolation. But if we see it as a kind of adjunct 
- when used with ppp it requires ppp to allow a binary abbreviation - 
then we wriggle out of having to say what it is that rdf:value 
actually means by itself.

The *minimum* is probably nothing (in the MT, that is.)

I agree doing things this late is a worry, even small things.  I 
would have done it earlier but I thought we had gotten rid of 
rdf:value. Tell you what, I'll write the section up today (evening) 
and let y'all read it, it will only be a few paragraphs, no great 
loss if we vote it down.
