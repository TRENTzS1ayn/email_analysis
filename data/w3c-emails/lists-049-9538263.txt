No, that seems right to me. If ppp really is a functional property 
then you *can't* use it in this way, because this usage forces it to 
have two values for some arguments, eg an address is both a complex 
thingie and a zip code. So if you do, then you can conclude some odd 
identities. See Patrick's message for uses of rdf:value to 
essentially mean equality.

>also the fact that it is contextual is not very appealing

Well, yes, but rdf:value *is* contextual, but at least this keeps it 
in bounds. I'd prefer to abandon it, but that's apparently not an 
option.
