Yes, I was.

I have to say, this idea of a 'syntax name' that isn't actually a 
name *is* very confusing, particularly when it sure LOOKS like a 
name.  Im still puzzled about how it's supposed to actually work. 
Seems to me that the actual graph formed from some RDF/XML which uses 
rdf:li can vary from moment to moment at the whim of the parser, 
since it depends on some ordering that isnt specified in the syntax.

Well, its ours, right? I mean, its in our namespace? It starts with 
'rdf:', after all.

OK, thanks.

Now Im puzzled about something else. I've been using rdf:Datatype as 
a class name. Is that a mistake??

Pat

PS. BTW, you say there that 'any other names are not defined and 
SHOULD generate a warning when encountered' which seems a bit strong. 
That means for example that any OWL vocabulary is going to generate 
an RDF warning. In fact, any RDFS vocabulary is going to generate an 
RDF warning.
