My apologies if this has already been discussed.

Is it intended that the syntax provide a way to describe a list that 
contains literals?

If so, how does that work?

If not, that seems like a significant omission, that significantly limits 
the utility of the new list construct.  I suppose one can always write out 
the list "longhand" with rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest and rdf:nil.
