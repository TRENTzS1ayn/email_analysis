An (XML) namespace we've been using as a set of names.  Some of these
names are not used in triples, just for rdf/xml; I've tried several
ways to say that, and syntax name is about as snappy as I've got.

The rdf:li syntax in rdf/xml does emit a different property as it is
used in the document, but the exact rdf:_n property emitted is well
defined and the same for each mapping of rdf/xml to triples.  So, you
don't need to worry about it :)

Yes, we have control over that.

Note the case & namespace difference
   rdfs:Datatype rdf:type rdfs:Class

     See RDF Vocab
     http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_datatype

   rdf:datatype - just a bit of rdf/xml syntax used to give the URI
     for Typed Literals

     See RDF/XML Syntax
     2.9 Typed Literals - rdf:datatype
     http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-datatyped-literals

I said "... not defined" in the context of the RDF namespace.  That
is so that if someone uses a name we don't list, such as rdf:foo, it
gives a warning.

Other vocab will be in a different namespace (RDFS, OWL, ...)
