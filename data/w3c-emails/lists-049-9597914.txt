No.

As you know very well, rdf:parseType="Collection" was asked of RDF
Core, by WebONT to work the same way as daml:Collection.  The latter
always, and only, allowed a collection of nodes to be listed as content.

It is not a significant omission at all since you can always list any
triples you want; it is (yet another) abbreviation for triples.
