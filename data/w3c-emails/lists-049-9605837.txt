Er, yes.  In the past few days, I've come across a few instances of its use 
in RDF schedule data.  Some of which, I think, doesn't conform with your 
proposed "abbreviated form" approach;  e.g.

[[
<VEVENT>
<!--- snipped -->
<DTSTART>

<DATE-TIME>
<TZID rdf:resource="#US-Eastern"/>
<rdf:value>20010226T090000</rdf:value>
<util:hour>09</util:hour>
<util:minute>00</util:minute>
</DATE-TIME>
</DTSTART>

<DTEND>
<DATE-TIME>
<TZID rdf:resource="#US-Eastern"/>
<rdf:value>20010227T173000</rdf:value>
<util:hour>17</util:hour>
<util:minute>30</util:minute>
</DATE-TIME>
</DTEND>
</VEVENT>
]]

This is just an example picked at random.  I've noticed this pattern a 
couple of times in iCalendar/RDF data.
