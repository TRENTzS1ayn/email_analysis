See:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Dec/att-0029/00-rc

Note - I have not yet agreed the following change with Graham.
new section 3.7, old section 2.5
3.7 RDF Core URI Vocabulary and Namespaces (Normative)

(In the agreed change it was unclear where it went).

Note2 - indentation in ToC is incorrect.

Note3 - more work to do before ready for review.

Jeremy
