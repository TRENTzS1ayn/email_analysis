I suspect a reader familiar with M&S would think many of these terms
*did* have a clear and explicit interpretation.  In some cases we've
backed off from what was said in M&S.  In other cases, the problem was
the lack of a *machine-interpretable* interpretation.

Can we explain this without references to "inferences"?  As valuable as
the concept is, at this point I'd just as soon not get into explaining
in the Primer what "inferences" have to do with anything if I can help
it.
