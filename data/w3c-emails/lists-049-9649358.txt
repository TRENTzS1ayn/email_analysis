Pat--

(minor point)
I have a database background and I wasn't confused (nothing like a large
sample size to prove a point!). 
I think the database term you have in mind is "primary key" rather than
"primary field", and we've never suggested anything like "key-ness" of
values in any of this discussion (A "key" is a unique identifier;  a
"primary key" is selected from among the possible "candidate keys" to
identify rows in a relational table; a row in one table might identify a
specific row in another table using a "foreign key".  Note that all
these involve using various adjectives on "key".  I'm not familiar with
"primary field").  However, if people think it'll be a problem we can
change it to "main" (as you did in your rewrite).
