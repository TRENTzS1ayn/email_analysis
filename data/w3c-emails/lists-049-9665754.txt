You werent confused because you WROTE it. Everything I write seems 
transparently obvious to me at the time I write it, but I can't 
understand it the next day.

Yes, whoops, sorry. (Im NOT a DB person....)

I know we havnt said anything explicitly, but I bet that any DB guy 
would feel right at home reading your explanation of how to handle 
more-than-binary relations, thinking happily about 'complex values' 
as DB rows, and to throw 'primary' at him at that point with no 
warning is a low blow, seems to me. Particularly in that example, 
where one might, just, at a stretch, think that the weight of a tent 
could be the primary key.
