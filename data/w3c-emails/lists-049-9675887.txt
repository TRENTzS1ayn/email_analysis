At least I don't *think* I was confused *when* I wrote it (I'm not sure 
about now though).  What you say is why I wait until the next day to 
read the stuff again (it usually changes then).

Actually, I can't imagine it normally occurring to a DB guy to think of 
weight as a primary key.  However, it gets worse.  After composing my 
reply, I looked at the Concepts document, and section 3.5 has an example 
(the "John's address" example from the Primer) that actually uses the 
term "primary key" (it uses "staffid" as the primary key, which is 
reasonable).  So whatever text we use, it'll need to avoid "primary".
