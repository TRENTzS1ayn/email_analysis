The good/bad stuff is beside the point. It does however make some 
sense to split the vocabulary into what might be called 
free/restricted, where 'free' means that an implementer can do what 
they like with it, even if we provide some guidance, and still 
conform; but restricted means that conformance requires that they use 
it only in certain ways. On that criterion, rdf:li and rdf:nil would 
be in the restricted category, of course.
