On reflection, I don't think we should shilly-shally with 'typically' 
when using this strict language, so Ive simplified this to:

A 'datatype-aware' RDF engine SHOULD be competent to recognize at 
least the built-in rdf:XMLLiteral datatype. It MAY also recognize the 
set of all the XML Schema built-in datatypes.


OK??
