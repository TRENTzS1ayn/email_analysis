Hmmm... actually, I don't see how this doesn't fit with Pat's proposed
semantics for rdf:value.

The util:hour and util:minute values are present in the rdf:value
value, just made more explicit. So "dumbing down" the date-time
value to just the rdf:value value is not losing the core information,
per se, just the more explicit presentation/partitioning and
time zone context. Loss of the latter could, of course, result
in ambiguity, but it still seems to be compatible with Pat's
suggested interpretation of rdf:value.

Or have I missed your point?

Patrick
