Then we need to say where we've backed off from M&S.

Hmmmm.... isn't that the only point to RDF? Enabling *machines*
to do something useful with our content?

If there is no machine interpretable interpretation, then IMO
there is no interpretation whatsoever. Eh?

Fine. I stole that from comments made by Pat. The key point is that
users should not expect RDF applications to do anything consistently,
or anything at all, based on those terms as their interpretation is
always application specific, if any interpretation occurs at all.

Human intuition about what the natural language mnemonics of the
terms suggests has no normative weight here, and folks are free
to use the terms in whatever way they choose without violating
the RDF specs in any way.

In short: here be dragons...
