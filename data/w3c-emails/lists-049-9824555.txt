OK, if you say so (and I don't mean that facetiously).

The reason I expressed doubt was that the rdf:value value did not match the 
value of some other property, which I had the idea was part of your approach.

As for what the example *means*, I have little more information than you 
;-)  However, your explanation concurs with my understanding.

Yes, no argument from me...

... if your explanation covers this case, then I think there's no more to 
say, and I'm pleased that the data I found is not an impediment to your 
proposal to describe the intended meaning of rdf:value.
