I don't follow. Though the language tags do not affect the
denotation of typed literals, they have consistent and unambiguous
interpretation by machines (even if that interpretation is
disjuct from the datatyping interpretation of the typed literal.

On the other hand, if some term has no consistent machine
interpretation, in any way, at any level, then it is useless
as part of a solution for the global interchange of knowledge
for which RDF is supposed to serve as a foundational component.

No?
