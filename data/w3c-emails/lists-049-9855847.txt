I'm sorry, I thought you were saying that entailments were the only way
to give machine "meaning" to RDF; the conter-position is that various
bits of RDF have a meaning on some other level (eg, use for
documentation in the cases of comment). That is, "meaning" as people
generally understand the term, not as in, rules in the semantics
document.

I'm still not convinced that "10"@en^^xsd:integer and
"10"@fr^^xsd:integer would get treated the same way by all application
programmers; there may be a consistent machine interpretation of
these, but if that's because there's only one implementation that deals
with these at the moment then I don't see that as being a particularly
valid argument :-)
