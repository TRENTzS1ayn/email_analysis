I have no problems with allowing documentation for humans, but
RDF is IMO first and foremost about machines and what machines
can make of RDF statements.

And yes, entailments are not the only way that machines can
interpret RDF.

Well, it depends on what you mean by "treated".

If they're taken to denote different values, then that's a bug 
in the application, plain and simple.

However, the language tag might be used to filter some values
from other values, for whatever reason. This is not particularly
useful in the case of the xsd:integer datatype, but for other
datatypes, which contain natural language content which is
otherwise also constrained by the lexical grammar of the
datatype, this is a very useful bit of functionality. E.g.

  some:thing x:shortLabel "Car"@en^^x:shortToken .
  some:thing x:shortLabel "Auto"@fi^^x:shortToken .

Nevertheless, the interpretation
of the typed literal both as to the value it denotes and as
to which language differentiated set it belongs to are both
unambiguous and consistent for machines according to the 
relevant specs.

No, it's because the RDF, XML and relevant datatype specs jointly and 
explicitly say what the valid interpretations are, and every implementation
should conform to the specs (even if there is only one implementation ;-)
