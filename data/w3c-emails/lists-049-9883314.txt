[ I note TOC 4 has a 2.4.2 under it ]

So in summary the renumbering was
  1.2 deleted
  2.3 => 3
    2.3.5 deleted, 2.3.6=>3.5, 2.3.7=>3.6
  2.4 => 4 [reordered subsections]
  2.5 now 3.7
  3 onwards => 5 onwards

can you confirm, check this; maybe add in a changes note/email.

So all the structuring and renumbering is done now? 

Can I update my references now?

Dave
