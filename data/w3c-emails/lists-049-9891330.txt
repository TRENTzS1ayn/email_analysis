I don't see how that is possible. When talking about datatypes we are 
forced into talking about information 'inside' RDF and information 
coming from 'outside'. The 'side' that these words are referring to 
is  the boundary of a hypothetical RDF reasoning engine.

I note that the XML spec makes a similar reference to a hypothetical 
XML parser, and it does not seem inappropriate there.
