I agree.  However, I don't think the Primer is the place to do this 
(example:  isDefinedBy)

Of course we want machines to do something useful with our content. 
However, there is quite a lot of machine interoperability going on 
without machine-interpretable *definitions* of the terms and data 
structures being used.  Instead, people read definitions, and write the 
software to behave in accordance with those definitions.  Practically 
every database in the world operates this way, for example (and most of 
the RDF currently works this way too).  I understand that, without 
machine-interpretable definitions, there is no guarantee that people 
will interpret the terms, and hence write the software, consistently. 
That's what we're trying to *appropach* in the Semantic Web.  However, 
there is no way we're going to be able to totally throw away the idea of 
people having to build a certain amount of additional understanding into 
software, barring the creating of the perfect description languages (I'm 
not holding my breath).  Some variant of your "here be dragons" warning 
is fine, along with carefully distinguishing what can be *guranteed* by 
virtue of having precise machine-interpretable semantics and what can't, 
based on the need for human understanding of terms (and reflection of 
that understanding in software), and the possible mistakes (or 
deliberate evasions) that may occur.  However, talking as if the use of 
such "software defined understanding" is totally out the door now seems 
similar to refusing to take a lifeboat and radio when embarking on a 
leaky ship.

I don't know about that.  Do you mean that even if something is 
specified in English in an RDF normative spec, that doesn't matter, and 
only what is describable in the model theory must be adhered to?
