"Consistent machine interpretation" sure.  But it seems to me you're 
going beyond that, to a requirement for a machine-interpretable 
definition as the basis for all this consistent machine interpretation. 
    As I said in an earlier message, that's something we want to move 
toward, but I don't think we can throw out the older approaches quite 
yet, as problematic as they may be (how do people write TCP/IP software, 
for example?)
