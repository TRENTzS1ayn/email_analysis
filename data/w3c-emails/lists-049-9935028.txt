OK, sounds like a reasonable position. Ultimately, the _point_ of the
semantic web is general machine-machine processing. As a first step,
there will certainly be a bunch of grassroots person-machine-machine
stuff (eg, the foaf bits and pieces) and we don't want to
discourage/deprecate the efforts of these people.

Big picture, I've got a lot of sympathy for Patrick's position in
general, but side with Dave & Dan on the particular issue of the primer
words etc.
