Can someone remind me what we decided about whether literals were 
resources or not?  Specifically, I'm trying to revise a sentence in the 
Primer that says:

"All classes are implicitly subclasses of class rdfs:Resource (since the 
instances belonging to all classes are resources)"

against which there is a question concerning rdfs:Literal.

Thanks.
