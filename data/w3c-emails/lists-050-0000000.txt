As promised, an outline of the latest proposal (C in my previous message) is at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/simpledatatype23-02-2002.html

I think this is about the simplest version that can allow reasonable 
access to datatype values and also protects something very close to 
the the S-B idiom. (I also think it does most of what Patrick was 
wanting to do with his 'union' proposal, but without actually putting 
the unions into the semantic domain.)

PS. I'm sorry I keep altering this thing, but all the different 
versions are really only small variations on the same basic theme, 
and most of the documents are based closely on earlier drafts.
