As I won't be at the F2F, my 2c worth of comment on this issue:

Fuzziness of matching is not acceptable for RDF: it would break every 
inference engine ever written. Language tagging is largely incidental 
to proposed RDF usage in any case, as RDF is not intended to be read 
by human beings. Also bear in mind that most proposed RDF usage is 
not concerned with text.

I would say that RDF deals with Unicode strings. How to encode an 
integral in Unicode is someone else's problem.

>and how will others match on it?

Again, someone else's problem. Intelligent text retrieval is a large 
research area, but it is also largely independent of ontology 
language design. RDF does not have the resources to do both jobs. at 
once.
