In that case these inference engines either do not handle text or else
they only handle text in a known language.

What's that got to do with it?  It is intended to be "read" by engines.
Reading implies "understanding" in the sense of being able to make
"decisions" (such as A and B are the same).  Understanding of text
requires knowledge of the language.  I walk on the pavement every day in
London.  If I did so in the US, I'd be dead within a few minutes.

Where is this documented?  It certainly was very much concerned with
text when the original RDF M&S WG (of which I was a member) did its
work.  In most use cases, the "literals" were text (as opposed to dates,
numbers etc).

Sorry, I didn't make myself clear.  How to encode an integral is a
solved problem: MathML solved it.  How to make use of this in RDF is an
RDF problem.

I'm not sure what you mean by text retrieval.  Are you suggesting that
all/most RDF literals will be numbers, dates etc?
