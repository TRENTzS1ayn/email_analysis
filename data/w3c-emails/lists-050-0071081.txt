Tim,

Tonight (it has since turned into last night) Graham Klyne drew my
attention to your "Interpretation properties" [1].  You wrote:

IIRC, the RDF M&S WG didn't include string language in the model in the
regular RDF manner because of the argument, put forward by us I18N
folks, that in real life many strings are mixed-language (your made up
sentence above is an example).  The most obvious node-and-arc treatment
cannot, I think, handle that.

We need to devise an approach which allows the string to exist as a
string and, simultaneously, to be recognised as containing substrings
associated with various languages.  I imagine this can be achieved using
regular RDF constructs, but it needs some careful thought.  Graham and
I tonight discussed the possibility of using XPath-based arcs to address
the monolingual substrings and to associate each with a language.

More difficult problems are posed by:

-  Text markup with control semantics, eg for BiDi.

-  Strings which encode neither human language text, nor a datatype such
   as a date or a floating point number.  An example is a mathematical
   equation (using MathML).  Then we have the mixed case of a human
   language string containing some embedded MathML, eg the title of a
   scientific paper.
