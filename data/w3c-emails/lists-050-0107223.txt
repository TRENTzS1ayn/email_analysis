I agree.

I don't think that's necessary.  How about the following rules:

Literals are equal iff:

1) the strings are equal, and
2a) at least one string does not have a tag, or
2b) one tag is a prefix of the other within the meaning of RFC 3066
     (i.e. "fr"/French is not a prefix of "fry"/Frisian but is a prefix
     of "FR-CA"/Canadian French).

This treats a missing tag as synonymous with the RFC 3066 language range
"*", which matches any tag.
