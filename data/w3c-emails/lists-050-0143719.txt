8: Status of Test Cases WD
ACTION: 2001-11-30#3 Jan Grant Get access to test case areas of W3C site
Closed.
ACTION: 2002-01-11#2  JanG  post summary of Test Cases WD outstanding
updates to list.
Closed.
ACTION: 2002-01-11#1  bwm  persue CVS access for Jan with EM
Closed.

Jan has CVS working and is currently going thru previous minutes looking for
test cases to add to the WD. There was some discussion about some of the
negative entailments being more for human consumption than for machines, but
it was discussed that this was acceptable. Pat Hayes said he'd take alook at
the test cases.

9: Preparing for the f2f

See section 7.

10: Model Theory for Containers
ACTION 2002-02-22/1: PatH to update the model theory to state a semantics
for rdf:Bag and rdf:Alt which is the same as that for rdf:Seq.

See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0072

11: Datatypes

DECISION 2002-02-22/2:
      The proposal should include support for the following idiom:

        <mary> <age> "10" .
        <age>  <range> <integer> .    # for some appropriate <integer>
                                      # and some appropriate <range>

Brian pointed out the specific ambiguity as to whether this was rdfs:range
or drange or something else.

DECISION 2002-02-22/3:
      That in case 1, the value of the age property is a 'string' which is
      constrained to conform to lexical space of a datatype indicated by
      <integer>, i.e. the node labeled "10" denotes the string "10".

Based on a Working Group vote, with Jeremy and Frank dissenting. Graham
noted a very slight preference for having 10 denote an integer. Pat Hayes
abstained.

DECISION 2002-02-22/4:
      That the doublet be dropped from the proposal (the rdf:value idiom).

Patrick Stickler: stab! stab! stab!

On number 4:
      That the datatype triple idiom be dropped from the proposal.
there was strong agreement that this idiom needed to be left in.

Pat Hayes commented that creating a model theory might be difficult with the
combination of decisions the Working Group had made, but said he would
research things and report back with more conclusive results.

12: Issue rdfms-fragments
See: http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-fragments

Aaron outlined his view of the problems, explaining that he felt this was an
inconsistency between the W3C specs and the IETF specs, leading to practical
problems, some more subtle than others. He emphasized that people like Roy
Fielding envisioned RDF's usage of URIs and designed the system to support
that use. He encouraged people to read Roy Fielding's dissertation[1], and
not to simply blow the issue off by saying that it's only relevant to
"traditional" Web tools like browsers and proxies.

The discussion continued after the end of the formal meeting, and several
people (notably Pat Hayes) said that they now understood the problem better.

Dan Connolly commented (on IRC) that "we can't (knowingly) put arch problems
in our specs."

13: Issue rdfms-identity-of-statements

Held over until F2F.

14: Provenance

Not covered.
