If that is what a  literal is, why have we been using examples like 
"35" during the entire datatyping discussion? (Should these have been 
("35", "Mathematics") ?) How does one define the application of a 
datatype mapping to a (string, lang) pair ???

I think the point was that literals *without lang* are tidy, which is 
my understanding of the current situation.
