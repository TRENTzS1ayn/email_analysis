Well, Brian, surely you might have mentioned this before, when the 
datatyping discussion was in full progress, all predicated on the 
assumption (and indeed the frequent explicit assertion, to which 
nobody raised the slightest objection) that literals were strings. If 
literals are not strings, then we have to go and do all that again, 
because NONE of it makes any sense at all. What is the result of 
applying the lexical-to-value mapping of xsd:number to the pair 
("34", "french") ? Is it the pair (34, "french" ) ? What would that 
mean ?

Well, one problem for us is that we will have to re-open the 
datatyping discussion again from square one. For example, if literals 
can be pairs, then we could put the datatype name in the second slot 
of the pair, - a solution which I believe was considered, but 
rejected on the grounds that literals were NOT pairs, as I recall.
