I would say that (1) the spec was ambiguously worded, and you have 
based your code on a risky intepretation of a single sentence, so you 
must be prepared to accept the risks; and
(2) the WG's charter is to clarify the spec. There is inevitably a 
risk, therefore, that code written on the basic of an unclear spec 
may have to be modified when it is clarified. Sorry, life is tough.

I have to say< I do not see it as being a change. If literals are NOT 
strings, on the other hand, we have to (1) modify N-triples syntax 
(2) rewrite (and probably re-think) every example in every document 
that uses a literal (3) re-write, and probably re-think, the entire 
MT document (4) re-open the datatyping discussion, as new options are 
now possible.
