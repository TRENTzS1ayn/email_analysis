As I said before, several folks did mention it a long time
ago, but after while, we got tired of saying "string
or string with lang or XML thingy" and just said string.

I was pretty careful to be sure the way we resolved
the lang issue doesn't matter to the model theory.

To the model theory, a literal is still just a string. We can
encode two strings in one, after all, no? Here's the
n-triples design DaveB and I kicked around after the meeting:

("abc", 'en') ->"abc"-en
("abc",  none) ->"abc"
("abc", 'fr') ->"abc"-fr

Also, for XML literals, we'll have xml("canonical-form...", "en").

The point is: the literal is syntactically evident in the RDF document.

same as the result of applying it to "blarf": you lose.

I don't think so.

no... the pair comes from RDF/XML syntax.

Eventually, you're going to have to take a peek at the syntax, Pat. ;-)

For the examples above, that's:

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example/something">
          <dc:title xml:lang="en">abc</dc:title>
</rdf:Description>

becomes

<http://example/something> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title>
"abc"-en.

If you want to muck with things in n-triples, you have to reflect
them back into RDF/XML.
