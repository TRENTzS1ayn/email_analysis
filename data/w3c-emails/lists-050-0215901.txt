I think that from an user perspective, that's the right thing to do.

However, the RDF core group, as they explained to us, needs a
definition that had the properties of equivalence classes,
with transitivity for the equality relation, for use for
deciding whether two labels were the same node in a graph,
or a different node.

For this, the only reasonable solution was that both text and
language have to match. User-oriented matching can [and should]
occur on a higher level [and I think that we got a commitment
from RDF core to say so in the spec].
