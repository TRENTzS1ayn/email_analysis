That could be given many interpretations. It seems to me that if the 
M&S authors had intended this to mean that a literal had two 
components, they could have said that explicitly. My own reading of 
that sentence is that the language is considered to be implicit in 
the string, rather in the way that a poet might say that his language 
is part of his art.

The last sentence cited suggests to me that language-specificity is 
considered to be included in the notion of string matching, so that 
string-matching might (or might not) be language-sensitive; but that 
once that is determined, the RDF treats literals as strings relative 
to that notion of 'same string'.
