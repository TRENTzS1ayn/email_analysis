Sure. But language tags are something like properties. The only
issue here is that RDF is being obstinate and pretends they're not.

I observe this will just boil down to a truth table implemented in
code somewhere, not unlike the one Jeremy and I knocked together
last year, or if we're being good engineers, some kind of data
directed dispatch. And we still haven't got a clue as to how
applications are supposed to know what other applications are doing
or inferring with these un-properties. I thought we were supposed
to use RDF to get this kind of opacity out of code.
