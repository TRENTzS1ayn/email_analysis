There was no requirement in what we agreed that the range constraint 
property was rdfs:range or that value of the property was xsd:integer.

No.  What we decided leaves us free to use a different range property or 
xsd:integer.lex.

In my view, webont are a very important customer of our work.  When I took 
this on, I believed that the major challenge we faced is that RDF is trying 
to serve two masters, those who want a simple meta data language and those 
who want a formal foundation for it.  That's hard, but that is what we are 
trying to do.

At the very least we must not mess things up for webont to build on rdf.
