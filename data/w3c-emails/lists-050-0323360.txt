I did.  This has been extensively discussed before, including if, I recall 
correctly at the last face to face.  It seems I should have reminded folks 
though.  Apologies Pat.

I had assumed that the mapping would be applied just to the string part and 
ignore the language.

I recall that suggestion being made.  I don't recall it being explicitly 
rejected or the reasons for such rejection.  I accept that I perhaps should 
have pointed out the relation to xml:lang.
