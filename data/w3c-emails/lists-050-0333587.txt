What maze?  The WG decided at the f2f that literals are in fact a triple:

   <parsetype, lang-code, unicode-string>

The parseType is a single bit which indicates if the string came from a 
parseType="Literal" in the xml/syntax.  The lang-code is a short string 
from some iso standard that defines the language.  The string is the string.

Does this give the model theory problems Pat.
