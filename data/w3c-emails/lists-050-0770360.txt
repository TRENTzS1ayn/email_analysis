Pat,
all,

My review comments are attached in the form of an edited document with my 
embedded comments in red italic.  (They're also in square brackets in case 
the colour/italic doesn't come through for some.)

Many of my comments are editorial, trying to take the viewpoint of a 
non-logician approaching this material for the first time.  These comments 
may be heeded or disregarded as you see fit.

I thought the new material on vocabulary entailment was very enlightening.

NOTE:  I'm thinking the Strong Herbrand lemma is incorrect as stated.  See 
my comments in section 2.2 for a counter-example.
