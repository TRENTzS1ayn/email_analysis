Well, this might (for some appropriate definition of lex:integer):

     Bob ex:age _:1 .
     _:1 s:integer "10" .
     s:integer rdfs:range lex:integer .

Well, I don't know what you mean by "datatype-defining", but some means 
external to the RDF core would be used to define that the class associated 
with a URI has some specified class extension.  RDF itself has no way to 
define the actual meaning of any given URI, just rules which allow 
preservation of meaning to be determined.
