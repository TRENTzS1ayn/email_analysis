A little known fact, even among Brits, is that z-spelling is the Oxford 
English preferred form for many words of this form.

 From my online Concise English Dictionary:

serialize // v.tr. (also -ise)
1 publish or produce in instalments.
2 arrange in a series.
3 Mus. compose according to a serial technique.
serialization // n.
