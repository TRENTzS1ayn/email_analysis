I think I agree with all Jeremy is saying here.  In particular:

>I find two possibilities acceptable:

>+ having a plausible syntax for reification

I'm unsure which way I actually prefer at this point.

Where a "plausible syntax might be:

>I propose that we

..

On reflection, maybe there is a third possible way?  A syntactic variation 
of reification (e.g. rdf:reifyAs='...') that:
(a) does not add the statement triple to the graph, but
(b) adds the reification quad describing the statement to the graph, using 
the given identifier to label the statement node.

I think this achieves a key goal of reification, namely use without 
assertion, without being forced to code all the reification quads.

As this is out of scope for our current charter, it suggests to me that 
reification by rdf:ID be dropped for now, and (if desired) reconsidered for 
a future revision of the specification.  However, I think it is still worth 
defining the reification vocabulary, without special semantics, so there is 
some common basis for experimentation and future development.
