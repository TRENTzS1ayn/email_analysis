Well, there is a data model section in the Primer (which has been 
somewhat rewritten from what's there, but not posted to the Web site 
yet), and I think this is at least one of the places we intend to talk 
about it.

As an old "database guy", I'm perfectly happy with the idea of an "RDF 
data model" (and note that that was the way "RDF Model" was used in the 
M&S.  My plan is to also briefly describe the model theory in the Primer 
(in non-logician terms), and say something about the difference between 
these uses of the term "model".  I don't feel it's appropriate to cast 
around too far for another term to substitute for "data model" just 
because "model" is also used in "model theory".  "Data model" is a 
perfectly respectable usage in another (sub)discipline, and people who 
are going to deal with the Web in general, and the Semantic Web in 
particular, had better get used to the idea that a given word may have 
different meanings to people in different communities.  However, we need 
to make the distinction clear.

I think the Primer is certainly at least *one* place for the data model 
to be introduced.  However, that doesn't prevent its being explained in 
other documents as well.  Once we have some reasonable text, it could be 
replicated (or linked to, or expanded on) in other places.

I don't know that anything as short as a "paragraph" is going to get the job done.  
Why don't you have a look at what's in the Primer now (or I could send you the 
revision), and see if it's along the lines of what you had in mind?
