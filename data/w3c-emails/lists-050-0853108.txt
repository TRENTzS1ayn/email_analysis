http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20011101 is still the latest 
version that includes contributions from Aaron, Sean Palmer, Danbri and Frank.

Frank's description of the RDF data model can be found in 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20011221 but there are 
problems associated with the markup that have yet to be corrected.
