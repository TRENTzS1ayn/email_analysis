Slight correction.  The latter document isn't, strictly speaking,
"Frank's description of the RDF data model".  Instead, it's intended to
combine Aaron and Sean's intro and background material with my data
model material (somewhat reorganized), forming what I think may be a
reasonable start to the whole primer (less the XML syntax, and other
material from the first cited document).  Some of the issues regarding
how the Primer reads have to do with differences of opinion about the
intended function of the Primer (e.g., whether it needs to "sell" RDF or
not).  I have to admit being of Graham's persuation about a lot of
this.
