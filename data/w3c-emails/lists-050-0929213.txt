This issue was raised by DanC in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001JanMar/0029.html

in which he proposes replacing the name rdf:value with other names
such as rdf:toString; or asks for the name to be confirmed.

(The wording in the issue description
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-replace-value
 is probably out-of-date given later discussion of datatyping)

I propose that we do not change the name rdf:value and close this issue.

  1. Insufficient reasons to make this change
  2. Will causing an existing uses to be illegal - such as as
     the examples in M&S.

This proposal *does not* indicate how this name is *used*, merely
that the name in the RDF Namespace, will remain "value".  I see this
as tangental to resolution of datatyping issues.

If this issue is closed, no action need be made.

Dave
