This issue was raised by Jonathan Borden in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001JanMar/0082.html

and asks that RDF modifies the algorithm for generating URIs from the
pair of
  (XML Qnames, XML Namespace URIs) 
by looking at the last character of the Namespace URI and inserting
"#" sometimes.


I propose that we do not accept this suggestion and close this issue
on the following grounds:

  1. Such a change would be a major change to the mapping of
     RDF/XML syntax to the model and would be beyond our charter.

  2. It would cause the same RDF/XML to generate a different
     graph from existing versus revised implementations

  3. Existing code may generate wrong (illegal) graphs for some RDF/XML.


Aaron said this when we proposed closing this last time:

  ".. I strongly disagree with Borden's proposal, and don't believe
  there is a need for it. However, I _do_ feel there is a need for
  the Working Group to at least _explain_ why it has chosen to break
  compatibility with the URI spec and instead use some new thing some
  have termed URIviews."

Sergey said later in the thread:

  "I believe it could be merged with uri-substructure"

  -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0592.html


Sounds good to me.  That is, I further propose
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-uri-substructure
will be modified to require the explanation of the RDF use of URI(thingys).
