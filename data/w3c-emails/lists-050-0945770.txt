Raised by Stefan Kokkelink in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Aug/0085.html
 
and recorded in the issues list as:
 "Must a parser created bags of reified statements for all
  [rdf:]Description elements?"

I propose that the following resolution addresses and closes this issue:

  No, only those which are explicitly reified using an rdf:ID on a
  propertyElt or by an rdf:bagID on the rdf:Description.

and this can be demonstrated by the current syntax WD
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20011218/
which already explicitly defines when reified statements are generated
and I think matches this resolution.

No further actions should be needed.  This may be, except for test
cases, however any test case that includes an rdf:Description
implicitly tests for this.

Dave
