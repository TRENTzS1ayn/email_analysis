Given that I objected to the proposed resolution of this issue at the last
meeting I have been asked to provide an alternative resolution.


My proposal:

  An rdf:ID attribute is permissable on all property elements and always
refers to the resource that is the reification of the triple corresponding
to that property element.



Notes:
  - this allows rdf:ID and rdf:resource on the same property element which
is a change.
  - this favours a reading of the relevant contradiction in M&S in which
para232 is dropped and para214 is preferred.

Reasons for this are:
 - M&S is contradictory and has widely varying implementations of its
reification syntax.
 - This WG must resolve the contradiction.
 - My proposed resolution is very simple, and hence makes reification
significantly more usable, and less of a barrier to RDF take-up.

I will post a follow-up with some implementation details.
