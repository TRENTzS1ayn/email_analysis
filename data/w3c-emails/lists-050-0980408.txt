That is much more regular and simple.  I remember the first time I spotted 
para 232 and was 'surprised'.

I see no contradiction.  I see an overriding of a general rule in a 
specific case.

The original WG did not have to include the bit about ID in para232.  They 
could have said nothing.  The fact they did say something suggests to me 
that they MEANT to override para214.

In my view, what you propose is better than the original, but it is a 
change to the original spec, not a clarification of a contradiction.

Is that true of the common case?

That is over egging things a bit.  Do you really think the problems with 
reification lie in this obscure bit of syntax?
