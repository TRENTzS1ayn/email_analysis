Hi folks,

A happy new year to all and welcome back.  I hope you are doing better at 
swapping RDF context back in than I've been managing.

This is the usual call for agenda items for this Friday's telecon.  Please 
may I have suggestions by noon UK time, Thursday.

I see we have some syntax issues to discuss.  Graham, as I recall raised a 
question about the structure of the document set and there is still the 
question of datatypes.

Brian
