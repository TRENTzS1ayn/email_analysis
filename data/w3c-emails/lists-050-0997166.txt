I tend to agree with Jeremy here.  I think that being able to use the 
rdf:ID= syntax consistently to identify the subject of the reification 
quad, and to imply the presence of the quad statements in the graph, would 
make reification much more comfortable to use.

Much criticism of reification has been about the triple-bloat.  I expect 
that implementations can optimize the internal storage of triples to 
overcome this;  Jeremy's proposal makes a similar optimization available in 
the XML-serialized form.
