Ugh. Groan. 

URI inspection is URI inspection, and even beyond that, we're talking about
some arbitrary list of URIs that applications which may have no use for
must track and natively support just to be able to know what is or
is not an asserted triple in RDF. And with every addition to the list,
software has to be updated to keep on top of what is *true* in the RDF
graph!

Argh, are you folks for real? Yikes!

Hack, hack, hack, hack hack...

Blech!

(I'd add some smileys, but I really just can't believe I'm reading this...)
