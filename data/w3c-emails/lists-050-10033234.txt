I haven't been following e-mail this week, and so I pick
up the thread. I haven't yet read the content pages (the actual
proposal).

I am procedurally uncomfortable. I suspect I almost certainly agree
with the proposal, but I oppose it nevertheless.

While our charter makes noises about RDF being the foundation of the SW,
it is clear that there is not yet any consensus in the SW community
about layering. If we determine that we are required by our charter
to forge that consensus then we will need to get buy-in not only
from the DL community (who we believe may be relunctant) but also
from the rules and trust community; who as far as I can tell are not 
even committed to the open world assumption.

Pat and Guha's proposal is ambitious and worthy of discussion but
RDF Core is the wrong forum. The discussion should take a year or so
not a matter of days.

We should, IMO, indicate our worries about the non-monotonicity of
dark triples back to webont; we should indicate that we have a new
proposal for an axiomatic treatment, and listen.

I don't believe either wg is the right forum for the layering
debate. I think it is important to involve people who are in 
neither group.


See you all soon.

Jeremy
