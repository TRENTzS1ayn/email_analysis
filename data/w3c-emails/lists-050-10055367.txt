I've just been reminded of this:

The RDFS spec is currently out of sync with the old document we
find at the RDFS namespace. I'd like to get this fixed, by our
resolving to request W3C update the doc at our rdfs namespace uri to
be from the current RDFS WD.

Brian, can we have some hopefully small amount of time on this tommorrow?

Dan
