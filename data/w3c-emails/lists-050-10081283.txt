I drafted this after the f2f session, pat tweaked it slightly. Sent here
for future reference. This was a side discussion I wanted to put on the
record, ie not a formal outcome of that discussion

Proposal re rdfms-assertion:


orig draft by danbri, after f2f discussion [
The RDFCore WG takes the view that RDF/XML documents, ie. encodings of
RDF graphs, are represenations of claims or assertions about the world.
RDF graphs may be true or false. A combination of social (eg. legal) and
technical (protocols, file formats, publication frameworks) machinery
provide the Web community with environments for asserting (and denying)
such claims. It is beyond the scope of RDF Core to enumerate these.
Instead, we note that RDF graphs are the kind of things that
can be true or false (rather than 'mere bytes').
For each linear syntax of RDF, there will be conventions
(social, legal) for indicating which chunks of data are encodings of
RDF graphs in that syntax, and thus of propositional content. A
media type, application/rdf+xml has been registered for indicating
RDF/XML in this way.
]

as tweaked by path:
[
The RDFCore WG takes the view that RDF/XML documents, ie. encodings of
RDF graphs, can be used to make representations of claims or assertions
 about the world. RDF graphs may be asserted to be true, and such an
assertion should be understood to have the same social import
as an assertion in any other format. A combination of
social (eg. legal) and technical (protocols, file formats, publication
frameworks) machinery
provide the contexts which fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary
of some piece of RDF, and which distinguish assertions from other uses
(eg citations, denals or illustrations.)
A media type, application/rdf+xml has been registered for indicating
the use of RDF/XML as an assertional representation in this way.
