                     For the RDF Community to answer...

Question 1:

Given the RDF graph:

<rdf:RDF
    xmlns:rdf  ="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns      ="uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#">

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Jenny">
       <ex:age>10</ex:age>
    </rdf:Description>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Film">
       <ex:title>10</ex:title>
    </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

Which of the following most accurately captures the meaning
expressed in the above graph?

    1. Jenny's age and the Film's title are the same thing
       which is represented lexically by the string "10".

    2. Jenny's age and the Film's title are both the
       string "10".

    3. Jenny's age and the Film's title are (potentially)
       different things which are represented lexically
       by the same string.

    4. All RDF Core WG members are bogshitters.

Question 2:

Given the RDF graph:

<rdf:RDF
    xmlns:rdf  ="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
    xmlns:rdfs ="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
    xmlns      ="uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#">

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#age">
       <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#integer"/>
    </rdf:Description>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Jenny">
       <age>10</age>
    </rdf:Description>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Bob">
       <age>
          <rdf:Description>
             <integer>10</integer>
          </rdf:Description>
       </age>
    </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

Which of the following most accurately captures the meaning
expressed in the above graph?

    1. Jenny's age and Bob's age are the same thing, which
       is represented lexically by the string "10".

    2. Jenny's age and Bob's age are both the string "10".

    3. Jenny's age is the string "10" and Bob's age is
       something which is represented lexically by the
       string "10".

    4. All RDF Core WG members are bogshitters.
