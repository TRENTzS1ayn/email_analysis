I forwarded this message from Patrick without reviewing it, as the network 
access at the face to face prevented Patrick accessing his own mail server.

I have received an offlist message suggesting that the language it 
contained was inappropriate for this WG.  I concur and appologise.  I am 
embarrassed to have this message, sent from my mail account, in the archive.
