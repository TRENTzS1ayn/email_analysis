Regarding

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jun/0181.html

Firstly, apologies for any offense caused by any content of that
message, and sincerest apologies to Brian for making him an unwilling
acomplice to my use of questionable language.

Even though the two questions with multiple choice answers did contain
a lame attempt at humor, I was actually quite serious about the form
in which the two entailments of concern are presented.

Thus, removing the fourth answer in both cases, I think they represent
an effective way to query the community about their expectations regarding
tidyness without forcing them to understand the brutal details.

Regards,

Patrick
