Before we close this issue, I insist that we add a new issue to deal with
the semantics of rdf:value, which many implementers and users and been
confused about.  I will not vote to close this issue until a new issue is
added to the issues list. Here's a proposed piece of text for the issues
list:

Issue rdf-semantics-of-value: Clarify the semantics of the rdf:value
property.

raised Fri, 09 Jan 2002 by Aaron Swartz

Summary: The property rdf:value is used confusingly and inconsistently
throughout the M&S and is never defined. Some have suggested it is used for
multi-valued properties (some suggest currying is a better way to do this)
and others have claimed it is for defining the lexical representation of a
resource. It is requested that the Working Group clarify its meaning and
usage.

Currently: for discussion
