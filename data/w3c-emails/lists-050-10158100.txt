To be fair, I think some "contextual" information ought to be documented 
in the archive (which it will be when this message is archived):  while 
it may be reasonable to be concerned about certain "questionable 
language" appearing in WG email (and the archive), it needs to be 
understood that the "questionable" term was, in fact, used a fair bit in 
certain verbal discussions of examples at the RDF Core F2F, and thus it 
wasn't arbitrarily introduced into the discussion by Patrick (i.e., 
Patrick was continuing in email a discussion that had started verbally). 
  If the fact that the term was used in verbal discussion reflects badly 
on the WG, "TS" (you can contact me privately if you don't know what 
that means!)
