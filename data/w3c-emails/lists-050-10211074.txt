I will admit up front I have done a poor job of following the datatypes 
discussion, but perhaps that will allow me to point out places where 
things are not clear.

It seems to me that we would not want B and C to be yes. We would want B 
alone to be yes. It would be helpful to explicitly state that this is 
not possible.

A nit is that QNames in N-Triples should not have <>s around them, 
because then they look like new URI schemes. I think it would be clearer 
to say:
    <ageInYears> rdfs:range xsd:decimal .

Another question that comes to mind is whether we can have:

Test D2:
   <Jenny>      <ageInYearsDecimalNumeral> "10" .
   <ageInYearsDecimalNumeral > rdfs:range xsd:decimal .
   <ageInYearsDecimalNumeral>  rdfd:abstract <ageInYears> .
   xsd:decimal rdfd:concrete xsdr:decimal .

   <John>  <ageInYears>      _:a .
   _:a     <xsdr:decimal>   "10" .

Which seems to avoid the overloading of the previous. Then I could use 
simple inference rules to transform the former into the latter. This is 
how I approach the similar problem in something like authorName vs. 
author.

N3 Rule:
{?thing ?prop ?num . ?prop rdfs:range ?range . ?prop rdfd:abstact ?abs . 
?range rdfd:concrete ?valprop } => { ?thing ?abs _:a . _:a ?valprop 
?num } .

Otherwise this seems to be a good summary.
