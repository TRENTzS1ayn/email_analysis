We should perhaps encourage lots of answers, just (B) or (D) and perhaps
provide a form to fill in, e.g.

[[[
To simply have your opinion counted sent an empty message with subject
either "B" or "D" to www-rdf-comments. We also would like to know any
reasons given for preference, and considered opinions from other groups,
please send those also to www-rdf-comments under the subject "RDF
Datatypes".
