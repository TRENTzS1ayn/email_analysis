It's been a busy week, and I've lost my context.  I think I may have got 
myself confused about the "direction" of monotonicity here.  My concerns 
were that expectations about the meaning of "basic" RDF constructs may be 
confounded.

<aside>
My recollection is that I was considering the effect of such an addition on 
a subgraph like:
   <ex:Jenny> <ex:age> "10" .
   <ex:Joe> <ex:age> _:x .
   _:x <xsd:string> "10" .
   <ex:age> <rdfd:rangedatatype> <xsd:integer> .
which may be true under some interpretation, but in the presence of the 
additional subProperty the enlarged subgraph could be false under the same 
interpretation.  But I see that was just me confusing myself about 
monotonicity.
