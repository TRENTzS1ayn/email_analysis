What is this 'xsdr:'? This should be 'xsd:decimal'.

Again, should be 'xsd:decimal'

Again, should be xsd:decimal

Test A can be considered true regardless whether the objects are taken
to be strings or values.

You could add:

And no datatype value is provided to any RDF application, only the
string, and it is not specified at the RDF level what is meant by
the string "10" -- i.e. whether Jenny's age actually is the number 10
or (oddly but possibly) the string "10".

Note that the use of rdfs:range in this fashion follows from normal
usage of RDF Schema semantics. I.e. this approach does not constitute
an extension to RDF or RDF Schema in order to provide for global
datatyping constraints.

You might better make the choice between C and D, as their distinction
is IMO clearer.

And the deadline for replies?
