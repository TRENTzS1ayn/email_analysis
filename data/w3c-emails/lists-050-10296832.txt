One additional suggestion:

I think it's enough to restrict the inquiry to only tests C and D.

The tests A and B are less illustrative of the core distinction
between tidy and untidy interpretation of literals, and C and D
will suffice to give users a clear picture of the distinction,
enough (hopefully) to make a choice.

Otherwise, folks could wonder why A can agree with either
interpretation and may get confused about the distinction between
A and B which is minor but makes B seem to be similar to A, etc.

So I recommend that we remove A and B and re-label C and D as
1 and 2 (or T and U) and make the feedback a simple vote
between the two (with optional comments).

Cheers,

Patrick
