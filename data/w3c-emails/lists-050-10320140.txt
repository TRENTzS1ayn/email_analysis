Well, both (1) and (2) violate this principle, but at least the
violation of (1) is far less severe, and far more generic, so to
that extent (1) is to be strongly preferred to (2).

This cannot work since qnames are not present in the graph, and I'm
presuming that the 'darkness' must be determinable based on the graph.

So unless we are also employing some mechanism of the graph syntax
to flag unasserted triples, any information embodied in qnames
(namespace prefixes) will be lost.

Though, if you mean that the encoding is part of the local name, then
I don't see then how (3) differs any from (2).

So (1) seems the only reasonable option.

A possible starting point for the definition of the log: URI scheme
could be

http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pstickler-uri-01.txt

Simply replace 'uri:' with 'log:'.

Thus, just as URI reification is an encapsulation of a URI, so
also would darkening simply be an encapsulation of a URI, and
that would permit the use of the same term in both asserted
and unasserted statements.

Question: do we want to call it 'log:'? Does that really capture
the notion of unassertedness or darkness?

Well, the decision procedure for the WG might be trivial, but the
application of that decision could be anything but trivial (though
I don't think it should be).
