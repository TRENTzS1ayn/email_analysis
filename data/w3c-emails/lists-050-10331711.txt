Note that this approach is also risk-free if dark triples turn out
to not be needed, since it is not adding any new functionality to
RDF, but only making the existing machinery for expressing unasserted
statements more palatable on the RDF/XML side.

Thus, RDF-only applications don't have to worry about asserted
statements that actually are dark and should be treated as unasserted,
and we don't need any new URI scheme, and we don't need reserved
vocabularies that can be identified generically, etc. etc. etc.

Yes, I know we already made a decision on this, but the above
approach is IMO so much better that it behooves the WG to consider
it seriously.
