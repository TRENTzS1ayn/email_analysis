In general, looks good. One comment:

I think that section 3.1 Namespaces should be left out, and the
only place where namespaces are mentioned is the Syntax spec,
as that is the only context where they are relevant.

Also, in the sections that list the RDF vocabulary, we should
include full URIs and not qnames.

Cheers,

Patrick
