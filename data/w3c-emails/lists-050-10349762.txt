By namespaces we meant the binding of rdf to a uri prefix.

This is not just a syntax issue since it would change all the documents.

The expected content of section 3.1 is something like:

[[[

RDF uses the following URI prefixes, which correspond to namespaces in the
RDF/XML serialization:

  rdf  http://www.w3.org/....#
  rdfs http://www.w3.org/....#

  NOTE: The RDF namespace prefix is unchanged since RDF Model & Syntax. We
actively seek feedback ...

In general, looks good. One comment:

I think that section 3.1 Namespaces should be left out, and the
only place where namespaces are mentioned is the Syntax spec,
as that is the only context where they are relevant.

Also, in the sections that list the RDF vocabulary, we should
include full URIs and not qnames.

Cheers,

Patrick
