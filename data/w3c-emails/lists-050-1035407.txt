There has been a call by Graham to finalize the Datatyping primer
generally as-is with only the S idioms defined.

I am calling for the inverse, for S to be removed from the primer
and the P and D (DAML) idioms defined as the recommended/official
idioms for global and local typing of literals.

Perhaps we need to have a brief discussion about this?

(I do hope that Graham is able to make the concall...)

Cheers,

Patrick
