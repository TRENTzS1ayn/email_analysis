I have been reviewing M&S to see which parts of it are:
- not currently in any of our new specs
- have not been decided to be dropped

These sections appear to be candidates for inclusion in the new top-level
document, fulfilling its dustbin role.

The main content is to do with vocabulary, particularly:
- containers
- reification
- rdf:value

I understand that we are maintaining M&S containers but without formal
semantic support and hence somewhere we need informal but normative text
corresponding to para 90.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#90

I understand that we are maintaining reification but clarifying it as
supporting the provenance use case (and hence 'stating' rather than
'statement'). As such text corresponding to M&S section 4 is needed - (all
subject to complete rewrite).
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#higherorder

I do not understand what we are doing with rdf:value, but there is a lot of
legacy which is based on stuff written in M&S and we should, IMO, carry some
of that text forward even if we deprecate it.
e.g. show some of the use cases.


While this stuff might belong in the schema specification, the current
schema draft appears to want to be very conservative and not suggest
semantics that are not in the model theory.
e.g.
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containervocab
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_value

Assuming that we do want to carry such intent from M&S forward, and that the
new document is the right home for that intent, then Graham and I were
thinking of putting it within the document structure as follows (section 5):

1. Introduction
2. RDF overview
* as before *
3. RDF specification
3.1 - 3.4
3.5 RDF vocabulary definitions
3.5.1 RDF defined vocabulary terms
pointer to section 5
3.6 RDF datatyping
3.7 Test cases
3.8 Primer
4. RDF Graphs
* text more or less as already suggested
on formal definition of RDF graph *
5. Informal Semantics of Some RDF Vocabulary
5.1 Containers
5.2 Reification
5.3 rdf:value
6. Additional technical considerations
6.1 Internationalization
6.2 Character normalization
6.3 Conformance
6.4 RDF in HTML
7. Acknowledgments
