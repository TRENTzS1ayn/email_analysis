Jeremy--

I don't necessarily have any objections to what you propose, but it 
would help a lot if you could consider what is now in the Primer, or 
already targeted for the Primer, and suggest how you think these 
proposals ought to affect the Primer, when considering these things. 
For example:

a.  the Primer already has text on containers
b.  the Primer already has a fair bit of text on schema
c.  the Primer already has a section (yet to be filled in) on reification
d.  the WG said it wanted something in the Primer to explain rdf:value

I'm starting to "lose state" as to how this new document and the Primer 
relate to each other.  In any event, let's try to address potential 
overlap up front.

PS:  Just to head off this answer, I don't think a idea like "the new 
document has informal but normative text while the Primer has 
non-normative text" is a reasonable distinction to make if there is 
going to be a lot of overlap in the coverage of the two documents, since 
that would leave us with a given issue being covered by text that is 
[formal,normative], [informal,normative], and [informal,non-normative], 
which sounds a tad dangerous.  I thought the reason why people wanted 
the Primer to be non-normative in the first place was because the text 
was informal.
