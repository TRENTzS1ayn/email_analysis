I agree that we want to avoid overlap.  I see the new document as focusing 
on being about "what" RDF expressions mean, where the primer focuses more 
on "how to" use RDF.  Also, I think the Primer should focus mainly on the 
features of RDF that we expect to be commonly used:  to convey a solid 
understanding of the RDF features that the majority of users will need to 
understand.

I'm pushing to move quickly on the new document, to catch up with the state 
of the others ASAP, so some of the details aren't completely finalized at 
this time.  Thanks for bringing up these specific points (my answers below).

No doubt Jeremy will answer for himself, but I thought that what he meant 
by "informal" was "non-mathematical" -- or a formal prose 
specification.  That is short, terse text focusing on what the vocabulary 
is intended to mean rather than how to use it.

With respect to your points:

>a.  the Primer already has text on containers
>b.  the Primer already has a fair bit of text on schema
>c.  the Primer already has a section (yet to be filled in) on reification
>d.  the WG said it wanted something in the Primer to explain rdf:value

I personally think the explanatory text about (a) and (b) will continue to 
have a place in the Primer, and that any text in the new document should be 
kept very tight.  I think item (c) doesn't really belong in the Primer 
according to my understanding of its primary purpose.  As for item (d), I 
think it comes down to the group's decision about what to do with rdf:value 
-- if it has a central place in RDF usage, then the primer should have some 
coverage.  Otherwise, I'd advocate dropping it from the Primer.  Currently, 
the situation seems to be the latter.
