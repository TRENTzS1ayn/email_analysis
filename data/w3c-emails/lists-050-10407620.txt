I think this distinction will be lost on those outside of this group
trying to get their heads around RDF.  Often times what people are
trying to say helps determine use. I'm concerned that splitting this
notion over 2 documents may be seen as more confusing than helpful.

I'm reluctant to say more until I get a chance to read the f2f minutes,
talk to the chairs and learn more about the rationale behind this new
document and its anticipated relationship to the other working drafts.
