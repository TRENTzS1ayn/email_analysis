Actually, for the same reason, isn't this a "yes"? Because the non-dark
statements are a strict subset of the antecedent?

To be honest, I think examples like this are why we should have an
explicit, not implicit name-based, darkening mechanism. At the F2F I was
in favour of it, but the more I think about it the more it seems like a
mistake to key this off property names. Some explicit syntax mechanism
(either Patrick's, or an "rdf:asserted='True'" or such) seems much less
error-prone... particularly if we can provide a little more sugar by
having shorthand constructs (daml:collection) that normally produce some
darkened triples do that "by default".
