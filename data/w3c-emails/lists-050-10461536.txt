Hang on, you've spotted the get-out (that the thing in quotes is a
Literal, but not an xsd:string), but given that I fail to see why the
above entailment should not hold. Unless the datatyping proposal gives a
uniform treatment to _all_ xsd datatypes, I can't see how we can vote in
favour of it. If we have to accept non-regularity in datatyping then
there are far simpler approaches that support the xsd types "natively"
and other types using a daml-like construct that seem much more natural.
