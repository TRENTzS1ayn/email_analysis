The intent of the new document is not to displace or overlap the intended 
Primer function, but to pick up a number of topics for which there wasn't a 
sensible home and to relieve pressure to use the Primer as the "dustbin" 
for things that don't fit anywhere else.  The style of this new document 
should be very different.

Anyway, rather than spin in abstract discussion, can I suggest that we 
resolve this in light of real documents?  I think we are on track to have 
the first cut of content for the new document ready by the end of this 
week.  Then I think it will be easier to see whether there is any 
gratuitous overlap.
