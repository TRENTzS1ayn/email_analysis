I do not understand what that is supposed to mean, and would strongly 
suggest that we do not make any informal text normative. If we wish 
to make some aspect of containers normative, then lets put that 
aspect into the model theory, which is the normative account of RDF 
meaning. The reason there is no formal semantic support for the M&S 
text on containers is because that text is simply incoherent: the 
intent that it expresses *cannot* be rendered in RDF, for essentially 
logical reasons. Rdf:Bags *cannot possibly* be bags. It seems to me 
to be a serious error to put into the spec as a normative passage 
something that is provably impossible given the rest of the spec.

OK, provided it is careful to not support, and preferably to 
explicitly repudiate, the content of paragraphs 93/94, which are in 
direct contradiction to paragraph 92.

Please take care to not use the term 'higher-order' in the context, 
which was a disastrous misuse of terminology in M&S.

Which is entirely appropriate, seems to me, in fact the only rational 
choice. I do not mean to suggest that the MT should rule the WG, but 
that if the MT as it stands does not reflect the intent of the WG , 
then it - the MT - should be brought in line with that intent. BUt 
there is no point in even having a precise semantics if the spec 
itself ignores that precision in its normative prose. Under these 
circumstances I would suggest simply abandoning the model theory 
altogether and reverting to the use of informal prose descriptions of 
meaning.

I do not think that any part of the final spec should express as 
normative any aspect of RDF meaning which is not reflected in the 
model theory. To do so makes the model theory worthless.
