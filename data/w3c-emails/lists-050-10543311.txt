Because the value of dc:title can always be chosen to not be an 
xsd:string and still satisfy the first triple. Those interpretations 
will block the entailment.

Well, I agree. If the literals in the graph really are 3-tuples, then 
ALL of the datatyping debate - all of which was under the false 
assumption that literals were items in datatype lexical spaces, ie 
strings - has been rendered moot. We simply don't have datatyping in 
RDF graphs, with these literals: it's meaningless. The 3-tuple 
<1,"10","french"> isn't in the lexical space of any XSL datatype.

I'd like to know the details of them. We have considered the daml 
ideas before, at length, and they were resoundingly rejected by the 
WG.
