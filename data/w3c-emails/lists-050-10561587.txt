You misunderstand; I'm not talking about an in-RDF (Guha's "same
syntax") mechanism- I'm talking about explicitly flagging triples as
dark using something like

<rdf:Descrpition rdf:about="eg:foo">
  <eg:blah rdf:dark="yes">wibble</eg:blah>
</rdf:Description>

rather than implicitly by examining the property URI.

The burden on users and implementers, I think, is going to be there
regardless. For the most part it can probably be made "invisible" to
users by, for instance, having the daml:colleciton spit out
appropriately-darkened triples (ie, a little bit of sugar in the right
place).

PS. Why I came to this conclusion is that I posed a simple example and
got two sets of answers, neither of which was 100% accurate. I think
things like the subproperty malarky are almost certainly going to crop
up. I'd be happier if the presence of a darkening URI _anywhere_ in a
triple caused the triple to be dark; although I've heard that that has
problems too.
