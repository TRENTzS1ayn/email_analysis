Urk! I had read the datatyping proposal with the notion that

jenny eg:age _:a .
_:a xsd:int "10" .

used some f:Literal->XSD lexical space such that f(<1, "10", null>) =
"10" - ie, that trivial, unlanguage-tagged, unxmlised literals were
being used for their mapping to the XSD datatype lexical space.

Apologies for terminological confusion in that last sentence.

This is an aside, so I'll follow up with it separately.
