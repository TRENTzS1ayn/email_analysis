I appreciate this has been endlessly debated and offer an apology in
advance to the chairs (and other participants!), but...

Thinking about the xml:lang issue, I recall the xml:base and namespace
issues which seem somewhat similar. In particular, there were questions
raised about xml fragments "inheriting" xml:base and namespaces
from their surrounding RDF/XML, and some kind of fragment trick that
produced a surrounding tag carrying all the information, ie

<xml:something xmlns:blah="..." xml:base="...">
 the content went here
</xml:something>

Would it not be simpler to say that

<property xml:lang="fr">chat</property>

was a syntactic shorthand for something like

<property rdf:parsetype="Literal">
<xml:something xml:lang="fr">char</xml:something>
</property>

? - in other words, punt the language tag into the XML realm, keep
literals as simple strings (or the string representation of XML content)
and make Pat happier?

This has been done to death, but I've had a scan back and I don't recall
this coming up before - further apologies if it has already been raised.
