I'm sorry; I was under the impression that the light and dark universes
pretty much never collided (ie, that the result of that merge would be a
graph* with one light triple, and one dark triple, the components of
each being the same): that is, when drawing RDF, I'd need two different
coloured pens.

If a triple is _either_ light or dark, but not both, then sure, ok, I'll
shut up.
