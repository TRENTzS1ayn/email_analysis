We differ.

It is true that it is a change; but we are required to change contradictory
text.

This is one of the problems.
My personal preference is to drop reification entirely; I am not yet ready

usable, within the constraints of our charter.
I feel very unhappy with keeping reification if we do not address any of the
problems with it.
