I have updated the face to face page

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020617-f2f/

to include a list of actions and decisions taken at the meeting and to 
point to the irc logs.

This is all I currently plan to do as minutes of the meeting.

I've also included a number of pictures I took.  If anyone has anyone has 
any objection to any of the images, please let me know and I'll remove it.

Brian
