I disagree:  I say there are two instances of eg:blah in the merged graph 
-- one is dark, the other is not.  The one that is not dark is not darkened 
by the one that is.  I thought you had accepted (or acknowledged) this 
interpretation during thew F2F discussion.

Yes, this presumes an extension to the graph syntax as currently defined.
