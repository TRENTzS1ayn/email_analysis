Well, maybe we have to do this, but I sure would like it to be kept 
to a minimum. Its OK to have some stuff along the lines Tim wants 
talking about the social meaning, but lets keep anything to do with 
what might be called mechanical meaning (eg what a bag is) either in 
the MT or not anywhere. Im quite willing to tweak the MT to fit 
anything that makes sense, but I really think that we shouldn't put 
out a spec that says on the one hand that the MT is the semantics, 
but also that parts of the language have a different meaning that is 
only described in M&S-style prose.
