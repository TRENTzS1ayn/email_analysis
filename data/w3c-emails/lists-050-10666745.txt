Well, what I meant by _no_ was that if there is any way at all of 
asserting it, then someone somewhere is going to hack a way of not 
asserting it, and then someone else is going to find a way to add it, 
and then....

I guess I have great respect for the creativity of users to find a 
way to break almost any spec that is breakable. For evidence, read 
the recent thread on RDF logic about how to provide urirefs for graph 
arcs. For more evidence, consider the fact that the Stanford DAML 
reasoning engine has an (illegal, but..) 'unassert' command built 
into it.

Well, I guess it depends on how cynical you are :-)
