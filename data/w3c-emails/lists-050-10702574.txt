Pat,

I get very nervous if we feel that we have to be responsible for every way 
that users might mis-use our specifications.  Without doubt, if it gains 
any kind of widespread currency the Semantic Web will contain faulty 
reasoners, and we'll have to learn to cope with them (e.g. having some 
framework --possibly localized-- for deciding what to trust).  The points 
you make seem to me to be no more or less than faulty reasoners.
