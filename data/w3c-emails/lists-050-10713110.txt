Fair enough -- indeed I broadly agree.

I suggest that Jeremy and I draft some words in the new RDF document, then 
--with real text on the table-- we coordinate on agreeing what is needed 
and transplanting it to its rightful home.

This is not about describing a *different* meaning, but about adding prose 
to capture additional refinements of *intended* meaning that cannot be 
expressed in the formalism available.  Without doubt, the formal semantics 
is king, and I agree that the various aspects of meaning should ideally be 
in the same document.

Jeremy in particular has done a very useful job of reviewing the existing 
specs and issues and identifying possible gaps in the coverage.  If the new 
document becomes a staging post for new text before it finds its way into 
some more appropriate document, then I think that's a Good Thing.

For myself, I'm very keen to push ahead and prepare text because I believe 
that's more productive than talking about issues.  The group can then 
decide (a) if the text is correct, (b) if it's useful, and (c) where, if 
anywhere, it belongs.
