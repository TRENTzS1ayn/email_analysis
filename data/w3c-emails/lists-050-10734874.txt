We don't *want* them, they are just true!
Or maybe I've been talking to Peter too much!

Any interpretation of any 

> >aaa [rdfs:range] yyy
> >yyy [rdfs:subClassOf] zzz


is an interpretation of

> >aaa [rdfs:range] zzz


thus the closure rule holds.

(Not) Proof:

Ahh, it depends on rdfs:range not being in the domain of discourse.
neglecting that little factette and invalidating the proof ...

Whenever 
iii aaa jjj .
then
jjj [rdf:type] yyy .
hence
jjj [rdf:type] zzz .

hence

aaa [rdfs:range] zzz .

I smell danger.
