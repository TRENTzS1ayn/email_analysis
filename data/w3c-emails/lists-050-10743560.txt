I saw in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Jun/0178.html

that you argued against Jos for the truth of basic set theoretic facts from
nothing.

My range and domian rules seem to me to be of a similar truth status. (There may
be a choice, and that choice depends upon how we regard the representation of
logical facts within the domain of discourse. Given that webont wants to be able
to represent such facts without having to explicitly assert them, then shouldn't
we be taking the same position in RDF Core too?)
