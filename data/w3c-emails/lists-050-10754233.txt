At the f2f one of the postponed issues that I wished to advocate reopening was:

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-syntax-incomplete

In particular, given the amount of change we have made I think a small change to
rectify the bnode serialization problem should be considered.

However we were out of time, and so I have decided to raise this by e-mail.

This is primarily motivated for me by Jena development.
Within Jena we have repeated user requirement to enable round-tripping.

e.g. one of our summer students yesterday said words like: "we use N-triple as
our transport becuase bNodes are important."

Since we are not proposing N-triple as a standard, we do have some obligation to
make RDF/XML useable.

I propose that we should modify the RDF/XML syntax to permit bNode labels
"_:foo" wherever we currently permit URI refs.

This still leaves non-standard property names as non-serializable, but that is
much less of a problem in practice.

Modify:
[[[
5.23 Production URI-reference
An attribute ?string-value? interpreted as a URI reference defined in Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URI) [URIS] BNF production URI-reference.

uses of URI-reference should have the name changed to resource-reference and
then


Production resource-reference

Production URI-reference

as before


Production bNode-reference

An attribute ?string-value? matching "_:<NCName>". (where NCName is the
production from XML Namespaces). The string value gives a bNode identifier with
file scope as for NTriple.
