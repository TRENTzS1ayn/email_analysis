It has been suggested that allocating a new URI scheme is a "big thing", 
like creating a new top level domain, and is best avoided if possible.

Who is an expert on  URI syntax - is the second ":" in (2) legal?  What 
about the  second "//"?  I assume so since no one has barfed yet.  We could 
just duck the second "http://" and it would still work.

I don't understand 3.  Could someone give an example.
