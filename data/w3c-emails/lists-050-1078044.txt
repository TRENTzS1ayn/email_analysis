For the record, I didn't so much issue a "call" as "asked the question":
[[[
For the rest of the group, my question is this:  do we just tidy up the "S" 
proposal and go with it, or do we need to discuss the alternatives?  I 
think proposal "S" works pretty well.  (If the latter, we would need 
descriptions of the alternatives to match Sergey's section 4, in particular 
showing how they work with the model theory.)

I don't object to discussion...

>(I do hope that Graham is able to make the concall...)

So do I ;-)  If I don't, I think I've said most of what I have to say in my 
response to you;  in summary, by my understanding:
- S does (or can) match current RDF usage and idiom, and
- S does not require any difficult changes to the model theory
