Eric,

My interpretation of the discussion and decision from the face to face was 
that the WG felt there were a number of things without a proper home, e.g. 
the graph syntax definition.  I confess I've felt for some time that the 
asymetry of having a schema spec, but nothing similar for the rdf model 
indicated a problem.

The decision we made, as I recall it, was to sketch out the contents of a 
document to describe the, oh I want to use the term "model", but Pat will 
jump on me if I do and I don't have a better word for it yet, but I hope 
you know what I mean.  The idea in my mind is that we look at that plan and 
see if it makes sense.

Another option we rejected was to combine this document with the schema 
spec, an option we might reconsider when we see the contents.

We were aware of the impact this might have on the schedule when we 
discussed this.

Brian
