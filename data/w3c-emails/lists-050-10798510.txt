Reviewing the issue document (as of 16 Jun) I note that a couple of items 
on the "issues postponed" list seem to have been resolved by the current WG:

- rdfms-abouteachprefix:  has been discarded, no?
- rdf-containers-otherapproaches:  we've just decided to include a 
daml:collection like syntax

I suggest these be regarded as closed.
