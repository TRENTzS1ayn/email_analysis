The current stake-in-the-ground WD, and all recent examples
in WG discussions use 'xsd:' so I would think we have decided
that yes, we can use the standard xsd URIs for datatype
properties.

Having the two different namespace prefixes could simply
confuse folks, especially since 'xsdr:' is both fictional
and undefined in the inquiry.
