The problem with B is that, intuitively, "10" denotes the integer
value 10 in both cases, and therefore folks may be confused as
to what is being equated, the literal value or the datatype value.
In either case, they are the same. "10" = "10". 10 = 10.

E.g. some folks might in fact change their answer if you were
to use "10" and "10.0" or "0010".

The C test better reflects the istinction between tidy and
untidy semantics, because, even though the literals are string
equal, they intuitively denote different datatype values, so
that will force folks to consider which of the two (lexical
form or value) they are equating. Thus, while "10" = "10",
10 != "10".

Again, I recommend that you make the choice between tests C
and D.
