not true; see comments from Sergey a long time ago about
the cost of untidy literals in RDF/database systems.

Sorry I don't have time to find it.

The swap/cwm implementation would suffer a significant
efficiency hit if literals weren't tidy.

esp in def loadToStore(store, addr):

    store.storeQuad((store._experience,
                     store.semantics,
                     store.intern((SYMBOL, addr)),
                     store.intern((FORMULA, addr + "#_formula" ))))
