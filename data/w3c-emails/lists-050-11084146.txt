I guess a number of questions are raised by Pat's message:
(a) has enough new information been provided to reopen the issue?
(b) do we agree that literals-as-tuples is ugly?
(c) do we agree that extending the graph syntax to allow literals as 
subjects is desirable?

Regarding (a), I think the answer is procedurally based rather than 
technically based, and don't have a view.  My remaining comments are 
predicated on the group and/or chair deciding the answer is yes.

Regarding (b), I tend to agree, but I've yet to understand fully why this 
is such a serious issue as Pat suggests.

Regarding (c), I think that allowing literals as subjects in the graph 
syntax would be a natural and useful thing, and in the absence of 
procedural considerations would wholeheartedly support such a move.  In 
saying this, I presume it's understood that not all well-formed graphs can 
be represented in the RDF/XML syntax, but that's nothing new -- we already 
have that situation.

If (c) is accepted, then I think it reasonable that some other issues be 
reconsidered in light of that.
