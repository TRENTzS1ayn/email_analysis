Well, not exactly. We tried to formally express it (the Bag part) and 
discovered that it didn't really make sense. That is, the items in a 
bag are in a fixed order in RDF, and there's just no way of getting 
around that. We should be careful not to give the opposite impression 
in the text.

Im quite willing to have text along these 'intended meanings' lines 
in the MT, with appropriate caveats about entailments. In fact I 
think that is where it should go, so as to avoid any impression that 
the different parts of the spec are disagreeing with one another. Of 
course it can go somewhere else as well :-)

Agreed.

OK, similar remarks to above. I think the latest draft of the MT does 
have prose like this in it, in fact: maybe it needs expanding some.

Lets not go there, I agree. But then lets also not *pretend* we have 
gone there when we havn't, I guess is my chief concern.
