I don't see that they are. In fact, your entailments aren't even 
valid, because two different classes can have the same class 
extension. I see range and domain as being particular individual 
classes 'attached' to a property. That attachment needn't be 
inherited under superset.

So its not just a matter of asserting things with no antecedents (the 
closure rules already do a lot of that), but what things should be 
asserted at all.
