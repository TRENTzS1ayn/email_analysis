That's true, but is a subClassOf declaration just making a claim about
a subset relationship between extensions? If

yyy [rdfs:subClassOf] zzz .

then every yyy _is_ a zzz (not just everything in the extension of yyy
is in the extension of zzz). If rdfs:subClassOf is pronounced
"rdfs:subSETOf" then we ought to consider fixing the spelling.
