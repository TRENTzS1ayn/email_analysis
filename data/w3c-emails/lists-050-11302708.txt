Graham,

You have been very busy; I'm afraid a little too busy.  This outline 
includes rather more than I was expecting this document to contain.  I was 
expecting a pretty unadorned spec with a lot less discursive material.

The motivation for this document was to provide a home for normative 
material that didn't fit anywhere else.

I suggest we start with the minimum that needs to be said.  I attach an 
annotated contents list as a possible starting point.

Brian
