All

There is a version of the new RDF document at:

http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-basics/2002-06-27/Overview.htm

with substantially all content barring the introduction and abstract. We are
still thrashing out some details, but we feel this is close enough that the
group can start to consider the material, and where it belongs.

We have tried to take a holistic view, identifying what is missing from the
current RDF documents, rather than a narrow view of just defining the RDF Graph.
For instance, we scanned the issue list and M&S for material that is in our
recorded intent but not in any working draft.

This has resulted that there is material here that (a) may be better moved to
another document, or (b) may be deemed unnecessary in view of the content of
other documents. The immediate priority has been to put down "somewhere" text
dealing with issues that we didn't perceive as being covered elsewhere at this
time. We hope that having something concrete on the table will enable us to
conduct discussions in a constructive and forward-moving way.

The lack of abstract and introduction reflects our uncertainity about what the
actual content should be, and which of the current content needs moving out or
deleting.

Please note there is some text in section 6.3 that has not been discussed by the
working group, dealing with fragment identifiers. This text draws upon past
comments from TimBL and Pat Hayes. We think it goes a fair way to resolving the
discomfort we have encountered about using fragment identifiers in RDF.

Graham and Jeremy have just agreed to drop section 5.1.1, which Jeremy initially
suggested after reviewing M&S. The semantic content is addressed by the MT.

Finally, the URI that has been circulated previously is being used as a working
space for editorial collaboration. The content there is liable to change without
notice. It will be easier if comments and citations refer to a dated URI. Graham
intend to keep all versions online for at least as long as this is a
work-in-progress.
