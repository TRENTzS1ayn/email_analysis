I'd like to see a primer that started out with a simple do-this-now kind 
of tutorial and gets deeper with each successive chapter. (K&R, for 
example, works like this.)

Here's are some QuickStartGuides I've done:

http://logicerror.com/taxo-quick-start
http://logicerror.com/signYourPage

Then we can continue on with some more explanation about what's 
happening, background, etc.

The key is to have something up top that's about instant gratification.
