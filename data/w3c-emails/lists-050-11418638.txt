Yuk. Having alternatives in a semantics is even worse. Couldnt we say 
that having no lang tag is actually having a lang tag of "none" ?

And can we say that Lang is a string? Then literals are pairs <x,y> 
where x is either a string or an XML structure and y is a string from 
a finite list of lang strings. Yuck but doable.

OK, I was basing the comments on what was told me at the F2F. I guess 
it all depends on what 'language tag' is supposed to mean when 
attached to a string. Strict MT answer: nothing, you are saying.

The model theory doesn't need to go into the details, but an actual 
RDF engine cannot recognize well-formed RDF graphs without using a 
full XML parser. Which means that it is now disingenuous to say that 
RDF/XML is a lexicalization syntax for RDF graphs; the XML encodes 
the graph which includes the XML, so its just a roundabout way of 
encoding XML. (This was brought home to me by Patrick's idea, 
expressed in a discussion at the F2F, to encode 'inner contexts' as 
XML/RDF literals. That seemed insane to me at the time, since I was 
thinking of literals as semantically opaque; but with this view of 
the RDF graph it makes perfect sense. By the way, it also provides a 
neat way to do reification better than by using reification. :-)

OK, got that now.

Just out of interest, now, can you tell me why? Like, what would be 
an example of a Bad Thing that could happen here? (What are the odds 
of a piece of well-formed XML just arising accidentally ??)
