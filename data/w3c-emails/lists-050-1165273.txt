I looked through the archive and could not see even the assertions let alone
links to docs using rdf:ID on empty property elements to name the object
resource.


I also saw assertions that parsers had implemented the reading of M&S that
is currently in the WD. These seemed to be unsubstantiated. A fairly
informal survey that I have done suggests a lack of uniformity and
significant confusion in the implementation of reification. I expect that
once we are done most/all parser writers will need to revisit their
reification code since as far as I can tell there is no industry consensus
behind any one reading of M&S.
