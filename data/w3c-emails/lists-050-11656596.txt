Good to be thinking about this and collecting data.  A couple of suggestions:

   o don't do too much work on it till we datatypes fully nailed; some 
issues did surface at the f2f.  I'm afraid they are not done yet :(

   o great to ask such clear questions, but best to wait for a collective 
group decision before implementing them
