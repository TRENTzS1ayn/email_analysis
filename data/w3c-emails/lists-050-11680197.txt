Jeremy,

What are your `other contexts'? I guess you mean non-RDF contexts by the
(I hope) all-inclusive `when interpreting an RDF graph
according to the RDF model theory'. I am anxious to make the point that
the same transitive equivalence criteria are used throughout RDF
construction and querying (and hence in the construction of queries in
any query language).
