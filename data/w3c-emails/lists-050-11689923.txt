Pat, I don't think it's anything like that bad.

It is also possible for a literal/string to have *no* language, which is 
what I'd expect for (say) numbers.  (Though there was a suggestion from 
outside that no-language matches any language, which I'd oppose to avoid 
the kind of confusion you raise.)

I'm not sure what it would mean to write a literal "35"/fr, or whatever, 
but I'd assume that would not be in the range of the kinds of datatype we 
have been discussing.

Which is just my way of saying what others have said.
