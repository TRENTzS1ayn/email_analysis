Some doubt has been expressed whether this issue is in scope.

See M&S section 6 has text:

[[[
Two RDF strings are deemed to be the same if their ISO/IEC 10646
representations match. Each RDF application must specify which one of the
following definitions of 'match' it uses:
]]]

i.e. paras 217 - 219 (incl note)

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#217

This text has an explicit ambiguity which the early uniform normalization
model addresses.
Hence this issue is within the core purpose of this group to clarify M&S.
