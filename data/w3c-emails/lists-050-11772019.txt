But are they? We have considered German versus English decimals and 
US versus UK date formats within the datatyping discussion. Seems to 
me that datatyping and language tagging are going to be seen as 
closely related in such cases. In the context of xsd:decimal, does 
"10,03"-fi equal "10.03"-en ?
