Right, though I can see why they wanted that.

What we really need here is a distinction between 
no-language-specified (ie missing tag) which matches anything, and an 
actual or implied not-language tag meaning 'not in any human 
language', which doesn't match anything except the same datatype.

Which in turn suggests that a datatype should be thought of as a kind 
of formal language. You can write English in -en and you can write 
numerals in -xsd:number, right? In fact, it seems to me that 
datatypes and language tags are almost logically indistinguishable. 
They both impose lexical rules on strings, and impose some extra-RDF 
conditions on their interpretation. That actually would make more 
sense than saying that they weren't in any language (If they aren't 
in *any* language, how can you encode them in strings?)
