Having consulted with my colleagues I will *not* be proposing to drop
reification.

However, in the feedback I got the following suggestion was made:

[ ... ]

This approach allows us to:
- avoid the "RDF is (NOT) its own metatheory" hole.
- avoid the stating versus statement problem (depends on usage).
- keep the good bits of reification (have standard vocab. for modelling
RDF).

It is characterised by there being no model theory for reification.

I am well aware that Pat may yet produce a reification rabbit out of his
hat, but currently this sort of approach is my favourite.

We could even throw out all the syntax for reification and still follow this
suggestion; it is more within charter not to do so, and I will not be
proposing such a step.
