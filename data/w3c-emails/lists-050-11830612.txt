I like "shopping".

In British English it involves going to the supermarket and getting food; in
italian you go to the posh shops and (at least think about) spend(ing) lots
of money on stylish clothes. They are really very distinct activities.

"shopping"/en-uk = "spesi"/it

I am not really quite sure hopw to say "shopping"/it in English.
