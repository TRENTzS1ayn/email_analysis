I thought Patrick's message was going to have reference to "turvy sex"-fi
(sp?)which I believe translates as "cheers"-en; or "sex"-la (latin) that I
seem to remember is "six"-en.

I propose that RDF Core reports an issue with xml:lang to XML Core, that the
value "" is not supported with Patrick's proposed semantics for it.

I do not support the full scope of Patrick's e-mail since it significantly
changes pre-existing documents, although I believe he might be able to add
DTD information to any documents he wants to change in this way.
