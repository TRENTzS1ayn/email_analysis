Hrmm... this is interesting. This is the second of two issues (potential 
bugs) that have been raised this week that we need to give serious thought 
to.
1. In your email: should we emit a namespace for prefixes found in an 
attribute value (or even element content?!).
2. If you canonicalize only an attribute (or attribute group) should their 
related namespace declarations also be emitted [1]?

I  haven't played with it in implementations myself. Your use cases 
anticipate this usage? Is my following understanding correct?

<foo:list foo:xmlns="http://example.org/foo">
  <foo:item foo:price="5"/>
</foo:list>

And you want to canonicalize the price attribute? And the result you want 
is akin to (avoiding your prefix rewriting for the moment):

  'foo:price="5" foo:xmlns="http://example.org/foo"' 

whereas Canonical XML yields:

 'foo:price="5"'
