I think the conclusion (also in w3c team discussion) was that it'd be
reasonable for someone (I'd be happy...) to just wade in and fix up the
file. Normally we're cautious about editing tech reports (things
published under http://www.w3.org/TR/) but since the namespace document
isn't itself a TR, and we made no explicit commitment not to change it,
fixing the bug seems the obvious thing to do.


Could you let me know what an appropriate fix would be, and I'll just do it.

cheers,

Dan

ps. if you hadn't spotted, I am not an XML encoding expert; the bug is
entirely my fault... so an idiots guide to fixup would be useful
