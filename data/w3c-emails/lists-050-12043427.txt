This is where I start trying to be clever, perhaps too clever.

The obvious way of how the RDF specs should use the C14N spec is to say that
the literal delivered by the rdf:parseType="Literal" production is
canonicalized using the C14N method.

A different way is to not say that, but to say that two xml literals are
compared by comparing their canonicalizations.


In more detail ....

C14N as part of parsing
=======================

Add text to appropriate specs in appropriate places like:
[[[
An XML Literal in RDF consists of an optional language tag paired with a
unicode string that is a well-balanced XML fragment, without use of entity
reference except the predefined entities, and in which all visible
namespaces are declared.

In the literal production
http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#literal
the string value of the XML Literal is found by using the canonicalization
algorithm of C14N (with/without) comments.

Two XML Literals are equal if the language tags are either both absent or
equal (ignoring case) and if the unicode strings are equal.

NOTE: any XML Literal that does not canonicalize to itself in some XML
context cannot be serialized in an RDF/XML document.

C14N as part of equality
========================

reference except the predefined entities, and in which all visible
namespaces are declared.

In the literal production
http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#literal
a possible string value of the XML Literal can be found by modifying the
string as in the input file, to ensure that all (non-predefined) entity
references have been expanded, and that any namespace declarations that are
visibly used are present in the string value. Any other equal string
representation is permitted. Any other representation from which the
canonical string representation can be generated is permitted.

Two XML Literals are equal if the language tags are either both absent or
equal (ignoring case) and if the unicode strings canonicalize to the same
string when put into the following XML context:

<foo><!-- Insert Here --></foo>

NOTE: different RDF processors may treat the underdefined aspects of XML
Literals
differently. These include aspects that are not in XML Infoset and
(maybe) XML comments
and (maybe) non-visible XML namespaces.

NOTE: RDF processors may choose to use an alternative communication band to
transmit a different XML context in which XML Literals should be compared.
In particular, many metadata applications may choose to use a context:
<foo xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><!-- Insert Here --></foo>
]]]


Looking at our example:


<rdf:Description
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core#"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  rdf:about="http://example.org/papers/paper1">
  <dc:Title rdf:parseType="Literal"><!-- Relevant text start. -->
    Foo<em>bar</em>
  <!-- Relevant text end. --></dc:Title>
</rdf:Description>

the former approach (using C14N during parsing):
- requires all RDF parsers to implement C14N
- does not require graph matchers to implement C14N
- specifies precisely which string an RDF parser must produce.
- no current RDF parser will comply
- maximises the ease of interoperability between different RDF processors

e.g. with comments, then we must retain the comment strings.


the latter approach (using C14N during equality)
- does not require RDF parser to implement C14N, but parser writers must
have some awareness of the issues
- does require RDF graph matcher implementors to implement C14N
- is explicitly vague about what string an RDF parser produces
- does address the issues on our issue list
- blesses at least some current implementations (more or less) (ARP and CARA
I think - although ARP does not do processing instructions, I don't know
about CARA).
- still leaves some interoperability questions

e.g using exclusive without comments, then implementations that retain the
comments and all the namespace will nevertheless be conformant, as long as
the equality algorithm (if any) strips the comments and the non-visibly used
namespaces.

I note that nearly all RDF implementations provide RDF/XML input, not that
many provide equality.
