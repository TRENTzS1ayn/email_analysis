I note that I was silent through last call on XC14N, so I don't much want to
call it an issue.

What I find counter-intuitive is that foobar is invisible in
   xmlns:foobar="http://example.org/foo/bar/"

I understand this. The namespace decl is not in the XPath nodeset, and not
accessible from XSLT. It does not appear to be a requirement of XML
namespaces.

From the document writers point of view, IMO, the obvious response to being
told that xsd is invisible is to reiterate such a namespace decl in my
example:

  <eg:bar rdf:parseType="Literal">
    <foo xsi:type="xsd:decimal">10.09</foo>
  </eg:bar>

map it to

  <eg:bar rdf:parseType="Literal">
    <foo xsi:type="xsd:decimal"
 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">10.09</foo>
  </eg:bar>

and this doesn't work.

Of course, the RDF group could say that namespace declarations on the
propertyElt (the one with rdf:parseType="Literal") are put on the
InclusiveNamespace PrefixList. That would then be a bit more natural and
less of a change than modifying the "Literal" word as I suggested in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Mar/0041.html

This example would then become:

  <eg:bar rdf:parseType="Literal"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <foo xsi:type="xsd:decimal">10.09</foo>
  </eg:bar>

where the RDF parser treats the namespace decl as asserting that
 InclusiveNamespace PrefixList = { xsd }
and then canonicalizes the xml literal on that basis.

Doesn't work well with putting the C14N into xml literal equality though.
