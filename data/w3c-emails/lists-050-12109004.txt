Or, you could just use Canonical XML. (Is the RDF usage scenario that you 
will want to be serializing subsets of an XML document and that you expect 
to move those subsets between documents? I'd expect that the  RDF is in 
some datastore, and then you emit those bits that you want to canonicalize 
(i.e., your not using a particular XML document as the actual store during 
processing). for transmission before their sucked into some other data 
store.)

Yep.

I don't understand this. (Why?)
