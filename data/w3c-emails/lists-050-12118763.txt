Yes.

For example, news feeds using RSS (built on top of RDF), may have the same
xml literal being written into an original document, read by a processor,
written out again in a new context, read by another processor, written out
again in yet another context ....


My reading is that the C14N Inclusive would result in namespace pollution,
in which the xml fragment would gradually pick up more and more irrelevant
namespaces as it progressed through such a processing chain.
