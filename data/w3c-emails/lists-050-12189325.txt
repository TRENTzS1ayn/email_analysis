I haven't seen Pat's examples, but want to stress that locale and
language are very different concepts and that xml:lang is defined for
language, not for locale.  It is perfectly OK for someone in France to
write in English and for someone in the UK to write in French.  This
does not magically interchange the meanings of instances of "1,234" and
"1.234" found within their documents.
