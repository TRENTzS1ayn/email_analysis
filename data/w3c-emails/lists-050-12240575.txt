I agree with this principle completely, but ...

.. this doesn't seem like a good example.  1,234 embedded in German
text is going to be between 1 and 2, no matter where it was written;
1,234 embedded in us-en text is going to mean between 1000 and 2000,
no matter where it was written.

A better example is sorting: one may wish en_US rules for sorting
even if the strings being sorted are in a variety of languages
and marked as such.
