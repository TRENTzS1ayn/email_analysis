I didn't provide the context.  Though in running text one would
interpret 1,234 and 1.234 as you describe, in RDF (as in XForms) we are
dealing with XML Schema datatypes.  In this context, the language of
nearby free-form text has no effect on the meaning of structured data
such as numbers or dates.  It would be useful to formalise this, either
by somehow specifying that the non-string datatypes are immune to
language, or by providing constructs enabling authors and authoring
tools to more easily avoid associating language with non-string
datatypes.  This is one of the places where something along the lines of
xml:lang="" would be useful.
