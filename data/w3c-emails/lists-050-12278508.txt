12: Datatypes
Action: 2002-02-26#8  PatrickS  Create XML examples for datatypes doc

Issues with the current proposal:
    * The lack of XML examples (Patrick Stickler to provide)
    * Jeremy's entailment is a problem
    * Octal is not an XML Schema datatype
    * XML Schema datatypes do not support different language representations

Proposed Issue:
  Its too complex; the doublet idiom was not completely removed.
