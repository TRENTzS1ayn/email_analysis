In the example of 1.234,56 appearing in text (e.g. HTML), we as humans
see it as data. But for the computer, it's just part of a string.
Marking it up, e.g. with something like
     <number value='1234.56'>1.234,56</number>
(not available in HTML) will identify it to the computer as data.

This is similar to having "This document was authored by
Ora Lassila" in plain text; RDF doesn't automatically capture it,
it has to be transferred into RDF. Going up the semantic ladder
is difficult and requires work.

This has come up at the recent I18N Workshop
(http://www.w3.org/2002/02/01-i18n-workshop/). If you are interested
in further discussion on what W3C should do in this area, please
subscribe to www-i18n-workshop@w3.org (sending 'subscribe' in the

The W3C has a collection of standard formats for data exchange, defined
in XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/).
Some of these are close to US formats, but some of them are quite different,
but all of them are textual.
