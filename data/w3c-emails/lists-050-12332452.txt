Graham's text did not IMO meet that part.
I am not sure whether dragons get into the primer.
If so, how about:

[[[ ADD:
In standard usage, the representation accessed by a  URL with a fragment
identifier
<em>is</em> dependent upon the representation accessed by the  URL alone.
However,
in RDF, the thing identified by a URI with fragment identifier <em>does
not</em>
bear any particular relationship to the thing identified by the URI alone.

[[[ADD:
Finally, other non-RDF components of a system may expect to be
able to treat a URI with fragment identifier in a manner similar to
the treatment of a URL with fragment identifier used for document
retrieval over the web. This may lead to interoperability problems.
