JOKE:

We could ensure that by putting in a large number of last call comments.


Somewhat more seriously ...

At this stage I am planning to make a last call comment on charmod's 2nd
last call to the effect that the existence of royalty free normalizing
transcoders for a large number of character encodings should be an exit
criterion for charmod CR.

I believe that charmod's 2nd last call may get out before we do.
I believe we are progressing faster than charmod.
