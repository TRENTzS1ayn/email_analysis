I've imported the test case zip files that (mostly) Jeremy made
into the RDF Core test cases area.
(Testing the CVS and new auto-ACL stuff)

Furthermore I've looked at these

  nested-bagIDs: OK
    However tests007 onwards are very complex and I need to study them more.

  not-id-and-resource: OK

  xmlbase: OK last time I looked - before F2F
