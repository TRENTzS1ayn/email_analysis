I think I was advocating a substantially more woolly position than you
appear to want.

Words typically have more than one (related) meaning falling into different
usage patterns. It works in natural language, I have yet to be convinced
that giving (not particularly formal) definitions that follow the
"provenace" model and the "quoting" model is not a solution.

e.g. when discussing the provenance of an RDF statement:

1: A different resource is used for each occurrence of the statment.
2: The resource is of type rdf:Statement
3: The s/p/o properties are as follows: [ omitted ]
4: dc properties are used to describe provenance.
 [I am not suggesting (4) is correct, merely an example]

This sort of resource is referred to as a "stating"

when quoting
Each rdf:Statement resource is uniquely identified by its s/p/o.

This sort of resource is referred to as the Statement.

We observe that each stating as a natural Statement corresponding to it.

While it may seem confusing to have both Statements and Statings represented
in the same way, in practice context will disambiguate.

It is clear to merely say that the rdf:Statement corresponds to the triple
in n-triple and the rdf:subject is the first field, the rdf:predicate is the
second, the rdf:object is the third.

Clarity only vanishes when we claim some deep metaphysical truth about
*identifying* a triple with its reification. If the reification merely
models the triple then it is not difficult.
