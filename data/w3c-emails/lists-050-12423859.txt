OK, I can see this is generally an improvement, but I'd want to change the 
opening clause to:

"In standard usage for web document retrieval, ...".  I might also suggest 
changing "dependent upon" to "related to".

Also, to fully discharge my action w.r.t. MIME types, here's a proposed new 
version:

[[[
In standard usage for web document retrieval, the representation accessed 
by a URL with a fragment
identifier is related to the representation accessed by the URL alone, in a 
way that depends on the MIME type of the document representation 
retrieved.  However, in RDF, the thing identified by a URI with fragment 
identifier does not bear any particular relationship to the thing 
identified by the URI alone.

I think that if this is to be included, we need some justification (e.g. an 
example where interoperability fails).  I have found it hard to come up 
with a convincing case.  From my exchanges with Pat, I think the dragons 
may not be as fiery as we first thought if we are clear about the 
accidental nature of any relationship between URI and URI#frag as far as 
RDF is concerned.
