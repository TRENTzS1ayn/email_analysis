I'm agnostic about the particular representation, but I
think it is important that we have a single canonical representation
for literals in NTriples, and that it is extensible (should
we decide we need something more in literal structures).

It could be

   (0,"35",en)
    0-"35"-en
    whatever

But preferably not either

    "35"-en
or  xml("<b>foo</b>",en)

That's all,

Patrick
