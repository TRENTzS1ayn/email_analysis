Graham said that he found the IRI examples not fully compelling, I wanted to
understand the WG's response to the literal based example below (from the
earlier zip).

If we do not find such examples compelling, IMO, it is only a political
problem of how to satisfy the I18N WG rather than a technical problem of how
to satisfy the I18N requirements as we see them for RDF. i.e. I think I have
adequately captured what the normalization issue is about in these examples.

<!-- Issue: charmod-literal
        Test:  1

        Example showing two different literals, that display the same.
        In a context where there is a unique naming convention, this can
        cause confusion, possibly moral and/or legal confusion.

        The use case consists of:
        - a site collecting Dublin Core data,
          using a unique names convention for individuals.
        - One of the editors of Charmod registers himself and his
          work.
        - Someone else, with the same name, creator of an adult internet
          site, registers a different but visually indistinguishable
          name; along with his work.
        - The consumers of both works get confused and disappointed,
          probably to the detriment of at least one of the Martins.
        - This file consists of some of the (ill-formed) RDF used by the
          metadata site.

With an unambiguous property declaration from an ontology layer this can be
done entirely within (future) W3C specs.
