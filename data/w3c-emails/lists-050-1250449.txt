12: Issue: #rdfms-qname-uri-mapping
The WG resolves to not change the algorithm for mapping qnames to uris
and close this issue on the grounds:

  1. Such a change would be a major change to the mapping of
     RDF/XML syntax to the model and would be beyond our charter.

  2. It would cause the same RDF/XML to generate a different
     graph from existing versus revised implementations

  3. Existing code may generate wrong (illegal) graphs for some RDF/XML.


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qname-uri-mapping
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0016.html


13: Issue: #rdfms-reification-required
The WG resolves that a parser is not required to create bags of reified 
statements for all rdf:Description elements, only those which are
explicitly reified using an rdf:ID on a propertyElt or by an RDF:bagID
on the rdf:Description.

Existing test cases, such as:
  
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0001.rdf

demonstrate this resolution.


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-reification-required
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0017.html


14: Issue:  #rdfms-replace-value
Proposal 1 (DaveB):  The WG resolves:

  to not change the name rdf:value and close this issue on the grounds:

  1. Insufficient reasons to make this change
  2. Will causing an existing uses to be illegal - such as as
     the examples in M&S.

Proposal 2 (Aaron): Open a new issue to clarify the semantics of rdf:value.
Aaron has proposed text for this issue.

Proposal 3 (bwm):  The proposed name change was intended to better express
the meaning of the property.  However the meaning of the property is not clear.
The WG therefore:

  o resolves to not change the name of this property at this time on
    the grounds:

    - insufficient reasons to make this change
    - will casue existing uses to be illegal - such as examples in m&s

 o resolves to recast this issue as a need to clarify the semantics
   of rdf:value.

 o actions bwm to update issues list with text based on Aarons proposal

 o actions DB to remove this issue from the list affecting the syntax
