It is locale-formatted data, which has nothing to do with the client it's on.

Whether it has a value to the computer depends very much on the nature of the
processing going on.  You can call it a string, or you can call it text, or you
can call it data.  What it is _not_ is locale-neutral.  It has a locale.

The point being that this is an example where only having the locale info at the
client is not sufficient.  Even if you have a value parm in the tag, the data
itself still has a locale - and you, the creator of the processing software, may
very much want to know what that locale is.  You might want to change the way it
is displayed, or put a pop-up tag for a mouse-over to alert the user, or who
knows what.  There are times where the locale tag would be ignored, just as the
lang tag is sometimes.

I recognize that there are 2 aspects to locale-specific info, syntax and
semantics.  This could simply be syntactically locale-specific.

The value parm would be useful for calculations and comparisons done on the
actual value.

I assume this message is for other people on the list - as you know I'm already
subscribed.

Right, I'll make sure to document this info for my groups here, thanks.
