Hmm.  Yeah, might be better.

That is the case by design - you can use string comparsion to compare
all *terms* in NTriples for equality: literal, uriref, nodeID

OK.  I thought there was more.  I intended to read what XML says
about xml:lang at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag and
follow up the several references, which don't seem to include RFC 3066?

Patrick I think said otherwise.  It might be useful for the MT if you
need to talk about all literals.

OK so I would have:
       "chat"      = a unicode string, no language
       "chat"-""   = illegal since xml:lang string can't be empty
       "chat"-"en" = legal string, language
          etc.

Cheers
