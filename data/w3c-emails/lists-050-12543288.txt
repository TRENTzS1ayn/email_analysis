Nope. You've got a use/mention bug in your argument.

Syntactic literals can't occur in the subject position,
but URIs (or bNodes) in the subject position can
denote literal values.

e.g. http://example/vocab/#myString might denote
the same three character string literal denoted by "abc",
in which case it would be sensible to say

<http://example/vocab/#myString> daml:equivalentTo "abc".
<http://example/vocab/#myString> rdf:type rdfs:Literal.

even though RDF 1.0 syntax doesn't include the sentence

"abc" rdf:type rdfs:Literal.
