We decided we don't need something more. 

RDF 1.0 syntax isn't extensible; hence n-triples 
need not be. 

Please don't make n-triples out to be more than it is.

I accept that as your preference. But both
syntaxes are equally "canonical"; i.e. each
corresponds 1-1 with what we want to say.

And we have a lot invested in the "24"
syntax (a hundred or so test cases).
I don't see any reason to throw
it away.
