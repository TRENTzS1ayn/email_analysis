Actually I realised the ()s are redundant, so this might be better:
   xml"<b>foo</b>"-en        XML content, language given "en"


Getting specific, I propose the following changes to production
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/rdf-testcases/#literal

changing to

  literal  ::=  langString | XMLstring

and adding new productions:

  langString   ::= '"' string '"' ('-' language)

  xmlString    ::= 'xml' langString

    ISSUE #1: OR maybe?
      xmlString    ::= 'xml"' string '"' ('-' language)

  language     ::= character+

    This is any allowed xml:lang content as defined in
    http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag

    ISSUE #2: I don't think specifying this more precisely here is
    worth it.  If the consensus is to do this, it would be something
    like this (after RFC 1766):
       language ::= [a-zA-Z]{1,8} ('-' [a-zA-Z]{1,8})
