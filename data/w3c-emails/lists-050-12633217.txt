As you know, NTriples doesn't define equality, it is a syntax for the
Model Theory to use to do so.  So: the Q is, how should the MT define
equality on these?

Can't be (a) since the "" content is just a sequence of characters.
(b) and (c) cannot be distinguished; it is a legal sequence of
ntriple characters.
