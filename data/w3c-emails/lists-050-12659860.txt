No, that's why I posted the proposed new productions to make it quite
clear:

  langString   ::= '"' string '"' ('-' language)

  xmlString    ::= 'xml' langString

and in the existing grammar at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#string

  string  ::=  character* with escapes as defined in section Strings

Legal - yes, this changed NTriples doesn't care.  However: the
NTriples that are generated from RDF/XML will *not* generate such a
literal.

If we went with
  xmlString    ::= 'xml"' xmlExclusiveC14Nstring '"' ('-' language)

  xmlExclusiveC14Nstring ::= as defined by http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n

then there would be further requirements

It is an answer from my current defn :)
