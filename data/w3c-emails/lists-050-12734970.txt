Looks like 3 issues to me, not one.

Thats issue 1.  Does the WG agree this is a problem.  I note that some 
previous posts used xsdr:decimal for RDF references to schema datatype.

Thats issue 2, but I don't know what it means.  Test case please.

Ok I was wrong, I don't see an issue here.

Please stick to the process we agreed.  Does the WG agree the issue 
identified is a problem.

Please try not to get into lengthy discussion of ways to resolve issues 
before we have agreed there is a problem to fix.
