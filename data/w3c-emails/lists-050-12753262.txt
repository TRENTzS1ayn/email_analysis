Per ?d rdfs:domain ?d that single uri denotes the valuespace and
the valuespace-to-lexicalspace mapping but *not* the lexicalspace.
Maybe for S-B we could use ``?p rdfs:range [ xsi:type ?d ]''
to say that the range of ?p is the lexical space of the datatype ?d
e.g.
  eg:Jenny eg:age "35" .

  eg:age rdfs:range _:1 .
  _:1 xsi:type xsd:number .
