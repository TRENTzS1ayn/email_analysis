well, in an earlier MT draft, there was some of that stuff
but ... (don't get me wrong) where are we w.r.t. that???
I'm much more in favor of unasserted triples
like the ones in a set of statements enclosed by N3's { } or so,
but that is out of scope of course :-(
and so I would propose to drop reification
a bit in the spirit of
