I provided some N3 during the f2f, but here is one again...

Taking the present proposed interpretation that a datatype URI
denotes only its value space:

Given

   age rdfs:range xsd:integer .

Then

   Bob age [ a xsd:integer; xsd:integer "35" ] .

works OK, since the bNode is a member of the value
space of xsd:integer; but

   Bob age "35" .

generates a range constraint conflict since "35" is
a member of the lexical space, not value space of
xsd:integer.

This problem does not exist with a union interpretation.
