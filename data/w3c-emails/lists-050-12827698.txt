See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020225-f2f/#d-2002-02-26-1

Patrick noted that in Schema there is one sort of literal, and having two
syntactic forms for literals may be confusing.

12: Datatypes
Action: 2002-02-26#8  PatrickS  Create XML examples for datatypes doc

This action has been completed:
  Missing URL

The following text of the agenda was not discussed:
[[[
Issues with the current proposal:
    * The lack of XML examples (Patrick Stickler to provide)
    * Jeremy's entailment is a problem
    * Octal is not an XML Schema datatype
    * XML Schema datatypes do not support different language representations

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020225-f2f/#d-2002-02-26-3
]]]

Brian proposed this issue:
  Its too complex; the doublet idiom was not completely removed.

The relevant text is in section 5:
[[[ 
ex:age rdfs:drange xsd:number
Jimmy ex:age _:x .
_:x rdfs:dlex "35" .
]]]

No decision was taken, discussion to continue on e-mail.
