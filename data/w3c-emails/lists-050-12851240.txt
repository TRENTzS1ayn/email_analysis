The example did not work; it got scrunched somewhere, I am reposting it in html with utf-8 encoding which worked last time.

Here is the example again, I hope this works.


<!--  Issue: charmod-literal
        Test:  1
        Author: Jeremy Carroll, HP
        $Header: /w3ccvs/WWW/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.rdf,v 1.4 2001/09/06 21:23:35 barstow Exp $

        Example showing two different literals, that display the same.
        In a context where there is a unique naming convention, this can
        cause confusion, possibly moral and/or legal confusion.
        
        The use case consists of:
        - a site collecting Dublin Core data,
          using a unique names convention for individuals.
        - One of the editors of Charmod registers himself and his
          work.
        - Someone else, with the same name, creator of an adult internet
          site, registers a different but visually indistinguishable
          name; along with his work.
        - The consumers of both works get confused and disappointed,
          probably to the detriment of at least one of the Martins.
        - This file consists of some of the (ill-formed) RDF used by the 
          metadata site.
