I don't see this as a problem _unless_ we are trying to use the same names 
(URIs) as are defined by XML schema.  And if we are trying to us the same 
names, we're in danger of trampling on someone else's lawn, and that's an 
issue to be resolved separately from the model theory.

Summary:  needs clarification before I agree it's a problem.
