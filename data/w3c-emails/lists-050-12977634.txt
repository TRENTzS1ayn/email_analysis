I'm sympathetic to this view.  However, at least in my mind, my
prepared defense for objections to the removal of aboutEach has
been that it was a syntactic transform, and there is now a
blessed method for doing syntactic transforms on xml - xslt.

If we are going to say that this is an xslt problem, we should
do so being aware that we may be recommending the use of xslt
to meet certain needs.
