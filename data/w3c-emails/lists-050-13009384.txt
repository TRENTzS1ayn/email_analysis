Modifying Graham's version:

> In standard usage for web document retrieval, the representation accessed by
> a URL with a fragment identifier is related to the representation accessed
> by the URL alone, in a way that depends on the MIME type of the document
> representation retrieved.  However, in RDF, the thing identified by a URI
> with fragment identifier does not bear any particular relationship to the
> thing identified by the URI alone.

Add:

This contradicts some readings of the URI specification[RFC2396], so caution
is recommended when creating new RDF terms which use fragment identifiers.

And I'll be happy with this wording.
