I think that's too strong, on two counts "contradicts" and 
"caution".  Here's something I think says the same idea without appearing 
to create a conflict with RFC 2396 or scaring users away from using fragments:

[[[
The URI specification [RFC2396] describes URIs with emphasis on their use 
for Web document retrieval, so be aware that the RDF use of fragment 
identifiers may appear to vary in some respects.  In particular, when using 
RDF, do not assume that a URI with fragment identifier denotes a part of a 
document identified by the base URI.
