XSLT over RDF/XML will work for most cases.

This particular issue is supporting XSLTing RDF/XML with
parseType="Literal" where the embedded XML content contains
attribute values that are qnames, not URIs and the qname prefixes
need to be preserved.  I consider this not a big problem given
the number of clauses in the previous sentence.

The XSLT expansion of aboutEach should remain dooable based
on Jeremys' XSLT work, as far as I know.

RDF/XML was designed well before qnames in attribute values started
to be used in XML formats and we have never promised that it would be
preserved.  We can give best practice, if we decide to go the C14N
route, but not much more at this stage, without making too-large
changes to the RDF/XML syntax.
