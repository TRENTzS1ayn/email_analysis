I suppose Patrick wants something like

  eg:age rdfs:range xsd:number .
  eg:Jenny eg:age "35" .
  eg:Jenny eg:age _:1 .
  _:1 xsd:number "35" .

to entail
  ...

the trouble that I see is the following
suppose we also know that

  eg:age rdf:type owl:UniqueProperty .

hence we can entail

  eg:Jenny eg:age "35" .
  eg:Jenny eg:age _:1 .
  _:1 xsd:number "35" .
  _:1 owl:sameIndividualAs "35"

but we also know that the domain and range
of xsd:number are disjoint hence we can entail

  eg:Jenny eg:age "35" .
  eg:Jenny eg:age _:1 .
  _:1 xsd:number "35" .
  _:1 owl:sameIndividualAs "35"
  _:1 owl:differentIndividualFrom "35"

which tells us that we have an inconsistent
given and it doesn't make sense to entail
stuff from that!!!

ps
  eg:age rdfs:drange xsd:number .
  eg:Jenny eg:age "35" .
  eg:Jenny eg:age2 _:1 .
  _:1 xsd:number "35" .

or
  eg:age rdfs:range xsdr:number .
  eg:Jenny eg:age "35" .
  eg:Jenny eg:age2 _:1 .
  _:1 xsd:number "35" .

could work, so drange or xsdr
and age and age2
