A new version of the Primer is available at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020312.html

It obviously (as you'll see from the various notes inside) has a way to 
go, but as far as I'm concerned it's suitable for a WD decision on 
Friday (I was sensitive to the fact that folks said they would like to 
see it earlier rather than later).  I'm still going to be doing 
additional work on the next version in the meantime, so I'll be happy to 
take comments before Friday as well.

PS:  You'll see I didn't get the fragment identifiers material in (and 
there's a note about it in the text).  I need to think some more about 
where to put this, since it may involve a bit of reorganization (which 
might not be too bad for other reasons as well).

PPS:  Dave:  thanks for a set of very helpful comments (even though 
you'll notice I haven't handled all of *them* yet either).

PPPS:  Eric:  let me know if you want the write lock back.
