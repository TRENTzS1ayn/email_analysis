Since rdfs:drange has no semantic relationship to rdfs:range and
does not in fact define any constraints which can be tested by
a generic RDFS Validator, it seems that a different name would be
a good idea.

Jos and I had discussed the possibility of rdfs:datatype, and
some of my N3 examples at the f2f reflected that.

What rdfs:datatype (rdfs:drange) is really doing is simply associating
a datatype with a property, so that some extra-RDF application is
aware of the datatype context within which values of either idiom
are to be interpreted.

Eh?
