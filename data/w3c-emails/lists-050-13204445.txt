Isn't this implying (since it is an error case) that RDF applications
have to validate URI-refs or at least know some non-hierarchical uri
schemes.  I understand RDF apps need to do relative URI resolution
but until the xmlbase test cases, we never checked that they worked
right.

We seem to be sort-of generating test cases for other specifications
(RFC 2396, xml base) which we generally shouldn't be doing :)

and urn:, isbn: etc. etc.
