>(RFC 2396, xml base) which we generally shouldn't be doing :)

IIRC, RFC 2396 is crafted so that the non-hierarchical schemes can be 
detected syntactically;  i.e. the base URI doesn't start with a "/" 
immediately following the schema name.  If the scheme name is followed 
immediately by a '/' then it's hierarchical.
