Yes, I missed your point.

Let me see if I get it now.  Given:

     Bob age "35" .
     age rdfs:range datatype:decimal .

you say there is a range type inconsistency?

I agree that there is an inconsistency here.  I don't agree that it is a 
problem.  Effectively, by saying that:

     age rdfs:range datatype:decimal .

(and assuming that the value space of datatype:decimal does not include 
literal values) then I think you are saying that literals should not be 
used with this property.
