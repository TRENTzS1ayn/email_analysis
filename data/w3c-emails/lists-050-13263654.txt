No, the denotation of the URI doesn't change with context.

What does change is the part of the denotation that is used.

If a URI is a property and a class, then its denotation includes (is 
associated with) a relational extension and a class extension.  When the 
URI is used as a property, the relational extension is used to determine 
the truth of the containing statement.  When the URI is used as the object 
of an rdf:type property, the class extension is used.  The RDF semantics 
provides this much completely separately from the issue of datatyping.

So, when a datatype URI is used with range, one part of its denotation (the 
class extension) is accessed.  When used with drange, another part (related 
to the definition of L2V) is used.

Conclusion:  I don't see any difficulty here.
