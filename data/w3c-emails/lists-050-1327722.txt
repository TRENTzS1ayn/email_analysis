This seems fine to me.  One nit...

Do you mean "there being no special model theory"...   I see no reason why 
the standard model theory should not apply -- we just don't (yet) try to 
say anything specific about the intended interpretation of the reserved

I would personally prefer to see rdf:ID= in property elements used 
consistently to identify the corresponding rdf:Statement resource, etc.
