>(RFC 2396, xml base) which we generally shouldn't be doing :)

IIRC, RFC 2396 is crafted so that the non-hierarchical schemes can be 
detected syntactically;  i.e. the base URI doesn't start with a "/" 
immediately following the schema name.  If the scheme name is followed 
immediately by a '/' then it's hierarchical.

[Follow-up]

Here's the relevant syntax from RFC 2396:

[[[
       URI-reference = [ absoluteURI | relativeURI ] [ "#" fragment ]
       absoluteURI   = scheme ":" ( hier_part | opaque_part )
       relativeURI   = ( net_path | abs_path | rel_path ) [ "?" query ]

       hier_part     = ( net_path | abs_path ) [ "?" query ]
       opaque_part   = uric_no_slash *uric

       uric_no_slash = unreserved | escaped | ";" | "?" | ":" | "@" |
                       "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

       net_path      = "//" authority [ abs_path ]
       abs_path      = "/"  path_segments
       rel_path      = rel_segment [ abs_path ]
]]]
