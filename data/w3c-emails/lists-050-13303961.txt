This is the usual weekly call for items for this weeks telecon, which I 
need by noon Thursday uk time.

I apologise to folks:  I'm behind on the email, so I really do need some 
help putting the agenda together.

I think we have:

   - primer: approve WD publication
   - xml:base test cases - approve
   - parseType=Literal: I think I saw consensus emerging - do we have a 
proposal?
   - IRI's - where are we?
   - Internationalization?
   - Datatype issues - I've seen two proposed problems so far

Corrections, suggestions welcome.

Brian
