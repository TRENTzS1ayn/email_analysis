Sure.

Interesting that you use xml:base here.
The solution to this one is pretty easy, since all your other namespaces are
fine:

[...]
   xml:base="http://prismstandard.org/vocabularies/1.0/usage/">
   <prl:usage rdf:resource="none"/>
[...]

Or, if you don't want to create all those little files you can use special
web server features like mod_redirect, or take advantange of CGI support:

   xml:base="http://prismstandard.org/vocabularies/1.0/">
   <prl:usage rdf:resource="usage?e=none"/>

   or if your web server requires file name extensions:

   <prl:usage rdf:resource="usage.xml?e=none"/>

This one is especially nice, because you can start out with just a plain
html file named "usage" which defines all the appropriate terms, but when/if
it grows too large, switch to a CGI/script/program which only shows the
appropriate term. To make sure your server supported this, I visisted:

http://www.idealliance.org/news/2002/idea0220b.asp?e=none
And got the same result as;
http://www.idealliance.org/news/2002/idea0220b.asp

Hmm, I get a 404 at: http://prismstandard.org/vocabularies/1.0/usage.xml

It looks like you're missing a line here... What's the relation between <>
and <#none>? That aside, you could replace this as:

  <pcv:Descriptor rdf:about="none">

  in the http://prismstandard.org/vocabularies/1.0/usage/ example.

Or

  <pcv:Descriptor rdf:about="usage?e=none">

  in a file named "http://prismstandard.org/vocabularies/1.0/usage"
  (or ".../usage.xml").

There are lots of ways to do this, and I hope my examples here have helped.
Please feel free to ask further questions.
