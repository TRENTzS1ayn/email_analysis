The problem with this is that RDF/XML isn't really introduced until 
Section 3 (except for the example in Section 1, which really isn't 
explained).

This might work.  Hmmm....

We did, but the situation is more complicated than it might appear. I 
was using "bNode" as an abbreviation for "blank node" (the model theory 
term), not as a synonym for "node identifier" (the model theory term, 
and which I use correctly).  What I need to do is change "bNode" to 
"blank node" (and eliminate the term "nodeID", which I introduce as an 
abbreviation but never use).  Note:  the RDF/XML spec uses the term 
"bnodeID", which is a sort of compromise.

I thought so too.  That's why I stole it from Dave! (Section 2, para 1 
of the RDF/XML spec)

Good point.

Could be.  The whole Schema section needs a lot of work to make it more "primer-like".


Thanks again for the comments.
