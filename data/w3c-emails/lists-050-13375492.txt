Thanks for the explaination. I understand the distinction now.

I think that it would be good to have some verbage somewhere that
clarifies these points for less-technical users, so that they at
least have reasonable guidelines/examples of when to use rdfs:range
and when to use rdfs:drange, and the ramifications of both.

Perhaps not a technical one, but possibly a practical one.
