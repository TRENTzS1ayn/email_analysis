This would, of course, require untidy literals, and we just decided
to make literals tidy.

If languages as properties, in conjuction with literals as subjects,
is truly is a desirable feature in the future, should we rethink tidy
literals?

If literals remain tidy, then that closes the door on languages
as properties.
