However, the language codes can have '-' in them such as en-us, en-uk
and so on.  How do you suggest we get round that if we changed to
  "foo"en-us
?

Maybe something more awkward:
  "foo"X"en-us"
where X is another character?

Or a bracketing pair?: "foo"("en-us")

Or a function/predicate-like thing: literal("foo", "en-us")

Lots of choices; but compatibility with N3 remains *very* useful, so
that's why I tried to ask N3 developers before we changed this.

That can be fixed as I proposed, by specifying the allowed set of
chars in a language string rather than just specifying a terminating
condition (next space).  Unless we go to other delimiters as above.
