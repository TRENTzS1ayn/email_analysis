>    - Internationalization?



I propose that:

- The Unicode strings within RDF literals are required to be in NFC.
- We note that literals whose unicode strings start with a combining
character may not be serializable in an XML document that conforms with
forthcoming Character Model Recommendations.
- We include a test case of such a literal as legal, to be reviewed if
Charmod reaches rec before we do.
