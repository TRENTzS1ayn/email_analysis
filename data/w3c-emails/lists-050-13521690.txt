I would like this taken after the other I18N issue.
This is most likely to be premature.

I propose that we:
- use original character sequences for URIs within RDF and require these to
be in NFC


(% escaped forms are legal but different identifiers. The difference is seen
in the model theory just as http://example.org is different from
http://example.org and from http://example.org:80 )
