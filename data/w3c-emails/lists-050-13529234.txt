Brian--

This note doesn't strike me as the kind of thing that ought to go *only* 
in the Primer, although it might well go there in addition to someplace 
else.  It sounds like an important qualification for RDF developers, and 
I don't think it should be *necessary* for people to read the Primer to 
get this type of information.
