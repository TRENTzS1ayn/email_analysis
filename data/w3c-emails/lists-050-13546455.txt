No, that's the dustbin mentality for the primer.
It's a note aboute the definition of literal equality, stick it straight
after that definition. Is that part of the model theory draft? Or syntax? Or
even test cases?

I guess my prerference is that the normative defition of the RDF graph data
model should be in syntax, and that this note follows the defn of equality.
