And that in the definition of the RDF graph we use MUST language, whereas in
the discussion of RDF/XML we indicate that parsers SHOULD use normalizing
transcoders, (with a reference to a CHARMOD WD).

Issue: do we want a note saying that non normalized unicode input MUST NOT
be normalized. (This is one of the safe guards in charmod, but it assumes
that specs are defining a processing model, and we are not).
