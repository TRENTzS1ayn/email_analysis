The examples I used were based on those given in Sergey's definition
of the A and B idioms. Perhaps there are errors there?

My very point was that if you use idiom A and B together, they get
in each other's way, or at least idiom B gets in the way of idiom A.

Thus, if the use of rdfs:range for idiom B is inconsistent with
knowledge expressed in idiom A, they cannot coexist in the same
knowledge base.
