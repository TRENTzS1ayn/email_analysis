A slight revision of the 20020312 version of the Primer is now at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020314.html

This represents no substantive content changes from the previous version 
(for those of you who are reviewing), but does represent some formatting 
and HTML cleanup (plus fixing a few, but apparently not all, typos).  I 
ran it through the W3C validator, and there's still plenty of work to do 
(I introduced a few more errors in "fixing things up", but at least I 
have the validation report to go by!), but I think it's starting to 
shape up.
