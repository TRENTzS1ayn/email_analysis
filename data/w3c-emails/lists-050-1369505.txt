This is precisely what I had suggested some time ago with my X proposal,
which also takes into account issues such as trust/authority, as well
as source, authentication, scope, and all other qualifications of
statements. It's just an issue of (a) having only one representation
for statements and (b) shifting matters of assertion, trust, etc. to
a suitable ontology (or ontologies) for qualifying statements. E.g.

    s a rdf:Statement ;
      rdf:predicate      pred ;
      rdf:subject        sub ;
      rdf:object         obj ;
      rdf:assertedBy     <auth://abc.com/john.doe> ;
      rdf:source         <http://www.abc.com/~jdoe/what-I-know.rdf> ;
      rdf:scope          dilusions ;
      rdf:authentication <esl:SHA1:i8...a82> .

and the triple <s,p.o> is just a resource-centric view of that knowledge
derived from the qualified statement, as Graham points out.

All statements are "reified", per se. Assertion is taken to be an issue
of relevance to any given process -- and selection of relevant statements
is based on a statement's qualification properties. I.e. assertion is
a preliminary query on the statements in a knowledge base to select
knowledge of relevance to a subsequent query or operation.

Of course, changes of a magnitude such as suggested above are totally
beyond the scope of the present charter, which is why I dropped discussion
of the X proposal (for now ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
