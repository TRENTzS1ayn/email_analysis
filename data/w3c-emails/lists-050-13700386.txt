I've got bigger ears than you! (also of Bristol)

The early uniform normalization approach to unicode normalization is that
the first producer of *Unicode* must normalize (and nobody else).

I am an RDF/XML parser.

If I read an RDF/XML document and it is in utf-8 then if it's not normalised
it's an error.

If I read Shift-JIS (no idea whether there is a normalization problem) then
I turn it into unicode, and it's my job to make sure that unicode is
normalised. To perform this job, I ask Xerces to do it, and they either have
or don't have appropriate normalizing transcoders. Once charmod is deployed
they will have these things. Since charmod is not deployed I prefer SHOULD
language.

The motivation for this is to ensure maximum compatibility with the lazy
implementor who does nothing. He probably has never heard of shift-JIS and
so rejects it. A normalized unicode document is processed identically by me
and Mr Lazy. A non-normalized unicode document is rejected by me (in strict
conformance mode). (In default mode, a non-normalized unicode document
generates a warning from me, but then I do not normalize it but proceed
anyway like Mr Lazy).

So when we both produce an answer we produce the same answer.
