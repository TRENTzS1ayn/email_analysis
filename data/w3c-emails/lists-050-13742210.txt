I think we should publish this as long as the editors take into
account a few editorial issues and try to address them before publishing:

  W3C Document publishing process bits - style, validating, link checking etc.
  Spell checking :)
  Making @@s and missing bits into more clear warnings
  Ensuring all sections, figures, examples have labels, anchors which
    are used

I'd also suggest the Model Theory section was moved earlier
rather than a subsection of 6.1
