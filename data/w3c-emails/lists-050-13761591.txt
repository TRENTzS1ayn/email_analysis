This is a long-ish message.  The main part explores this key 
question:  according to [1], what can we say about the relational extension 
of ex:age (IEXT(I(ex:age)) given:

    ex:age rdfs:drange datatype:decimal .

Ah... I was going to say that I would expect a generic RDFS validator to 
also know enough about datatypes, but I think I see your point 
now.  Condidering:

    ex:age rdfs:drange datatype:decimal .
    ex:Jenny ex:age "10" .

    ex:Jenny ex:age _:x .
    _:x datatype:decimal "10" .

the second part is consistent with:

    ex:age rdfs:range datatype:decimal .

but the former is not.   Hmmm.

...

Reviewing the model theory for datatypes [1] I find that I cannot tell what 
the relational extension for ex:age is intended to be.  I think it only 
works if:

    ex:age rdfs:drange datatype:decimal .
means that:
    <I(ex:Jenny),"10"> in IEXT(I(ex:age))

(where "10" is the sequence of two characters) and

    ex:age rdfs:range datatype:decimal .
means that:
    <I(ex:Jenny),10> in IEXT(I(ex:age))

(where 10 is the integer value)

This seems to be saying that rdfs:drange allows datatype lexical-space 
members in the relational extension of a property, and rdfs:range allows 
the corresponding datatype value-space members in the relational 
extension.  I wonder if that is what Pat intended?

I'm thinking there may be a problem with the datatype proposal [1].  Consider:

    ex:age rdfs:drange datatype:decimal .

According to section 5 of [1], taking account that literals denote 
themselves, this means that

    <x,y> in IEXT(I(ex:age)) => z=L2V(I(datatype:decimal))(y) for some z

[i.e. y in the lexical space of datatype:decimal]

But later in section 5 we see that

[[[
    ex:age rdfs:drange xsd:number
    Jimmy ex:age _:x .
    _:x rdfs:dlex "35" .
]]]

means that Jimmy's age is the number 35, which requires that

    <I(Jimmy),35> in IEXT(I(ex:age))

but the number 35 is not in the lexical space of datatype:decimal, so we 
appear to have a contradiction.

As far as I can tell, this is a problem with [1].  More likely (I hope), 
I'm overlooking something.
