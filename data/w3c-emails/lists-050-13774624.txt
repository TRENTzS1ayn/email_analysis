This dead horse is making a good living out of being flogged... I just 
thought I'd say that I happen to agree with Jeremy about this.  Ho hum.

Except that I'd view Tim's example slightly differently under this approach:

   Jenny ex:age "35"en-US .

<==>

   Jenny ex:age _:x .
   _:x lang:en_US "35" .

and maybe:

   lang:en_US rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:dlex .
