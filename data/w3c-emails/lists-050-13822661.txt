I came up with a suggestion very similar to that earlier.  However I
don't want to have to wait to hear what the N3 developers want to do
(such as any plans for the use of round brackets or predicate-type
things) and so again, lets go with what I currently proposed.  

Then we can move forward and get issues closed; which requires test
cases; which requires a test case format that can encode them.

We don't need to get the perfect test file format first (or nth) time
around, just sufficient for now.
