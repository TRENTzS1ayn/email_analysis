I fail to see why this example illustrates a problem. This is exactly 
what should happen. What would be a problem would be if the range 
datatyping failed to distinguish between

Boib age "35"

meaning that Bob's age was 35 and it meaning Bob's age was "35", and 
simply accepted one interpretation as correct when someone wanted to 
impose the other.

One utility of the last proposal (using range/drange)  is that it 
allows someone who wants to be 'sloppy' about ranges to do so and 
still invoke datatype checking, but it also allows someone who wants 
to be precise about the lexical/value distinction to be precise.
