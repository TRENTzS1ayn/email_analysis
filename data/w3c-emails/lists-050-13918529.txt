3 is the case that corresponds to the version of idiom (1) where a 
literal can denote its value. That was the original P-style idiom 
which is used in DAML, for example. We have ruled out the P idiom, 
but case (3) above is its substitute.  I think we need this in order 
to be able to do range datatyping properly.  It isnt really fair to 
say that (1) and (3) are alternative *ways* to do datatyping: they 
are the same way, but used for different purposes. (1) imposes a 
check on lexical forms, (3) assigns a value based on the form.

Right, but in this proposal, that would NOT invoke any particular 
datatype checks. It just uses normal RDF schema reasoning about a 
class which happens to be the one used by a datatype.

Well, I suggested that we change it to rdfs:dcrange in order partly 
to make it even less similar to rdfs:range. The 'range' part does 
make some sense, since it applies to the object of the property 
rather than the subject, but I agree it is potentially confusing.
