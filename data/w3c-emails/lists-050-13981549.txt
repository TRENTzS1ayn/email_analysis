It is not that what does happen isn't what is supposed to
happen -- only that it can be a practical problem in a
context where one is syndicating knowledge from various
sources where some may have used the inline idiom and others
only used the bNode idioms with strict range constraints.

Thus, one has to either filter out the range constraints or
map the inline idioms to lexical form idioms to avoid a
garunteed range conflict.

But perhaps that's par for the course...
