Pat,

I pretty much agree with all you say, in particular that (1) and (3) are 
not the same.  I think any difference is one of emphasis and usage style.

I see (2) and (3) as being more similar - they both provide a way to use a 
literal to indicate a node denotes some value according to a datatyping 
scheme - in this case an integer represented by a decimal numeral.

So, bearing in mind your comments at the last telecon, my question for you 
would be:  is there a need for (3) that is not satisfied by (2)?
