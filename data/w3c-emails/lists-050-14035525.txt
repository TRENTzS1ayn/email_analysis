This action is completed.

BTW, for the benefit of anyone else who wants to sign up to
rdf-comments, the instructions for joining the list included in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/1998JanMar/0000,
and pointed to from the list archives page at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/, are incorrect. 
The instructions say:

> Subscription requests to automatically receive postings sent to this
> list may be sent to www-rdf-comments-request@w3.org; include the word
> 'subscribe' in the body of the message.

Rather, put the word "subscribe" in the *subject* of the request, cf
http://www.w3.org/Mail/Request
