just quickly, there is one easy way that we can use immediately
i.e. 'immediate addressing' per http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt
e.g.

<data:,:John a :Person. :John a :Male> log:implies <data:,:John a :Man>.

we use it a lot to exchange graphs between engines and it is quite
performant as the dereferencing is just a simple string manipulation
