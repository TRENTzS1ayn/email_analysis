(moving on-list)

Dave and I have been having a discussion about xmlbase test013.

[i.e. test cases that are about URI resolution (or the workings of xml:base
in general), as opposed to the test cases to do with xml:base in an RDF
context].

I thought both of these ideas are worth bringing to other peoples attention.

Seems like a proposal to:

- draw the relevant XML wg's attention to difficulties in interpretating
xml:base with same document references, (particularly when the base is a
URIref).

- select the xml:base test cases that:
  - test general URI resolution
  - test general xml:base behaviour
  and mark them as non-normative
