I would prefer

- <subj> <pred> <obj> .

as an unasserted triple.

Liar, (or should that be "balls" :) )
You came up with a number of proposals that all seem fine.

My early preference is ...

This could be a namespace prefix rather than the namespace e.g.


<rdf:RDF xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" xmlns:egdark="http://example.org/"
         rdf:darkPrefixes="egdark">
     <rdf:Description eg:aserted="foo" egd:unasserted="bar" />

</rdf:RDF>
