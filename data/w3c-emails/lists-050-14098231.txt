This becomes problemmatic (in a practical sense) if we want to
use the same vocabularies for both asserted and unasserted
statements.

An alternative:

How about an element rdf:Expression (or some such) which is in all
other ways identical to rdf:Description except that statements
are not asserted. E.g.

   <rdf:Expression rdf:about="#Bob>
      <ex:age>35</ex:age>
   </rdf:Expression>

gives us

    :Bob ex:age "35" ;
or
    - :Bob ex:age "35" .

This doesn't require any significant changes to current parsers
and the only modification is to activate a flag when seeing
rdf:Expression rather than rdf:Description and add the non-asserted
punctuation when outputting the triples.

Eh?
