I've been drafting a schedule to see if our target of last call at the 
beginning of May is attainable.  This is the worst sort of schedule; I 
started at the end and worked back - so this is not an estimate; its a "do 
we think we can do this"?
It looks very tight to me, but its what we have to do if we are to use the 
f2f to review last call comments.

Questions and Issues:

eric:    Can w3c team meet the publication schedule given preparations for 
www2002?

all:     Are there any holidays or other outages that will affect the schedule?

editors: Do you commit to achieving this schedule?

all:     Do we commit to the necessary detailed reviews for a last call 
publication as per this schedule?  I'd like to identify specific reviewers 
for each document.

all:     What other groups should we approach for last call comments?  I 
have, webont, xml schema, i18n, canonicalization,
DC,  PRISM, CC/PP as possibles but request advice.
