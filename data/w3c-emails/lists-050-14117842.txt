I have looked at revision 1.216

Another great document.

I would be happy with this going out as is, but do have a few suggestions
for the editor.

==============

(Fairly fast read).

Before last call I would like to give a thorough read and give
sentence-by-sentence suggestions for clarity improvement. I do not intend to
do that with this draft.


I was concentrating particularly on bagID this time round, and that seemed
OK.


Commnets:

section 3:

Note: "This particularly applies .... parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt."

somewhat confusing, in particular *all* info items are not available within
parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt.

I suggest

Unchanged:
"Note: Outside RDF/XML processing, all Information Items should be made
available to the application."

Changed:
"Note: The handling of XML content inside parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt
requires some other Information Items, to be determined."

or:
"Note: The handling of XML content inside parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt
minimally requires those Information Items required by Exclusive XML
Canonicalization."

(I think the second is the right answer with our resolution, but since this
draft does not make that explicit it is premature to say this).

Section 3.1.2
This handles xml:lang (and correctly deletes it), but fails to delete other
xml attributes.
ARP discards all attributes from the xml namespace. I have forgotten if we
have discussed this and decided what the correct behaviour is.

The ARP behaviour would be described by the following change:
Between
"value of the language property on the parent node."

"The subject property may be added "

insert new para
"Other attributes from the namespace "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"
are removed from the list of attributes."

***ISSUE***
The resolution we agreed on xml literals ignores xml:space on parent
elements. (i.e. the normal scoping of xml:space does not apply - if I
remember XC14N correctly). I did not highlight that at the time. That
behaviour is consistent with the text I suggest above, but might be
surprising.



Section 5.5
You want bagID to respect XML document order, as clearly stated
"3. Statements generated by the propertyEltList children by S4 in document
order "

I think the allowance to my sensibilities in
"S4 Handle the propertyEltList children nodes in document order (or any
order if none of them are rdf:li) "
is misplaced and could be simplified to
"S4 Handle the propertyEltList children nodes in document order"


Section 5.11 parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt is fine for now.

Section 5.13 parseTypeOtherPropertyElt

do we want this, since we seem to have decided that parseType is not an
appropriate extension mechanism. My preference would be to simply delete
this possibility. (It is a *change*).

Section 5.14
BagId stuff seems correct.
