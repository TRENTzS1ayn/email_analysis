I see the need to clarify my meaning when I refer to P, P+, D, U, etc. in
recent discussions.

I am not speaking about the earlier, entire proposals -- including their
expectations/requirements in the MT -- but only to the idioms they represent
for expressing the typing of literals in the graph. In all such cases, I am
talking about the (lexical_form, data_type) pairing model, previously
referred to as PDU or just PD, as defined in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0579.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0060.html

I apologise if this has caused any confusion.

With the exception of S ;-) if in the future I mean to refer to the entire
earler proposal, including those parts relating to the MT, I will say so
clearly. Otherwise, I am referring only to the idioms as they relate to the
PD model.

Regards,

Patrick
