A fair point ... my example is bad stylistically, but does show that the XML
syntax is as flexible as the n-triple syntax.

This too is a fair syntax ....

I suspect somewhat more confusing though ...

We still can get the confusion of using the same vocab both ways ...

e.g.

<rdf:RDF>
  <rdf:Expression rdf:about="#Bob>
      <ex:age>35</ex:age>
   </rdf:Expression>
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="#April>
      <ex:age>35</ex:age>
   </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>


and would need clarity about embedding


e.g.

<rdf:RDF>
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="#April>
      <ex:foo>
       <rdf:Expression rdf:about="#Bob>
          <ex:bar ex:doublyEmbedded="??"/>
        </rdf:Expression>
    </ex:foo>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

that clarity could be done (I would favour a one level reading like for
bagID).
