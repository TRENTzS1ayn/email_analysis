I'm not making any syntactic comments - I can invent an N-Triples
change and/or some RDF/XML to implement both of these ideas fairly
easily (if challenged).  I'd rather we concentrated on the model
aspects of this.

My concerns are:

* Is adding dark triples a good idea?

  I'd like use cases to support this.  Foundation and semweb layering
  is a start; informal indications that WebOnt need this is another.

* Is adding 'contexts'/whatever a good idea?

  Use cases would help here too; the widespread use of N3 {} 
  (TimBL calls formulas) is an indicator.

* Would these be required to implement RDF or optional?

  I suspect they'd have to be optional, in the way RDF Schema is optional.

* Is it a good idea to make these changes at this time in the WG process?

  Don't know; if this starts taking too long, too much energy, we
  should consider punting.
  (Although if we don't do it now, it won't be till a successor WG)

Dave
