(frankly no)

At somepoint DanC pointed out that it is good manners to have a first call
prior to last call.

I am concerned that we are not leaving the possibility for the community to
review the datatyping proposal.

In this schedule the first MT with datatyping *is* the last call.
The gap for commuity feedback on schema (with or without datatyping) before
the last call WD is available is (less than) a week.

As is, as far as I know, we don't have a finished datatyping proposal to
write up into the WDs.

On the other hand, last call is not a rec, and we should get community
feedback at that point ...

There is a webont f2f on 8th/9th April.

I am happy to review:
  Syntax
  Model Theory
  Test Cases (I will at least identify the syntactic test cases that ARP
fails, and try and verify them manually).

If there really are two weeks (Apr 12 - 26) to do it in then I probably can
find the time.

(I would suggest highlighting only the relevant section to c14n - they are
not RDF literate).
