I have surveyed some uses in my document (which was circulated as personal 
notes, not to do with this WG):

   http://www.ninebynine.org/RDFNotes/UsingContextsWithRDF.html

In particular, section 5.4:

I think optional, too, in that a (syntactic) subset that deals with ground 
facts should be just like CURRENT rdf.

A good question.

I'll punt the question, but suggest a process:  interested parties might 
work on a note to extend/accompany the RDF core work - if it comes together 
easily then we can look to publish as part of the RDF set;  otherwise it 
gets deferred and maybe published as a NOTE and/or merged with an RDF V2 
effort.
