A little unparliamentary that.  I hear calls of "withdraw".

It may be a little old maidish of me, but one of the virtues this WG has, 
in my view, been the respect in which members hold each other and each 
others views.

I'm sure this was meant in a jokey way, but I'd like to take the 
opportunity to remind folks that's not the sort of language we have 
typically used around here.
