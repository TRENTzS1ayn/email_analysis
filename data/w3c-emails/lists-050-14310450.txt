Jonathan,

I'd prefer, for the moment that folks do not cross post to both rdfcore and 
webont lists.  Jeremy was careful not to do so and I request that you also 
refrain from doing so.

My reason for this is to try to bound the volume of email and keep some 
structure to the discussion.  RDFCore is considering going to last call in 
early May, so I'd like to us to apply some self discipline and good process 
and keep focused on what we have to do to accomplish that.  I ask for your 
support.

As for the layering issue, I am committed to getting the WG's to work 
together to resolve it.  Folks from both WG's have already been working on 
this, and I have today, through the coordination group, asked for an update.

Once we have an assessment of the situation, we can decide how best to 
proceed.  In the meantime however, RDFCore is having some exploratory 
discussions.

I am concious that significant and hurried late changes to a spec are 
unlikely to improve its quality.  So I personally will be looking for ways 
in which RDFCore and WEBONT, working together, can take the time they need 
to work out what changes to RDF(S) are necessary to best integrate RDF and 
OWL.

In saying that, I have in mind that it should be possible to push the work 
done so far through the standards process and also that RDFCore can work 
with WEBONT over a longer period to address the layering and other issues 
that our current charter required us to postpone.

Please feel free to post a pointer to the archive version of this message 
to webont if you think it would be of interest to that community.  I, of 
course, have refrained from cross posting.

Brian
