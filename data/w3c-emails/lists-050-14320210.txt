Well *I* certainly viewed it as jokey, especially given the context (if 
you'll pardon the expression).  But I certainly second Brian's comment 
about the respect in which we hold each other.  At the same time, I also 
have to say that some of our "parliaments" have a somewhat rowdier 
history than the one you're referring to.  For example:

"On May 22, 1856, the "world's greatest deliberative body" became a 
combat zone. In one of the Senate's most dramatic and deeply ominous 
moments, a House member entered the chamber and beat a senator into 
unconsciousness."  [This was after the senator had characterized another 
as "noise some, squat, and nameless animal ..."]

"On February 22, 1902, John McLaurin, South Carolina's junior senator 
raced into the Senate chamber and pronounced that state's senior 
senator, Ben Tillman , guilty of "a willful, malicious, and deliberate 
lie." Standing nearby, Tillman spun around and punched McLaurin squarely 
in the jaw."

Then there's the April, 1850 incident:
"Two weeks later, [Vice-President Millard] Fillmore's worst fears were 
realized. When he ruled Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton out of 
order, Kentucky's Henry Clay , no friend of Benton, angrily charged that 
the vice president's action was an attack on the power and dignity of 
the Senate. The ensuing debate sparked a bitter exchange between Benton 
and Mississippi Senator Henry Foote . As the burly Benton pushed aside 
his chair and moved menacingly up the center aisle toward the diminutive 
Foote, Foote pulled a pistol."
