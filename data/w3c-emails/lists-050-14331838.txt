Yes, I have to say I've really enjoyed being involved in the RDF effort
for this reason. There's (for the most part) a civility that's often
missing in online technical discussions. Like Brian, I tend to jump on
swearing on the RDF IG lists. It may matter less on small WG lists than on
larger lists open to public subscribers, but I think it's worth erring on
the prudish side, for reasons nicely articulated by Rick Jelliffe in [1].

My previous outburst on this subject is at [2],
[[
Could you please try to avoid swearing on RDF Interest Group mailing
lists? While it may sound petty, keeping some control over the tone of our
language helps to create a less threatening, hostile environment. For
those of us know each other or have met offline, out-of-band context may
implicitly lighten the tone, but for those new to this community, swearing
can create a sour and unfriendly atmosphere. So I'd appreciate it if folk
could stick to this simple guideline (ie: swearing: don't). I've no
interest in getting into debate about whether "dash it", "darn" etc count
as swearing. The real point is about (real or perceived) tone and
attitude rather than vocabulary. Perhaps we should have followed Rick
Jelliffe's Schematron model and called this the www-rdf-calendar-lovein
list? See [1] for Rick's critique of the XML-DEV mailing list culture and
on the  need to foster non-confrontational debating styles if we are to
be truly pluralist and international in our work. Swearing on a mailing
list is very different from doing so in real life, where you've a better
sense of audience and audience reaction.
