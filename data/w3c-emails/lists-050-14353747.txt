Heh sorry, teach me to cut and paste on a Macintosh; forgot to press apple-c.

That (for the curious) was an animated gif of some photos I took in
Kowloon, Hong Kong at last year's web conference. I animated a bunch of
photos to make a cheapy movie effect. It succeeds in reminding me of
Kowloon (apart from the heat/humidity, no HTML tags for that, thankfully).

Rick's msg was http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xml-dev/message/18922

I'd have changed the topic but I think this side-thread has just about
exhausted itself.
