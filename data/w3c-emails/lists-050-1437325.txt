The recent message from the DAML folks requests both explicit (local)
and implicit (global) data typing, but does not say whether both are
required to coexist in the same knowledge base.

Could this please be clarified?

I am assuming that both local and global mechanisms must be able to coexist,
but it would be useful if this were stated explicitly.

Thanks,

Patrick
