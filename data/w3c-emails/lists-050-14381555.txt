Probably doable, insofar as the datatyping portions are concerned,
with the caveat that it will reflect what is agreed upon at that
point and may require non-trivial modification should we decide to
revamp the DT solution in any way (but I guess that's part of the
definition of a working draft ;-)

Will certainly try.

I hope/plan to review both primer and syntax-- though unfortunately I
cannot provide an absolute commitment as it will be time-permitting, in
and around other critical work (both for the WG and for my 'day job')
and there is real chance I may not be able to review them at the level
of detail needed.
