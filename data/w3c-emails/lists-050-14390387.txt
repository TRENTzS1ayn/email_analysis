Would it be reasonable to alert the most relevant groups to the planned
schedule, and point them to the WD's along the way, so they realize that
they will not have a long leisurely time to review the last call spec?

It will reflect the present state of concensus -- and though not finished,
it seems pretty close to complete, even with the remaining issues.

Quite so. And even if folks do not choose to review the WD's along
the way to last call, they can be made aware of the short review period
after last call well in advance of that time, so they should be
"primed" for review.

Cheers,
