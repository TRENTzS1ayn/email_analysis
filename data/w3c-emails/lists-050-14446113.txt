My original message highlighted:
[[[
Test case 007 - 013
    examples of the combination of a base URI and a
    relative URI or same document reference, showing
    various different cases.
]]]

and the three error cases (now error001/test017 and test 15 and 16).

I have difficulty with deleting these, since practically these are:
+ significant
+ subject to dispute

Hence, refusing to judge on this, because it is not in our competence, acts
to make the meaning of RDF/XML documents that contain XML Base (in the
dubious cases) doubtful.

The fact that they generate discussion is indicative of the need for at
least guidance from the WG; even if it is not in our competence.

Some of these test cases are no brainers, others do commit to a position.

The former are not objectionable and can be retained without much problem;
the latter are needed for a standard use of xml:base.

I am arguing a catch 22, if you want to delete these, it is because some
people disagree with them, which is why we need them. I am happy with
deleting the ones that nobody disagrees with.

cf.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Mar/0061.html

which disagrees with some of these test cases.
