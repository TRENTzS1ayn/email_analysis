Great; I particularly wanted to get that complete and try to get as
readable as possible.

Yes.

I'll go for something nearer the first offered change with a
reference to canonicalisation somewhere, indication what will be changing.

I forgot to add that.  The Infoset handles xml:base itself but no
other xml attributes (xmlns being taken by XML Namespaces) so

I'll add words to delete this.

I think I have something like that, I'll try to make it clearer.
The reference to the language property is always as a property of
the current element node.

Not sure what you mean here

OK

I'll leave what I have now, waiting for resolutionm of the c14n
stuff.  I might add a note about it somewhere appropriate near
parseType literal.

Yes.

Yes.  But I'll add a more prominent note that this is a change something like:

  There are two values defined for rdf:parseType:  "Resource" and "Literal"
  all other values are requivalent to "Literal" and generate
  XML Literal content and no extra statements.
