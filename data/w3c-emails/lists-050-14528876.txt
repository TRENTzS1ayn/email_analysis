We have students coming to work with us and the plan is that they will work 
on developing tools to support W3C process stuff;  basically daughter of Jema.

They will be led by one of our colleagues, Andy Seaborne, designer and 
implementer of RDQL.  To get an understanding of what we do, Andy would 
like to observe at the telecon tomorrow.

Does anyone have any objections?

Brian
