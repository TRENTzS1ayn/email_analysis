Unfortunately, but speaking realistically, as a Primer Editor I don't
think I can commit to this schedule (I can work very hard to meet it, of
course, but I can't honestly commit to it).  It allows 3 weeks to a last
call WD when we've just now got the first WD out, and I'm going to be
out of town during much of one of those weeks (at a technical workshop,
so it's unlikely I'll be doing a lot of work in the evenings, and it's
at a resort [blast it!], so I'm not sure what kind of Internet access
I'll have anyway).  Regarding "holidays or other outages", I don't know
about any of the other Americans in the group, but I still have my tax
returns to do (April 15 is the deadline).  "Outage" is a good word to
describe that process;  it sure doesn't count as a "holiday"!.
