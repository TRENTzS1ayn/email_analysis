The only one that wasn't approved was test017/error001 and that is
because I think the algorithm for resolving the URI was wrong in the
proposed test017.nt

I think resolving 
  base URI "mailto:Jeremy_Carroll@hp.com"
  with URI "relfile"
will give
  URI "mailto:relfile"
not
  URI "mailto:/refile"

because mailto is a non-hierachical URI scheme (does not start
mailto:/ so can be detected by apps).
