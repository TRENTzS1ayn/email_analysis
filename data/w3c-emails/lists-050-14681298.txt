I agree that test017 is wrong. Your analysis is better than mine was.

However I have reverted back to it being an error. (error001).

The history from my point of view is:

+ I suggested it was an error because of non-hierarchical URI
+ The wg asked me to reconsider
+ I pointed to text in RFC 2396 that supported my position
+ DaveB indicated implementation difficulty in distinguishing hierarchical
and non-hierarchical schemes
+ I agreed with DaveB and suggested test017 as resolving that
+ Graham pointed out that RFC 2396 gives an easy syntactic distinction
between hierarchical and non-hierarchical schemes (is the first : followed
by /?)
+ I agreed with Graham and reverted to regarding this case as an error


Meanwhile ...

+ DaveB expressed concern that we were doing something that was not our job
+ I expressed limited agreement
+ TAG discussion has started up about URIs
+ Brian suggested deleting the relevant test cases
+ I identified the test cases, and mildly opposed deleting them



====

I think an outcome in which we do not *need* to provide test cases for URI
resolution is the ideal.
At least some of the test cases I posted are unclear, and hence require
clarification.

Brian's proposal may result in the clarity that we need without us stepping
beyond our competence.
