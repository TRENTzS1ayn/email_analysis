That's what I mean, yeah.

No. I've got no problem with my conceptual RDF graphs having any and all
datatypes; I'm flexible enough to cope with that. When it comes to (RDF
implementation X), doubtless such a conceptual ideal will be realised
(or at least, approximated) _behind_the_scenes_ by some kind of what is,
effectively, a lexical representation. I don't really care about that,
though, because my conceptual view of the RDF graph (and the view I'd
like any APIs to fake for me) is that the values are really there in the
graph.

Actually, the first half of this doesn't have to be true.

If it's broken really badly - don't fix it either.
