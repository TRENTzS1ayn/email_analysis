I think this is an error:  that a relative URI cannot be resolved with 
respect to a mailto: URI.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt, Section 5 (final 2 paragraphs):
[[[
    It is not necessary for all URI within a given scheme to be
    restricted to the <hier_part> syntax, since the hierarchical
    properties of that syntax are only necessary when relative URI are
    used within a particular document.  Documents can only make use of
    relative URI when their base URI fits within the <hier_part> syntax.
    It is assumed that any document which contains a relative reference
    will also have a base URI that obeys the syntax.  In other words,
    relative URI cannot be used within a document that has an unsuitable
    base URI.

    Some URI schemes do not allow a hierarchical syntax matching the
    <hier_part> syntax, and thus cannot use relative references.
]]]

Noting some following discussion in the list, I fail to see what harm or 
difficulty is incurred by saying now that this is an error.

I also don't think this is really an architectural issue, and not part of 
what TAG is discussing.  If I'm wrong, and TAG subsequently say that 
mailto:-relative references are OK, then that can be adopted (harmlessly, 
IMO) by an erratum.
