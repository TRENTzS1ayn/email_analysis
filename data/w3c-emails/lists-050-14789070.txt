Abstract

   This document describes a media type (application/rdf+xml) for use
   with the XML serialization of the Resource Description Framework
   (RDF).  RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by
   facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF
   provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data
   exchange and follows the W3C design principles of interoperability,
   evolution, and decentralization.

1. Introduction

   RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by
   facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF
   provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data
   exchange and follows the W3C design principles of interoperability,
   evolution, and decentralization.

   While the RDF data model can be serialized in many ways, the W3C has
   defined the RDF/XML syntax [1] to allow RDF to be serialized in an
   XML format.  The application/rdf+xml media type allows RDF consumers
   to identify RDF/XML documents so that they can be processed properly.

   It is important to note that RDF language is used to transmit
   meaningful information, and thus has the same legal status as
   assertions, in say, English would.

2. application/rdf+xml Registration

   This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures [3]

      MIME media type name: text

      MIME subtype name: rdf+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: charset

         Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in
         [5].

      Encoding considerations:

         Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in
         [5].

      Security considerations:

         Security considerations include many of those described in
         section 10 of [5] and more, due to the semantic nature of RDF.
         RDF documents may make assertions about anything, and thus RDF-
         based systems want to be certain that they can trust the
         document.  It is expected that future work with Digital
         Signature and "Web of Trust" will make it more clear how to
         build secure RDF systems.

      Interoperability considerations:

         For maximum interoperability it is recommend that RDF files use
         the Basic (un-abbreviated) RDF Syntax, since this is most
         likely to be understood by RDF parsers and remain stable
         through future RDF specifications.  It is also recommended that
         RDF documents do not use processing instructions, as RDF
         parsers give no meaning to them.

      Published specification: see [1]

      Applications which use this media type:

         RDF is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported
         by a wide range of Web user agents and authoring tools.

         Magic number(s): none

            Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
            identify RDF, RDF documents will have the sequence "http://
            www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" to identify the RDF
            namespace.  This will usually be towards the top of the
            document.

         File extension(s): .xrdf, .rdf

         Macintosh File Type Code(s): "TEXT"

      Author/Change controller:

         The RDF specification is a work product of the World Wide Web
         Consortium.  The W3C and the W3C RDF Core Working Group have
         change control over the specification.

3. Fragment Identifiers

   Section 4.1 of the URI specification [4] notes that the semantics of
   a fragment identifier (part of a URI after a "#") is a property of
   the data resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and
   interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type
   of the retrieval result.

   However, in RDF, the thing identified by a URI with fragment
   identifier does not bear any particular relationship to the thing
   identified by the URI alone.  This contradicts some readings of the
   URI specification [4], so caution is recommended when creating new
   RDF terms which use fragment identifiers.

   The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments
   in an RDF document.

4. Historical Considerations

   This media type was reserved in [5], saying:

      RDF documents identified using this MIME type are XML documents
      whose content describes metadata, as defined by [RDF].  As a
      format based on XML, RDF documents SHOULD use the '+xml' suffix
      convention in their MIME content-type identifier.  However, no
      content type has yet been registered for RDF and so this media
      type should not be used until such registration has been
      completed.
