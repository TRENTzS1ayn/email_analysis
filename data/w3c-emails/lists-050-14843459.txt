Looks good... some comments.

Suggest use:  draft-w3c-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-xx.txt

(I'm thinking this may get higher IESG/IANA/RFC-editor attention when going 
for publication/registration.)

Suggest include an IANA considerations, along the lines of:

x. IANA considerations

This document calls for registration of a new MIME content-type, according 
to the registration template in section 2.

I strongly suggest dropping this last paragraph.  If there's anything 
likely to snarl up approval through IETF/IESG/IANA processes, I think this 
is it.  And it's not necessary to make this point for registering the 
content type.

Don't you mean "application" ?

(I really think text is wrong here:  that media type is meant to be for 
human readable text -- it is now generally felt in MIME circles that 
text/html is an error.  RDF is an order of magnitide less readable to 
(non-technical) people)

I don't recall the distinction between basic and abbreviated RDF syntax 
surviving into the latest syntax draft.  Further, I think it would be a 
mistake to propagate this preference, as the abbreviated syntax is, IMO, a 
bridge between "traditional" XML and RDF and makes it much easier to 
achieve deployment of RDF use in real-world applications.

---------------^^^^

The anti-marketeer in me thinks that "wide" should be dropped.

Do you mean "text"?  (I don't know, just checking.)

I think a w3t contact might be appropriate here.

Hmmm... for longevity, I'm wondering about the appropriateness of saying 
RDFcore WG here.  Just commenting.

In due course, I think this reference should be expanded to include author, 
title, etc.

It's normal for people not to put personal addresses as part of their 
contact details:  name, optional organization and email address is 
enough.  (I mention this because it may not be wise to put a personal 
postal address in a very visible public document.)  (I'm assuming that is a 
personal address.)

....

And finally, I'd suggest we go for an initial Internet-draft publication of 
this as soon as the WG is happy with it.
