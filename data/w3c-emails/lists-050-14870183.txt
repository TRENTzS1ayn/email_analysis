I'd agree with Graham here; actually, I'd go further. RDF does _not_
have the same legal status as written English assertions until test
cases say it does. That's (in my opinion) unlikely to happen for quite
some time:

- RDF/XML is gibberish. It's going to be close to impossible to get a
  court to give it the same status as English.
- a court can decide on the meaning of English because there's a
  "common interpretation" to draw from. In the case of libellous RDF,
  there's a good defence:
  - my intended interpretation for those particular URI-labelled
    properties is completely innocent;
  - any english content in a URI label is inadmissable because RDF
    is built on something which says, "URIs are opaque"*

Unless/until you have a "common interpretation", you're not going to get
very far. I don't think the W3C has sanctioned a schema for name-calling
yet :-)

This is, I think, distinct from the use of RDF to transmit
machiine-generated content for machine consumption.

Otherwise, good stuff.

IANAL, but that doesn't mean I don't have an opinion-
