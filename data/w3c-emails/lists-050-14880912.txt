Yes, of course. Copy-and-paste error on my part.

OK, dropped. [Take note, DanC, TimBL.]

Any suggestions for interop considerations, then? DaveB, any suggestions?

Dropped.

I don't think it's worth the bother to create a new one for RDF.

Note that it says "the W3C _and_ the W3C RDF Core Working Group" (emph.
