As an aside, and in no way intended critically, I just wanted to remind WG
members who are maintaining local drafts on their own servers that the
www-archive@w3.org list is available. Periodically sending snapshots (eg.
attaching a .zip with images etc too) might be worth doing, to make sure
that the w3.org historical record captures these documents at each stage
of their lifecycle.

(wishing  w3c-rdf-syntax and w3c-rdf-schema archives were similarly part
of the public record... maybe after we get to REC I'll put the time into
seeking permission for those archives to go public)
