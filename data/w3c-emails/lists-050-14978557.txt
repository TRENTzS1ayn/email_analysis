Re: http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/rdf-mediatype.{txt, xml, html}

Aaron and I discussed this on IRC today and we updated both our
documents to be consistent in a few bits.

I guess I should note that I initiated this new draft from Aaron
since I asked Graham Klyne for advice on how best to get this
registration done at the appropriate time.  I noted that some
other W3C work hasn't actually got the registration complete
for the documents, so wanted to be prepared.

The general plan is to get a slim I-D out soonish (which has a
lifetime of pub date+6 months) citing the current WDs. When our docs
are nearing candidate recommendations, start working out how to
progress this I-D along the IETF information RFC standards track.
When we reach CR/PR, ask to get them out as Informational RFCs and
get the type registered.

I think it shouldn't be too much work to get this done in parallel
with our existing work, with Aaron leading it.

Dave
