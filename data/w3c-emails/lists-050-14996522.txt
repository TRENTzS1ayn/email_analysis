This was pretty much the same worry as the one I raised this morning about
the serialization text (though going in the opposite direction):

http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Serialising
[[
The basic approach uses the basic RDF syntax from [RDF-MS].
 *  All blank nodes are assigned arbitrary URIs.
...
]]

BTW I wrote a reply to your msg earlier but crashed my ssh session and
lost it. Short version: none of my comments are urgent enough to delay
publication. Consider them early feedback on the next WD. In particular, I
withdraw my comment re rdf:Description (though I'll continue to not use it
myself).
