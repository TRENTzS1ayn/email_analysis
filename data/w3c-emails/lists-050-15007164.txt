I must have missed discussion/decision on this, presumably: reading the
Syntax doc (and comments such as those above, which indicate
that the Syntax is a `syntax for the graph per MT spec not M+S'99)...

Why is the MT spec not a normative reference, while the (broken old) M+S
spec is normative? Should implementors code to M+S or new MT's notion of the
graph? Presumably the latter, since we talk of bNodes etc.

Is the lack of a normative ref caution stemming from the fact that the MT
includes stuff like RDFS closure rules, and we don't want to give
impresssion that syntax can't be implemented without that stuff? (eg.
see our exchange earlier re my idea for using subPropertyOf to serialise
XML-unfriendly predicates). It should somehow be possible to make
normative ref from syntax to MT without parsers having to have inference
engines, shouldn't it? (for some sense of 'normative reference').

also, the abstract references (by direct hyperlink not footnote) MT
version of sept 2001 while the footnotes reference the valentine's edition.
