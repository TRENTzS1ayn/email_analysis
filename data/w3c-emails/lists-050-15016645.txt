The MT is quite clear; literals are not allowed as subjects.
N-Triples reflects this and the syntax doc also doesn't emit such
N-Triples (not that it could from the current rdf/xml syntax).

That's the general reason.

I guess.

I was wondering about a specific conformance statement something like:

  [[To implement this specification requires reading and understanding:

    XML, XML-NS, Infoset, XML Base, RFC 2396 (URIs), RFC 3023 (XML
    Media Types), RDF Test Cases
  ]]

and for understanding the specification, also RFC 2119 (KEYWORDS).
Maybe Model Theory could be in another related list.

Fixed; and in a few other places.


Back to trying to get this draft finished...
