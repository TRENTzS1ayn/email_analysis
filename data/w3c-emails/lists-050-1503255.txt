Nor do I, presuming their representation is system/platform/implementation
neutral.

Hence my description of an API that both deals with the variant idioms
and provides an optimized interface to actual values, insofar as it
knows about the idioms and datatypes in question and is able to provide
an internalized representation of values for a given data type.

Sure. But we're talking about the RDF graph here, not an API.

I don't see how it can't be true, if we are to maintain a generic,
portable, implementation-independent means of knowledge interchange.
