My thoughts on this are based on:  I'm not sure that referring and denoting 
are the same thing here.

In Web architecture terms, referring relates in some way to a value you get 
when you do a Web retrieval (dereference), right?  In RDF MT terms, URIref 
denotations are required of any interpretation.  Somewhere between these, 
there is the idea of some intended interpretation that (a) satisfies the 
model theoretic aspects of RDF, and (b) is consistent with what you get 
when dereferencing Web URIs.  I think there will just about always be 
several interpretations that satisfy these tests.

I don't see that a statement being meaningless takes away from the meaning 
of the other statements.  So if there are truly no constraints on the 
denotation of the poison URI, I think it might as well be a blank node.

They seem pretty much the same to me.  Rat2 may not add any new 
constraints, but any interpretation that satisfies Rat1 can be adjusted to 
also satisfy Rat2 (by including the necessary values in  the relational 
extension of rdf:object) without introducing any possible conflict with 
observations based on URI referral in the Web, if the poison URI cannot refer.

I would argue that the "meaning" of some RDF is not the "conjunction of the 
meaning of individual triples".  Conjunction of "meaning" seems to be a 
meaningless (er, ill-defined) idea.  It is the _truth_ under some 
interpretation that is a conjunction.


 From your quotes, these are the ones I think are relevant:

In summary:  there are indeed research issues here, but I'm not sure that 
non-referring URIs are a problem (other than not being very useful).
