This is, surprise, going down a rathole fast, so this is my last pulic

As I said to Dan: the MT defines an interpretation like this; it tells
you what a "standard intended interpretation" will look like.

It _would_ be possible to rewrite the MT document to use partial
interpretation functions, but all the theorems and definitions would
just have extra clauses (and proofs become similarly unmanageable) - for
very little (no) gain.

A better bet (I think) is to just do something Herbrandish - that is,
keep the current definition of "interpretation"; if you _do_ wind up
with one of Dan's problematical graphs (that is, one with a URI-labelled
node with no "meaning", ie, which doesn't denote anything*), you don't
really hurt yourself by letting it denote some mathematical figment that
doesn't collide with anything else.

I'm still not convinced that this is really a problem; just trying to
summarise what's giving danbri sleepless nights.

:-) - in other words, producing a uniform resource identifier that
doesn't identify a resource :-)
