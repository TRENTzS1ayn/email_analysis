Thanks for the initial reply, Jan.
I don't want to start a complex debate without first having seen a complete
reply, just noticing that this is such a fundamental architectural decision
that a complete and careful pro/con analysis is due. The above three "pro"
reasons
all have good counterarguments, so I'll wait to see for the full official
motivation-and-reasoning behind such a milestone decision.

I can well imagine... ;)
