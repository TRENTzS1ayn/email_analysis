Massimo,

The discussion of whether or not to use Skolemization did come up, at some 
length as I recall, in our first F2F.  The conclusion is reflected 
(briefly) in the current MT document:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#skolem

In particular:
[[[
Also, skolemization would not be an appropriate operation when applied to 
anything other than the antecendent of an entailment. A skolemization of a 
query would represent a completely different query.
]]]

[Pat:  I think there's a typo there 'antecendent'->'antecedent']
