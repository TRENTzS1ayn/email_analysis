well, bNodes are quite all-round I think
- in an graph with asserted facts they are existentials
  which could be written as skolem constants, indeed
- in a query (graph) they are universals
- in the LHS (graph) of an entailment they are universals
- in owl lists the are functional terms
  i.e. (a b) denotes the same thing wether it's
  written in one graph, or written in another graph
- in the RHS (graph) of an entailment they are skolem
  functions which could be written as daml lists (I think)
