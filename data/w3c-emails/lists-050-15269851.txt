Aaron, thanks for pushing this forward.

The security considerations section looks a bit risky and imprecise; a flag 
red enough to attract attention, but having no answers.

[[The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments in an 
RDF document.]]

Is that true?  Hmmm, we said rdf:ID="foo" was equivalent to 
rdf:about="#foo".  Does rdf:ID actually define a fragment in the 
document?  Did we mean that to happen with rdf:about too?

I'd like to see two things:

   o an overview of the ietf process, preferably from someone who has done 
this before.  Are we cooked to start this?

   o Your current draft copied to an archive and review by at least two 
members of the WG.  If we can get volunteers asap, I can put it on the 
agenda for approval this Friday.

Brian
