Perhaps Graham can provide this, I've not published an RFC with it before.
Vaguely it goes something like this:

1. Publish an Internet-Draft
2. If comments, fix them and go back to step 1
3. Get approval from the IESG/Regional Coordinator
4. Have the RFC Editor publish it.

That was the intent in including it in my last message.

An older draft has been reviewed by Graham and DaveB, this one incorporates
the fixes they suggested.
