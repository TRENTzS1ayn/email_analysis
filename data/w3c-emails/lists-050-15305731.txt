A last call for a first draft ;-)

Aaron, this looks good and I see no reason not to publish it.  I do have a 
comment below for consideration, maybe in a later round.

Brian, in private exchanges I recommended that this be released fairly soon 
to give the IETF community time to review it and get used to the idea that 
it's coming.  Releasing an Internet Draft is a very informal affair -- 
possibly even less so than releasing a W3C working draft -- so there's no 
sense of commitment implied.  As long as nobody's going to be embarassed by 
the content I see no reason not to publish.

When it has been published, I would be happy to ask Ned Freed (IETF area 
director and a leading author of the MIME specs) for advice on how to make 
sure the (IETF-tree) MIME registration can be approved as soon as possible 
after our documents are published as recommendations.

When I reviewed this bit earlier, I didn't stand back far enough.

What is needed to specify here, I think, is the meaning of a fragment 
identifier when applied to an RDF document URI, as opposed to one _used_ in 
an RDF document.  Maybe something like this?:

[[[
A fragment identifier applied to an RDF document refers to the RDF resource 
defined within the document using an rdf:ID attribute whose value is the 
fragment identifier, or equivalently identified using an rdf:about 
attribute with the document URI and fragment identifier.
]]]

Hmmm... that's not quite right either:  that's what _RDF_ means, but what 
should a general web rendering engine (not RDF) -- e.g. an ordinary web 
browser -- do with an identifier <http://example.org/somedoc.rdf#fragid> 
?   Would it be all the statements about the resource thus identified?  A 
concatenation of the description elements thus identified, contained in an 
enclosing <rdf:RDF> element?
