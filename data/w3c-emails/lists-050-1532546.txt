Point taken, but to do so would be IMO a crippling decision.

Just as RDF is neutral to ontologies beyond that needed for its
core, RDF should also IMO be neutral with regards to data typing
schemes.

This doesn't mean that folks shouldn't be looking at standardizing
tools and content on common data types, but that RDF should be
insulated from such decisions, so that it can remain static as
the world evolves.

I'm not against XML Schema data types. I use them. I just don't see
them belonging in the core definition of RDF no more so than any
application specific ontology does.

Cheers,

Patrick
