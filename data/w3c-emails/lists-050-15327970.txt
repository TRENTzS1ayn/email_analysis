That's pretty much it.  From step 3, you're somewhat in the hands of the 
IESG and there is probably a last call of some kind involved.

Theoretically, it's possible to have an informational RFC published without 
IESG approval, but since we're after registration in the MIME type "IETF 
tree" then I don't think that's an option here.
