I just took a trawl through the closed issues to check which ones we have 
test cases for, and as side effect claim I've completed Jan's action.  My 
analysis is attached.  I'd appreciate someone checking it.

The summary is:

   we need test cases for:
     rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces
     rdfms-xmllang
     rdfms-rdf-names-use (DaveB - you may have done these and I didn't find 
them)
     rdfms-abouteach (to show whether its illegal or just a warning)
     rdfs-subPropertyOf-semantics

there are some others to be approved, a couple of special cases to be 
resolved and the WD lists need updating.

Please can I have volunteers to prepare these test cases.

We also need to update the WD with a description of the different types of 
tests.  So  far, I've spotted:

   parser tests:     rdf/xml   -> n-triples
   parser warnings:  rdf/xml   -> n-triples
   parser errors:    rdf/xml
   seralizer tests:  n-triples -> rdf/xml
   rdf entailment:
   rdfs entailment:
   rdf non-entailment:
   rdfs non-entailment:

and a description of the manifest file structure.

Jan/Jos - you've done some work on this; I was wondering if you could 
provide some pointers.

Jan, I get the impression you are a bit busy at present and I think you are 
looking for some help.  Any volunteers.

Brian
