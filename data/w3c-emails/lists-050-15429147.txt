I will try to come up with one for
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-subPropertyOf-semantics

one pointer, also due to Jeremy, is
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Mar/0102.html
BTW, our current entailment test case description uses lists,
but the list topic will be discussed next week or so

Have a nice Easter, to all of you!
