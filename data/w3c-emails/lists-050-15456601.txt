Unfortunately, it seems you've reviewed an older draft and many of your

Good question, I'm not sure what the IETF thinks about that sort of thing.

This was changed to:

         It is recommended that RDF documents follow the newer RDF/XML
         Syntax Grammar [1] as opposed to the older RDF Model and Syntax
         specification [3].

Can you explain what you mean here?

In what situations would they not have this?

Danbri is in the latest draft, after asking him off list.

Clearly, the point that needs to be made is that it can name any resource.
I'm not sure how to word this, though.

I'm having trouble following this. For one thing, the element isn't an
RDF/XML document and "RDF/XML representation" isn't defined anywhere.
