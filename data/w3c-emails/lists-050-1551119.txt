Attached are illustrations/diagrams showing the PDU "Pairing"
Data Typing model interpretations for the S/A and S/B idioms
based on that Model.

Of course, these interpretations disregard the coexistence
incompatabilities both between the A and B idioms themselves
as well as the P/P+/D/U idioms...

Regards,

Patrick
