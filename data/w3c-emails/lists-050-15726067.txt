We should be clarifing which nodes are identical in:


<rdf:RDF
    xmlns:eg="http://example.org/#">
  <eg:Andre rdf:about="http://example.org/#x">
    <eg:foo rdf:resource="http://example.org/#Andr%c3%a9"/>
    <eg:bar rdf:resource="http://example.org/#Andr%C3%A9"/>
  </eg:Andre>
</rdf:RDF>

is the rdf:type of eg:x the same as its <eg:foo> or its <eg:bar> value or
neither.

The WG decision clarified along the "They are clearly different character
strings" route that you advocated for the <eg:foo> and <eg:bar> values.

It is somewhat contrived, but illustrative that the common understanding of
M&S as doing the % encodings before forming the graph is not clear.

Options in the face of this example include:
- decide the example is illegal (e.g. eg:Andre does not match the typed
node production)
- decide that % encoding is upper case
- decide not to do % encoding when forming the graph (what the group chose)
- decide that the example is non-deterministic
- decide to recode %c3%a9 in upper case and that % encode e in upper case
(this is what ARP does)
- decide that the example is not important


None of these is cost free, none is backwardly compatible.

No, not robustly. To reverse the %-encoding you have to assume UTF-8.
I believe that Nestl(e-accute)(reg) in 8839-1 is also legal UTF-8.

We are deciding that what RFC 2396 calls "original character sequences" are
more important for us than the %-encoded forms. This is not a change to RFC
2396 nor is it incompatible with it.

This change is already in XML (through erratum 26), it is already in xlink.
It is in many other W3C specs.

The logic of it is that there is a need for an update to RFC 2396 that
recognises this migration; but we, a small group, are a small part of a
bigger picture of change.
