I find the pictures very compelling, but nevertheless oppose this.
The problem is the knock on impact.
This is not just bending our charter, it's driving a coach-and-horses
through it - in that the syntactic changes in RDF/XML that will be required
are, (guessing) quite substantial; creating a significant backward
compatibility issue.

I think the PD proposal has nearly as much elegance, and certainly would
permit a later migration to P+, while being probably the most in-charter
proposal on the table.
