Yes, I'm free to do all sorts of stuff.

I suppose I misspoke: it's not that the recent
datatypes proposals prevent me from doing this;
it's just that they don't support me in doing
it either.

They don't provide for interoperability among
people who want to do this.


Let me rephrase: is it a problem that there's
no specific support, including examples,
for using XML Schema datatype facets?
e.g. "integers between 5 and 10"
or "strings that match '\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d'".
