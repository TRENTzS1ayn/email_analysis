I suggest it isn't.  Heres why: we shouldn't expect to be able to 
*express* a datatype in RDF. The actual definitions of the datatypes 
is done outside RDF, and RDF then *uses* the datatypes so defined 
(assuming they have somehow been given a special URI which can be 
used by an RDF engine to retrieve the relevant machinery). So if 
someone defines a datatype  like, say xsdd:integersBetweenFiveAndTen, 
then the RDF datatyping should work with that as well as with any 
other datatype. What that URI needs to 'supply' is well-defined:

1. A recognizer for members of the lexical space of the datatype.
2. A computable mapping from members of the lexical space to (some 
canonical representation of) members of the value space.

and that's all, in principle, though it wouldn't hurt to have a few 
others as well, eg an identity recognizer for lexical forms if (2) is 
expensive to compute.
