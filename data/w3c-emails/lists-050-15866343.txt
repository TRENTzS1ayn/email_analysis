10: Issue: rdf-charmod-resources
Approval of Jeremy's draft message to I18N.  


See:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0013.html


11: Issue rdfs-isDefinedBy-semantics
It is proposed that the WG resolves that:

 - isDefinedBy is a Property
 - it has no further semantics in the RDF Model Theory

Aaron also propose this.  I'm not sure this is necessary.
 - further subclasses of it may be created by others
 - it is out of scope for RDF Core to create these subclasses

  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-isDefinedBy-semantics
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0478.html


12: Issue rdfs-clarify-subClass-and-instance
It is proposed that the WG resolves that:
 - subClassOf and rdf:type are defined in the RDF Model Theory
 - the RDF Schema spec and RDF Primer provide adequate descriptions of these
properties
 - action Brian to respond to the issue raiser with helpful explanatory text
