I'm working out the details... cwm seems to cooperate when
there are two continents but not when there are six...
I hope to get back to you shortly...

Yes, any form of closed list involves negation. The whole
point of a closed list is to be able to conclude that something is
*not* in it.

But I don't think we can condone it.

i.e. we can't say "no, that file isn't RDF, but you're free
to put <rdf:RDF> at the top of it."

It's sorta like the XSLT-template-in-HTML-document's-clothing
situation that has come up in the TAG. For the sake of
a coherent architecture, it's important that each document's
meaning as a formula is clear, and doesn't depend on
whether you use an RDF parser or a WebOnt parser.

Hmm... I'm not sure how to make this point clearly...

No, it's an interoperability nightmare.

Not if you want my support.

The latter is unacceptable; I'd object.

The former is ugly; I'd abstain.
