Your points are well taken, and I feel a small bit of
shame for my radical suggestion, but the elegance of
P/P+ is hard not to become infatuated with, and we
all know how infatuation can cloud judgement...  ;-)

I agree that P/D is the next best thing, given the
constraints of the charter.

I guess P/P+ must wait for RDF 2.0 or the like.
