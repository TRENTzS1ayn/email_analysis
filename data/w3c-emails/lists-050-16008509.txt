If I had been there, I would have dissented. I wasn't, and didn't, but for
the record I have two problems with the detail (if not the intent) of this
resolution.

(i) we don't specialise properties with sub-class relations; the correct
term is sub-property. these are different relationships in rdf.

(ii) it is not out of scope for RDF Core to create these sub-properties,
we have merely decided to focus our energies elsewhere. The phrase 'out of
scope' shouldn't be over-used for everything we decide not to do. The
charter asks us to complete work on RDFS; this could quite plausibly
include refinements of rdfs:isDefinedBy based on a better understanding of
(for eg) the relationship between RDF Schema and XML Schema, or of the
needs of WebOnt (eg. mechanisms such as daml:imports).

I don't want this re-opened, but wanted these points on record.


A couple more casual comments below. Nothing major.

Phew :)

One reading: If URIrefs are names, http://example.org/a and
http://example.org/b could be names for the same thing.

One option I discussed face to face with brian: renaming rdfs:isDefinedBy
to be called rdfs:ns or rdfs:namespace. We wondered whether doing so might
make its purpose more transparent. Not sure.
