Hi Folks,

I think we've decided to hold the RDFCore f2f meeting in June at HP's 
offices.  Julie has gathered some hotel information for folks, which I've 
copied below.

HP is located to the north of the city.  Folks have a basic choice to 
make.  Do you want to stay in the centre of the city where there are pubs, 
restaurants etc nearby, or do you want to stay within walking distance of 
HP, in a rather bleaker environment.  If you stay in the centre, then HP is 
about a 20 minute cab ride away.

HP folks visiting often stay at the Marriot.  The Holiday Inn near HP is a 
new Holiday Inn Express.

I imagine we will organise a dinner though it will likely be self 
funding.  If folks choose to stay in the centre, then we'll probably have 
dinner in a restaurant there.  If you choose to stay close to HP, then I'd 
suggest dinner at one of several country pubs nearby, provided there are 
enough cars/drivers to get us there/back.
