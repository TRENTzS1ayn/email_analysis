With emphasis on "sheer quantity", I think this is a compelling argument, 
which is not limited to Dublin Core.  (Though I do think that "does not 
conform" is a slight overstatement, I do think this indicates a real problem.)

Similar issues arise in at least two other RDF vocabularies that I can think of
- CC/PP device capabilities and user preferences: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct-vocab/
- Photo labelling schema: http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf/ (in particular, 
section 5.2)
