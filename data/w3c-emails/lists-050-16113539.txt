Lest anyone fail to make the obvious generalization here, it is not just 
the Dublin Core community that uses string literals to represent 
[actually, not "represent", but "denote" or "name"] real world entities. 
  Anyone who uses a relational database to store information about real 
world entities does the same thing.  In the Primer, there are examples 
in which an employee number is used to construct a URI that identifies 
the person in question.  But in reality that employee number would have 
been taken from a relational database as a string literal, and might 
well be used in literal form as the value of some RDF property.  If used 
as a dc:creator value, it wouldn't cause the specific mis-entailment 
cited by Jeremy (at least, not if kept within an appropropriate 
context!), but only because an "extra-model-theory" mechanism enforces 
(some) uniqueness constraint on the association of values to entities. 
But, as noted, RDF can't tell the difference between those kinds of 
literals and others.
