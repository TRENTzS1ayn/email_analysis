The way I see it, dc:creator relates a work to
either its creator or a name for its creator.
So the conclusion just says that the two works
have either the same creator or have creators with
the same name.

I'd rather the dublin core folks didn't use
RDF this way, but they did choose to, and
I'm pretty sure they were made aware of
this sort of nonsense when they made the choice.

I don't think they're wrong; maybe misguided.

yes, I'd rather see examples ala
<http://...> dc:creator _:somebody.
_:somebody ex:name "Bob".

If this goes on our issues list, please call it
"things versus their names".
