Well, one way to view this is to draw a line between
URIs as names and literals as names based on global
consistency. URIs are names of things and they have
a consistent global meaning in-and-of themselves.
Literals are also names of things, but they need
additional context to disambiguate exactly which thing
they name.

But in both cases, they can name something in the
universe.

Eh?

So I think that the current Dublin Core (and CC/PP
and other) usage is quite correct, and not the least
bit misguided or wrong.

There are advantages to using a URI (or blank node)
insofar as global consistency is concerned, but there
are also advantages to using context sensitive names
as well. And simpledatatypes2 provides idioms for both
cases -- but also provides a consistent interpretation
in the MT.

Cheers,

Patrick
