I think we are agreeing that the model theory is not
giving a useful entailment here. Since the conclusion
is the same in either case, the interesting first
case has become indistinguishable from the less
interesting second case.

I worry that this makes the MT irrelevant to the
DC community, until and unless they deprecate
the string-literal usage.

If DC ignore the model theory, and WebOnt have 
darkness to ignore the parts of the model theory 
they don't like, then  I am really not sure why 
we are bothering to make the model theory normative.
