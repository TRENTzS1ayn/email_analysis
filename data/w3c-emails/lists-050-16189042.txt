It's difficult to say what "accurately describes" semantics as fuzzy as 
those of CC/PP.

I would say that simpledatatypes2 more closely reflects what I understand 
to be the intended interpretation of terms in a CC/PP expression.

Further, I think that simpledatatypes2 allows us to not rewrite the CC/PP 
schema;  the current proposal will require some changes to be made.
