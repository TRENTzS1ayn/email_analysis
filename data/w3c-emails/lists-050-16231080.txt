That (i.e. the original question of your survey) was exactly the 
question/argument I personally found not compelling as an argument for tidy 
literals,

But, that was a fair response, and I've no claim on Absolute Truth here, 
just an opinion.

There's a balance to consider here:  your survey was directed squarely at 
software developers:
[[
If you have any sort of RDF API or query language or
any sort of software in which this question can be posed,
would you please ask your implementation and tell
us its answer right now?
]]

But there's another group here, too:  I'll call them "information 
designers".  This is the category I'd apply to Dublin Core.  And more 
generally, to any group that get's together to define how to describe some 
information in RDF, so I guess that would include the CC/PP and photo 
metadata software I mentioned.

Of course, the really important progress is going to come from a fruitful 
cooperation of software-developers and information-designers.  In the 
scheme of things, I think it's going to be easier for the software 
developers to adapt to the needs of the information designers.

I speculate that the important gains for RDF have come from adoption by 
information designers - Dublin Core, RSS, foaf, etc.
