I wouldn't use the term RDF 2; but say, not in this working group
under the present charter.

The syntax WD doesn't refer to Unicode.  The test cases WD ntriples
section needs updating to use the new wording.

That's rather sweeping.  What does it say about the other sections of
3 and the other sections that you don't mention?

In detail, most things are related to
ntriples http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples
or syntax http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/

ntriples 
  charmod 1.2 -  Have to change to use U+hhhh format

  charmod 3.4 - the charmod Character String term is already used;
    should we remove this, all references to charmod?

  charmod 3.5 - the right range of Unicode characters is used

  charmod 3.6.1 - ntriples mandates US-ASCII which is forbidden by
    charmod, breaks the MUST in 2nd para. 

    The obvious fix would be to mandate utf-8, which would require an
    extra processing stage for ntriples before doing the processing
    of the resulting unicode characters.  The \u and \U escapes might
    remain?

  charmod 3.7 - mostly conforms here.  But the "escaped chars SHOULD
    be acceptable wherever unescaped chars are" isn't yet met since
    they aren't allowed in names such as blank node ids or comments.
    The last sentence notes this is SHOULD so isn't actually
    REQUIRED.

  charmod 4.2.1 - I have no idea which normalizing phrase we use here 
    - not include-normalized, given ntriples has no inclusion.

  charmod 4.3.2 - should U+0338 also be excluded from characters of an
    extended ntriples indentifer class (if it went to a UTF-8 encoding)?



syntax
  charmod 2 conformance - need we add a conformance statement?  even
     if not conforming to charmod?
  charmod 2:
    [I] Where this specification contains a procedural
description, it MUST be understood as a way to specify the
desired external behavior. Implementations MAY use other ways
of achieving the same results, as long as observable behavior
is not affected.
   may need emphasising although we already have:
       [[This document illustrates one way to create the N-Triples
         from the XML - any other method that results in the same
         N-Triples (RDF graph) may be used.]]
       -- http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Introduction

  charmod 3.4 - the Character String term may need to be used in the
    future graph model section

  charmod 3.5 - reference processing model
    we conform to this since we are based on XML

  charmod 4.2.1 - I have no idea which normalizing phrase we use here

  charmod 4.4 -
    "[S] Specifications MUST document any security issues related to
    normalization."
    -- is this stuff we take from the internet draft or do we need to
    demonstrate / point to example of encoding URIs that look the
    same but are different?

  charmod 8 - char encoding in uri referenceso
     several things here to conform to
     do we really need to cite the IRI internet draft?
     I agree with Jeremy that this is too early.

  charmod 8 - fragment identifier (last para)
    since we define the fragment indentifer for RDF, this says we
    need to address the chars outside US-ASCII and how they are
    encoded in it.

    I agree with Jeremy - our specification is in accordance with
    (sufficient for?) handling IRIs but does not explicitly support
    them

  charmod 9 -
    xml 1.1 proposes changes to cites unicode terms for legal name
    chars.  I expect we aren't going to depend on 1.1 (also a WD) so
    does this need spelling out for, say RDF IDs?


General comments

charmod 4.3 is just baffling in the levels of inclusion, entities,
  escaping and normalizing.

charmod 4.3.1 sentences are very complex, some mentioning 3 types of
  normalizing and two parenthetical clauses in one sentence.

charmod 4.3.2 does not explain what '-' means?  No or 'N' to compare
  with 'Y'?

charmod 4.4 - I'd hate to have to explain this.  Some of these
  statements seem web architectural and will need a lot of buy-in

charmod 8 - charmod MUST NOT depend on the IRI I-D, and even if it
  was an RFC, needs lots more buy in before the MUST could be used.
  Charmod #2 maybe.

So this section should be labelled 'IF the spec has a processing model...'

+1

I haven't review this but, it it doesn't at this draft stage we
definitely shouldn't use it, since equality is all we require.

Not sure what bidi impact you mean?  Is that the "logical order" requirement?

Those seem sensible

I do not recommend putting such future-guessing statements in docs.
If IRI becomes an RFC, charmod should make a new version (WD --> REC)

Jeremy - can you take my comments, merge and edit them to give some
consistent summary?
