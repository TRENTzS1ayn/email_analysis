That wasn't intended as part of a formal comment, but point taken.

Maybe delete 'fully'. The point here is that the work we have done on character literals has been
helpfully informed by these sections (and their precursors). Significant substantive change to these
sections would be highly problematic, hence, IMO, we should support them.
Moreover, IMO, they have helped identify and solve a range of issues to do with normalization that
is helping us produce a better RDF recommendation.

It says nothing about the other bits of charmod. (Section 8, which is the only other relevant
section is dealt with later). e.g. I don't think RDF Core should have an opinion on "3.6 Choice and
Identification of Character Encodings" since XML does that for us.

I had been imagining that n-triples is not and will not be conformant with charmod.
Maybe we should identify a lack of an escape clause. I certainly do not believe that charmod
conformance for n-triple is an appropriate goal at this stage. I agree with your analysis that
sections I have not considered would be relevant.

The include phase exapnds the character escapes.
I think the goal is that it is fully normalized.

IMO we should not attempt charmod conformance in this round.
We should omit a conformance statement.

I think we could meet this by simply pointing at appropriate pairs of test cases.

We shouldn't have a dependency on xml 1.1 but we should work just as well with it.
I don't understand the unicode versioning issues enough to know how to say that. Can't we just have
a non-specific reference to Unicode and note that not all unicode versions can be serialized in XML
1.0.

Some of that is XML and not charmod's fault.
Another aspect is that earlier simpler versions didn't work. I had made comments about earlier
drafts where the normalizations rules did not work for RDF.

My preference would be you make personal editorial comments.
It seems heavy handed for a WG to make editorial suggestions, also I think we should focus our
review efforts on substance.

Ditto.

We might differ here - probably worth airing at the telecon.
I gave an editorial comment that normalization-sensitive definition was hard to understand.

Was my suggested text strong enough - it seems not.
Would:

 RDF Core opposes any requirement on a specification which
 refers to the IRI draft.

be better?

Bidi is bidirectional text.
The normal example is numbers in arabic.
I think that the arabic for

the number 1.234

is

1.234 REBMUN EHT

which is logically stored as

{ T, H, E,  , N, U, M, B, E, R, 1, ., 2, 3, 4, }

Frankly I don't think RDF will be known to be bidi compatible until we have bidi users involved with
rdf-ig.

I imagine I'll take that as an action in an hour's time.
