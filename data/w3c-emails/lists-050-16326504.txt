I spent most of yesterday afternoon thinking this over and chatting

I see it as a horrible kludge/mess. I thought I could see a way to
implement it, but it didn't stand up under scruitiny.

As much as convincing DC folks to go back and separate
creatorName from creator looks like pushing water
up hill, I prefer that to kludging the RDF core treatment
of literals.
