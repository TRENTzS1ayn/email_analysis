The implication that

    _:1 rdf:type xsd:integer.lex .
and
    _:1 rdf:type xsd:integer.val .

is only incorrect with respect to the intended interpretation of 
"xsd:integer.lex" and "xsd:integer.val".  The problem is that you made 
statements which were inconsistent with that intended interpretation (you 
used ex:age with different-type objects - one from the integer lexical 
space, and the other from the integer value space).  For RDF, it's 
perfectly legitimate RDFS-entailment, and might quite reasonably be 
consistent with some different intended interpretation.

In a different message to Brian, you said:
>The examples I used were based on those given in Sergey's definition

Unlike Sergey's similar example, you have used the *same* URI (ex:age) for 
each idiom.  Sergey's examples of A and B use 'exA:birthdate' and 
'exB:birthdate', so the problematic entailments do not arise.
