See:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0037.html

Both Jeremy Carroll and Dave Beckett have reviewed the last call charmod WD
extensively.

It was agreed that editorial comments would not come from the WG but would be
submitted by individual reviewers.

It was agreed to say that a normative section of charmod MUST NOT depend
on the IETF IRI draft which is not finished and is not yet stable.

HPLabs in Bristol.

It was decided that the main hotel will be the Holiday Inn next to HP.

10: defining literal equality
See:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0410.html

It was agreed that we needed a more precise definition of the abstract
graph syntax of RDF.  There was some discussion of whether this should
be included in the RDF/XML syntax document or in the model theory
document.  It was decided to try it in the RDF/XML syntax document for
fit.  Pat suggested a definition based on triples would work well and
deal with some concerns raised by Massimo.

ACTION: 2002-05-17#5 jjc Draft text to describe the abstract graph syntax
                          for inclusion in the RDF/XML syntax doc.

Sergey's presence noted.

Sergey questions on status of Literals taken to email.

ACTION: 2002-05-17#6 Sergey Clarify questions on Literals by email.

ACTION:2002-05-03#7 danc summarise to the list the options for

See:
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-seq-representation
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0334.html

Skipped since DanC not present.

12: Issue: rdfms-assertion
Feeback from Tim:
o agrees that context modifies interpretation
o suggests that appropriate words appear in mime-type document
See:
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-assertion

Brian reported back on conversation at WWW 2002 in Hawaii with TimBL.  Pat 
noted we need to be careful with the use of the term "meaning".  In response
to the suggestion that we should include appropriate text in the mime-types
document, DaveB pointed out there had been a recent TAG decision on registering
mime types for W3C specifications.

ACTION: 2002-05-17#7 DaveB Investigate recent TAG decision on registering
                            mime types for W3C specifications and make a
                            recommendation to the WG

I will try to post a summary, but may not have time. I'd be real happy
if someone beat me to it.

Meeting Closed

There was after hours discussion of literals and tidyness.  It would be 
good if someone would summarise to the list.
