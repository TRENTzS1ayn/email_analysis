Sorry to appear to be re-raising an issue that people might think is 
closed, but I need some information for the Primer.  The basic situation 
is:

1.  the Agenda for the 2002-04-26 telecon had the following item:

"12: Primer
2002-02-25#17 EricM Ensure primer has appropriate description of use of 
rdf:value"

I have not been able to determine the disposition of this item, and the 
Primer currently contains nothing about rdf:value.

2.  the issues tracking document says (about rdf:value):

"At the February 2002 face to face meeting, the RDFCore WG resolved:

* that rdf:value is a property defined in the RDF namespace
* that the model theory state that rdf:value is a property
* that no other model theory semantics is defined specifically for it
* the issue be closed"

My reading of item #2 is that rdf:value is supposed to have *no* special 
semantics.  If that's true, then, on the one hand, it might be unwise to 
include in the Primer examples such as that in Section 7.3 of the M&S 
(non-binary relations) that suggest that the rdf:value property is there 
to hold, say, the numeric value of a "weight" (hung off a Bnode 
describing the complete value), with other properties of the Bnode 
describing things like units, thus giving rdf:value special semantics. 
On the other hand, maybe that's still supposed to be the intended 
purpose of rdf:value, we're providing this pre-defined property for this 
"utility function", and it's just that the intended semantics aren't (or 
can't be) described in the model theory. In any event, including such 
examples in the Primer would seem to say that we still mean for 
rdf:value to be used.

So what do you suggest I do about rdf:value in the Primer?
