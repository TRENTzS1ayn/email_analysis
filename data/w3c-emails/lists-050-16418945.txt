Excuse the crosspost (RDFCore WG and SemWeb Coordination Group). Please
direct followups to one of these lists.


The TAG are making decisions about media type registration that affect W3C
WGs who are defining 'languages'. We might want to consider whether RDF
(RDFCore, RDFS, WebOnt, ...) is, for these purposes, one or several
'languages'. We might also want to consider whether each new RDF Schema
that a (working) group defines is a 'language' in the sense used in this
TAG proposal. My gut reaction is that registering an Internet Media Type
for each new RDF Schema would be counter-productive. RDF is designed for
fine-grained mixing; Media Types are useful for course-grained dispatching
based on content type. But I need to think about this some more...

There isn't much time till their suggested closure date of May 28th. I'm
not sure what the next sensible step is? Brian, EricM, DanC?

Hello,

On behalf of the TAG, I have published

   "TAG Finding: Internet Media Type registration,
    consistency of use" [1].

The TAG invites people to review this finding. The TAG
will consider this finding "accepted" unless there
is substantial opposition expressed on this list
prior to 28 May (say, end of day Boston time).

Draft and accepted findings are available at
the TAG's Web site [2].

Thank you,

  _Ian
