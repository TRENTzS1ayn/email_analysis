Dan,

I agree with your "gut feel".  At the level of description provided by MIME 
content-types, I think that all RDF "languages" are effectively the 
same.  Indeed, I think it should/will be the norm that different schema are 
mixed in a single document, and any processing rules implied by the MIME 
type should not vary based on the schema employed.

The situation is different if languages layered on RDF have syntactic as 
well as schema extensions (or other fundamental extensions that go beyond 
the RDFcore language):  e.g. DAML and its collection syntax.  In these 
cases, I think there is probably some need for a separate MIME type.
