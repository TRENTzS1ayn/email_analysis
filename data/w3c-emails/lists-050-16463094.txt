I also missed it. My understanding of the decision was that a literal 
is best thought of as a unicode character string plus some additional 
decorations whose function is to record XML-specific syntactic 
information which has no RDF semantic content but which RDF 
nevertheless needs to record in order to properly permit 
round-tripping from XML. In particular, both your b and c are ruled 
out: the correct syntactic answer is d, but the model theory can 
treat d as though it were a.

That would be cleaner in the RDF graph but would probably break the RDF/XML.
