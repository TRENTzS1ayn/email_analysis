My understanding was we went for (d) as best reflecting the past (M&S) not as the best basis for the
future (SW).

I think there are many issues for which we might want to say that the past is not the ideal basis
for the future. But the past is non-optional.

The language tags are a dynamic set. There are mailing lists that tell you of the changes. There are
well-defined update procedures. We can have a generic dependency on xml:lang, which in turn has a
generic dependency on RFC 3066 which in turn has a generic dependency on ISO639 and ISO3166. IMO
this will have a long enough shelf life. It makes it hard to write software that "knows" all the
langauge tags, but it is only a warning message (at least in my software).

I don't find Sergey's argument compelling.

I think we have created a clear rearticulation of M&S. That is the job we are chartered to do.
