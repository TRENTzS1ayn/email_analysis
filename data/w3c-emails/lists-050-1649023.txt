The subject line says it all...

Inference based on rdfs:range shown in grey.

Note that cohabitation of P and D idioms will still have
to deal with equivalent knowledge expressed in both
idioms. E.g.

   Bob ex:age "30" .
   ex:age rdfs:range xsd:integer .

   Bob ex:age _:1 .
   _:1 rdf:value "30" .
   _:1 rdf:type xsd:integer .

which in some fashion at some level likely needs to be
treated as redundant knowledge, despite the different
idioms of expression.

The P/P+ combination has no such problems... (but I'll
let go of that for now... sigh... ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
