I regret that you weren't at the after hours conversation last
week.
I found it helpful, and thought Aaron's e-mail summarised what
I learnt:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0066.html

While I continue to support simpledatatype2 I believe that
the group should as much as possible concentrate on getting
the current datatype stuff out to the community as a WD.

As such, I would support the chair in stating that your
agenda request is about an issue that is currently not open.
