As do I.

Aaron's comments may be true for some preceptions of DC, but
other applications (actually, most of them, from what I've
seen, including I think alot of common perception about DC
as well) still take an untidy simpledatatypes2 view of things.

In fact, I've been working for awhile on some RDF querying
stuff that relies on the inline idiom being understood
to "provide" a datatype value, and unfortunately since
the present stake-in-ground proposal does not offer this
(much to my disappointment and due to my own misunderstanding
of the MT) I find myself in a position of being a co-editor
of a specification that I myself will reject and not use
for most of what I am using datatyped RDF for.

So, clearly, I'm rather concerned.

I agree. I didn't mean to imply that getting the present WD
finished and out would be held up by discussing the concerns
already raised about it by you, myself, Graham, etc.

I don't know whether Pat or Sergey presently has the lock,
but it's not me. But I'm also eager to see it get out to
the public (both because it's well overdue, and because I
expect that the issues already leveled against it will find
support in the general RDF community).

Still, I wonder whether it still reflects the true concensus
of the WG... (i.e. would the WG still vote the way it did)

Hmmmm...  well, I consider datatypes to still be an open
issue, or at least, to be an issue that still has problem
areas and not "a done deal" so to speak. But I certainly will
understand if Brian deems it to be inappropriate for tomorrow's
aggenda.

Cheers,

Patrick
