Hi Folks,

Frank has offered the following schedule for the primer:

draft to WG: 7 June
WG vote: 14 June
publish: 17 June
draft to WG: 12 July
WG vote: 19 July
publish: 22 July [Last Call]

Can I please have a schedule from the other document editors.  What are 
your plans?  Can we aim for a last call publication for all documents (except
datatypes?) on 22/July?  Is that a target everyone can commit to?

Brian
