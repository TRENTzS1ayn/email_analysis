Despite my earlier reply ...

Thinking about your message, I realise that I agree that we could have
done a significantly better job.

Personally, I would be interested in seeing an alternative proposal; and
suspect there would be one that:
+ would address your concerns (which I have previously had the
impression were shared by Tim BL and DanC)
+ address my semantic concerns (which are also held by Patrick and
Graham).
+ retain syntactic tidiness on strings

A proposal with the above features would get my enthusiastic support
(despite any backward compatibility concerns).
