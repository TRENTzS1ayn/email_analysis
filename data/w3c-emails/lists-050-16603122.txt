FWIW, I always mentally parse this as syntactic longhand for:

 <rdf:RDF>
  <rdfs:Resource rdf:about="http://example.org/"/>
 </rdf:RDF>

'rdf:Description' is a way of saying "there is a resource and it has the
following (URI, properties...)". But it doesn't explicitly assert the
'there exists a thing and it is of rdf:type rdfs:Resource bit. Which is
fine, cos everything's a resource, so its a pretty vacuous assertion to
make.

Not sure this helps.
