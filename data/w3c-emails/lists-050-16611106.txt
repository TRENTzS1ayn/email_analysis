No; since we base our describe the rdf graph as triples
as node->arc->node rather than any other form.  If this is not the
case then N-Triples in insufficient to connect the model theory and
syntax.

Any URI ref.  This is pretty clear from M&S and we've mentioned this
a few times in passing with respect to the issues related to
writing them as qnames.

(XML) Namespaces are artifacts of the RDF/XML serialization and are
not in the current model.

Any legal XML element content
   i.e. "foo<blah/>bar" is OK as well as "<blah>foo</blah>"
since this is the kind of thing allowed inside an XML element; weaker
than just well-balanced.

Yes (from the description in the syntax doc)

Yes (ditto)

Well, the equivalence can be made I guess?

Yes, in my opinion.  RDF/XML allows serializing of a large subset of
the legal RDF models, this is one it can't do without using some
method (such as Dan Brickely's suggestion of using subProperty)
