No, not _any_ URI ref.

Some URI refs don't name properties.

Arguably, all the phone: ones, all the mailto: ones, and a huge % of all
the http:// URIrefs too.

But I think I agree with (what I take to be) your general point. There are
many URIrefs that we can take as naming URIrefs which aren't (for various
reasons) going to have an RDF/XML document derferencable.

However, the fact that they name RDF properties means that they can be
used in RDF/XML instance data using the XML namespace mechanism, so in
that sense they are associated with a namespace. Or they are a namespace.
Or they can be written about using XML namespaces.
