(XML) Namespaces are artifacts of the RDF/XML serialization and are
not in the current model.

 From M&S:

[[
RDF also requires the XML namespace facility to precisely associate each 
property with the schema that defines the property; ...
]]

[[
Property names must be associated with a schema. This can be done by 
qualifying the element names with a namespace prefix to unambiguously 
connect the property definition with the corresponding RDF schema or by 
declaring a default namespace as specified in [NAMESPACES].
]]

[[
In RDF, each predicate used in a statement must be identified with exactly 
one namespace, or schema.
]]
