And isn't it great how we threw most of that out of our current specs.

Excellent.

Relying on the (mostly missing, evolving) semantics of XML namespaces
isn't going to work.  The first quote I assume is about the syntax
not the model.

The property name <> schema association can be done using
rdfs:isDefinedBy properties in the graph (though RDFS doesn't mention
this).  However since RDFS and such definitions are optional, this
doesn't have to be present and the check in the last quote you give
is therefore also not required.
