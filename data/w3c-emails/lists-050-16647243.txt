Jeremy,

thank you for spending thought on the issue. I believe we discussed 
several options on the list months ago. I think that it'd be more 
elegant to represent language-tagged words and XML structures as bNodes 
with some 'standard' properties, and leave literals as plain character 
strings.

Despite my concerns about the current treatment of literals, I feel 
uneasy about raising the issue again (although it may technically be 
still on the table given the pending replies of the issue raisers). I'd 
like to ask the chair to recommend whether and how we should proceed on 
that. I believe that it is important to do a good job on literals since 
they are one of the most fundamental language elements of RDF.
