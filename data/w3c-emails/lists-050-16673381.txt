This differs from Dave's position I fear.

If we take the rdfs schema closure of the graph corresponding to the
given RDF/XML file then it contains two triples

rdf:type rdf:type rdf:Property .
http://example.org/ rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

(according to DanB).

This can be formalized within our current framework by saying that an
RDF Graph is a set of nodes and a set of arcs, where each arc is a
triple [ subj, pred, obj ] where subj and obj are in the set of nodes.

Dave's position can be formalized as saying that an RDF Graph is a set
of arcs, and the nodes in the graph are defined as the set of nodes in
the arcs. Isolated nodes that do not partake in any triples are
prohibited.

I currently agree with Dave, but fear this looks like an issue.
