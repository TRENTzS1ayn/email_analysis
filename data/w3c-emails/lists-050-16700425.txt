There's a get-out clause that I increasingly see specs use, along the lines of:

[[
This specification describes certain behaviours.  Implementations of this 
spec are not required to actually conform to these behaviours as long as 
the results obtained are such as would be obtained by such conformance.
]]

If applied to charmod, does it help your concerns?
