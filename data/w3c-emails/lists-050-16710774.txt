I raised some minor concerns with this.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0030.html


Here is a reworded closure text. I consider this closed, and offer this
as a bugfix better characterisation of why / how we close it.

Main problem was the use of 'sub-class' rather than 'sub-property' in text
above.

 - isDefinedBy is a Property
 - it has no further semantics in the RDF Model Theory

 - further sub-properties of it may be created by others
 - RDF Core doesn't currently expect to create any of these.

Can we close this for good please?

Dan
