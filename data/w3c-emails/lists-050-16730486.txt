Since people apparently want a shorter Primer, and we can simply refer
to the MT, test cases, and so on to explain everything, I thought you'd
like to review this newer version.  Of course, some people may find the
explanations a bit sparse, to which I suppose we'd respond, "that's
life"!  

Now back to actually explaining things....
