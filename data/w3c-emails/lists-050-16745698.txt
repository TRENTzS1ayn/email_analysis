Aaron--

I think you've got the right idea, but I don't know about your proposed 
changes.  I was thinking that Section 3 has two sentences, and that 
could easily be cut in half (more if we allow fragments--oops!  haven't 
done that material yet;  I guess it's too late now).  Also, since this 
is the Web, and we have links, why do we need Section 8?  Or even 
separate sections?  We could just run all the sentences together.

Cheers!
--Frank
