Item 9: Issue: rdfs-isDefinedBy-semantics

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0102.html

There was some discussion of what "informal semantics" were, and what
isDefinedBy should point to (if anything).

Eventually it was decided that the document editor should update the
proposal in light of the discussion to try to close the issue next week.

ACTION 2002-05-24#4 (danbri) to update the isDefinedBy proposal (with
help from Guha) in light of the discussion in the 2002-05-24
telecon


Item 10: Review comments on Charmod

Jeremy's comments:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0080.html

Jeremy summarised his comments: we agree (on the whole) with charmod
(except for the dependence on IRI); we may not currently conform and
make no guarantee to conform with this revision (due to time
constraints).

ACTION 2002-05-24#1 (jjc) to submit his comments (minus N-Triples
mention) to the I18N WG as representing this WG's position.


Item 11: daml:collection

The WG had some discussion on the options that appeared available:
- "bless" daml:collection in some form (most major parser
  implementations had the machinery to support this)
  DaveB pointed out that there would be an impact on delivery of the
  syntax document if this was adopted.

  There was concern about making a normative reference into a namespace
  not "owned" by W3C, so "daml" would have to be replaced if this
  were followed. Since OWL may well be making its own namespace changes,
  this was not felt by all to be a problem (although Mike Dean expressed
  concerns)

- use daml:collection's first/rest but without the syntactic sugar
  (WebOnt were likely to reject this out of hand)
- add a "max index" to the existing rdf:_n collections.
  DanC and Jos both expressed a strong dislike for this option.

ACTION 2002-05-24#2 (danc) to write up a proposal for incorporating
daml:collection into RDF
ACTION 2002-05-24#3 (jos) to produce test cases to go with the
daml:collection proposal


Item 13: Document status and schedules


Syntax: DaveB was concerned that there are still no decisions on
  literals, containers.
MT: Pat indicated teh document was converging nicely and would continue
  to do so as long as the WG didn't suddenly decide it liked nontidy
  literals



Item 14: Dark triples

  Jonathan Borden's summary of the need for unasserted triples:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002May/0168.html

  Guha indicated that RDF's reification provided sufficient
  syntactic mechanisms to support unasserted triples, but that he'd
  recently been convinced (offline) that "since the syntax is so
  complicated, [WebOnt] aren't going to accept it".


The meeting ran out of time at this point and was closed.
