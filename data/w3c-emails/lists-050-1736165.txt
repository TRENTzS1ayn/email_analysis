Jan, I've added the actual resolutions on a couple of the issues into the 
minutes, for precision and completenes.

As I recall the resolution approved was the one in the
agenda viz:

The WG resolves to not change the algorithm for mapping qnames to uris and 
close this issue on the grounds:

   1. Such a change would be a major change to the mapping of
RDF/XML syntax to the model and would be beyond our charter.

   2. It would cause the same RDF/XML to generate a different
graph from existing versus revised implementations

   3. Existing code may generate wrong (illegal) graphs for some RDF/XML.

The resolution that was approved is:

The WG:

o resolves to not change the name of this property at this time on
the grounds:
- insufficient reasons to make this change
- will cause existing uses to be illegal - such as examples in m&s

o resolves to recast this issue as a need to clarify the semantics
of rdf:value.
