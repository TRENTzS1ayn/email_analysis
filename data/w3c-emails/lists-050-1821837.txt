Per my proposal regarding the partitioning of datatyping discussion
documentation, attached is a revised/truncated version of Sergey's
sections 1-3 which I think could serve as an expression of the
common understanding/agreement, at present, regarding datatyping
of literals.

My changes are in red.

Regards,

Patrick
