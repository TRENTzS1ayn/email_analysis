I'm personally agnostic about this matter, but it occurs to me that we 
*could* allow unprefixed ID=, about= and resource= attributes, and others, 
within elements whose name is associated with the RDF namespace without 
creating any ambiguity.

My reasoning, supported in part by the (non-normative) appendix A.2 of XML 
namespace spec, is that the meaning of such attributes can be defined by 
the element in which they appear.

Thus, we can define that for all element types in the RDF namespace, the 
appearance of an ID= attribute will be regarded as equivalent to rdf:ID=, 
about= equivalent to rdf:about=, resource= equivalent to rdf:resource=, etc.

But I think it's important that the qualifying prefix be retained when 
these attributes are used in non-RDF elements, as when using a class name 
in place of rdf:Description, etc, and most property elements.

Just a thought...
