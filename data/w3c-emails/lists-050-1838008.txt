The terminology "Built-in" and "primitive" also comes from the schema 
document (e.g. part 2, section 3).

I'd like to seek wider consensus on the specific point you raise, but I've 
added some words to the document.  (My preference is to start simple and 
build up from there;  i.e. have an account for the primitive types first, 
and then see if it extends cleanly to the derived types.)

Hmmm... "infer" carries some (logic-related) baggage that I didn't want to 
invoke at this stage.

How about "indirectly incorporate typing information..."

Hmmm... I'm reluctant for two reasons:
(a) this text is pretty much the desderate the DAML+OIL joint committee 
gave us, and I don't want to mess with it too much,
(b) I think it's OK to the extent that any "proposal" could be said to 
support (i.e. allow use of) one or more "idioms".

The exact point of using different names is to avoid the assertion that it 
is the same name that is used in every idiom.  (I considered using Sergey's 
.lex, .val and .map conventions, but did not because that implied too much 
about how the idioms would be interpreted.)

I'll note that, where more than one idiom is supported by any given 
proposal, the ex*: names used may be the same or may be different for any 
pair of supported idioms.

Yes, OK.  As far as I'm concerned, this is an informal discussion 
document.  (Hmmm, I should probably say that somewhere.)
