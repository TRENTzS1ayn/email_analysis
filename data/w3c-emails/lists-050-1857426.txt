"intersection", not "union" (per WG resolution).

Maybe.

OK, if by "constrain" I can understand a limitation the interpretations 
that may be considered to be models.

I see nothing here that argues that the meaning of:

    Direct Graph + Schema Graph

should be any different to the meaning of the merge of those graphs.  I.e. 
the same conclusions can be drawn either way.

In the model theory, the meaning of schema statements is defined in terms 
of entailment over a subset of interpretations called RDFS 
interpretations.  And the schema lemma is pretty explicit that the schema 
entailment of some set of graphs is equivalent to the schema-closure of the 
merge.

>Which interpretation is applied is up to the particular application.

I think we really should be steering well away from that:  if different 
applications can draw different conclusions from some graph+schema, then 
where is the basis for interoperable exchange of information in RDF?
