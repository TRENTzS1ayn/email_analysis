Ahhh, OK, I think I see where your coming from.

A Union Datatype expects that its members are a member of
at least one, but not all, of its subtypes.

But the rdfs:range constraint defines an intersection of types
(not union) such that a lexical form (property value) is
considered (or required) to be a member of every specified
type -- and of course, any of those types can be a Union
Datatype.

Thus, I can define a Union Datatype 'myUnion' with xsd:date and
xsd:duration, which have totally disjunct lexical spaces, and I can
then say

  ex:someProp rdfs:range xsd:string .
  ex:someProp rdfs:range #myUnion .

which will never result in a contradition since xsd:string subsumes
the lexical space of all lexical datatypes.

Yet if I say

  ex:someProp rdfs:range xsd:date .
  ex:someProp rdfs:range xsd:duration .

then I am sure to get a contradition every time, regardless of
whether the literal is a valid xsd:date or xsd:duration since
all rdfs:range defined types are inferred/required.

Right?

If so, then I'm OK with your definition of the equality of (a), (b),
and (c) with regards to interpretation.
