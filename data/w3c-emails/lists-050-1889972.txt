Raised by Pierre-Antoine CHAMPIN in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001JanMar/0024.html

Summary:
   The Model and Syntax specification does not clearly specify which
   reified statements are put in which bag when nested description
   elements have bagID's.


I propose we close this by resolving:

  Nested rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs generate the same
  triples as top-level rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs.
  Specifically, triples generated as a result of nested
  rdf:Description elements do not get included in bags associated
  with outer rdf:Description elements.

(sort of based on the resolution attached to Jeremy's mail
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0346.html

 -- I hope I got this right
)


With respect to Pierre-Antoine's question
  What model should the following RDF piece return ?

The first attachment test001.rdf contains an updated and completed
version of his example.  (Iadded the rdf:RDF, updated the attributes
to be rdf:*, and made absolute URIs)

By this resolution it is equivalent to the attached test002.rdf, with
the inner rdf:Description moved to the outer level.

And both generate the same N-Triples

However, since IDs/bagIDs are being used, the URLs generated are
relative to the location of the RDF/XML files so there are two result
N-Triples files. The final test case files will be below
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-nested-bagIDs/ so
they are calculated relative to that
