For those who are interested, you can get a sneak-peek preview
of the TDL (PD) datatyping scheme proposal at

   http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/TDL.html

It doesn't yet contain the math. Jeremy will provide that. It
also has a few sections that are anemically worded, albeit
considered to be complete.

Feel free to comment. I expect to finish up the final draft
first thing next week.

Regards,

Patrick
