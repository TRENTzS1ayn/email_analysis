12: Unrecognised xml: attributes
Propose:  

The WG resolves that unrecognised attributes in the xml namespace
should be ignored.



13: Issue: #rdfms-xml-base
See DaveB's excellent summary of the discussion to date - url below.

Propose:  

  The WG confirms it's previous decision that where RDF is
  embedded in an XML document, and that RDF is within the scope
  of an xml:base, then then an RDF parser will use the value of
  the xml:base attribute as the base for resolving relative URI's.

  The WG confirms its previous decision that xml:base attributes
  within an RDF/XML document will be ignored.

  The WG actions DaveB to reflect these decisions in the syntax
  document.

  Action ??? to create test cases to reflect these decisions.

  This is be closed.

14: Issue: #rdfms-nested-bagIDs

Summary:
   The Model and Syntax specification does not clearly specify which
   reified statements are put in which bag when nested description
   elements have bagID's.

Propose:

  o  the WG resolves: 

  Nested rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs generate the same
  triples as top-level rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs.
  Specifically, triples generated as a result of nested
  rdf:Description elements do not get included in bags associated
  with outer rdf:Description elements.

  o the WG approves test cases 1 and 2 in DaveB's message - url below

  o this issue be closed
