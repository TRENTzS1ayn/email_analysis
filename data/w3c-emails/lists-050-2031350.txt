I hope we're not going to get into scoring systems... ;-)

I'll look into what you suggest, but I would like to keep the DAML+OIL 
joint committee text fairly intact, at least until we are reasonably sure 
we're talking about the same things.

I'm also trying to be very careful that I don't combine things because they 
look the same under some assumption that I hold.

No, you didn't miss anything.  I didn't merge them (yet) in case some 
idiomatic differences between B and P emerge in subsequent discussions.  I 
think there might be some more complex combinations of statements that 
don't work in the same way under those proposals.
