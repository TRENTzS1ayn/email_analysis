Patrick,

there is a well-known problem with the rdf:type/rdf:value representation
that you described in

http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/TDL.html

In essence, the interpretations of nodes _1 and _2 in

_1 rdf:value "3.0"
_1 rdf:type us-double
_2 rdf:value "3,0"
_2 rdf:type german-double

fall together (_1 and _2 represent the same real value), and the pairing
between the lexical representation and the type gets corrupted.
Specifically, the semantics of the above four statements is equivalent
to that of

_3 rdf:value "3.0"
_3 rdf:value "3,0"
_3 rdf:type us-double
_3 rdf:type german-double

How do you suggest to work around this problem?

Sergey
