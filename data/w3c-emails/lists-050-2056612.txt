As I pointed out, P and B cannot be merged. The semantics
of the rdfs:range values are significantly different. They
do not express the same knowledge, and I would suggest that
the examples for A and B follow the S conventions using
'.map' and '.lex' suffixes, or that all idiom examples
be omitted from the "common" desiderada document and
addressed solely in each proposal.

Cheers,

Patrick
