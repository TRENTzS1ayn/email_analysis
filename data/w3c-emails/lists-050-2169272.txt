Hmmm...maybe not, but Id like to know which case that was so I can 
take another look.

This point seems to go beyond RDF as it is currently constituted, so 
unless we plan to open up this issue of resources being sets of 
triples, I propose to ignore this issue for now.

Mind you, that might be a good issue to open up, if folk feel that it 
doesn't go beyond our charter. (?)
