I agree, but yes, let's leave it as a separate discussion ;-)

Good. I had hoped that was the case. What threw me
was the adjective 'literal' in front of value. It
seems to suggest that the values are the strings
(literals) rather than the members of the value
space of the datatype.

Perhaps you could just say 'value'? and leave the
'literal' off?

Fair enough. Though I think it would be clearer, in
light of the vocabulary of the "foundation" datatyping
document (sections 1-3 of Sergey's document) to just
say 'value' rather than 'literal value'.

Cheers,
