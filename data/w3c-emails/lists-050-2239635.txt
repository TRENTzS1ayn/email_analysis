Damn, you are right. And the same mistake is reflected in the second 
example. Thanks for noticing. I will fix this.

Right.

Ah, clever. Right, obviously. I need to restate those lemmas more 
carefully. That phrase "is like E except" is much too sloppy, in any 
case. I will get these fixed. Similarly for the next one.

That follows from ICEXT(I(rdf:Property)) = IP . I will add a comment 
to clarify this.

Yes, I'm aware of this stylistic failing. I will go through and do a 
bracketting-purge.

OK, this is rather tortuously written. I will rewrite.

OK, I can add more internal links. Good idea. (Im still rather new to 
hypertext composition.)

Whoops. Will fix.

OK, then we can change it in the newer version, right? Or would it be 
better W3C style to refer ahead to future documents (? genuine 
question, Im not sure how best to handle this 'evolving' 
documentation process.)

I agree this is an oddity.

I think the best thing is if I simply remove this section for now 
until we get containers fully worked out. The point of sneaking it in 
wasn't really to imply that containers are a done deal, but only to 
show that they don't seem to give rise to any MT problems; they are 
(at least in a simple version) almost semantically transparent. BUt 
since you want bags to be more baglike, and Jos wants URIs to be able 
to denote sets of triples, and so on, then maybe my optimism here is 
rather naive.
