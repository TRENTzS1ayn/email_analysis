Given the comments that have come back, I propose to remove section 7 
(containers) from this version of the MT document (and put it off to 
the future.) I had kind of snuck it in hoping nobody would notice, in 
any case, and it can be removed without affecting the rest of the MT. 
If anyone objects strongly to my doing this, speak now.

Pat
