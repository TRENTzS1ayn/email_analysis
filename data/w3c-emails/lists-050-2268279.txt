I would think that the SOAP folks and other XML based
packaging models may have given some thought to this
as well.

After all, an XML instance inside a SOAP wrapper that
has xml:base attributes (if it does ?) would be a similar
case as an XML instance/fragment within an RDF literal.

In that regard, RDF parseType="Literal" is a packaging
mechanism just like SOAP.

I think the criteria of "what is relevant to the application
interpreting the instance" is a good way to go insofar
as applicability of xml:base attributes.

Cheers,

Patrick
