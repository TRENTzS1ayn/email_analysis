it's not a singular case of one rule or so,
but one using axioms as in
  http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/rdf-rules.n3
  http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/rdfs-rules.n3
  http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/owl-rules.n3
(but where we play with rule and premis reordering implementation)
and that for the kind of
  http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/graph.axiom.n3
  http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/graph.lemma.n3
example
now, I think we have some other than MT problem
(however, I have currently no idea at all
but it shouldn't be a loop)

fair enough (for the current state of the art of RDF MT)
but I think that "resources being sets of triples" are evident
(also in the light of tagging them or so, so this is
in a way related to the "(drop) reification" issue
and after all to the use/mention stuff)

I mind :-)
