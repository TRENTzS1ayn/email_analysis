A revised draft of the datatyping document is available:

http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/datatyping-20020118/

Many thanks to Graham for the desiderata, and to Patrick Stickler
for two important contributions:

1. The editorial changes to the previous version (marked in red).
2. Spotting of a third original idiom (called P in the document),
   in which typed elements are interpreted as elements of the
   datatype mapping.
