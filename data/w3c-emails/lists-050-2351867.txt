Well, of course a resource can be anything, so I guess it can be a 
set; but saying that is one thing, and expecting to be able to get 
inside the set and access its contents is something else. That is a 
whole other issue that involves in effect adding a set theory to RDF. 
It might be a simple set theory, but its still a big step from here 
we are now.

Yes, I agree it is related.

OK, let me try to write up some ideas which arise from recent webOnt 
emailings together with this and maybe that will get things started. 
Some time next week.
