Hmm. The trouble is that plain "value" could mean anything at all.  I 
want to allow the MT to conceptually distinguish values of literals 
from semantic values in general, ie resources. (They might turn out 
to be the same; but they might not also and I'd like to stay 
agnostic.)

How about calling them "datatype values" ? That avoids the use of 
"literal" as an adjective and also makes an obvious connection with 
datatyping. It also follows the DAML usage, which distinguishes 
'object' classes from 'datatype' classes, which are classes of 
datatype values.

Anyone got strong views on this? Speak now! Unless there are strong 
objections I will make this change.
