Well, I don't myself use the terminology "resource URI" which seems 
redundant (are there any other kinds of URI??) , and I guess I was 
under the impression that the terminology of "literal" to refer to 
the syntactic entities was established in the wider community, so not 
ours to legislate.

Since this whole "literal" terminology is so confusing, I think it 
would be safest to avoid the use of simple unqualified terms 
altogether. Let me therefore modify my suggestion to the following, 
which is more longwinded (and less 'orthogonal') but has the merit of 
making everything very clear:

I(URI) = I(uriref) = resource  (ie same as present)
I(literal token) = datatype value

This keeps "literal"  completely outside any semantic domain, and 
also emphasizes even to the casual reader the token/value 
distinction; and it has the advantage, already noted, of being 
consistent with DAML terminology at the semantic level.

OK with that?

Pat
