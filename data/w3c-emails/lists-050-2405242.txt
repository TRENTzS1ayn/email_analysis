True, true. Hmmm. And if we use a URI in a subject position that 
happens to be the URI of an RDF graph, then it seems reasonable 
enough that it ought to *denote* that set of triples, right? OK, I'm 
getting there...

Why ppp and not sss? [Later: Oh, I see, the ppp is what does the 
DEreferencing. Ah, cute. Some properties can look inside their 
subject/object denotations and get at the stuff inside. There are all 
kinds of semantic rocks lurking here, as Im sure you know, but we 
might be able to find a safe path through them.  More later...Sorry 
Im slow...]
