But literals are not necessarily "tokens" in the common person's
typical understanding of tokens.

I think that 

    I(literal) = datatype value

is the clearest.

RDF M&S speaks of literals, not literal tokens, literal values,
literal strings, lexical forms, etc. and it would be good IMO
to follow that terminology as much as possible, if folks are
to easily relate the different sibling specifications/documents.

Eh?
