OK, I think I'm following you better now. You are in essence
saying that the current MT does *not* refer to members of
value spaces (as was Pat's assertion) but rather refers to
members of the lexical spaces.

Whether that fits into the MT as specified now or not, perhaps
we can iron out the terminology first, and then figure out
if the semantics of the terminology fit the semantics of the
MT?

I propose

   'literal'        the RDF/XML string representing an rdfs:Literal
   'lexical value'  member of lexical space of "some" datatype
   'data value'     member of value space of "some" datatype

and the datatyping proposals focus on clarifying *which*
datatype a given lexical value or data value belong to.

As to which of the above 'literal value' in the present MT
corresponds to, I can't say. Seems to me that it equates
to data value. Pat?
