Er... I think the intent was to be able to *use* them, not to specify 
them.  Personally, I'd prefer to start with the primitive types and then 
move on to derived types, but other views were expressed.

I think that if we remember these are desiderata, not requirements, it's 
OK.  These are points for consideration/evaluation of proposals, not 
must-haves.

Yes...  (9) addresses an aspect of backward compatibility.  My intituion 
for now is to keep them as separate items, so that we're reminded to look 
for other compatibility issues.

Yes... I'm feeling inclined to remove the example and just keep the 
placeholder with a reference to B.

That might be confusing .. my idiom 'C' used to be called 'P'.
