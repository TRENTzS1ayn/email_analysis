Yes..

I have no objections with these terms per se, but...

Have we got a glossary somewhere to record all this... I'm becoming a 
little worried that there might not be convergence terminology.  I've been 
talking/thinking in terms of datatype lexical space vs value 
space;  Sergey's datatyping document sets up these, and I guess I'd like to 
see any new/refined terminology related to those definitions.
