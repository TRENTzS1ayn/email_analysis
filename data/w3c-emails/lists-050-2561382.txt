Isn't the point of having delegatable namespace control to preserve the
"U" in "URI"? If you take this view then all arguments for anonymous
(nodes|resources) vanish (again), because you can just use

http://thing.com/1
http://thing.com/2

etc. in your document and claim that the intended interpretation differs
on a document-by-document basis.
