Er, you lost me at the first hurdle.  I don't see a "quoting" context here.

I would expect the term <mary> as object of <rdf:subject> to denote the 
same thing as any other occurrence of <mary> in the same graph.  As far as 
I can tell, all that requires is that interpretation is applied 
consistently across a graph.  Without that, I think the model theory collapses.

What you lose, I think, is to ascribe a particular rendering of a statement 
to Jan.  What you gain is the ability to ascribe to Jan some statement that 
had a given interpretation.  (That is, you can make the assertion that Jan 
made a statement that, when interpreted in the context of its utterance, 
had a given interpretation.)

So, I might have been in France last year and heard Jan utter to a passing 
Frenchman "J'ai vu un chat noir" (if you'll pardon my French), and I could 
later say "Jan told the Frenchman that he'd seen a black cat".

I guess it depends on what you regard as the "important detail".  My 
current view is that it's the interpretation, not the exact rendering.

Within the same graph, surely it is?

... but yes, I take your point.

OK, I'm beginning to see what the issue is here.

But I'm still deeply uncomfortable with it.  I need to think about this 
some more.
