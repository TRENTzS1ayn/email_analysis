to clarify: 
I didn't say that reified statements are asserted; that would be contrary 
to the letter and intent of M&S, not to mention common sense. I said that 
I've been using reification as a mechanism for encoding RDF within RDF in 
a non-asserted form. By 'inner graph' I meant the structure that is 
encoded using rdf:Statement, rdf:predicate, rdf:object and rdf:subject. 

[objections to a position I've never held snipped]

Sorry if my phrasing caused any confusion,

Dan
