Very good questions, and all very much needing answers ASAP.

I would include in your list some questions regarding distinctions
between digital (web) resources and non-digital (including abstract)
resources.

C.f. my thoughts on this in

  http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pstickler-uri-taxonomy-00.txt

I.e.

  o Should there be a formal distinction between digital (web-accessible)
    and non-digital (non-web-accessible) resources?

  o What does a URI Reference denote (if anything) for a non-digital
    resource?

And then regarding namespaces (presuming you mean XML Namespaces):

  o What is the relation between a namespace, a vocabulary, and a
    content model?

This question is based on the assertion that a namespace does
not equate to either a vocabulary or content model (contrary to
popular use and common misconception) and it would be very good
for the W3C to state this explicitly. A namespace is just
punctuation; a prefix to achieve globally distinct partitions
of name spaces. The affiliation of specific namespace URIs
with specific vocabularies, ontologies, schemas, and content
models leads to alot of confusion and "hacks" wihch are not
grounded on the actual specifications.

Also, is it necessary to specifically mention or include the
HTTP protocol? Do we not wish the foundational model for resources
and URIs to be independent of protocol? Or are your questions
only concerned with 'http:' URIs?

Regards,

Patrick
