You _do not_ need to quote URI labels on resources to make this
distinction. <foo:superman> and <foo:clarkKent> are labels on resources;
these labels are preserved using my version of reification; and the fact
that an interpretation means they denote "the same thing" isn't a
problem at all.

I think it's clear now that it doesn't. Meaning comes from the
application of an interpretation function, which is where "clark kent"
and "superman" collide. Quoting URIs makes no difference here.

Preserve the resources, maybe, but turning URI labels on them into
strings isn't necessary here.
