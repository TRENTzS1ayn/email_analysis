Oh dear, I hope we have not agreed to do that. That would put lexical 
items into the semantic domain. This seems to be getting *extremely* 
confused (and confusing). My basic understanding is that the terms 
"lexical space" and "value space" refer respectively to syntactic and 
semantic kinds of things. (Of course, since the latter include 
strings, one can use them to encode syntax; but the conceptual 
distinction still remains.

Right; and since all literals need a datatyping scheme to have their 
denotations specified (right?) , those semantic values will of 
necessity be datatype values (no?).

Sigh. The problem is that this is where we came in. Patrick was 
honestly confused by the use of "literal value" in precisely this way 
in the current MT, so I was looking for an alternative that would be 
completely unambiguous.
