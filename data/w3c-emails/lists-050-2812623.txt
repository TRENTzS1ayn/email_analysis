The fact that RDF 1 (a product of a consensus process) specifies this, I 
think does make it a kind of consensus.  And to oppose that decision is to 
break consensus.

(I don't claim that consensus is always right, but having made a consensus 
decision then I do claim that some stronger argument that "what were the 
reasons for that decision" is reasonably required to require us to revisit 
that decision.  Which is, I think, what Brian was saying.)

Notwithstanding the above, I do have some sympathy with this view.
