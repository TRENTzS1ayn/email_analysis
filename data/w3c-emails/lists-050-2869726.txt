I've not seen any comments to my earlier proposal

   'literal'        the RDF/XML string representing an rdfs:Literal
   'lexical value'  member of lexical space of "some" datatype
   'data value'     member of value space of "some" datatype

by which the MT would refer to 'data value' rather than 'literal value'
to denote the semantic thing, and we can talk about literals and
lexical values in the datatyping definitions, and the two sync up
on the common term 'data value' as the member of the value space.

Thus, it is clear in the MT that it is not speaking of lexical
things, but of semantic things denoted by lexical/syntactic
representations in the graph.

Eh?

Patrick
