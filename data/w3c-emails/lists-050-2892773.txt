[trimmed, sorry]

I think we're missing the point; DanC seems to have a technical reason
for wanting to quote URIs (but not literals?) because he needs this to
get KIF to grok reification in any sensible fashion.

However, it looks to me like DanC's stuff in KIF requires _exactly_ the
right level of quoting to make sense of the reification of a reification
of a statement; I can't reconcile this with his claim that it doesn't
matter that the "quoting" of literals he proposes is somehow idempotent.

(And I'm still not clear that a reworking of DanC's stuff with the
alternative intuition for rdf:subject etc. that I suggested can't be
made to work; I'm still looking at this.)
