How do we ever know who "Lois" or "Jimmy" really are?  (This is in danger 
of becoming philosophical which won't help this debate.)

I understood DanBri to be saying that he wasn't yet ready to assume that 
URIs have global scope:  that person:Lois in one context means the same as 
person:Lois in some completely different context.  OTOH, without allowing 
that it seems that URI-refs don't offer anything that label strings like 
"Lois" and "Jimmy" don't also offer.  The point of my comment was to 
suggest that matters relating to personal belief of identity shouldn't 
really be expressed in terms of URIs.

I have no argument with this...

I'm slightly concerned that you may be muddling assertion of a statement 
with interpretation of resources.  As things stand, a URIref-labelled node 
in an RDF graph denotes some resource (per some interpretation) 
irrespective of whether or not any statement within which it appears is 
asserted.  Non-assertion of a statement doesn't somehow suspend 
interpretation of the graph nodes used to describe it.  Maybe this is what 
DanC and DanBri are arguing for?

When I look at your example (below), I find myself worrying about what 
ex:#Superman actually denotes, and the extent to which that affects the 
truth of what you are expressing.  Absent some very special treatment of 
the reification vocabulary, there's nothing in the model theory (that I can 
see) that allows the various occurrences of "#Superman" to have different 
denotations (depending on whose belief is being described), which is what I 
think DanBri is trying to allow with his RDF-through-RDF scenario.

Yes (apart from possible the bit about "real world knowledge"), but that's 
not the issue that I'm chewing on.

I don't know what you mean by "intersections between quoted and asserted 
knowledge".
