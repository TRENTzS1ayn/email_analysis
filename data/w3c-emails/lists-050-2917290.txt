FWIW, this seems closest to the mental model that works best for me ... 
roughly, a URI denotes a function that, when applied to some arguments, 
returns some data entity.  In, say, an HTTP GET operation, some of the 
arguments are implicit (the fact that it's a GET operation, the state of 
the "resource" when the function is evaluated) and some are explicit (HTTP 
request parameters, request body, etc.).

In a sense, I think this is right, in that any attempt to classify URIs 
raises more questions than it answers.  But I also think this is a separate 
issue from the question "What is a 'resource'?" that you posed, and (if 
only for political/social reasons) the classification of URIs debate should 
be kept separate from consideration of your question.
