As far as strings are concerned, we don't. As far as URIs in an RDF
context, we know insofar as those who use those URIs agree.

Whether or not that is what Dan was saying, I find such a view to be
in total contradiction to the very purpose of using URIs as resource
identifiers in RDF in the first place. The whole point was to achieve
intersection of resources which reflects agreement of meaning.

If someone is not sure if their #Lois is the same as person:Lois, fine,
then don't use person:Lois to identify her. Leave it local, or use
some other namespace.

But your examples are not about belief of identity, they
are about belief of properties of entities which are given
identity.

I.e., you weren't saying that <person:Lois> <ex:accepts> that
"Superman" <ex:is> <person:Superman>.

Cool  ;-)

I thought that was what I said ;-)  I.e., I agree.

I fully agree.

I wouldn't expect any URI labeled resource to have different denotations.

If one says ex:Superman, one means ex:Superman. If one says "Superman"
then there is no way to know what is meant. Maybe it means ex:Superman,
maybe not.

I figured I'd get slapped on that one ;-)

Agreed, poor choice of terms. Let's just say "asserted knowledge" and
leave it at that.

The shared URI labeled nodes. I.e., the intersection of resources
shared by quoted/reified statements and asserted statements.
