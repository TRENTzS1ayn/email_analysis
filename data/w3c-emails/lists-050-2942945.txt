My take on this scenario was that Lois' non-belief that Clark Kent is 
strong is rather bound up with her belief about the identity of the person 
she knows as "Clark Kent";  i.e. that she does not recognize him as also 
being the person she knows as "Superman".

I think some alternative formulation of this scenario could lead to a 
situation in which Clark Kent and Superman have universally accepted 
denotations, and URIs may then be appropriate.  In this case, I think that 
it's not possible that they denote exactly the same thing;  e.g. Clark Kent 
denotes a person X wearing a suit and glasses;  Superman denotes the same 
person X wearing a natty blue-and-red number.  In this formulation, using 
URIs seems less troublesome.
