I see your point. Though I'm not sure that the Dan's do. Talking about
some person X named "Superman" (who might later be deemed to equate to
<person:Superman>) is not the same as using "person:Superman" rather
than <person:Superman> to avoid instantiating a URI labeled resource
node in the RDF graph.
