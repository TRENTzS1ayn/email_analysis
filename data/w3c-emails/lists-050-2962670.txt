Ugh... discussion diverges
into metaphysics and philosophy.

Here are the options I find acceptable:

(a) Shoot reification on the grounds that
there isn't consensus about what it means
nor how to use it.

(b) accept my proposal to clarify/change
how it works, based on my implementation
experience, DanBri's, and Jos's.

In order for this to fly, I owe a pile
of test cases. (or Jos or Danbri or
somebody(ies) who agree with this position).

It seems that I'd have to do a bunch of
advocacy too. Bad news is: I really don't
care about it enough to prioritize
it high enough to do a bunch of advocacy.
Either my position is basically understood
and agreed by the WG and the community,
or I'm happy to (a) shoot it. That is:
if there aren't a bunch of people out
in the community who understand rdf:subject
the way I do, then the well-known-name
does me little good; I can just make
up my own namespace.
