Well, some of this is helpful in understanding what the issues are, but 
I'd agree that it doesn't *necessarily* get us to an actual resolution.

Could you summarize once again what that proposal (b) is?  I.e., say it 
in a few sentences or paragraphs so we could say (say at a telecon) "yes 
I agree with that statement of how reification ought to work" (or 
disagree, assuming one feels that way)?  I don't think this request 
constitutes a request for "advocacy" (on the other hand, nailing this 
sucker would be worth a bit wouldn't it?)
