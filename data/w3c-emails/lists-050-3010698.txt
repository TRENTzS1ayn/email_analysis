The same "thing" in the universe, yes, but not the same RDF resource.
We wouldn't want all nodes with Superman and ClarkKent URIs to
be merged, even if we determine that they denote the same "thing".

This equates to my present view, that if two or more folks
use the same URI, they are agreeing that it denotes the same
"thing", whatever that "thing" may be.

That doesn't mean that some "thing" in some universe may not
be denoted by multiple URIs, or by "constellations" of properties,
including literal encoded names, etc. Only that, insofar as that
single URI is concerned, its use represents agreement according
to what the minting authority says it denotes.

It is IMO the right of the minting authority to specify what
a URI means. And if someone else uses it incorrectly, even
if unintentionally, they shouldn't usurp ownership of the meaning
of  that URI but should either conform to the specified meaning
or use another URI. Obviously, that's a social issue (or legal
one) not a technical issue.

But both Clark Kent and Superman would presumably be denoted by
different URIs, and belief could be expressed in terms of either.

If Superman has Xray vision, and it is later determined that Superman
is the same thing as Clark Kent, then one many infer that Clark
Kent also has Xray vision. But even if the are the same thing in
the universe, they are different resources in RDF space (if
denoted by different URIs).

There need not be agreement about all attributes of a thing, only
about what thing a given RDF resource denotes.

Of course one cannot prevent misunderstanding, or even disagreement,
on the SW, but agreeing on the same URI to denote the same thing
seems a reasonable basis to conduct discussions, and we can hope
that knowledge expressed in terms of RDF and URIs will be less
ambiguous than knowledge expressed in natural language ;-)

And that's the beauty of RDF. Users who use URIs are not agreeing
about all of the attributes of a thing. Only the denotation of
that thing by which they describe the attributes of that thing
that *they* know about, or by which they obtain attributes known
about that thing by others.

Then knowledge is pooled, including knowledge about
the equivalences of RDF resources which denote the same things,
and viola, we get a synergetic merging of knowledge that may
be far more than the simple sum of its parts.

And if that merged body of knowledge contains contraditions
(which it likely will) then as you suggest, these could serve
to clarify common understanding (or misunderstanding).

Of course, there can still be disagreement even if everyone is
in complete agreement about what thing a given URI denotes.

I think that folks can attribute contradictory things about the
same URI labeled resource without requiring that it denote more
than one thing.

I consider the N-to-1 mapping of RDF resource(s) to a thing as
fundamental and essential as the N-to-1 mapping of lexical form(s)
to a datatype value. If we allow N-to-N mappings then we lose all
clarity in our statements. I.e. if a given URI can denote more than
one thing in a universe, then we'd never know precisely what it is
anyone is talking about.

This leads us right into the heart of the URI/URL/URN/URP debate
where some folks think that e.g. 'mailto:john.doe@abc.com'
can denote both an email URL and a person, or 'http://www.abc.com' can
be used to denote both a web page URL and the company ABC Inc.
This introduces an N-to-N mapping from the set of RDF resources
to the set of things in the (or a) universe such that if
one says

   <http://www.abc.com> <dc:creator> "John Doe" .

one cannot know if John Doe is the creator of the web page or
of the company.

The "contemporary view" seems to take the view that "a URI is
whatever it is used for" similar to Perl scalars, yet this
introduces this N-to-N mapping from resources to things that
makes inference about knowledge untenable.

I keep thinking that surely there must exist some axiom
or "law" in KR or AI that forbids such N-to-N mappings
in a KR system (my ignorance shames me).

Anyone?
