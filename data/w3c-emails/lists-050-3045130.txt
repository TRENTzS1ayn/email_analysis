If we really determined that they truly denote the same "thing", we 
certainly would like to try! There are many highly practical examples 
where you'd want to get rid of one of the identifiers and agree to use 
the other.  The situation here, though, is Superman and ClarkKent URIs 
don't, strictly speaking, denote the same thing (they denote different 
personas that the same physical being assumes at different points, but 
we obviously need to keep them apart).  Also, there are practical 
difficulties with "legacy data" using both URIs that is hard to revise. 
  Finally, all this is sort of "theoretical":  we have no way to merge 
the  URIs (or even, in RDF, assert they are equivalent;  you can in DAML).

We need to be careful here.  I agree that a given "thing" in the 
universe may be denoted by multiple URIs and so on.  However, in my view 
of the way this will probably work, you may create a URI and describe 
what it means (so you're the minting authority).  I may starting using 
it with the idea that I agree with your meaning, but you may never know 
about it (so you don't necessarily agree).  In that case, strictly 
speaking the agreement is only one-way (it would be inaccurate to say 
"we are agreeing").

I agree that it's the minting authority's right to specify what a URI 
means, but I don't see how we can be very strict in interpreting this. 
For example, the only way I have of understanding what you mean a URI to 
denote is how you describe it using other properties.  You may have left 
some details out of your description, so I may be misled as to what your 
denotation is, and start using it incorrectly (as far as your intended 
meaning goes).  I wouldn't say I was usurping ownership of the meaning 
in that case;  I may have been *trying* to conform to the specified 
meaning and just not gotten it right.  That's going to happen.  I agree 
it's not a technical issue, but we also need to be careful how 
well-behaved we expect the world to be in designing our technology.

If by "different resources in RDF space" you mean RDF has to treat them 
differently, I agree (and in any case, Superman and Clark Kent are 
slightly different, as I've suggested above)).  But they may still be 
the same resource, right?

The *intent* is certainly that use of the same URI indicates that 
agreement.  But I repeat that I only know what someone else denotes by a 
URI (at least, general URIs denoting non-digital things) by their 
description of it in terms of other attributes.  And I may, on the basis 
of the description you present, think we have an agreement when we 
really don't, because we disagree on other attributes that you didn't 
include in your description.

Also, because people determine what names denote on the basis of other 
information about them, there are frequent problems that occur where one 
person thinks that, on the basis of disagreement about descriptive 
properties, they are talking about different things, and another thinks 
that they are talking about the same thing, and the other person is 
simply wrong about that thing's attributes.

I agree.  My only point is there may be some additional conversation 
necessary to resolve such misunderstandings, even after we *think* we 
have agreement (and the Web provides a medium for conducting those 
conversions).

Yes.

Yes.

Strictly speaking though, the problem isn't that we're allowing a given 
URI to denote more than one thing.  The problem is how well (accurately) 
we can transmit that denotation from the minting authority so that it is 
(again, accurately) shared by others who are going to use it.
