In which case, the example has drifted somewhat from my original intent,
which was based on their being two names for one thing-in-the-world, ie.
some wierd guy who's kinda strong, sometimes wears glasses and sometimes
wears a blue and red leotard.

The point isn't that "lois's idea of superman" and "lois's idea of clark"
are distinct entities worthy of our concern. I was trying to make a much
more mundane and (I'd hoped) less woolly point. Lois lacks complete
information about the name-to-world mappings. Her views, messages, diary
entries and (we ought to steer clear of this) mental states will all be
affected by her lack of the 'complete picture'. On the Web, we have a
similar situation: no one document or agent has the whole story. Often
they're wrong, or lack information. The partial information aspect of this
is my main concern: if *everyone* had faultless access to the meaning of
each and every URI name, I wouldn't have my current concerns about
reification.
