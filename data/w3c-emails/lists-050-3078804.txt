Why to a function? Wouldnt a URN be able to name almost anything?

Let me add another thought. Some URIs may be best thought of as 
continuations, so that when invoked (called) they return a data 
entity but also (perhaps implicitly) another way to call the same 
function; and that next call may return a different data entity, of 
course. This lets the 'resource' (?) have some residual state which 
may change with time, rather than being a pure mathematical function, 
and therefore gives some flesh to the otherwise puzzling talk about 
'conceptual mapping' in RFC2396.

Just a thought to keep y'all humming.

PS heres another thought. DAML is going through the throes of 
inventing a query language for itself. Is there any basic similarity 
between using a URI to access something, and posting a query and 
getting back an answer? Maybe a URI is a kind of generic atomic 
'query' addressed to the web as a whole, along the lines of 'does 
anything with this name exist?'

I have no idea if this makes any sense at all, but if it causes 
someone to have an epiphany, please remember me in your will.

Pat
