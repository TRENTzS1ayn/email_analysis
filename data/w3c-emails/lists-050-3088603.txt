OK, let me slow you down. Idiom P in this MT requires the range of a 
property to be a literal-value pair. But that is wrong, for P. If I 
want to say that the range of a property is xsd:integer, I mean to 
say that the range is whatever xsd says integers are, ie the value, 
not a literal-value pair. One hundred and twenty-three is an integer; 
the pair <'123',123> is not an integer (according to XSD).
