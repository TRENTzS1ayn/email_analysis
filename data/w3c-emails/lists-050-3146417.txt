fine with me...

This is a perfectly accurate analysis, Pat, and a very nicely worded
one. In fact, as obvious as it is, it did not occur to me that elements
of lexical spaces (per XSD) could simply be identified with RDF literals
(i.e. literal tokens ;)

The question is whether we go with a 2-way or a 3-way distinction. It
looks like this issue needs to be clarified in the "foundations" part of
the datatyping document. The 3-way distinction seems somewhat more
general. Are there any caveats? Which one would you prefer?
