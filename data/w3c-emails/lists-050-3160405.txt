Can we get small amounts of words to describe these please? Currently
there seem to be three proposals knocking around, with a possibility of
others: (insert "this WG resolves that..." in front of all these)


Proposal #1:

A resource R in an RDF graph G is said to be the reification
of the statement
S P O .
iff there exist in G the following statements:

R <rdf:type> <rdf:Statement> .
R <rdf:subject> f(S) .
R <rdf:predicate> f(P) .
R <rdf:object> f(O) .

where f is simply the identity function.

Objections to this thus far appear to be (apologies if I'm putting words
in people's mouths here):

danbri: objects on the basis that the intended interpretation
associated with the "utterer" of S P O may assign different
denotations to S, P and/or O - in other words, this is "broken"
when reifying statements taken from different sources in the
same graph (is that accurate, Danbri?)

danc: objects on the grounds that there's a use/mention
problem here, that it's hard to see how to make a MTetic
interpretation of this work. (again, correct me if I'm wrong).
(See his earlier messages on this) (- If there isn't a way
to make this make sense, then this seems to be a showstopper
objection)

Proposal #2: (Danbri or danc to fill in the blanks..?)

Looks like proposal #1 but f is defined differently.

f(X) = Xif X is a literal
f(X) = ?if X is a URI-labelled resource
f(X) = ?if X is a blank node

jang: might object if f isn't injective (or "one-to-one")

Proposal #3:

this WG resolves that it's never heard of an eleven-letter
word beginning with "R". (DanC's option A)

(Other things that have been mentioned in passing include other ways of
including statements in a "non-assertive" fashion)

Can we give these all fancy letter names and try again?
