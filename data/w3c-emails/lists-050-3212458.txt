I think DanBri's point is the key one. Lois lacks the information about
the identity between the Clark and Superman URIs. In her interpretation,
there is no conflict in believing `A is strong' and `B is not strong'.
She can believe what she likes and, if there are no correspondences to
show she is inconflict with herself, she can remain sane.

Kent Bach in http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~kbach/puzzle.html talks about this
puzzle and gives several ways to deal with it. He points out the Perry
White (the editor of the planet) is not entitled to hold these two
beliefs because he knows about the identity (as we do). I favour Bach's
`metalinguistic' approach: although Lois apears to be believing stuff
about `our' URIs she lacks some knowledge about their identity which
would stop us believing these two assertions. 

The reification of her beliefs must be understood as having its
components interpreted according to Lois' (the subject of the
reification `Lois believes...') knowledge. I think this indicates that,
at a level of implementation in software, it is `better' or `safer' to
maintain that the reified statement refers only as far as the literals
(in their lexical space) and not to an interpretation made possible only
by the reader's knowledge (hence DanC's pragmatic stance). To
accidentally follow the interpretation through to the set of properties
which have to hand regarding Clark and Superman would be to
misunderstand the context in which Lois believes these two things and to
misunderstand the reifification. It would also come up against a
conflict which does not appear in Lois' mind.
