Short version:

P and S-B have rdfs:range as referring to the value space.
S-A has rdfs:range as referring to the lexical space.
My proposal explores the third possibility of having rdfs:range as referring
to the map.

I don't think there are any a priori reasons that rule that out. It is our
model theory and we are free to choose what parts of the world get modelled
where. Since rdf:type is found in the model I find it more natural to do the
datatyping work in the model.

Longer version:
omitted.
