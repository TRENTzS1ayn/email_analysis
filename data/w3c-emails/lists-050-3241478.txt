I'll try and answer.

Yes

Yes, but such nodes don't exist in the models ... unlike S-A, (or the
original P), at least in the model theory all values (such as integers) are
always paired with a lexical representation.

Yes that's fine I accept the nit.

I want rdf:value as the identity which is why its Universe x Universe.

I am not suggesting literals as subjects in any serialization of RDF, but in
terms to the graph, and particularly taking the schema closure of a graph
literal as subjects is necessary in this approach. (Both the P & D idiom
really does seem to have literals as subject or type statements, just not
syntactically)

Extremely. I am trying to delete the suggestion that xsd:string is the
default type.

If we support no types, or no type information is available for a particular
node labelled "foo", then that node can be interpreted as a pair <"foo", x >
for any x what so ever.

It's model theory not application semantics.



 Suppose that data types BinaryNumber and

"10" without type information could also just be the string, or maybe
there's its of some type we haven't thought of yet. So in the pair < "10", x

since the x is free.

Pass for now.
