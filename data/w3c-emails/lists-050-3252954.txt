Patrick,

I know Pat's already replied to this but I must just point out that this
proposal must rule itself out on lexical grounds alone (regardless of
its `value'). You've used `value' three times, once in the fundamental
sense of a `value space' and then casually in a term for the other side.
I also note you use `data' three times but I can only object to that on
aesthetic grounds.

I'd humbly suggest we restrict the use of `value' to `value space' items
and use `lexical' only for syntactic items and use `data' as a free
radical for both. That jumbles up your table rather messily, I'm afraid.

Martyn
