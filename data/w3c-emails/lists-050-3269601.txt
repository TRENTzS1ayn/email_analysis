It's probably clearer to indicate that these mappings
are within the scope of a specific datatype, e.g.

   BinaryNumber("10",2)
   DecimalNumber("10",10)

which are implied by the TDL pairings (in the graph)

   (<BinaryNumber>, "10")
   (<DecimalNumber>, "10")

and, yes, if the literal is associated with both the
datatypes BinaryNumber and DecimalNumber, then it is
asserted to denote a value for both datatypes.

If that is a contradiction, i.e.

   (<BinaryNumber>, "10") != (<DecimalNumber>, "10")

where both datatype interpretations are applied to
the same value node, then that has to be dealt with,
but that is not a issue for the representation of or
interpretation of those assertions.

Eh?
