I don't see how we can do this, as reification is at present
the most straightforward way to qualify statements.

One could simulate statement qualification by using anonymous
node objects which bear the qualifying properties, but that
seems alot more messy to me and gets in the way of queries
which have to account for all variations of qualified and
non-qualified statements.

I don't think we can toss out reification as it's now
defined, but we may be able to provide for the distinction
between assertions, statements, and quotations (see my other
posting on this from today).
