Actually, I only use it once (I don't consider the front part of
"datatype" to equate to "data"), but that's neither here nor there.

How about just

    'literal'   the RDF/XML string representing an rdfs:Literal
                corresponding to a member of lexical space of
                "some" datatype (context clarifies which we mean)

    'value'     member of value space of "some" datatype

But as Dan suggested, we should probably all just shut up and
let Pat define the terms he feels are optimal.

Cheers,

Patrick
