This is my take on this:

The value of rdf:type is a datatype, not a lexical space or
value space.

If the datatype is a lexical datatype, then one would expect
that the lexical form denoting the value would be part of
the expression.

If the datatype is not a lexical datatype, but rather
a structural datatype, then it has no lexical space
and its absence in the expression is to be expected.

rdf:type is neutral to whether the datatype is lexical or not.
