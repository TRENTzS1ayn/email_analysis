My own view (which, like most views concerning this issue, is
controversial ;-) is that a URN denotes a digital resource that
(actually or potentially) is web-accessible.

IMO, a URN cannot denote abstract or non-digital entities (I'll
avoid calling them "resources" for the moment -- though I think
they are).

Thus, both URLs and URNs denote accessible resources. URLs denote
them directly -- specify their "location" -- and URNs denote
them indirectly, where their location may be context sensitive.

So no, IMO, a URN cannot name "almost anything".

OK, I think I see your point. Rather than a URN being a pointer
to a function it is simply a function that returns a function.

Thus:

To dereference a URL is similar to executing a function
that returns as its value the resource,
whatever that may be.

To dereference a URN is similar to executing a function
that returns as its value a URL, which may
be dereferenced to obtain the resource, whatever
that may be.

URPs on the other hand, are non-dereferencable, and static
and thus are similar to constants. They do not compute to
anything else. They are just what they are.

Whether the dereferencing process/algorithm allows additional
internal redirections does not invalidate the above functional
single-execution-step interpretation, I think.

Well...  just last week I jotted down some design notes for
a simple query portal that would take only a single URI and
return, in RDF of course, all of the knowledge known about
the resource denoted by that URI, with options for various
levels of verbosity, depth, and/or inference.

The context of this idea was a query portal at some major
standards site (W3C, IETF, ISO, etc.) for standards related
knowledge -- in this case, URI Class and Scheme taxonomies
in particular, but also with a view for standard vocabulary
terms, etc.

Thus, one could e.g. resolve "http://ietf.org/URIQuery?http:"
to get all knowledge known by the IETF about the 'http:' URI
scheme, etc. (taking the view that a colon terminated
URI prefix is a valid URI denoting the URI scheme itself).

Is this similar to what you had in mind?

(This is, depending on your perspective, a trivial generalization
 of the RDDL approach -- but for any URI (not just namespaces)
 and for all knowledge, in RDF (not just that defined by the
 RDDL vocabulary)

Cheers,

Patrick
