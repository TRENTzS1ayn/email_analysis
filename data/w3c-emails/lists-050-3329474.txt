It depends on the application, and of course, specific applications
are free to interpret, modify, and merge RDF graphs as they need.

There are, however, very real contexts where even if we know with
100% certainty that two resources with different URIs are the very
same thing, we can never merge those nodes, unless we wish to
discard all traces of "perspective".

E.g. consider a digital resource with DOI, ISBN, and proprietary
identities, each of which is a URI, and different users of that
resource make statements about it using different identities,
yet it is known that these are all synonymous identifiers.

You may decide to merge based on e.g. DOIs, but then some
application presents a query based on the ISBN, so you
still have to maintain the variant identities and their
equality.

If you merge all synonymous URIs into a single URI:

1. How do you choose which one to use?
2. How do you accomodate queries from applications that only
   "know" the resource by one of the other URIs?
3. How do you maintain historical perspective for statements
   made using one URI vs another?
4. What if equality of identifiers is not universally agreed?
5. What if equality of identifiers is later found to be false?

Thus, it seems to me that one can never escape having to
accept all synonyms in a knowledge base and thus any benefits
of actual merging is either limited to a very narrow
application space (or closed systems) or is an illusion.

Some examples would be very appreciated (though feel free to
send them offlist, if you think they would be noise for the
majority)

Right. As I outlined above (apparently unnecessarily ;-)

Different RDF resources, having different URIs, but perhaps
the same "thing". Just like (xsd:integer, "5") and (xsd:integer, "05")
are the same "thing".

It is correct, though, that even if two RDF resources correlate
to the same "thing" in some universe, that doesn't mean that
those resources are actually identitical, since as is the case
with Superman versus Clark Kent, resources can denote a subset
of qualities of a given "thing" that are significant to a given
perspective or context.

Hmmm... I can't say I agree. Use of the same URI is agreement
about the referent, not agreement about everything that anyone
might say about that referent.

We may both agree that <person:John> denotes a specific person,
but not agree that that person is smart. You may assert he is
smart. I may assert he is dumb. But all the common use of the
URI implies is agreement that we are both talking about the
same person, nothing more.

Of course, without mechanisms for authority, scope, source, etc.
it would be very difficult to benefit from such an interpretation,
and I agree that insofar as the present RDF is concerned, it's
pretty hard not to have to accept the view that use of the same
URI implies agreement about everything said about the resource
denoted by that URI.

Still, I hold fast to my view that use of a URI only implies agreement
about the identity of the referent, and am working on the
other bits needed to make it workable...

Agreement can be (and to date usually is) based on knowledge
not expressed in RDF but expressed in natural language and
exchanged in written prose or word of mouth.

Perhaps in the future we will have a sufficiently rich and
mature set of upper level ontologies which will allow us to
define our understanding of the identity of resources based
on semantic primities and expressed in RDF, but not yet.

Insofar as they are attributes which establish only identity,
I agree. Other attributes need not be the basis of agreement
for common use of a URI.

Absolutely.

Quite so.
