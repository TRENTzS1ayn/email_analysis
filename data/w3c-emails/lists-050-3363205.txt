Well, let me suggest what the answer should be. This may seem odd, but....

I think the answer depends on whether this is a single graph being 
'merged' with itself, or whether it is two distinct, but identical 
(ie isomorphic) graphs. If the former, then the 'merge' is just the 
same graph, with 2 nodes and one arc: a single triple. If the latter, 
then it is a larger graph with three nodes (assuming foo is a uriref) 
and two arcs. This is because different occurrences of a 'bare' 
literal have to be treated as distinct nodes (in case one of them 
should get itself attached to a different datatyping scheme from the 
other...), unlike urirefs. Notice that if you did a similar exercise 
with two copies of an all-uriref triple:

foo bar baz .

then the merged graph would be the same in either case, ie it would 
simply be a single triple; since in this case, the merging would 
(re-)identify the two copies of each uriref.
