no doubt, there is a use/mention problem
(I even asked my wife, and she was also sure...)

I would say f(X) = quote(X)

I wouldn't know that one

Resolutions???

so we could have e.g. at <uri0>
  <uri1> <uri2> <uri3> .
  <uri2> rdfs:range rdf:Description .
and at <uri3>
  <uri4> <uri5> <uri6> .
  <uri7> <uri8> <uri9> .
asserting the triples of <uri0>
doesn't mean asserting those of <uri3>

my dear...
