No, it's not a show-stopper objection; I don't see a conflict
between Proposal #1 as stated above and the model theory.

I just don't have any use for that sort of reification;
i.e. I don't see why it's in the spec.
I on behalf of the W3C Semantic Web Advanced Development group,
I think. (I should double-check with the rest of the group.)

If other folks find it useful (or if we're prepared to
accept it as the best interpretation of the current spec
or whatever), then I don't object.

Or... hmm... while I don't see a big conflict with the
model theory, I do see a bunch of stuff that should
be added to the model theory to describe this idea
of reification, and it looks really ugly.

Here's an entailment test:

input:

<msgid:s@example> <msgid:p@example> "o".

does it rdf-entail this?
_:ss <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#object> "o".
_:ss <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> 
<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement>.

?

The way I read proposal 1, it does.

In fact, it seems axiomatic that for any literal "oo", there's
a statement with that object. i.e. here's an entailment test:

input: (none/empty)

output:
_:ss <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#object> "oo".

yeah... f(X) is quote(X)

> f(X) = Xif X is a literal

umm... I'm not sure how to quote literals.

> f(X) = ?if X is a URI-labelled resource

I was thinking
  f(<http...>) = "http:..."

but I didn't consider quoting literals and blank nodes.
Blech.

> f(X) = ?if X is a blank node

I dunno.

This macro-expansion form of quoting is messier than I thought.
Maybe TimBL's right... maybe parseType="??:quote" is the
only mechanism that meets my requirements.

> jang: might object if f isn't injective (or "one-to-one")

as well you should.

I find that acceptable.

1/2/3 are sufficiently fancy for me.
