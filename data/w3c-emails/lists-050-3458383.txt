Right.  We have two possible meanings of rdf:subject and we have to choose 
which one rdf:subject means and leave the other one for a different vocabulary.

Dan's statement implies that the reification support in RDF/XML is of 
little/no value to him, since he'd lose that switching to another 
vocabulary.  Is that true of others supporting the 'object of rdf:subject 
is a URI' position?

We have two different things to say and we could use two different 
vocabularies to say it.  The things that distinguish the rdf:subject 
vocabulary is:

   o there is syntactic support for it in rdf/xml
   o there are existing implementations.
