Bloody hell, we're agreeing! I should add, if literal DT support ends up
including snazzy functors so that I can have literals like this:
<a> <b> quote("http://foo/") .
<a> <b> quote(<http://foo/>) .
then (modulo having no way to handle anon resources like this) I'd be
happier than hacking quoting out of string manipulations.
