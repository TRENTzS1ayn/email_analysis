This was what motivated my suggestion of two new classes rdf:Assertion
and rdf:Quotation, both rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Statement, to provide a
means of distinction for the purpose of intepretation.

That was my take.

Right. rdf:Assertion is the unmarked case, implied by actual
property arcs from subject nodes to object nodes, and rdf:Quotation
is available as an alternate to rdf:Statement providing for
the slightly different interpretation of "utterance" rather
than statement.

This approach seems backwards compatable with (most) current
usage while allowing those who want the quotation distinction
to achieve it explicitly.
