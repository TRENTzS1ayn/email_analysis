That's what I understood about the *situation*.  It's the syntactic 
distinction I'm having trouble with.

This last section of your comment is getting to what I wanted more information about.  

(NB:  the brackets in the examples are intended to indicate a "reification boundary";  
I'll write out the separate subject, predicate, etc. triples if that would help.)


Dan's example seemed to suggest that a piece of software, having

   lois accepts [superman is strong]

and being aware that superman and clark are coreferring terms, would go 
ahead and substitute one term for the other, determining that

   lois accepts [clark is strong]

ignoring the fact that this substitution must place *inside* a reified statement,
and inside the "context" (sorry!) of what "lois accepts", and that we 
have no explicit statement that 


   lois accepts [clark isthesameas superman]


(which would justify that sort of substitution).  The suggestion seems to be that
software would be less likely to perform such incorrect "reasoning" if it instead saw:


   lois accepts ["superman" "is" "strong"]


and I'm wondering why a piece of software might not just as easily 
"dequote" as "dereify" in cases like this.  I appreciate that there's a 
distinction between the two forms (and have no particular difficulty 
with adopting this "quoted" form), but I'm still wondering about how the 
two forms automatically convey the distinction you're having them make. 
  This particularly because I think we all agree that we can't assume 
universal agreement on all the properties of the things we talk about, 
even if we use URIs to refer to them.
