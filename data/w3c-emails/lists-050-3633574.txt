Thanks... mostly this confirms what I expected.

So, in effect, the denotation of *any* node is a pair (in any model of an 
RDF graph)?

Ah, I think I get it.  In any model (which in your MT is defined relative 
to some set of datatypes as well as the URI vocabulary), the interpretation 
can be _any_ pair of <literal,value> that is a member of some datatype 
mapping.  rdf:type and schema statements may have the effect of eliminating 
some potential candidates from the set of models?

I think this would need to be addressed, but I now don't see it as a big 
deal.  I suppose one could add a "bottom" or "null" to the literal domain 
and use that?
