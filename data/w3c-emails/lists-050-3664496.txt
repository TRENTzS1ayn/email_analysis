Nodes labelled with URIs map to resources
Nodes labelled with strings map to pairs
Blank nodes can map to either resources or pairs.

Almost correct.
The doc allows _any_ pair (whatsoever).
There is no requirement that there are any datatypes (an earlier draft,
which I think you looked at, used xsd:string as a default, that's been
dropped, I had made a mistake), so there is no requirement that the pair
belongs to a datatype.

All pairs which are the interpretation of Unicode string nodes are required
to have the string literal being the same as the node label.

The key part is your last sentence quoted:
"rdf:type and schema statements may have the effect of  eliminating some
potential candidates" .
