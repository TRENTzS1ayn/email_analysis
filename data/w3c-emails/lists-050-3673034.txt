Of course that's what it says.

The specified pairings correspond to the mappings between
a member of a value space
of a *specific* datatype and a member of the lexical
space of the *same* datatype. Thus, the pairing
("10",2) is not without context. The context is the
datatype, such that "10" is a member of that datatype's
lexical space and 2 is the corresponding member of
the same datatype's value space.
