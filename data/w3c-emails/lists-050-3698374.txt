Oh sure, its your model theory, and there is no reason to rule it out 
a priori. I guess maybe I was reading too much into the section 
heading that referred to P, assuming that this meant to say that this 
was an accurate rendering of the old P idiom.

However, I still think that most people who write something like

foo rdfs:range xsd:integer .

would intend to be saying that the range of foo was integers as defined by xsd.
