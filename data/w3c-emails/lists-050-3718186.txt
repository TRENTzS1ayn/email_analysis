Talking with Brian it seems it would have been clearer for our WG to have
used xsd:integer.map throughout the TDL proposal - at least that's the way
model theory worked out.

The TDL proposal only uses the value without its lexical representation in
the application space (above the model theory).

The way the mdoel theory for TDL is clear about type is to always have both
the literal string and the typed value.
