As I said in my discussion of how perl programmers might
do datatyping in RDF, it's not necessarily the case
that in S, "30" is a string; we could call them
"scalars" if you don't like using "30" to represent
an integer.

What's necessarily
the case is that in S, "30" denotes the same thing in all
interpretaions, but in TDL it doesn't.
