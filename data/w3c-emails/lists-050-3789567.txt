This is an important distinction (and I agree we need the token
interpretion for this)

"tps"?  I agree that a lot of the reification discussions have seemed to
assume that the entire web (possibly the entire world!) consists of
telepaths, but if that were true reification becomes really simple.  Or
did you mean "teepees" (as in conical tents)?  I've found a number of
teepee sites on the Web recently, but I'm not sure how they would apply
reification.
