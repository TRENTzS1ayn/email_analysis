Right, I tried to illustrate this point in

I'm assuming you are referring to

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Jan/att-0007/01-RDF_Model_Theory.htm

?

There, in Appendix A, Subsec 1, tidyness is defined in condition 3 for
both urirefs and literals. The comment "graph is tidy on uriref nodes"
should in fact say "... tidy on uriref and literal nodes", since label()
is used both for uri nodes and literal nodes - unless Pat had something
else in mind? Pat, did you?
