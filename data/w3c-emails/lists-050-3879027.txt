Indeed, "cannot work with" instead of "cannot
live with" (because life is mostly work for us).
We thought to have a responsability (as an engineer)
and when we don't succeed with something, we fail
and backtrack.
We didn't succeed with proposal 1.
We did do the job with a kind of proposal 2
(the quote() stuff) but we can also understand
and follow that that is not an option.
We now do the job with N3 contexts and I'm
convinced that Pat will convince you!
