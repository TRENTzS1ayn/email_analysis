Can you live with the RDF spec having a (clarified version of) option 1,
so long as its limitations are made clear?

While I have big misgivings about the utility of rdf:Statement etc as
currently defined/used, I've come to the view that it has some uses, and
that a fixed up version requires substantial new vocabulary (eg. to handle
blank nodes properly). I'd be happy seeing folk collaborate on a W3C Note
to this end. So while I don't myself have much use for the current
reification machinery, I'm happy so long as the spec is clear to warn folk
about its possible risks / mis-use.

The N3 contexts angle is interesting. I look forward to hearing Pat's
pitch for why this is feasibly do-able...
