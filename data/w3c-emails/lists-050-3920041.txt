I was referring to that version (dec 14 draft)

Near the beginning it says

"Notice that disjoint graphs do not have any blank nodes in common, by
definition, and that each separate occurrence of a literal is considered a
separate node (in contrast to urirefs); we will therefore distinguish
between literals and literal nodes."

I think there are some editorial issues that have left confusion.

Sergey, wanting tidiness, read tidiness.
Jeremy, wanting untidiness, read untidiness.

I think the document probably allows both readings.

Jeremy


PS You should see my cube, it might explain some things about untidiness.
