OK. Definitely a bug with TDL model theory.


I can describe the approach I will work on, but only in English at this
stage. Mathematics to follow later.

Pat's model theory (both the current draft and the editor's draft) on
entailment amount to:

An RDF Graph A entails another RDF Graph B if, given a set of URIRefs from
which the uriref labels are taken, and any interpretation of these uriref
into some universe, then:
  whenever there is
     some mapping of the blank nodes of A into that universe such that the
triples of A are satifisfied,
  then
     there is also a mapping of the blank nodes of B into that universe such
that the triples of B are satisfied.

In TDL what we should have is:

An RDF Graph A entails another RDF Graph B if, given a set of URIRefs from
which the uriref labels are taken, and any interpretation of these uriref
into some universe, then:
  whenever there is
     some mapping of the blank nodes and literal nodes of A into that
universe such that the triples of A are satifisfied (including all
datatyping triples, understood as in the TDL document)
  then
     there is also a mapping of the blank nodes and literal nodes of B into
that universe such that the triples of B are satisfied.

Peter suggests (if I have understood him correctly) that what I in fact
wrote had dropped the existential quantification over the blank nodes as
well!



Sorry for the mistake.
I haven't done model theory in the last fifteen years!
