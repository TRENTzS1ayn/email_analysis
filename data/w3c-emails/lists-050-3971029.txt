Sergey,

If TDL supports tidy literals (which it does, though the MT will need
adjustment) does this address your concerns about compatability with
your present applications?

A TDL with tidy literals allows (I belive) for Dan's "redhead"
example where the datatyping for a given property is implicit in
the RDF and kept consistent as a characteristic of the application
environment (i.e. everybody agrees that 'hairColor' is a value
from some enumeration "red", "blue", "green", etc. and the
reliability of the axiom inferring redheadedness relies on
conformance to that implicit datatyping).

Eh?

Patrick
