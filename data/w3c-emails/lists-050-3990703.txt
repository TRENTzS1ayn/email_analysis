But this presumes an implicit, global datatype for all values
of a given predicate. Surely you are not saying that any
arbitrary string has a single interpretation?

As many examples have show, the same literal can -- in the
context of a given datatype -- mean very different things.

Two literals may be string equal, but not denote the same
value. Literals are local names and we need the "namespace"
context provided by a datatype to differentiate between
different meanings.

Tidy literals will prevent any adoption of literals as
subjects in the future.

I agree. RDF rather needs a consistent, generic mechanism
for statement qualification, which includes such things
as language scoping.

Why the extra layer of anonymous node? Of you're
going to capture language scoping with predicates
rather than datatyping, why not just use subproperties
of the rdf:label property? I.e.:

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID="Class" enLabel="Class" frLabel="Classe"/>
<rdf:Description rdf:about="#enLabel">
   <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="&rdf;label/>
</rdf:Description>
<rdf:Description rdf:about="#frLabel">
   <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="&rdf;label/>
</rdf:Description>

Of course, in either case, we still haven't related those
literal values with some standardized name for the languages
English or French (e.g. (xsd:lang,"en") or (xsd:lang,"fr")
etc.

I'm not sure how this is "vanilla" if an application
must be aware of the particular ontology being used for
scoping. I think a more generic mechanism is called for.

This of course depends on the semantics of s:subPropertyOf.

Does it define a subset relation between value spaces,
and/or lexical spaces, and/or canonical lexical spaces?
