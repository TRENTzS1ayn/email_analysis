Hmmm ...

As I understand Patrick's position:


There is an abstract layer over a tidy graph in which the TDL for one use of
a literal node is distinct from the TDL for a second use.

This abstract layer seems to be a datatyping layer between the graph and the
model theory.

I did consider this approach to doing the mathematics for TDL and couldn't
get it to work, with all respect, Patrick has not shown to my satisfaction
how it would work.

Let's suppose that it could be made to work.

I think an Occam's razor argument would favour a two layer approach over a
three layer approach.
