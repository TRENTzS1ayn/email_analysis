Oh dear me, was it something I said?!  ;-)

I agree.

Exactly.

Agree.

Well, different occurrences of literals -- with occurrence being
differentiated by different context, not necessarily whether some
node with that literal label is "shared" in the expression of
different contexts.

What counts is that the context is distinct, and the distinct
context denotes a distinct occurrence of the literal, and that
results in a unique interpretation for that context.

Well, I guess I don't see a difference. Meaning, that the TDL
interpretation (based on the labels, not the nodes) is the same
whether or not the graph is tidy or untidy -- and that goes for
URI labeled nodes as well. So I don't see TDL *requiring* an untidy
graph, per se.

Of course, as I pointed out in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0327.html

there may be other problems with tidy literals, but I didn't see
any problems insofar as the TDL interpretation was concerned.
