Because the specification says so.

I don't know how to make sense of that.

I doubt you really need "30" to mean something else.
Zillions of perl and tcl programmers, for example,
do just fine with just one kind of literal.

I expect you just need to talk about something closely
related to "30", such as the integer whose decimal
(or octal or ...) numeral is "30". You can do that with S.

All handled by S, to my satisfaction. I have working
calendar applications, stuff that does mathmatical
calculations, etc., all using S (S-B, in particular).
See http://www.w3.org/2000/01/sw/ .

One doesn't. If one wants to refer to something other
than the two character string '3' followed by '0',
one uses a different expression than "30".

After several months of implementation experience with S,
I have not run into any problems with S.
