I don't see how that is possible. S might say that
literal nodes are tidy, such that a given literal
resides at one and only one node, but I don't think it
says that a given literal has the same interpretation
(maps to the same value in the value space of a
single datatype) in all contexts, always.

See items 5 and 7 of the desiderada.

See sections 3.1 and 3.3 of the TDL proposal.

See section 4.9, Idiom A of the S proposal.

All have to do with local (vs. global) typing.

Nope. Sorry. You can't use both. They are not compatible
in the same knowledge base.

What happens when you choose to use S-B and I choose to
use S-A and then we want to syndicate our knowledge
but can't because our idioms are not compatible?

I consider this to be a major show stopper for S.

Hmmm.... Is this an application design choice?

How will my application know about your application's
typing expectations when I get your data?

Well, you're going to have a very tough
time freely exchanging knowledge with others
when your expectations about what
are (to RDF) local names are not shared
globally by others.

So RDF datatypes can only be integers or strings?

Sergey? Can you confirm that?
