Insofar as qualified values are concerned, the anonymous node
idiom seems reasonable. When we get to authority, source, etc.
which relate to the entire statement, though, it seems far
less correct to attach those qualifications to the object/value
rather than to the statement itself.

I probably would have better off having used a property
such as ex:authority rather than a language scope in my
examples.
