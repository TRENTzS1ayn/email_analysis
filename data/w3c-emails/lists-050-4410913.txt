You updated the definitions section; I intend to steal some of this
for the start of the syntax doc since I got some feedback about my
rather hasty and inadqueate description of the RDF graph.

I don't see that in the previous 25 Sep published WD.  I assume you
mean deleted from the previous internal draft?  The abstract still
mentions this I see, so I guess that is OK.

What needs to be sorted out?  If there are issues, can you make sure
they are linked to issues recorded on the issues list so that readers
of this document can follow the open issues, and find out later on
how they are addressed.

You could add a short section listing the known/open issues to be
addressed.  Doesn't have to be much, even a bulleted list with
entries of the form
"reification - yeah, we are working on it, see tracking Issue rdfms-....".


Finally, you need to update some references to the newer versions

[RDF/XML] should point to the 18 Dec one (and new title too)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20011218

[RDFTestCases] should point to the 15 Nov one:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-rdf-testcases-20011115/

Cheers
