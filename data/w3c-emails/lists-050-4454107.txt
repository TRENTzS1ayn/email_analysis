OK, but be aware that the definitions here make graphs be non-tidy on 
literal nodes, which is currently controversial. That may be changed 
once we settle on a datatyping scheme, so use these defs with caution.

Right.

See 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0094.html 
(end of that msg). The MT did 'sort this out' in a sense, but in a 
way that made rdf:Bags into a species of sequence; ie it said, in 
effect, that all containers were totally ordered in RDF (ordered by 
the access properties :_1, :_2 etc. ), but that bags were just 
declared to have the baggishness property; it would be up to some 
other application to figure out that the bag with A in :_1 and B in 
:_2 was the 'same' bag as the one with A in :_2 and B in :_1. Jeremy 
doesn't like that, I gather, so this issue isn't resolved yet.

OK, I will try to find the relevant open-issues. There doesnt seem to 
be one specifically addressing reification, oddly enough.

Good idea, if I can locate them I will do that. I will certainly add 
the 'open issues' section as an appendix.

Thanks, done.
