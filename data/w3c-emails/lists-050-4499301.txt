Ouch, no it isn't.
Fixed.

Fixed.

OK, fixed. I just deleted the 'always'.

OK, I have added a brief explanation of separability and put this 
definition more where it belongs, nearer the front of the section. I 
hope this makes things clearer.

If I were doing this in a more 'mathematical' way, I would start by 
constructing Herbrand interpretations and defining  minimality, then 
prove the interpolation lemma directly and then derive everything 
else from it. But I think that wouldn't be so useful to a non-math 
readership. Even though some of these lemmas follow from others, 
proving most of the directly from first principles gives a better 
feel for how to use MT in analysing inferences, i think. (?)

Right. Intuitively if you make E' true then E is forced to be (E not 
separable from E'), but not reverse.  This is now stated more 
explicitly.

The point is that there could still be something in a universe that 
you could map _:x to and have that triple come out true, even though 
there was no uriref that denoted that thing. There can be things in 
the universe that don't have a uriref referring to them, right? All 
the triple says is that *something* exists (whose bbb is ccc), but 
that something might not have a name in the form of a uriref.

Right. The blank nodes are themselves considered to be things in the 
universe. The A mapping where they denote themselves (identity map) 
then has [I+A] satisfying all the triple with blank nodes in them, 
so....

??? That isn't a ground triple.

Under that A it would, but then there would be a different A' with 
[I+A'] satisfying E. But in any case, the Herbrand lemma only 
establishes that *a* satisfying interpretation exists, and the 
construction of the Herbrand interpretation assigns true to that 
triple (if it occurs in the graph). So in your example, the Herbrand 
interpretation of E would look like this:

IR={ node(_:x), bbb, ccc}
IEXT(bbb)={<node(_:x), ccc>}, IEXT(node(_:x))=IEXT(ccc)={ }

Which satisfies E but makes E' false, since it doesn't assign any 
meaning to aaa.

No. Well, it depends what you mean to 'allow'. I don't exclude them 
because there is no need to, since they can never occur in those 
positions in the LHS of those rules. The rdfs3 and 4b cases need to 
be restricted since a literal could legally appear there in the LHS 
patterns but would produce a syntactically illegal triple on the RHS.

Should I put a sentence of explanation?
