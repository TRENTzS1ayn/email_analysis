Yes... I think it's helpful to build some intuitive feel for what's going 
before leaping off into pure mathematical structures

Aah...

... I was confusing triples with denotations.  Still.  :-(

Getting that straight, the rest is fine.

Probably not ... just checking that was what you meant.  If I weren't in 
"reviewer mode" it wouldn't have caused me to pause.
