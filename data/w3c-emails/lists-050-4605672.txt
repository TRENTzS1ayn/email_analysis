Dan, you had almost convinced that some version of the S proposal is 
the best way for RDF to go, but then you said this:

Re first paragraph above; are they really expecting that "abc" always 
*denotes* the same thing as "abc", for literals? (Not just that "abc" 
is the same string as "abc" , i.e.) Because if they are, then they 
really seem to me to just not doing datayping at all. Which is fine, 
I guess; but then we are supposed to be doing datatyping, right? I 
mean, by mandate, in our charter. So even though existing code may 
decide to ignore it, surely we are obliged to take it more seriously.

Re second paragraph.  I have to say, if the RDF community is 
expecting that strings and URIs are a sufficient basis for knowledge 
exchange, then its time the RDF community  stepped out into the real 
world for a while. Come on, you can't be serious, surely? For 
example, numbers are *really* handy, you know?
