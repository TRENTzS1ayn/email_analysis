Jeremy, feel free to correct me if you disagree ;-)

I see the recent refinement of TDL as an attempt to provide
tidy literals to those who want them without loosing the
untidyness that is inherent in the context dependent interpretation
of literals. It was an attempt at a fusion of TDL and S-P,
in the interest of finding a common ground and reaching a
mutually acceptable solution.

As Jeremy has said to me so elegantly, "there's untidyness in
there somewhere", and I agree.

You're either going to have untidy literal nodes or untidy
bnodes with literals hanging off them. There's no way around
that.

If it turns out that the "manditory bnode" idiom is going to
be highly backwards incompatable (and I'm not saying it is),
cest la vie, then we are stuck with untidy literal nodes, and
back to the previous TDL model.

The only show stopper that has been claimed for TDL is
that it doesn't have tidy literals -- based on the view
that e.g. "1984" always means the same thing. I hope that
it has become clear that this view is not
valid in an environment of global interchange between
disparate sources of knowledge.

So it should be concluded that there are no show stoppers
for TDL.

You may not love TDL for stylistic or other esthetic
reasons, but I feel that all supposed "fatal" flaws
with TDL have been addressed.

I don't feel the same is true for S, as my comments to
Brian's summary outline.

Let me state for the record that I am not religiously
tied to TDL. If S can be refined so that what I see as
unacceptable shortcomings are eradicated, then great.
It's not a matter of ego or advocacy -- but about having
a solution that will address all of the desiderada in
as general, efficient, and compatable a way possible.

So, that said, I still await someone to address the
issues of compatability of local and global idioms
and idiom specific vocabularies.

Cheers,

Patrick
