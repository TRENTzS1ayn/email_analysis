OK, yet another version of the MT document is now accessible at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/w3-rdf-mt-draft-J.html

(same URI as before). It passes the W3C link and HTML checks, but the 
CSS validator insists there is a non-XML character on line 1561, 
which I cannot find and Dreamweaver apparently cannot edit out (??)

This has new stuff in yellow and even newer stuff in pink. (Question 
about good HTML practice. Should the final version have all the 
<span> and <..class=..> stuff edited out of it, or is it considered 
OK to leave all that clutter in, and just wipe out the colors in the 
header??)

All the proofs are now done. This has necessitated a few small 
changes to the statements of some of the lemmas, and a slight fixing 
of the semantic conditions on rdf-interpretations (iff--> only if, in 
the second condition. I should have noticed that iff was a bug a long 
time ago.)

I have put in an 'open issues' appendix with links to the issue 
tracking, and also added some appropriate other links to issues  here 
and there in the text, and put in the more uptodate references. 
(Thanks, Dave.) And the appendices are all alphabetic now.
