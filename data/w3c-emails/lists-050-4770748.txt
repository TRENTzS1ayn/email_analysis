Just checking the pink changes... Mostly looks very good.  I have one 
question and a comment.


Section 3:  I notice the condition:

  if x is in IP then IEXT(I(rdf:type)) contains <x, I(rdf:Property)>

is relaxed from iff in the previous version.  Do I take this to mean that 
some things of type rdf:Property (according to the relational extension of 
rdf:type) may be non-members of IP?


Section 4:

RDF closure lemma. Any rdf-interpretation of E satisfies the rdf-closure of 
E; and any minimal simple satisfying interpretation of the rdf-closure of E 
is a satisfying rdf-interpretation of E.

Er, shouldn't that be "Any *satisfying* rdf-interpretation of E ..." ?

(Similarly section 6, RDFS closure lemma?)
