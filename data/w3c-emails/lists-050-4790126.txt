If this is the end of the thread, I can safely add my 0.02 euros:

This is what I've implemented for the sake of promoting (a) long-term
survival of distinct information and (b) good practices in dependent
applications. As much as possible and as far as we can economically
police it, comparisons of semantically different objects throws an
exception. It's not an empty set: it's broken - a bad question. `Give me
a film called the same as Mary's age' is a kid's puzzle and will not
lead to an enhancement in world knowledge.
