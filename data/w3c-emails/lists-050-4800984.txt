Assuming that the lexicalization is canonical. Back to the `age of Mary
as a string' expressed as octal or as "010", again.

My problem from the query side is that it is a desirable application
function to define equivalence for each datatype in a liberal manner -
albeit only locally. Thus two literal dates may be equal according to
ISO8601 though their strings are not. Even strings in practice can be
usefully equated modulo whitespace trimming, etc.

If you try and do this sort of cross-type equation in practice then you
cannot use any locally sanctioned equality conventions (from which
side?) and you're reduced to pedantic char-by-char comparison.

This isn't a fundamental comment on RDF as such but belongs in the area
of:

TDL probably also allows the application developer to be more helpful.

The lex-value mapping for a datatype may include non-trivial conversions
which make queries as the above very frustrating if not downright silly:
the birthdate of Mary as a string is the same as her encrypted password
expressed in decimal - pure nonsense.
