I accept the reasoning above; it doesn't address my objection;
it' just shows that my example wasn't very good. Sergey's
example makes the point better:

--8<--

  _:f <rdf:type> <film> .
  _:f <dc:Title> "10" .
  <mary> <age> "10" .

Given a query:

  (?x <dc:Title> ?y) & (?z <age> ?y)
--8<--

As to the claim that query is irrelevant, I disagree;
it's clearly analagous to an entailment test:

premise:

  _:f <rdf:type> <film> .
  _:f <dc:Title> "10" .
  <mary> <age> "10" .

conclusion:

  _:x <dc:Title> _:y.
  _:z <age> _:y.

pass or fail?

Clearly when viewed in TDL-extended-N3 as above...

  _:f <rdf:type> <film> .
  _:f <dc:Title> (_:t1, "10") .
  <mary> <age> (_:t2, "10") .

it's not valid to conclude

  _:x <dc:Title> _:y.
  _:z <age> _:y.

The TDL proponents claim this is a feature: the two occurences
of "10" might indeed denote different things. I see it as a bug:
I think RDF users expect "10" to match "10".
This seems to put the two positions in pretty stark contrast.
