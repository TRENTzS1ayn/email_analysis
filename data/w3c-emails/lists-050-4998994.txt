It IS possible to conclude the specified inference,
based on string comparison of literals, which TDL
supports.

Therefore, I do NOT agree with Dan that you
CANNOT conclude that inference.

(BTW,I'm not shouting ;-) I'm just stressing the
important bits, since there seems a perpetual
confusion about exactly what I am disagreeing
with ;-)

Yes and no.

It's not an issue for TDL, it's an issue for the query
engine. If the query is based on string comparison of
literals only, then it will not return null, but will
bind ?y to the literal string "10" (which IMO is a
logical error).

If the query engine is comparing values, it will return
null.

TDL does not mandate either result. It allows for either.
(and, as Jeremy has pointed out, that is a benefit)
