It is correct as stated, but obviously unclear. I have add some 
sentences of explanation, to make it clear that this is not a typo.

OK, and Ive added some more prose to explain why its done this way.

OK

Er..yes, though I don't need to emphasize it because I don't use it; 
and IF we decide to go the S-style route for datatyping then all this 
will go away, so I'd rather not go on about it more than we really 
need to at this stage.

Hmm, good question. My instinctive logicians-hat-on reply would be 
yes; but Ive learned that what I think of as an answer to a query is 
a lot simpler than what SQL folk think it is, eg this kind of answer 
wouldn't allow you to ask *how many* instances there were, things 
like that.

I think I'll leave this until we do reification. I wouldnt want to 
mess with the idea of truth, however.  [BTW, I would say that in 
option 1, there should be *no* entailment in either direction between 
a triple and its reification. Isnt that what people use it for, to 
encode a triple without asserting it?]

Well, it all depends on what datatyping scheme we settle on. Like I 
said, Im trying to avoid that issue in this version as far as 
possible. The single-global-mapping assumption is either a stop-gap 
waiting for a later extension of the MT where datatypes will be more 
fully involved with the machinery and a more complicated story will 
get told about them, or else is a sketch of the S proposal which (as 
far as the MT  is concerned) amounts to just saying that all literals 
denote strings. Either way, it will need to be re-done.  When we 
decide....

In the S proposal, RDF entailment itself will not 'deal with' 
datatypes in any special way and we could make graphs be tidy on 
literal nodes.  For the other proposals, I would expect to introduce 
another semantic extension (dt-interpretations and dt-entailment) 
that would deal with those mappings.

Well, it may not be useful, but that's not the MT's problem. If 
literals denote strings, then that's what they denote. If you wanna 
talk about values, you have to write some more triples, right?
