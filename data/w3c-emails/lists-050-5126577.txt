Here are some ideas:

Agenda request: reification
Any volunteers to come up with a pile
of test cases that will help crystalize the
issues?

Agenda request: datatypes
I think perhaps we can choose between TDL
and S before the meeting, but there are
zillions of little details to clean up, I think.
What URI-names to use, how many, etc.
whether this impacts xml:lang etc.

Agenda request: collections
(esp. entailment stuff around bags. I have
an idea I haven't written up yet...)

Agenda request: WebOnt update
Maybe this should go on the Thursday RDF IG
agenda in stead, but I'll give folks
in this WG an opportunity to say "no, let's
spend some of our meeting time on it."

Objective: get to zero open issues on M&S, i.e. 
on syntax and model theory. Issue a last-call
on them ASAP after the meeting. Switch
to debug-the-test-cases mode from then on.

Objective: get to zero open issues on RDF schema.
(are we there already? if not, what's left?
if so, why haven't we done a last call?)

[I suggest choosing one of the objectives
above, not both.]

Objective: paint a picture of the end game.
What communities are critical to the consensus
around our specs? Have we reached them? If not,
what else do we need to do? Where can we
reach them? What conferences/mailing-lists/publications/etc?
