OK, the P idiom is this:

   Jenny exP:birthDate _:a .
   _:a rdf:value "2001-07-15" .
   _:a rdf:type exP:date .

or, for a global typing idiom, instead of the final triple, use:

   exP:birthDate rdfs:range exP:date .


You suggest that exP:date is the same as xsd:date.map;  i.e. it denotes the 
data type mapping, whose class extension is a set of <value,lexical> 
pairs.  The denotation of _:a is then a <value,lexical> pair, and the 
property rdf:value then is used like a "selector", in that it relates a 
member of its subject pair to a lexical that is its object; it's relational 
extension would contain:  < <15 July 2001,"2001-07-15">, "2001-07-15" >.

My thought was that exP:date here could be the same as xsd:date.lex, and 
rdf:value was an identity relation, so the denotation of _:a would be just 
a lexical.  The relational extension of rdf:value would contain 
<"2001-07-15","2001-07-15">.

That's it.
