It is?  When I try to turn that into an entailment test, I seem to end up 
with either the original statement, or something that isn't covered in 
present RDF;  the nearest I can get is this:

Does this:
     _:f <dc:Title> "10" .
     <mary> <age> "10" .

entail this?:
     _:x <dc:Title> _:y .
     _:z <age> _:y .
     _:x = _:f .
     _:y = "10" .
     _:z = <mary> .

and even this uses something that is not (currently) defined in RDF, namely 
'='.  What, exactly, should we take '=' to mean?

Is this even remotely close to what you're suggesting here?
