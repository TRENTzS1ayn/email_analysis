I'm uncomfortable about withdrawing this.  Dan used a different example for 
self-entailment prior to the one he withdrew:

Does:
         <http://www.w3.org/> dc:title "W3C".
entail:
         <http://www.w3.org/> dc:title "W3C".

Intuitively, I think it is important that this is a valid entailment, and 
this hasn't been established yet for TDL.
