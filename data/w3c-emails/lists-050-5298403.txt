Well, in my case, actually finding time to read the TDL proposal 
makes me vote against it. I don't think it is coherent as it stands, 
unless I'm badly misunderstanding it. (See earlier mailing for 
details) However, I think it can be modified to be coherent, and I'll 
try to sketch that by Friday. The change isn't to the RDF idioms 
involved, but to the MT.
