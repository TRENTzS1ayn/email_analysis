I think it would be useful for the group to make explicit what
the ramifications of this are -- which should make it clear (I
hope) why I cannot live with it.

In order to use both S-A and S-B in the same knowledge base, or
syndicate knowledge using either idiom into a merged knowledge
base, we would have to have *two* variants of every metadata
vocabulary: DC, PRISM, ONIX, MARC, vCard, etc.

I.e. dcA:title and dcB:title and then relate the two together
so that queries asking for dc:title would obtain knowledge
expressed in either idiom.

Ouch. Yuck. Blech. Insert your favorite expletive here _____ ;-)

I just can't see the RDF community at large buying into such
a scenario.

And it is imperative that we support both global and local
typing for literals, so the alternative -- choose only S-A
or S-B is equally unacceptable.

No. This is not correct. We just don't seem to be connecting
on this one Brian. It is an issue of whether the query is based
on string equality or value equality -- whether datatyping is
taken into consideration. If we treat the parenthesized versions
as TDL pairings (which I think is your intent) and use that
as an indication of whether the query is string or value based
then I think the results should become clear.

Let me try to expand it to all significant cases:

--

Case 1: (value comparison, no datatyping specified)

_:f <rdf:type> <film> .
_:f <dc:Title> (_, "10") .
<mary> <age>   (_, "10").

DOES entail

_:x <dc:Title> ?y .
_:z <age>      ?y .

(though probably should flag some warnings since
 the query is expecting datatypes as that is the
 basis for value comparison)

--

Case 2: (string comparison, datatyping ignored)

_:f <rdf:type> <film> .
_:f <dc:Title> "10" .
<mary> <age>   "10".

DOES entail

_:x <dc:Title> ?y .
_:z <age>      ?y .

--

Case 3: (value comparison, datatyping defined)

_:f <rdf:type> <film> .
_:f <dc:Title> (xsd:string, "10") .
<mary> <age>   (xsd:integer, "10").

does NOT entail

_:x <dc:Title> ?y .
_:z <age>      ?y .

--

Case 4: (value comparison, datatyping partially defined)

_:f <rdf:type> <film> .
_:f <dc:Title> (_, "10") .
<mary> <age>   (xsd:integer, "10").

does NOT entail

_:x <dc:Title> ?y .
_:z <age>      ?y .

(and as with case 1 should probably flag a warning
 due to the unspecified typing)


Is that clearer now?

Cheers,

Patrick
