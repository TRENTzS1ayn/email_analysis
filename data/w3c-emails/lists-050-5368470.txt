Firstly, was it not decided that xml:lang was to be removed
or at least ignored?

Secondly, this is a matter of value qualification (or statement
qualification, depending on your particular bent)

At present, it seems the preferred way of handling this is
by using a blank node that has the literal value and
the qualifiers hanging off it. E.g.

   X ex:title _:1 .
   _:1 rdf:value "foo" .
   _:1 xml:lang "en" .

[or in RDF/XML:

   <rdf:Description rdf:ID="X">
     <ex:title xml:lang="en" rdf:value="foo"/>
   </rdf:Description>

with the datatyping presumption

   xml:lang rdfs:range xsd:lang .

or an alternative is reification

   X ex:title "foo" .

   _:s rdf:type rdf:Statement .
   _:s rdf:subject X .
   _:s rdf:predicate ex:title .
   _:s rdf:object "foo" .
   _:s xml:lang "en" .
 
So, this really isn't a datatyping issue at all. It's
a qualification/scoping issue. The literal "foo" does
not have a datatype of (xml:lang,"en") but rather that
is a property of the value (not the literal).

Right?

Cheers,

Patrick
