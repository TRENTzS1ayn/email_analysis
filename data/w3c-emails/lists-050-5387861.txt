Not at present:

  Summary: "This is a mess - it is in the syntax and not in the
  model. Should have used an RDF vocabulary for language. It should
  be removed from the syntax."

  ... 
  Currently: for discussion

Which is really, waiting for the datatypes/what is a literal?
discussion to complete.

That's OK, if you model like that, see below.  I don't think using
xml:lang as a property is widespread.

Doesn't that require schema support in order to use it?  xml:lang in
M&S doesn't need that

That attaches it to the statement, not the unicode string, see below

I don't know about prefered way; the abvoe is one way to model it but
RDF/XML in M&S gives the other way:

    <rdf:Description rdf:ID="X">
      <ex:title xml:lang="en">foo</ex:title>
    </rdf:Description>

M&S says:

  "The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to
  associate a language with the property value.  There is no specific
  data model representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to
  the data model); the language of a literal is considered by RDF to
  be a part of the literal. An application may ignore language
  tagging of a string. All RDF applications must specify whether or
  not language tagging in literals is significant; that is, whether
  or not language is considered when performing string matching or
  other processing."

so there are several get out clauses there.

This form is used in examples and M&S and also, the RDF Schema for RDFS:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327/#xmlcore

and we owe the community an answer for what these forms mean.


I think that since we use XML for the syntax, and M&S mentions
xml:lang, we must continue to support it. The in-scope xml:lang
attributes affect all inner literal element content so that I want to
know about these statements:

    <rdf:Description rdf:ID="X">
      <ex:title xml:lang="en">foo</ex:title>
      <ex:title>foo</ex:title>
    </rdf:Description>

and how you think they should be modelled?

Do literal-labelled nodes become (unicode string, optional xml:lang)
pair as the quoted paragraph above I think indicates - "part of the
literal"?
