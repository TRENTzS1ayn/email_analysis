I stand corrected. Though I still don't see this as a datatyping
issue. A literal value with xml:lang qualification is not a
"kind of" xml:lang. The xml:lang attribute does not assign a
type to the literal.

What else could it be?

Only if you want the datatyping to be explicit in the
RDF graph rather than left to the application layer.
I.e., I was presuming a datatyping interpretation of
xml:lang to be xsd:lang, not requiring the range
constraint to be made explicitly.

Nothing attaches to the unicode string. Literals do
not act as subjects.

You must use some form of idiom to infer properties of
literals (or rather of the values they denote).

It is not the literal that is "English" but rather the
value denoted by the literal.

After all, what does "pan" mean. Is it English? Spanish?
The literal itself means nothing. It's just a sequence of
characters. You must have context to determine meaning.
The xml:lang property provides context for the interpretation
of natural language strings.
 
This problem is disjunct from the problem of interpretation
of lexical forms per datatype.

Sorry, I meant a preferred way to express value or statement
qualification, not for using xml:lang. Apologies for being
unclear.

In principle, I agree, though it is a difficult issue. We would want
support of xml:lang, as with e.g. XML Schema datatypes, to be provided,
but by generic mechanisms and not with special interpretation in
either the syntax or model.

I would treat this as two statements where the first is qualified
for language but the second is not. Whether a given application
wishes to consider these statements synonymous in a give context
is undefined.

I hope not.
