No. In the TDL *MT* a literal is a pair. In TDL, the actual
model, a literal is a literal -- a string that may be interpreted
as a lexical form of some datatype, in the context of that
datatype.

Please let's keep this straight. If there's a problem with
the MT for TDL, fine, but that doesn't equate to a problem
with TDL (though I appreciate that the mathematicians may
only want to look at the MT and ignore what the MT is supposed
to be capturing).

Cheers,

Patrick
