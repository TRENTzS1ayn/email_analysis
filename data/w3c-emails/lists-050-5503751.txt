Right. Insofar as RDF/XML or ntriples is concerned, you don't have
to write TDL pairs. The pairs are inferable from local or global typing,
and are the basis for interpretation, but are not part of the
graph syntax itself (even if components of the graph syntax are
used, per specific idioms, to define those pairings).

Or did I just muddle up any clarification I may have earlier provided? ;-)
