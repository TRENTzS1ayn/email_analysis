Excellent summary, Jeremy.

Theoretically, perhaps, but not practically.

This is not acceptable, unfortunately, as that does not
provide us with any means for global typing and precludes
the use of schema implied typing. It also prevents any
means of asserting system typing on locally typed
knowledge, which needs both local and global types
asserted.

S-A alone cannot provide a complete solution. It would
be great if it could, but it can't. We need both local
and global typing.

Is this a bad thing? I thought this was a strength ;-)
