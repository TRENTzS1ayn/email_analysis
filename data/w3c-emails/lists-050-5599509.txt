Hi Jeremy, many thanks for all the explanations. I now see where 
y'all are coming from, as it were. You are right that the old P++ did 
not handle the overlapping-value-spaces issue properly. I am 
struggling with a way to do it that doesn't have Bob's age be a pair.

I'll get back on this asap.

PS. I like string-type pairs a lot better than literal-value pairs. 
At any rate, sets of literal-value pairs ought to be property 
extensions.
PPS. re. yr reply to Q6: yes I was responding while going through, Im 
in too much of hurry to read things twice right now :-) But 
seriously, my point was that a set of pairs *is* a property extension 
in the MT, so it seemed kind of odd  to make it into a class. I see 
that this preserves some deployed idioms, but it seems like a lot to 
bite off in order to achieve that.
