This is a side remark for those who like/need untidiness on literals for
certain purposes.

In a tidy graph model, untidiness can be modeled using bNodes.

For example, an untidy graph

_:a --dc:Title--> "Big Bang"
_:b --my:book---> "Big Bang"

can be represented e.g. as a tidy graph

_:a --dc:Title--> _:1 --rdf:value--> "Big Bang"
                                       ^
                                       |
_:b --my:book---> _:2 --rdf:value------+

Sticking with the tidy graph model does not limit expressivity, but has
the benefit of being in widespread use, simpler, and more compact (when
untidiness is not required).
