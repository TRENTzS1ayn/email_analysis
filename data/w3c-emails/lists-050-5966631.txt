At the telecon on Friday this was the preferred option, or rather using a
special prefix.

e.g.

http://myuri


maps to

http://www.w3.org/reserved/http://myuri

There was discussion that this does not involve a central registry because the
whole of URI space can be embedded under http://www.w3.org/reserved/ (I made
comments about Hilbert's hotel).

Other made comments which I may describe as Hilbert's web-server.

We put a smart on the W3C webserver such that

http://www.w3.org/reserved/SOME-URI

has a redirect to SOME-URI.

This would then give an operational semantics to embedding the whole of the
light web within the dark web.

I wished to point out a bug with this redirect.

Consider an RDF resource like
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label

and its dark variant

http://www.w3.org/reserved/http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label


getting either of these documents and applying the usual rules will result in
getting

<rdf:Property ID="label">
 <rdf:type resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
 <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">label</rdfs:label>
 <rdfs:label xml:lang="fr">label</rdfs:label>
 <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Resource"/>
 <rdfs:comment>Provides a human-readable version of a resource
name.</rdfs:comment>
 <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Literal"/>
</rdf:Property>

as the definition of either resource.
In the first case (the light case, intended by the document author), the base is
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema

In the second case (the dark case, not intended by the author) the base is
http://www.w3.org/reserved/http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema

The problem is that the author has unwittingly created dark properties as well
as light properties.


This problem does not happen if:
- we always use N-triple and not RDF/XML
- we always use xml:base
- we always use rdf:about and not rdf:ID in schemas


Since any of these is a major change I am less than convinced by Hilbert's web
server.
