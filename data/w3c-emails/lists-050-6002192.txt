I agree.

Thus, I stand (or actually sit ;-) corrected about test A being
irrelevant. It is not irrelevant, but joins with B and C such
that a yes answer is a vote for tidyness.

Which makes me wonder whether the inquiry is now a tad bit
imbalanced...  'yes' to (A and B and C) or D ... hmmmmm....

Anyway, just send it and let's see what we get.

I retract my earlier objection.
