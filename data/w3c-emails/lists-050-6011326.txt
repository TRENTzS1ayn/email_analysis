My take is that global datatyping and containers of literals simply do not
interoperate.
Containers with literal values either are untyped or locally typed.

I don't believe that any of the proposed global datatyping solutions (ever) work
with containers.

Hence I think:

+ test case A is a choice (the group seems minded to say that the entailment
holds - I disagree but not strongly).

+ containers cannot contain globally typed literals (i.e. the literals are
either self-denoting or untyped)

+ if test case A is true then rdf:object takes untyped literals as its object
(Brian also mentioned the rdf:object problem in the telecon).
