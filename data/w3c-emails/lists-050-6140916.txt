Brian,

I'll respond briefly here, to acknowledge your comments for the 
record.  I'll leave detailed consideration of the points you raised to my 
action from the last telecon.

I did not think that the document that Jeremy and I have produced was so 
much in excess of what was agreed at the face to face, but our discussion 
then did not go into much detail and I can see how one might reasonably 
come to such a view.

To reiterate what I said in the last telecon, much of the material that you 
feel is more than is needed derives from my experiences of trying to come 
to terms with RDF as part of the CC/PP work.  At that time, lacking any 
background information, it was very difficult to understand why we were 
using RDF, and what it would do for us.  Thus, some of the information in 
this document was an attempt to add in some of those elements that I would 
regard as being an important part of making the specification usable for 
developers and information designers.

Looking forward, I hope that having something concrete on the table will 
make it easier for us to determine exactly what this group does expect to 
see, by stimulating comments like yours.  I'll return to this theme in 
another message.
