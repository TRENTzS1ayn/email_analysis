I was about to send out the datatypes message to rdf interest, but I'm 
concerned that we have new information that means I need to change it.

Have we agreed that test A does not hold for untidy literals?  Patrick has, 
and I think Jeremy has.  If so then I need to modify (simplify) the message 
- tests B and C can be dropped.

The reasons we might decide that test A does not hold are:

   o it requires a special case in the reification machinery
   o it requires a special case in the container machinery
   o it interacts badly with rdfs:subPropertyOf

I need some feedback from the WG on this.
