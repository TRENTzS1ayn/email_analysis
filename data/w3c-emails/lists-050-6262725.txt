Yup, but its beginning to give me the heebee jeebees.

Right.  The logic survives, as best I can understand it, but is this the 
behaviour we want to specify?  Would someone ever want to build a language 
on top of RDFS which had some notion of a TOP property.  If they did, what 
would the implications for datatypes be?

Are we willing to accept the constraint that all subProperties of a 
property must have the same datatype constraint?  Or is there some magic in 
the model theory that can allow them not to?

I need to find time to sit and think about this.
