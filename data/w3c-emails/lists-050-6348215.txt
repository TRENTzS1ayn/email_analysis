Fair point.  That suggests to me an introductory paragraph (in my section 
6.3) that is more explicit about browsing behaviour and RDF denotation.

Off the cuff ...
[[
In the following discussion, a URI means an absolute URI without a fragment 
identifier, and a URI reference means a URI with an optional fragment 
identifier.

In the Web, URI references have most commonly been used for creating 
hyperlinks in a global information space.  In this use, the URI part of a 
URI reference is taken to address a resource for which one or more 
representations can be retrieved, using retrieval mechanisms that are 
well-known to the browsing software (most commonly, the HTTP 
protocol).  Normal web browsing depends on this ability to retrieve 
resource representations.  This is what is meant below by "normal web use".
[[[Consider change of terminology to "normal web browsing"?]]]

URI references can also be used as resource identifiers, in applications 
whose normal operation does not depend on retrieval of a resource 
representation.  XML namespaces and RDF are two such applications.  The 
following discussion addresses the clearly desirable goal that URI 
references used in RDF should be interpreted in a fashion that is 
compatible with normal web browsing.

In particular, normal web browsing uses fragment identifiers in a way that 
depends on the MIME content-type of a retrieved resource representation 
[[[references]]].  RDF, on the other hand, treats a URI reference as an 
opaque identifier that denotes some specific value, without requiring that 
the URI part be dereferencable.
]]

Does that touch the right points?  I feel it is too long, but I can 
wordsmith down when I better understood what needs to be said.

I'm not sure what is "our current understanding" here ... that's one of the 
reasons I felt the section 6.3 material needed drafting, particularly since 
it represents a relatively recent understanding on my part.

OK ... I'll think about that (see above).  Thanks for the feedback.
