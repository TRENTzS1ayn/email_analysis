Graham--

I think your added material is helpful.  However, I'll indicate below 
where I think some more discussion (rather than less) is needed.

Here's where I think some additional discussion is necessary (I suppose 
it could go in the Primer).  In my original response to you, I cited the 
way you yourself had used fragment identifiers to identify specific 
subsections of the documents you were citing, which I think is 
more-or-less consistent with the intuition people have about the way RDF 
  intends to use fragments.  Now, above, you say "normal web browsing 
uses fragment identifiers in a way that depends on the MIME content-type 
of a retrieved resource representation".  This may be the case in some 
sense of "normal", but I doubt if it appears that way to most web users 
(who are mostly retrieving html and text documents).  It would help to 
cite an example in "normal" circumstances in which fragment identifiers 
*don't* eppear to have the effects they have when used with html.  In 
other words, I think we ought to talk in terms of "normal" behavior as 
defining what most people see most of the time;  other behavior may be 
consistent with the specs, but if it's rarely seen, it doesn't become 
"normal" by calling it so.  What we're really trying to say is something 
like "in most usually-seen cases, retrieval behavior involving fragment 
identifiers seems to be sort of consistent with the way RDF wants to use 
fragment identifiers, but in fact the specs allow the retrieval behavior 
to be arbitrarily-different, depending on the MIME type of the resource 
representation.  Because of this (and because, according to the specs, 
servers don't need to know anything about URL fragments, because that 
behavior is dealt with somewhere else), there are potential problems..."

You're welcome.
