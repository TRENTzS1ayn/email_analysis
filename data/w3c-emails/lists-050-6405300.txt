?? I fail to follow your reasoning here. It seems circular.

There are two cases to consider, right? We can have (semantically) 
tidy literals, where each literal node labelled with the same literal 
denotes the same thing; or we can not. Call these the ST and NST 
cases. Test A is 'yes' for ST, 'no' for NST. Now consider your 
container example. In an ST reading, b1 and b2 have the same first 
element; in an NST reading, they need not. Put another way: if all 
literals are tidy, then all literals in containers must be tidy. 
Well, right. And if all literals are not tidy, the ones in container 
need not be either. So... what has been demonstrated, exactly?

I fail to see why.
