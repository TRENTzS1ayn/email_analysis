Following on from my reply

But Brian is in the context of the f2f suggestion that the denotation of
literals depends on the property and the literal, not just the literal.

Ahh, this links up better with the f2f.

This entailment holds for literals, and the corresponding entailment holds for
urirefs.

So if the object is a uriref or bNode we enatil:

  <s> <p> _:o .
 _:s rdf:object _:o .

but if the object is a literal then we don't.
