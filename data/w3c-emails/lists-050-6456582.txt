True, but in the f2f proposal it was suggested that they would because the 
denotation is a function of the literal and the property, i.e.

>>   <s1> <p> "lit" .
>>   <s2> <p> "lit" .

|=
   <s1> <p> _:l .
   <s2> <p> _:l .

Sure.

Ok, given:

   <a> rdf:_1 "10" .

what does the "10" denote?  What is in the container?
