At the f2f a number of issues of consistency between the various docs were 
mentioned and I was asked to propose guidelines.  Unfortunately, the actual 
issues were not recorded in the irc log.  The only one I remember is the 
notation for representing triples in documents.  If you know of any others, 
please let me know.
