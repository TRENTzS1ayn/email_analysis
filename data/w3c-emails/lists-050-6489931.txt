It has been suggested that we adopt a common notation across all the specs 
for representing triples.

I suggest we use legal n-triples with the addition that a URI can be 
represented as a qname without angle brackets, e.g.

   _:a rdf:type rdfs:Class .

The notation should be explained in the primer which should include a list 
of standard prefixes.  The other documents should reference the description 
in the primer.
