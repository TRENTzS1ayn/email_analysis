Gee, that looks familiar. 1/2 ;-)

i.e. yes, I support this guideline.

As input to the RDF primer, I'll note that lots of people have
learned N3 syntax from the N3 primer alone, without further
assistance. You may find some text there that you can use...
the section that covers the qname shorthand for URIs is

I tried to find a particular paragraph or two that you could
steal, but the explanation of the qname shorthand is
kinda context-sensitive.
