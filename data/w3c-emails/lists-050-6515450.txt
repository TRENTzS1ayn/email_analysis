My first reaction was, what's the problem?? Technically this is all 
consistent. But thinking about it more, I see that there is something 
odd about this. One would reason as follows: the *reason* why 
dc:property holds for both literals is different in the two cases, so 
even though its the same property, the literals aren't being treated 
the same (assuming that the literals 'mean' the same thing in the 
superproperty triples as they did in the corresponding subproperty 
triples), so the common-b-node inference is no more justified in the 
superproperty case than it was in the subproperty. Hmmm, yes, good 
point.

Well, after the F2F discussion and subsequently, I think that this 
compromise idea (with literals being syntactically tidy but 
semantically untidy) isn't really worth the trouble it causes. If 
literals are going to be semantically untidy then lets have them be 
syntactically untidy as well, since that keeps everything coherent. I 
think we should stop trying to be clever, and just decide one way or 
the other: either literals just are string-ish things which denote 
themselves, or they are genuine names which can denote anything, 
depending on the datatyping applied to them; and in the latter case, 
then really should not be syntactically tidy, since different 
datatyping contexts have to be allowed to attach to distinct literal 
nodes. I myself would prefer the latter, and also to allow literals 
to be in the subject position, but I gather that this isn't 
acceptable; so I would vote that we stick to the other simple option 
and reject implication A.
