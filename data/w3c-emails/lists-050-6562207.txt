To: RDF Core<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>


I have sent, at last, the datatypes message to rdf interest and rdf logic 
and await the explosion.

I have modified it from the draft approved by the WG in the light of recent 
discussion.  I trust the WG will approve of the modification.

At the f2f and elsewhere, concern has been raised the we might simply 
repeat the discussion, in all its confusion and volume, that we have had in 
RDFCore, in a wider forum.  It would be a disaster if that were to happen.

I am not sure what other WG's have done in the past, and would welcome 
guidance from those who have been here before.

However, I strongly suggest that members of the WG refrain from any form of 
advocacy for their preferred position on the other lists.  We are seeking 
input from the community on this issue, not a debate.

I recognise that what is advocacy and what is helpful explanation is a 
difficult line to draw.  I am loathe to suggest gagging people, but I also 
suggest that folks leave it to me to answer for the WG on any questions or 
issues that arise on the other lists.  If anyone is dissatisfied with 
anything I say, then raise that with me first and we will correct it.

Brian
