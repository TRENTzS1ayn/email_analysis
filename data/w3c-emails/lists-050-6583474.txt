I'm happy with that.

I would further recommend that replies from the WG include a very
strong aversion to address questions about "Why not option X" and
simply focus on answering questions that enable folks to decide
between A and D and take the replies as they come.

I.e., those replies that attempt to debate issues other than the
explicit choice between A or D are simply ignored -- in the interest of
avoiding long discussion threads -- and folks should be made aware
that if they can't choose between A or D, then their input in this
matter is out of scope, for the time being.

Of course, folks will be able to raise other issues about datatyping
once the first WD is published.

Cheers,

Patrick
