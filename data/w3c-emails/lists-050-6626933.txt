I've been feeling the time pressure.

Hmm,

[[

constraints on the properties.
]]

wasn't enough.  I'm happy to send an amendment, but I'm worried about the 
form you suggest, as in the tidy case its a contradiction.  I think we need 
to use drange, which could open another can of worms.

I could send:

[[

I perhaps did not emphasize this point enough.  Where the appropriate range 
constraints are present, all solutions produce the "expected" answer, e.g.

>    <Jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .
>    <John>       <ageInYears> "10" .
>    <ageInYears> rdfd:drange  xsd:decimal .

an RDF processor could conclude that Jenny and John have the same age.

Note however, that there may be issues handling very general properties, 
such as the container membership properties and rdf:object where it isn't 
really feasible to use a range contraint.
