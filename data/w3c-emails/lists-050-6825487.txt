Yes, or more simply

<rdf:Description >
   <ex:prop3 >
    <ex:prop1 rdf:node="_:b" />
    <ex:prop2 rdf:node="_:b" />
   </ex:prop3>
</rdf:Description>

since the _:b one is the only one that is difficult.

I'm agnostic about whether we should do this, but if we do the approach
seems mostly OK to me.  I think it's better than the _:x form of 'URI'
because this provides a very clear syntactic marker in the XML.

To test my understanding:

   _:a ex:prop1 _:b .
   _:a ex:prop2 _:b .
   _:c ex:prop3 _:a .

could then be:

<rdf:Description rdf:node="_:a">
   <ex:prop1 rdf:node="_:b" />
   <ex:prop2 rdf:node="_:b" />
</rdf:Description>
<rdf:Description rdf:node="_:c">
   <ex:prop3 rdf:node="_:a" />
</rdf:Description>

?

Two comments:

(1) I think we'd need to be careful about what constitutes "file scope" --
not all RDF is contained in files.  I think we could specify a document
scope for web resources (a complete representation that you get when
dereferencing a URI), which covers files via the file: uri scheme, then
note that applications that obtain RDF in different ways must specify the
scope of any node identifiers used.  (e.g. CC/PP protocol.)

(2) I think we'd need to say something about combining graphs with these
node identifiers;  i.e. that renaming must be performed.

(3) Say explicitly that within a scope, any node identifier can be changed
throughout to any other identifier not used in that scope without changing
the semantics.

I think this way is safer.

I think I prefer your way (being explicit about the scope), it makes it
clearer that node identifiers are different than URIs.

Eitherv way works for me.

Two identifiers might be more obvious, with a clearer relationship to
existing label attribute roles.

We could discuss this endlessly.  I think short names are good, but not
essential.
