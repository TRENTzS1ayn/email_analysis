I was reading the latest WD draft, ie not yet a WD (Member private)

  Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CC/PP): Structure and Vocabularies
  http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/Group/Drafts/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20020716/

after some comments I made on earlier WDs.

I guess I can't quote the contents of this member private document on
the public RDF Core WG list, but look at the section

  2.2 Extensibility and namespaces
  http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/Group/Drafts/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20020716/#ExtensibilityNamespaces

which explains how CC/PP (and RDF?) see XML Namespaces, Schemas and
Schema documents relating.  Might be useful to consider.
