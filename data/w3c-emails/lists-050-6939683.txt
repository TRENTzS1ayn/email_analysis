I've been unable to find the time earlier this week to review all the
SOAP WDs properly apart from (mostly typos) in Part 0 Primer which
I'll send myself.

My main note is the use of XML qnames, the (namespace name, local
name) pair for identifiers which is biggest disconnect and doesn't
seem particular webby to me - URIs are the web's identifiers.

The TAG has been discussing this:

  (DRAFT) TAG Finding: Using Qualified Names (QNames) as Identifiers in Content
  http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/qnameids.html

but offers mostly observations.

SOAP seems to use qnames, uris and strings in attribute values,
element content as identifiers and it isn't clear to me when these
are best picked, at least coming to it fairly cold.  

With respect to Part 2, Adjuncts - Graham's analysis in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0073.html

seemed fair but it looks like formulating a WG response is unlikely
given the timescale and since from Graham's analysis, it doesn't look
so useful for shipping RDF.

I may have an attempt to review part 2 myself rather than for this
WG, by tomorrow's deadline.

Dave
