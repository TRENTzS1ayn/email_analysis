OK, imagine you're putting up a website based around the notion of 
software descriptions. In this example, Ruby software packages.

If you go the SOAP, Web Services route, you'll maybe serialize software 
descriptions using SOAP Encoding rules. If you go the RDF route, you'll
define RDF classes and properties, and use RDF's serialization.

So you'll end up with one problem diverging into two different XML 
representations.

Here's all my work in progress (re SOAP 1.1), including example files
in SOAP and RDF formats, generated with Max Froumentin's partial 
SOAP2RDF XSLT:

(this is on my own development box; W3C CVS choked on the huge checkin 
and I've not figured out another way to host the files at w3c yet).
e

contrast:

http://fireball.danbri.org/people/danbri/2002/05/raa/_rdf/ActiveScriptRuby_se.xml.rdf

rummage around there for the .xslt and scripts to load the transformed 
SOAP data into an SQL store and query it with RDF query tools...

more partial writeup:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/soaptech/ (including incomplete 
attempt to show an SE-Triples version of N-Triples for SOAP QA).


Can you expand on your 'natural fit' comment? If you were building the 
software description system described (people are, right now) would you 
use SOAP Encoding or RDF syntax? Wouldn't you expect it to be natural to 
have a defined mapping between these two W3C specs?
