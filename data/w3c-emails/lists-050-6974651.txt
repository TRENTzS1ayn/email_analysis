In order: I'm guilty of the "bad smell" sin here; basically my concerns
are that you're fitting something into what still seems (to me) to be a
purely syntactic framework. The existence of a well-defined, sanctioned
mapping would at least say, "here are some RDF-style MT semantics for
the subset of soap graphs that we map RDF onto".

The "no literals at the blunt end" thing might bite us if we "fix" that.

And the answer to the most important question (your last one) is an
emphatic yes.
