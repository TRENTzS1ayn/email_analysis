Err, well, err.. yes.

We got to the point in our analysis where it seemed like it came down to a 
choice of which functionality was more important, the entailment you 
suggested or the Cannes entailment.

My understanding is that we decided to ask the community which of these 
they thought was more important.  This we are doing.  After one of the two 
weeks allowed for feedback have elapsed, there indications are that the 
segment of the community which is responding is favoring untidy.
