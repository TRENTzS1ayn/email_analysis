preface: I remain opposed to re-opening this issue,
on the grounds that we've slipped considerably
since our "last call in May" target, and this
represents more stuff between us and last call.

Has the issue been reopened? evidently so, from
12: Representing B-nodes in the graph syntax
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0081.html

OK, having crossed that bridge...
as an implementor, I find this appealing;
it addresses a known problem with the SWAP tools...

Currently, the SWAP tools, when given...

  _:a <#prop> _:a.

write the following, which is clearly horked:

<rdf:RDF xmlns="file:/dev/stdin#"
    xmlns:log="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#"
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#0_work">
        <log:forSome rdf:resource="#_ga"/>
    </rdf:Description>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="#_ga">
        <prop rdf:resource="#_ga"/>
    </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

[using log:forSome as a property is nonmonotonic,
even after you squint really hard to see how
cwm uses it.]

I gather that if we adopt this, it would/could write:

<rdf:RDF xmlns="file:/dev/stdin#"
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">

    <rdf:Description rdf:node="ga">
        <prop rdf:resource="ga"/>
    </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>


which would communicate, in an interoperable manner,
just what the original form meant.


I'd feel better about it if I found time to implement
it, but I'm reasonably confident it's sound.

Some details:

XML IDs would be easier for me to support.

We're still debating whether to reopen it? Seems to
me that in assigning you this action, the group decided
to re-open it. Maybe not. Who cares...

I don't like the name. I don't know why.

thinking out loud...

  rdf:term
nah... that's meta-syntax
  rdf:something
too long, goofy
  rdf:some
hmm... maybe I like that...

<rdf:Description rdf:about="some/doc">
  <dc:creator rdf:some="party"/>
  <dc:publisher rdf:some="party"/>
</rdf:Description>

hmm... kinda sounds like rdf:type...


OK, rdf:node is as good as anything I can come up with.

yeah verily.

yeah.

no opinion.

see above.
