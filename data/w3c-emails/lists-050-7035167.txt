Yes.  Jeremy was bashful so we renamed it.

If I interpret that properly, then you need two properties, say <age> and 
<ageL>.  My understanding is that WG agrees that this works, but that 
having two properties is unacceptable.  If we agreed that two properties 
was acceptable, then I think all this would just go away.  The argument is 
that there will be lots of user error and confusion resulting from having 
to distinguish between the two cases.
