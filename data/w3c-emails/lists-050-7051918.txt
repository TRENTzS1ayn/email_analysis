Well the users better get used to it because they already need to 
distinguish between author and authorName and site and siteURI. I think 
allowing them to use the same property in this special case will only 
add more confusion, not less. Furthermore, as I just pointed out, the 
two-property method is easier to use in forward-chaining systems like 
CWM and clones.

Who objects to the two properties? Just PatrickS?
