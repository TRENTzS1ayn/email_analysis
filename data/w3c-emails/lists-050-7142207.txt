Thanks for keeping that one from falling between the cracks.


Here's a sketch; it's a parser test.

.rdf input:

<rdf:Description>
  <ex:brothers rdf:parseType="daml:collection">
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example/#Fred"/>
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example/#Bob"/>
  </ex:brothers>
        </rdf:Description>

and the .nt has just one triple:

  _:something ex:brothers xml"<rdf:Description ...".

Sorry, I haven't managed to implement parseType="Literal",
so I can't easily come up with the details.

Anybody out there got a parser that does xml"" stuff? DaveB?
Would you please fill in the blanks for me?
