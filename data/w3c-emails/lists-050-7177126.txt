Quite allright; but it's news to me that rdfms-assertion
is resolved. I looked pretty hard for a record of
a decision to resolve it, and I couldn't find one.

Brian's clearly got plenty to do; can anybody *else*
help me find a record of a decision to close
rdfms-assertion?

There's not a lot of urgency, but if somebody
has it handy...
