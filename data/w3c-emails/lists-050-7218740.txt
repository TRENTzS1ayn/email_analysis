 From http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020617-f2f/

I think it's covered by this decision:
[[
log The WG decided to consider producing a new document to describe the RDF 
graph, possibly called "Resource Description Framework". This will include 
description of the graph synax, what it means to assert, character 
normalization and possibly some other material from the primer. Graham and 
Jeremy to be editors.
]]
in the sense that it's become a document issue.

There was some discussion at the f2f of the assertion issue against a 
background of social aspects of RDF deployment (in discussions in/after the 
telecon prior to the F2F, the omission of any discussion of the social 
environment of RDF deployment had been noted).  Section 2.3 of the new RDF 
document [1] resulted from this.  Assertion is covered at sub-section 2.3.4 
[2] (and still needs review/discussion).
