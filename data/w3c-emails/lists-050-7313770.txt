The syntax doc does have sections for introducing the syntax which is
*not* related to parsing.  It takes a graph and explains how the
RDF/XML for it is built, and will cover more of the detail of the XML
syntax.  That isn't for parser writers but for explaining how the XML
syntax works, and all the little corners.

Furthermore, the later section from turning a graph to RDF/XML, also
sometimes called serialising the graph, is also not for parser writers.

That says both too little and too much.

It doesn't explain what an RDF parser is, or what an RDF writer is.
Neither of those is mentioned in the syntax doc either - we only talk
about the graph and the rdf/xml document[infoset].   This sounds like 
RDF processing which we have avoided doing.

What are QName forms?  I prefer 'XML qnames" [citing reference in XML].

The subject of the section is "Forming a URI reference from a Qname"
but the words doesn't explain how this is done, so why is it here?
Either you should add this detail, and remove it from the syntax
document, or remove this section.

I think such XML syntax issues (graph to/from RDF/XML), and XML
qnames are best handled where the rest of the XML issues are
explained, in the RDF/XML syntax document.  These can then be linked
to the syntax grammar, examples and the appropriate test cases.
