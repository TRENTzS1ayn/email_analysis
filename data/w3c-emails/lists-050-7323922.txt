What you say is, of course, quite true.  But it remains my perception that 
this document is overwhelmingly concerned with detailing the minutiae of 
mapping between XML syntax and the abstract graph syntax.

As you say, it explains how the syntax works, including all the little 
corners.  Yes, there is other information here, but that's not clear from 
cursory glance at the document.  For example, I just went to the online 
copy of this document to try and work out where the QName to URI 
correspondence was described, and it took me about 5 minutes to find 
it.  The table of contents didn't help me on this point, and if I didn't 
know if was here somewhere I might have failed to find it.

OK - that can be easily fixed.

OK - that can be easily fixed.

You use the term "should" here without explaining your criteria, so I 
cannot really agree or disagree with what you say.

I'm coming to this with the view that we should be making it as easy as 
possible for developers (programmers, software designers and information 
designers) to find the information they need.  I think that a key reason 
for RDF not being especially successful to date, and I do find a continuing 
reason for resistance to adopting RDF rather than roll-your-own XML, is 
that smart people just don't get it.  If we want RDF to really succeed, 
part of our job is to make it easy for people to get it when they look at 
the specs.  The kind of audience I'm thinking of here are experienced 
system architects who will make key decisions about system design choices, 
without necessarily delving into all the details of the specifications.  I 
say all this to explain the kind of criteria I am applying, and why in my 
opinion it is important to call out certain key features of RDF.

In this case, I think the relationship between XML Qnames and URIs is such 
an important feature.  The relationship is described in the syntax 
document, but I found it was not easy to find.  So I feel it is appropriate 
to call out the issue and provide a precise reference to where the detail 
is defined.  Maybe there are other ways of achieving this goal - for 
example, I'd say a heading in the syntax document table of contents 
containing the word Qname might do it.

Well, in a sense I agree with you, which is why I didn't try and duplicate 
the material.

But... (see above).
