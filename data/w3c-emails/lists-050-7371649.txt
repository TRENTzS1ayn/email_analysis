Yes, they do.  But taking this constructively, I can change or add
headings so you can find the things you were looking for.  How
RDF/XML uses XML Qnames can be made more prominent and if necessary,
more words can be added.

If you have XML syntax things that need calling out, we should fix
the XML syntax draft - let me and/or the group know any others.  I've
already got your comments from an earlier draft on the notations used
queued up for action for the next draft, but the above wasn't
mentioned then if I recall correctly.

Cheers

Dave
