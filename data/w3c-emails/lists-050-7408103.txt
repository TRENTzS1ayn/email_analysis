Indeed.  I reviewed the document then on the basis of the scope thus 
presented:  i.e. the details of correspondence between XML and RDF graph form.

When I prepared the "overview" document, I was taking a broader view.  If 
it turns out that this reveals some additional desirable clarifications for 
the syntax document, then that is fine by me.

I think the lesson here, and this is *not* a criticism of the syntax 
document, or any other specific document, is that in our focus on specific 
aspects of the RDF specification (syntax, semantics, etc., etc.) we may 
have lost sight of the broader view.  It is my opinion that to disregard 
the broader view is a disservice to our intended audience.  If a broader 
view can be addressed by enhancements to existing documents, then I think 
that is perfectly fine.  In proposing that there are broader points that 
might usefully be clarified, I don't think it's fair to treat my comments 
as criticisms of existing documents that seem to fully satisfy their 
apparent aims.

I believe I have been consistently receptive to the idea that material 
posted in the "overview" draft might find its eventual home in some other 
document.
