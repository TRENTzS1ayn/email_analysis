7) rdf:ID / rdf:node proposal

[[
The chair was keen that we avoid too much discussion. I would like to
highlight the choicepoints.
]] --
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0080.html

I'm keen on this as well - review choicepoints and be prepared to
discuss.

a follow-up useful for establishing my view as well

[[
This chairs position was to not reopen the issue at this time, but to 
indicate that if a slam dunk proposal was submitted to the WG, then I
would not be opposed, provided it did not delay us.
]] -

8) New Document 

A new draft of 'Resource Description Framework (RDF): Overview and
Abstract Data Model' is available at:

http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-basics/2002-07-25/Overview.html

Graham to do quick intro; Graham if you have specific issues that need
to be addressed by individuals/editors, please be prepared to discuss
this as well.

Graham, in particular see next agenda item.

9) rdfns-assertion

See:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-assertion

I'm frankly confused if this issue is open or not, but I think this
issue is addressed in Graham's document but still needs review -

[[
There was some discussion at the f2f of the assertion issue against a 
background of social aspects of RDF deployment (in discussions in/after
the  telecon prior to the F2F, the omission of any discussion of the
social environment of RDF deployment had been noted).  Section 2.3 of
the new RDF document resulted from this.  Assertion is covered at
sub-section 2.3.4  (and still needs review/discussion).

If I am wrong I'm happy simply to have this noted and skip over this :)
