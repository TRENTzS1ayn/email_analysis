There's a new version of the Primer at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20020725.html

Given our new scheduling arrangements I don't necessarily expect to see
this republished (there are still some big holes, and I'll continue to 
work on additional stuff as noted in the comments).

There's a (new) "Changes" appendix that summarizes the major changes. 
The main item of immediate general interest is probably the introduction 
of the shorthand triples notation I was commissioned to do, in section 
2.3, since other documents are supposed to use this notation.

 
However, if anyone has spare cycles I'd appreciate comments on the new material on

URIs and fragments in section 2.1, QNames in 2.2, the new blank node 
example in 2.4, the rewrite of section 3, the rewrite of schemas (now 
section 5), the new section 4 (and its organization),......(there are 
changes all over the place).

I'm hoping to get a new subsection on medical applications written for 
section 6 too.
