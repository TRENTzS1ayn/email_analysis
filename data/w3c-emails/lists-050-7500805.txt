Thanks for the warning!  This message constitutes my prepared input, to 
which I'll talk in the telecon.  Hopefully, a URI of the message can go 
into the IRC log/minutes.

These are the notes I'll use for that purpose:

- 25 July version of the document has had two main sections removed, per 
telecon 2002-07-12, and now contains three substantive sections:
   2. Goals, rationale, key features
   3. Definition of RDF graph syntax
   4. Other technical issues

- Feedback received already from Dave Beckett, much of which is in the 
process of being folded in (but not in the version noted above).

- The main points as yet incomplete or needing review:
   - section 2.2.5, datatypes (pending outcome of datatype discussion)
   - Section 2.3, needs review:  this is new text and new topic material 
since F2F
   - Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2:  Dave Beckett has asked these be removed in 
favour of
     a reference to the syntax document.  I agree, but currently see no 
corresponding
     list in the syntax document.
   - Section 3:  need to liaise with PatH to ensure description is 
consistent with MT usage
     (JJC will pursue this)
   - Section 3:  some test cases cited are still subject to group agreement
   - Section 3:  various comments from DaveB, JJC is reviewing these
   - Section 4.2:  needs review:  this discussion of fragment identifiers 
is new
     material compared with what has been discussed before;  it is a 
synthesis of
     my own thoughts and comments by PatH and TimBL (though any errors are,
     of course, all mine).
   - Section 4.2 also laps at the edges of a current TAG discussion,
     and we'll want to make sure it's not inconsistent
       http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#httpRange-14
       http://www.w3.org/2002/07/15-tag-summary#L3330
       http://www.w3.org/2002/07/22-tag-summary.html#L3974
     and in particular the document text:
[[
In view of this, it is reasonable to consider that URIs without fragment 
identifiers are most helpfully used for indicating web-retrievable 
resources (when used in RDF), and URIs with fragment identifiers are used 
for abstract ideas that don't have a direct web representation. This is not 
a hard-and-fast distinction, as the line between resources having or not 
having a web-retrievable representation is sometimes hard to draw 
precisely.
]]
