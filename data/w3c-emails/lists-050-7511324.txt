About section 3 and some of the references ...

Correct this is not intended to normatively depend on WXS but to be 
compatible with, I will check the text.

Yes this bit needs a bit of polishing.

I'll consider.

That's precise.

I didn't want to make heavy weather out of this; really only interesting 
for mathematicians.

I think we are planning to drop this list all together if the WG is 
minded to say that this URIrefs are legal but cannot be serialized.

In which case that point should be made in the serialization section of 
the syntax doc.

We are certainly normative on xc14n (xml literal resolution).

I'll consider the charmod status, you might be right.
