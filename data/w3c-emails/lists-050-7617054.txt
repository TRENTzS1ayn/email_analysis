> ACTION jos Review new document, particularly section 2.3.

1/ what I've been missing are
     rdf:List
     rdf:first
     rdf:rest
     rdf:nil
   (resulting from rdf:parseType="Collection")
   and all WD's should be upgraded for that

2/ 2.3 Meaning of RDF documents
   I can't do better than Pat's comments made some time ago
   [[[
      Would you agree that 'received meaning' can be
      characterized as the social meaning of any logical
      consequences? That gives a clean characterization
      which I think is what Tim is getting at. If you
      publish a graph G and G entails G', and we interpret
      G' using the same social conventions that everyone
      agrees could be reasonably used to interpret G, then
      you are asserting that content of G' as well.
      Tim wants to prevent human publishers of RDF content
      from wriggling out of their mechanically-inferred
      social obligations; I want to be clear that the
      machines doing the inference aren't expected to know
      what all this human stuff is about.
   ]]]
   which I agree with
