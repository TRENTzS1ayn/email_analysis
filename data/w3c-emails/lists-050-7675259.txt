that's right Graham, sorry for that
so what about following sentences

=====
Using RDF, 'received meaning' can be characterized
as the social meaning of any logical consequences.

If you publish a graph G and G entails G', and we
interpret G' using the same social conventions that
everyone agrees could be reasonably used to interpret
G, then you are asserting that content of G' as well.

Human publishers of RDF content commit themselves
to the mechanically-inferred social obligations.

The machines doing the inferences aren't expected
to know what all those social conventions/obligations
are about.
