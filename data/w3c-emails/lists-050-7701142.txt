Dave,

Thanks for your review.

I've taken on board most of the points you raise.  To avoid spinning cycles 
on purely stylistic  matters, I'm going to focus my response on requests 
for substantive change which I've not incorporated, or for which I feel 
some clarification is in order.

I've changed the title to remove "Overview", but I do think it's important 
the title should reflect that there's content other than just the abstract 
data model.  Currently:

   Resource Description Framework (RDF):
   Concepts and Abstract Data Model

But I'm still open to other suggestions.

Section renamed (see below).  Motivation and design goals don't belong in 
the bullets, which are introduced as the normative elements of RDF 
specification.

>Section 2
>   rename title to 'Design goals and rationale'.

Following your intent, I think, I've opted for:

   2. RDF background, rationale and concepts

I'm not sure what can usefully be said here, other than what is already 
said.  I think the fact that use of XML schema datatypes was not detailed 
in the original RDF design is not really relevant here.

I looked into this, and come to the view that the normative syntax draft 
doesn't really illustrate the point I'm trying to make.  Dan's document does.

I've changed this, but cited the MIME type registration document directly.

That comes later.  I've added a forward link.

I've cited a work-in-progress of my own, but I'd prefer something more 
widely known.  RSS might be a candidate?  Can any RSS cognoscenti comment?

In this case, I meant Notation3.  (Otherwise, I've reworked the sentence as 
you suggest.)

That feels to me more like detail material for the tutorial.

I'm not sure what I could usefully add here.

Currently, we *are* normative on these.  (A note has been added to section 4.1)
