Aesthetic possibly, but it also has implications on apparent 
consistency.  I'm explaining some of this stuff in the Primer as well, 
and it isn't going to help the understandability of our specs if we 
appear to be inconsistent in how we talk about truly basic stuff like 
the various parts of the graph (and whether things are "labels" or not). 
  I don't care if the difference is trivial in "substantive content", 
the mere *appearance* of a difference creates a problem.  I think having 
such differences ought to be rigorously avoided, unless it's absolutely 
God-awful necessary.  In case you're wondering, the Primer currently 
uses the description from the "older" version of the model theory;  but 
I'll be happy to change it to gain consistency, once I make sure what I 
need to be consistent with!  (my default is the model theory)

A couple of minor questions about this:

a.  if, in the current model theory, some nodes *are* URIrefs, rather 
than being *labeled with* URIrefs, why shouldn't arcs *be* URIrefs, 
rather than being *labeled with* URI refs?

b.  if some nodes are URIrefs and some are strings (and we say nothing 
about them being labeled any more), why are we so insistent to say that 
blank nodes are unlabeled, and that node identifiers are *not* labels? 
Apparently, at the moment, no nodes have labels.  (This node identifier 
business, by the way, is one of the things I'm trying to explain in the 
Primer that I don't think is helped by inconsistency among the documents).

Pat?

Well, I think debate is needed, not so much about which explanation is 
better, but about whether we ought to use one, and not two (or, heaven 
help us, more than two!).  And I think *this* debate ought to happen 
ASAP.  It seems to me that if using the basic concepts from the model 
theory causes problems for non-mathematicians, we need to explain things 
better, not introduce apparent inconsistencies about whether nodes *are* 
URIs or are labeled by them (and I suspect that the non-mathematicians 
will be the first to notice, and have a problem with such inconsistencies).

PS:  You guys did say this new document was going to *help* with 
something, right?  :-)
