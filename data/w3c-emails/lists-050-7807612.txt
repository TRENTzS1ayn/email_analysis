Agreed. My message wasn't intended to indicate that this would be an 
acceptable inconsistency at last call. Merely that at this stage it 
shows stylistic choices in presentation that the WG needs to agree on.

It is clear that the primer editors need to be in on that agreement.

What other docs talk about the nodes in the graphs and their labels?
Probably all of them?
Which use nodes and node labels, which treat the label as the node?

Easy one: the nodes can be the label because there is at most one node 
with any given label. That is not true of arcs. e.g. there are many arcs 
labelled rdf:type. If we identify the arc with the uriref rdf:type then 
it has more than two ends.

We clearly should have one, the question is which one?
