Seems fine to me

  [[The design of RDF is intended to meet the following goals:

      * A simple data model
      * Formal semantics and well-founded inference
      * Extensible URI-based vocabulary
      * XML-based syntax
      * Use XML schema datatypes
      * Anyone can say anything about anything
      * A basis for legally binding agrements
      * Universal expression of ground facts 
  ]]

No, RDF was not designed to use XML schema datatypes.  This is
incorrect.  We are revising RDF to provide a datatyping mechanism
that is compatible with using XML schema datatypes but it does not
mandate their use.  Better:

  Provide a datatyping mechanism that incorporates W3C XML Schema Datatypes

(or some contraction)

Later on 2.2.5 says "RDF can be used with XML schema datatypes"
- the 'can' is the important thing.

  [[2.2.4 XML-based syntax

   RDF has an XML-based serialization form which, if used
   appropriately, allows a wide range of "ordinary" XML data to be
   interpreted as RDF [STRIPEDRDF].
  ]] -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Jul/att-0056/01-Overview.htm

The section is titled about the XML syntax.  Change the reference to
refer to an RDF Core WD that describes the syntax - either the primer
WD and/or the syntax WD.  The STRIPEDRDF document is useful for
thinking about the syntax from a historical perspective but is not
the document to point people at.

And why "ordinary" and "appropriately" ?  This paragraph is a mess.
Please rewrite it to describe that there is an XML syntax rather than
concentrate on this corner case of using a profile of the syntax as
"ordinary" XML (whatever that means).  The way we recommend to use
RDF in XML at present is to use the syntax we define which is
normative, now updated for best XML practice and should be linked here.

Yes, replace with RSS 1.0 which is a well known and used RDF/XML
syntax profile.

  [[
  2.4.3 XML serialization syntax
  ]]

Yet still does not mention the normative syntax despite citing your
work [XML-AS-RDF] reference and actually mentioning that there is a
normative syntax!

Please add a reference to the syntax WD to this section.

Well, in that case the words in the CC/PP WD are beyond what RDF sanctions.

see section 2.5 of this member only link to draft:
  http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/Group/Drafts/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20020716/

> I'm not sure what I could usefully add here.

Mention what you might conventionally find behind a namespace URI.

Mention how an RDF schema document can be found for a property,
possibly.

This section is about URI vocabulary and namespaces but doesn't tell
you how the two relate.  If you can't say anything, add this as a note.

No.  Charmod is not a normative reference for the syntax work - we do
not make such references on external working drafts and are not
extending the normative references for the syntax.

Please remove it.
