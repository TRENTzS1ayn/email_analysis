See comment in section 4.1. This section is the only one that 
normatively depends on charmod.

The problem here is that the concept of early uniform normalization is 
sufficiently large amount of text to explain that the reference is the 
only realistic way to do it.

I think we formally decided to go with early uniform normalization; I 
could try and dig up a reference.

At some level I see this as a negotiating position with the I18N WG. 
This para indicates that we are willing, as long as they progress.
  It is quite likely that we will have to remove it, and then Charmod 
will be demoted to an informative reference.
