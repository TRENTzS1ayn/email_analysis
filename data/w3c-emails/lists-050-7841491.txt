Dan,

[Trying to clarify rather than take a position here]

Jeremy's comment was aimed at the notion of a graph itself being "tidy" (no 
label appears more than once), separately from the hotly debated issue of 
tidy literal interpretations.  This document does not take any position on 
the issue of tidiness of literal interpretations, though it does say that a 
graph is syntactically tidy with respect to literals and URIrefs.

I think the key statements are:

Section 3.3:
[[
A tidy set of nodes is one in which no two nodes have equal labels.
]]

and

Section 3.5:
[[
The set of nodes of an RDF graph is tidy (per definition in section Nodes).
]]

This document section merely defines the abstract graph syntax, and says 
nothing about its semantics.
