I don't know/recall the details of the discussion, but this is what the 
document says:

[[
4.1 Character normalization

[[[This subsection normatively depends on CHARMOD, currently a last call 
working draft. If CHARMOD has not reached the appropriate recommendation 
status as this document progresses down the recommendation track, this 
section will be deleted.]]]

For the processing of character data that can be represented in different 
ways, RDF processors are required to conform to Early Uniform 
Normalization, as described by Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0 
[CHARMOD].
]]

I think the principle here was thrashed out with I18N folks (BICBW).
