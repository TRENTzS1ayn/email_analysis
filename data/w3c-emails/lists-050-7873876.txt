Arcs in a mathematical graph are defined in terms of their relationship
between two nodes so there is no way for them to exist independently of the
two nodes. Hence you can only label them with a URIref, they can't *be* a
URIref since by definition they are an ordered pair of nodes (or URIrefs in
this case).

Aesthetic possibly, but it also has implications on apparent
consistency.  I'm explaining some of this stuff in the Primer as well,
and it isn't going to help the understandability of our specs if we
appear to be inconsistent in how we talk about truly basic stuff like
the various parts of the graph (and whether things are "labels" or not).
  I don't care if the difference is trivial in "substantive content",
the mere *appearance* of a difference creates a problem.  I think having
such differences ought to be rigorously avoided, unless it's absolutely
God-awful necessary.  In case you're wondering, the Primer currently
uses the description from the "older" version of the model theory;  but
I'll be happy to change it to gain consistency, once I make sure what I
need to be consistent with!  (my default is the model theory)

A couple of minor questions about this:

a.  if, in the current model theory, some nodes *are* URIrefs, rather
than being *labeled with* URIrefs, why shouldn't arcs *be* URIrefs,
rather than being *labeled with* URI refs?

b.  if some nodes are URIrefs and some are strings (and we say nothing
about them being labeled any more), why are we so insistent to say that
blank nodes are unlabeled, and that node identifiers are *not* labels?
Apparently, at the moment, no nodes have labels.  (This node identifier
business, by the way, is one of the things I'm trying to explain in the
Primer that I don't think is helped by inconsistency among the documents).

Well, I think debate is needed, not so much about which explanation is
better, but about whether we ought to use one, and not two (or, heaven
help us, more than two!).  And I think *this* debate ought to happen
ASAP.  It seems to me that if using the basic concepts from the model
theory causes problems for non-mathematicians, we need to explain things
better, not introduce apparent inconsistencies about whether nodes *are*
URIs or are labeled by them (and I suspect that the non-mathematicians
will be the first to notice, and have a problem with such inconsistencies).
