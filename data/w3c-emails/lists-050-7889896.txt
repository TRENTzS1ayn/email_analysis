Dave,

I have some agreement, some not, but overall I think we're converging...

OK, I'll work that in.

I agree that I should lead in with a broader mention of the XML syntax, and 
cite reference to the syntax specification.

But what you describe as a "corner case" is something that I have found to 
be crucial to getting agreement to incorporate RDF into commercial 
products.  As such, I think it's an important feature of RDF looking 
forward, regardless of the historical reasons.  (Even CC/PP implementers 
are now trying to wriggle out of using RDF because they cannot process 
CC/PP profiles using familiar XML based tools.)

I think there are two points of debate here:

1. we clearly disagree about the importance of this aspect of RDF, so I 
must appeal to wider WG input for a decision (either way).

2. Regarding the wording, I accept that it is inadequate, and am fully 
prepared to revisit that.  A possible approach might be to rework the 
section to:
(a) start with a general reference to the XML syntax and cite its 
specification,
(b) refer to the striped syntax section of the normative syntax draft, then
(c) to indicate by reference to DanBri's document an example that shows how 
XML can be constructed to be RDF compliant.

OK, I'll dig out that.

Agreed - my oversight.

Quite possibly...

OK, I'll stop resisting, but I'm still not clear what you want me to 
say.  There is no section 2.5 in that reference.  The nearest text I see is 
this:

[[
There is a reasonable expectation that a designated (globally unique) 
namespace will have associated semantics, including schema-related 
semantics. Thus, there is a convention that a namespace URI is associated 
with a corresponding schema document, though the specific mechanism for 
determining such an association is not formally defined. (The RDF Schema 
specification does say that the namespace identifier is also used as a 
schema identifier.)
]]

OK.  I can add something about that.

Apart from as above, I don't know how.

This is currently subject of separate WG debate.   I propose we follow WG 
consensus.
