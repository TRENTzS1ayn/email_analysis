Hi all,

   Given the amazing progress we have made on agreeing on the one right 
way of dealing with data types, here is a proposal that is only 
partially tongue-in-cheek.

  Lets face it ... there isn't that much RDF out there. I am sure that 
in their spare time, the Dans and Pats of the working group could easily 
rewrite it all. So, a clean solution that breaks some existing RDF files 
might be worth considering.

 The simplest thing I can think of is to say that the literal always 
denotes the string, unless there is an explicit xsd attribute which 
specifies some other data type. Life just becomes so much simpler ...
