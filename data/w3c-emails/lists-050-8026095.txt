I don't understand that at all. Either the property is already in 
existence and people are required to write something like:

:John :age "4" .
(i.e. the object is a literal containing a bunch of numerals)

and this is just a way to describe that more formally or they're 
creating a new property which either doesn't have a standard datatype 
scheme and they'll use the local idiom or it does and they'll use an 
idiom like above. If they pick the first, they'll optionally create a 
second property if they want to make it easier for people to abbreviate 
a standard form.

I don't see why this is so special. We don't get upset that people have 
to make author and authorName if they want to abbreviate. How is this 
different?
