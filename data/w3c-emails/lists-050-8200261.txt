I'm not sure about the proper modeling, but I'll try and explain the 
concept.

DCMI Point is a system for identifying a point in space by using east, 
north, elevation, units, zunits, projection and name. DCSV is the 
plain-text encoding of a DCMI Point. There is also an XML encoding, 
which would look like:

<Point name="Perth, W.A.">
         <east>115.85717</east>
         <north>-31.95301</north>
</Point>
