Part of my point was that N-triples and arc-and-node drawings are pretty
much in the same position, so I think we're sort of agreeing.  However,
your response caused me to realize that there's another distinction to
be made here, having to do with the meaning of "normative representation
of a graph".  You're using the phrase to mean "a representation that
software is obliged to generate and/or process", and that representation
is certainly important to nail down (at the moment, RDF/XML seems to be
"it").  However, what about the concept of "the notation (or those
notations) used to describe graphs in normative specifications"?  It
certainly seems plausible to talk about a notation used to describe
graphs in a normative specification (at least, a specification that
needs to talk about graphs) as being somehow normative itself (not
normative for software processing, perhaps, but possibly in some other
sense).  N-Triples (or the variant that uses Qnames instead of full
URIs) is certainly widely used in our normative specifications for
describing graphs.  They are certainly widely used in the model theory
and syntax spec.  I can't imagine trying to describe graphs using
RDF/XML in the model theory;  in the syntax spec, it would be impossible
to use RDF/XML as a substitute for N-Triples (you'd be describing how
RDF/XML got translated to RDF/XML!).

I agree.
