I've modified session 8 in the f2f agenda to unassigned, realising that my 
intent for the original designation of the session might be misunderstood.

We are now, I hope, close to resolving all our issues, and its time for the 
WG to take stock of where we have reached.  I urge the WG to review all the 
decisions we have made and check that our decisions are reasonably 
consistent, particularly that decisions we made early in the process, still 
make sense in the light of our now improved understanding and later decisions.

Brian
