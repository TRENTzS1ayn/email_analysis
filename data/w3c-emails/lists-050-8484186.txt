Below are some difficulties I see with what you're proposing.

I'd like to be clearer as to what things are included in "RDF vocabulary
term" (what else besides Classes and Properties).  Also, I suspect "the
context within which it is defined" will muddy the waters, rather than
clearing them.

If this is intended to be a constraint, I don't understand how you'll
enforce it.  Note also that this doesn't say there can't be more than
one rdfs:isDefinedBy property, it just says there is only one "correct
value".  So there might be multiple rdfs:isDefinedBy properties, several
of which have the "correct value" (whatever that is), and others which
have "incorrect values".

But identifying the namespace doesn't, per se, identify someplace where
something is defined, unless you're assuming that the namespace URI is
also the URI of a schema.  The text you quoted from the M&S seemed to
say that this was the case, but do we say that in any of our current
specs?  I don't think so, and without that, I think it's misleading to
suggest (by using the name "rdfs:isDefinedBy") that the namespace URI is
something that defines anything (as opposed to something that simply
distinguishes a collection of names).

I don't think so.

I don't think your text represents this explicitly, since I don't think
there's anything in our current specs that says that the namespace URI
identifies a schema.  The easiest way to represent the above explicitly
would be to simply say it, e.g., say, someplace,

a.  Each property is defined by exactly one RDF schema  
b.  The [or a] URI of this schema is used as the XML namespace URIref in
the serialized representation of the RDF properties
c.  rdfs:isDefinedBy can thus be used to represent (within the RDF
graph) the relationship that holds between a property and the namespace
(and schema) within which it is defined.

There are still some problems here (like, what exactly is a "schema"? 
if a property is described by other properties in multiple places, is
that one schema or many?), but at least it's more explicit.
