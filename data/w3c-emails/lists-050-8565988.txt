In truth I had a broken test harness :(

Moreover having fixed a bug in the test harness there are now rather more
bugs in both ARP and the test cases apparant.

Some in the test cases include:

rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/test004.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/
test004.rdf

rdfms-rdf-names-use/test-025.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-rdf-names-use/test-025.rdf

xmlbase/test014.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/xmlbase/test014.rdf

ARP is still buggy around the xml-literals but some of those test cases have
neglected the language tags.

I attached a zip of modified nt files.
