I'm a little uncomfortable with what this might be saying, but I'd be happy 
if we can describe the schema resource referenced by rdfs:isDefinedBy as:

[[
An RDF document containing defining information about some RDF vocabulary 
(i.e. about some RDF properties and classes).
]]

What I want to avoid doing here is (a) creating an idea that a schema is 
somehow apart from the wider body of RDF data, and (b) that a schema 
contains only statements based on the RDFS-defined vocabulary (rdfs:range, 
rdfs:domain, etc.).
