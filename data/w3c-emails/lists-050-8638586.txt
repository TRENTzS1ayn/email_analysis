(a) I think this initiative sounds useful, particularly for the future of 
things built upon RDF.

(b) I think it would be better as separate documents for a practical 
reason:  as long as we can be confident that the proposal is truly 
compatible with the current model theory, we need not feel bound to delay 
completion of the current documents while this one "catches up".
