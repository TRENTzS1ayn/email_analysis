Pat--

Your message starts out like a letter from the Draft Board (fairly
appropriate under the circumstances, I suppose)!

Just for clarification (and maybe these are questions for the F2F):

a.  you are proposing that the new document using your new technique to
give a semantics for RDF should become a new RDF Core deliverable,
right?

b.  should this have the same normative status as the Model Theory
document (if not, how do you think we ought to refer to it?)

c.  what would be the status of the document describing the overall
technique?  Another RDF Core deliverable?  A WebONT deliverable?  A W3C
Note?  Something else?
