Yes. And I'm further suggesting that we formally write this concept down
so that others can use in their descriptions (e.g.):

so to be clear, the suggestion is to add:

<rdfs:Class rdf:ID="Schema">
  <rdfs:label>RDF Schema</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>An RDF document containing defining information about
some RDF vocabulary (i.e. about some RDF properties and
classes)</rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:Class>

and change:

<rdf:Property ID="isDefinedBy">
  <rdf:type
resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
  <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="#seeAlso"/> 
  <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">isDefinedBy</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:label xml:lang="fr">esD&#233;finiPar</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>Indicates a resource containing and defining the subject
resource.</rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Resource"/>
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Resource"/>
</rdf:Property>

-- ala http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema

to...

<rdf:Property rdf:ID="isDefinedBy">
  <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="#seeAlso"/> 
  <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">isDefinedBy</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:label xml:lang="fr">esD&#233;finiPar</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>Indicates a resource containing and defining the subject
resource.</rdfs:comment>  
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Schema"/>
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Resource"/>
</rdf:Property>

<!-- note I'd suggest clarifying the comment -->

or is this level of formalism the part you're uncomfortable with?

I absolutely agree. I don't mean to suggest otherwise.
