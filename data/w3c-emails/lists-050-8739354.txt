If I understand correctly what Graham is saying here, I agree ;-)

I.e. we would not say

   rdfs:isDefinedBy rdfs:range rdfs:Schema .

Rather, we'd say (as is presently defined)

   rdfs:isDefinedBy rdfs:range rdf:Resource .

and then for a particular case

  :someTerm rdfs:isDefinedBy :someResource .
  :someResource a rdfs:Schema .
