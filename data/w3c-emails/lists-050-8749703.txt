I'm in favor of this.

I'm strongly opposed to this.

Firstly, this is a narrower definition as defined in M&S (and I'm
not convinced that this narrower definition was what M&S was
intended to say) and that narrower definition is contrary to
present usage based on the broader M&S definition -- i.e. things
will break (see Aaron's recent post of examples).

Secondly, given the definition of the rdfs:Schema class, it is
unneccesary, since one may clearly express that the defining
resource is an RDF schema.

Cheers,

Patrick
