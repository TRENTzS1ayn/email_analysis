I'm completely torn. We're supposed to be in the end-game now, big changes
to our docs at this stage are expensive and risky. But this
re-articulation of the RDF Core semantics does to me seem promising as a
mechanism for resolving the layering debates that have take up so much
time and attention. Promise, however, isn't good enough. I'd like to know
how the new work looks from a WebOnt perspective, as well (of course) as
hearing the reaction of other WG members. If we are to work on this, I'd
like to see a clear demonstration of two things: (i) that the layering of
a Web Ontology language over our work becomes easier / possible, and that
WebOnt folk acknowledge this (ii) that the creation
of subsequent layers of semantic web architecture (eg. rules, query) on
top of RDF Core and WebOnt's work also becomes easier (or feasible). I'd
like to be convinced that this proposal makes our life easier rather than
harder. And that WG members have the energy and enthusiasm and hours in
the day to adopt this proposed change. I don't think any of this has been
shown yet. Most of all, I want to see more technical comment from WG
members. This is an important proposal and an important decision. I hope
WG members can find time to take a look at

...without slowing down our other work. Which brings us back to the
hours-in-the-day and 'why now' problem...
