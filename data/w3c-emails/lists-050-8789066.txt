Brian,

  Sorry, but the approach described in the MT document currently up on 
the W3C site does *not* address the layering problem. It does with a 
change which introduces a small wording modification (but only the 
wording modification is small).

  As per W3C processes, we could rule the layering problem out of scope, 
etc. and quickly move to completion. But if RDF aspires to be a basis 
for OWL and other languages, it has to solve the layering problem. If it 
does not, OWL and others will be forced to introduce constructs which 
make RDF and them non-monotonic, etc.

  The current layering issue is focussed on being able to build pyramids 
of model theories. The problem of layering is broader and significant. A 
melange of model theories does little to ensure machine 
interoperability. A solution to this problem is what makes these two 
drafts interesting.
