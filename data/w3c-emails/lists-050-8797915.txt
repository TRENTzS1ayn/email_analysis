Dan,

 I would like to answer the "why now" question.

 The reason is *very* simple: we have a problem. RDF is intended to be 
the foundation for languages of the semantic web, and yet, it has been 
found that even a comparatively simple thing like OWL can't be built on 
this foundation. Wait till you try to layer thing like DAML-S on top of 
 RDF.

  Heck, we don't even know what it means to layer ... At this point, all 
it means is that OWL or someone else does their own model theory and all 
that layering means is that it is not inconsistent with the RDF model 
theory. Fine bit of good that does a machine trying to combine 
expressions in different languages.
