I think that my notion of meaning is very much the english one, and so I 
have a greater right to the default namespace!

You are  clearly the one who has the hubris.  You are telling me I am 
wrong and crazy.   But simultaneously saying  that the meaning of an RDF 
statement is only what is expressable is RDF, you imply that RDF has 
somehow captured in its semantics - ie its model theory -? an entire 
account of English meaning, or human thought. This is clearly insane 
hubris as you say, but it is you who are guilty of it!

Science always has problem that it isn't very good at using namespaces.  
There is an arrogant assertion that to classify a tomato as not a fruit 
is wrong, when it is just a use of a common term rather than a 
biological one.  To  teach your undergraduates about the meaning of 
"pat:meaning", apparently that all pat:meaning can be expressed in RDF 
axioms, is all very well so long as you don't have the arrogance to 
declare that pat: meaning is the only form of meaning, and specifically 
that all the people who use the term in is english sense are wrong or 
crazy.

To say that #pat  pchar:eyeColor pantone:blue .  has no meaning is not 
helpful in reality.

SOME of the valid inferences from the above can be expressed in 
mathematical langauges, but as you say it is crazy to think one could 
define all the terms from scratch.

I am talking about grounding how the technical terms in an RDF 
vocabulary are grounded in enlgish, not how english is grounded. **

I suppose I take for granted the process which W3C and engineers are 
constantly in general: writing specifications.  When someone writes a 
specification for SVG, about how <circle> should generate a circle, they 
often do it in natural english. The same applies for specification fo 
sheet steel, and so on. The same applies to the DAML spec, which for all 
its axioms and model theory is incomplete without english text.

I can see it is frustrating to you as a logician that the meaning of 
things like a sheet of mild steel can't be practically specified in 
mathematics, but you have declared that it is "insane hubris" to expect 
to do so, and yet we need to be able to specify sheet steel, and hence 
we use English. Specifications of technical terms are normally much more 
verbose than a single word.  They use repetition and restatement to 
avoid ambiguity and make a definition which a community of use -- 
potentially the entire planet -- can accept as being unambiguous.

That's life.

(**Actually the grounding of english is, in my humble opinion, quite 
complicated.   It is simplistic to imagine that kids learn all of their 
natural language from definitions provided to them in terms of "hot" and 
'cold" and the other things for which they have sensor cells. We 
construct associations between concepts as we understand more of the 
world, and learn to associate words with those concepts in a rather 
fuzzy way.  Eventually they end up with a large set of concepts which 
map in a more or less fuzzy way through words onto the loose webs of 
association in other's brains, and that way they get though life.   
Logical concepts are rather the exception in that they are consciously 
analyzed to a greater extent, and so the shared webs of association in 
different people's minds include some repeatable mathematical 
properties.)

Well, we are all looking forward to those aspects of meaning which are 
machine-processable to be represented formally.  And we all struggle to 
use natural language to set up this infrastructure.

For pat:meanings, in other words defining the set of valid infrences 
which can be deduced using a turning machine, yes.

Software agents understand, but the output must be usable in the real 
world.

So a person writes that x is the author of y.  A machine deduces that x 
is creator of y.
A person concludes that x is the creator of y.

(Never mind. Let's not niggle over details of the examples.)

That's how it works on the web.  People publish things.  To publish is, 
I suppose,  to declare the meaning of something by fiat.     It does not 
work like common parlance defines the meaning of words.

All of civilized society could indeed in principle be "outvoted".  One 
could vote that the holocaust didn't really happen, or that "bedtime" 
means "time to watch television", if one has enough support.  These are 
failures of a system which generally works for things like commerce.  
You can assert as much as you like that a pound note means that the bank 
of England should furnish you with gold for the rest of your life, but 
they won't.  Society has constructed a framework which (while its left 
brain delights in poetry) not only uses but also supports a framework of 
communication over practical matters using well-defined common terms.

In many cases we use the concept of terms with well defined meanings.  
In writing specs of internet protocols and in RDF this is what we do.  
Deviations from this are dealt with outside the box, using many 
different techniques.
