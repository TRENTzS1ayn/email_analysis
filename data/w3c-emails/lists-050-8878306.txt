Guha,

>?I don't think there should be any impact on the test cases.

that's what I thought too, at least after having read
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF(S)_based_on_Lbase.html

>?I would like your feedback however on how something like

I believe what's written

[[[
   Model theory is usually most relevant to implementation
   via the notion of entailment, described later, and by
   making it possible to define valid inference rules.
]]]
    -- http://tap.stanford.edu/SemanticWebSemantics.html

and in that sense MT is good news and we try to
obey MT (maybe also because those are the initials
of my wife ;-)


I've been thinking a lot recently about function terms
i.e. the thing we called "functionial terms" in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Jun/0078.html


I think I'm not completely understanding the last part of

[[[
   Further, we believe that a melange of model theories
   will adversely impact developers building agents that
   implement proof systems for these layers, since the
   proof systems will likely be different for each layer.
]]]
    -- http://tap.stanford.edu/SemanticWebSemantics.html

but anyhow, this gives us also a strong motivation/challenge
