Sorry if I got it muddled. I'll try to keep it straight in what follows.

OK, if you mean some informal English sense of 'meaning', then fine; 
but then you need to justify any claims that *that* is somehow 
encoded in RDF, which seems like a hard row to hoe. (I could argue 
with you about exactly what the 'english one' is, but lets not get 
into a philosophical debate.)

No, please, I was careful not to say that. I said that your words 
SOUND crazy. The implication I draw is that I'm not hearing what you 
are meaning to say, that we aren't communicating properly. (Since I 
know that quite a lot of people are understanding this kind of talk 
in roughly the same way I am, I would also suggest that there might 
be a wider breakdown of communication.)

I genuinely fail to follow you here. We seem to be talking past each 
other. I am NOT saying that the meaning of RDF has this wide scope, 
or that RDF has captured all this in its semantics. That is my point: 
it cannot possibly have such a rich meaning. Yet you (and Dan C., for 
example) seem to insist that it does.

Maybe you could briefly say *how* you think that a piece of RDF gets 
to have some complicated meaning associated with it? In other email 
discussions with Dan C., for example, he has suggested that simply 
saying, in English, in an rdfs:comment string, that a uriref has a 
certain meaning, is sufficient to give it that meaning. Do you agree 
with that claim? To me, that sounds like saying that putting a 
comment in a Java program which says "This program outputs 1 when 
given the Godel number of a program which terminates and 0 when given 
the Godel number of a nonterminating program" would be enough to 
refute Godel and Turing: one wouldn't even need to write the program. 
Can you see why this *seems* daft?

What ARE you talking about? The point that I try to teach my students 
is that all meaning *cannot* be rendered into axioms (of RDF or 
anything else.) That is why I find your claims about the meaning of 
RDF so extraordinary. It has nothing to do with arrogance or using a 
term in technical way: it is just to get them to stop thinking that 
because they write some piece of, say, first-order logic that says 
"Has(Joe, Measles)" that they have somehow managed to fully capture 
the meaning of the English sentence 'Joe has measles'. The formalisms 
DONT capture all the English meaning; we seem to agree on that. But 
elsewhere, you *seem* to be saying that RDF does. (And just for the 
record, this view of 'meaning' isn't pat:meaning, its more like 
Tarski/Quine/AI/FormalLinguistics/CognitiveScience:meaning. Im not 
claiming that I invented any of this stuff or had any new insights 
about it.)

What I find odd is to use the word in its English sense *when 
referring to RDF*. That was my point: that *sounds* like you are 
saying that RDF has the expressive power of English. Which *sounds* 
crazy. Im sure that what you actually do mean isn't in fact crazy, 
but I am rather at a loss to figure out what it is.  Communication 
breakdown.

Well, I think that it is helpful, if it can be seen as a refutation 
of the claim that putting that triple in an RDF document is enough to 
enable a computer to know that my eye color is blue. Thats what you 
*seem* to be saying, and that is sufficiently badly wrong that its 
helpful to cry 'foul'.

I don't know about 'scratch', but they had better be defined in some 
way that is accessible to an RDF processing engine.

OK; but *that* meaning isn't machine-processable, right? No software 
agent is going to act in some way that depends on that kind of 
meaning.  Moreover, there isn't anything to say in a technical spec 
about that notion of meaning. What could the spec say? "We hereby 
declare that any piece of RDF shall mean whatever the person who 
wrote it intended that it should mean."  ?? Hardly seems worth 
saying: its like declaring that people are people.

OK, nice distinction. But can we agree that 'grounding in English' is 
a (difficult and largely unexplored) research area? One where we 
might expect that 'ordinary' meanings of words like 'meaning' might 
have to be adjusted to conform to (as yet unwritten) theories of 
what, in fact, 'meaning' means? Or do you want to just assume that 
there is no need of any analysis of terms like 'meaning' and we can 
just muddle along?

Sure, of course. But that is in the *spec*, not in the actual 
formalism. Specs are meant to be read and used by people, of course I 
agree. But the spec needs to be precise. If a spec said that <circle> 
should generate a foodle, and didn't say what a foodle was, then it 
wouldnt be much use. Unfortunately, at present, referring to 
'meaning' in a spec is about as useful to implementors as referring 
to a foodle. We really do not know what meanings are, or what it 
means to say that X means Y.

I know sentences like this are kind of wierd because they use the 
terms they are complaining about. As St. Augustine said about time: 
if you don't ask me what it is, I know; but if I try to explain it, I 
don't know. We do know enough to know that most of the 'obvious' 
ideas about meanings don't work out when one leans on them hard 
enough for use in a technical spec. Godel undecideability (which 
really hasnt got anything particularly to do with mathematics, btw) 
was a shocker to most people 50 years ago, for example, because it 
runs counter to a whole slew of apparently intuitively obvious ideas 
about meanings.

>I can see it is frustrating to you as a logician that the meaning of

No, that isn't the point Im making at all. I KNOW that the meaning of 
things like a sheet of mild steel can't be axiomatized; that is why 
Im puzzled by what you say about RDF. And Im not speaking here as a 
logician, but more as an AI/KR type who worries about meanings and 
how to represent them. I wish we had better ways than by using 
logical formalisms, but so far we don't.

>but you have declared that it is "insane hubris" to expect to do so, 
>and yet we need to be able to specify sheet steel, and hence we use 
>English.

OK, stop there for a second. We use English when talking to who? To 
other human beings, or to software agents? I have been understanding 
the entire semantic web effort as having the goal of making some 
aspects of meaning accessible for use by software. Was that a 
misunderstanding? Because if it was, how does the *semantic* web 
differ from the current web? We have English text already on the web, 
right? People publish it and people read it and understand it. If 
THAT is what we are trying to do here, what do we need the *semantic* 
web for?
And if, as I have been supposing, the point of RDF and RDFS and DAML 
and OWL is to formalize some (not *all*, but some) meaning in a form 
that makes it accessible to machine processing, then whether or not 
it also can be said, in some ordinary-language informal sense of 
'meaning', to have some other meaning, seems to me to be largely 
irrelevant to us (and potentially very misleading to assert, at least 
without qualification) , since it's only the machine-accessible 
meaning that is, well, accessible to the machines that we are trying 
to create which will manipulate and process it suitably, right?

Sure. But here you seem to be talking about the English in the specs 
of (say) RDF, not some English in a comment in a piece of actual RDF 
being sent across the web and being processed by some RDF engine. It, 
the poor dumb thing, isn't going to be able to read the rdfs:comment 
text and act on what it means to people like us. And if it has to 
stop and ask a person what this means and what it should do about it, 
then the semantic web is going to work very slowly indeed.

Oh, I couldn't agree more. Thinking about kids learning language 
gives cognitive psychologists nightmares. At the peak - around four 
years - they are learning about 10 new words a day *on average*. Its 
this very complexity that frightens me when someone expects words 
like 'mean' to map easily from their informal everyday use into a 
formal, precise specification.

Never mind Turing machines; but look, surely it IS exactly the 
aspects of meaning that can be somehow cashed out in the behavior of 
software (which might well include valid inference-making) with which 
have to be centrally concerned here, right? That is how the semantic 
web will get built. It won't get built by sending English text around 
and hoping that the machines will understand it, And putting it 
inside rdfs:comments, calling it "RDF" and claiming that one has 
thereby captured its meaning, just seems like sticking ones head in 
the sand.

'output'? The output from one RDF reasoner is likely to be the input 
for another RDF reasoner. I don't think that talking in terms of 
input and output of meanings is a useful way to think about the 
semantic web. Rather, think of a connected web of inferences being 
manipulated by machines, which also act on the basis of the 
conclusions they reach. Quite likely, many of those conclusions will 
never be even seen by any human being, but their machine-useable 
meaning might have very significant consequences out in the real 
world. Here I am standing in front of the ATM and God alone knows 
what inferences are going on, but eventually I either get my money or 
I don't. We need to be able to keep this huge process of planet-wide 
machine inference at least marginally predictable in its behavior, 
and those predictions are going to depend crucially on being able to 
say, with as much precision as we possibly can, what the 
*machine-processable* meanings of the formalism are (and are not, by 
the way). Just saying that meanings are defined by the intentions of 
the human authors doesn't seem like a good enough basis to predict 
what is going to happen here.

A person might conclude anything. We cannot possibly legislate what a 
person can conclude from RDF or anything else. What matters a lot 
more, and what the spec is about, is what a machine can and (more 
germane to this discussion) what it cannot, conclude.

I doubt it, in fact. Publication on the web is pretty much like 
publication in any other medium, as far as all these issues of 
meaning and so on are concerned. The Web is  a new force in society, 
to be sure, but it hasn't materially affected the basic notions of 
semiotics. Hypertext is still text, even when it moves. But in any 
case, how it works on the (current) web is  largely irrelevant. What 
is at issue here is how it WILL work on the semantic web; and it 
seems obvious to me that there, just claiming that a piece of RDF 
means something isn't going to be worth a fart unless all the RDF 
engines out there have some way of figuring out enough of the meaning 
to enable them to do something useful about it.

>  People publish things.  To publish is, I suppose,  to declare the

Nonsense. To publish is to make a public assertion, not to define 
meanings by fiat. In fact,one had better use *existing* meanings if 
one wishes ones publication to reach a very wide audience. (A point 
originally made by Wittgenstein, trashing the idea of a private 
language.)

It generally works when the society consists of human beings, who 
have all that famous common sense. It absolutely is not clear that it 
is going to go on working when some of the agents doing the 'voting' 
are built from software, and still less so when they can be 
*generated* by software.

Oh God, would that it were true. Do you have any idea how many 
inconsistencies arise when one tries to fix the meanings of these 
'well-defined common terms' crisply enough for use by machines? It is 
almost guaranteed that any two people will disagree about the actual 
facts of the world in front of their eyes if asked to describe it in 
some formal language (never mind giving *logical definitions* of the 
terms, now, just writing it down using ordinary concepts, assuming 
that the definitions will be filled in later.) I could tell you 
stories....but so could anyone who has tried to do knowledge 
representation in a nontrivial domain. This is NOT easy to do, and it 
can't be done - really, CANNOT be done - just by assuming that when 
people are able to agree on a workable set of NL words, that they do 
in fact agree on actual  meanings, or that it is enough to just kind 
of indicate in English what the formal symbols are supposed to mean. 
The mechanical inference processes are just too unforgiving of all 
the little minor mismatches that allow humans to smoothly 
misunderstand one another without it really mattering; and the 
machines don't have human abilities to negotiate nuances of meaning, 
or to readjust their interpretations to correct previous 
misunderstandings, or to work with a partial understanding of 
meanings to be filled in later, or to switch smoothly between 
inference and comprehension. People are just WAY smarter than 
machines. And even though, I concede, the semantic web will have 
people as it were surrounding it and providing its grounding in the 
world, nevertheless it is the machines, not the people, which are 
going to have to be actually working the machinery of the semantic 
web.

Pat

P.S. Here's one of the stories. Once, as an initial exercise in 
formalizing some 'common sense' I sat down with two people and we 
decided to make a list of all the things in the room. After a while, 
one of them mentioned a picture which was hanging on one wall; the 
other objected that the picture wasn't *in* the room, but was *part* 
of the room. The ensuing debate went on for an hour. What do you 
think? Is the carpet 'in' the room? (What if it is glued down?) Is 
the paint on the wall 'in' the room? (If you bring a can of paint 
into the room and use it on the walls, at what point does it become 
part of the room?) Is the door of the room 'in' the room? (If it 
opens inwards, and you open it, is it in the room then?) Can a sound 
be said to be in a room? How about a light, or a scent? And so on.... 
They fought like cat and dog : each of them found it hard to accept 
that the other could believe such crazy stuff.  And the amusing thing 
is that both of these people had reached adulthood using the words 
'in' and  'room' without ever discovering that other people had such 
different intuitions about what they meant.
