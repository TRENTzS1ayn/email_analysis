Until you had used the word 'namespace' in the bit I've cut from
above, I would say no.  When namespace appears in the MT, I'm
worried.

I just went and checked in the MT WD, and you do use it a few more
times than I expected.  Hmm!

Patrick Stickler has said elsewhere that "namespaces are punctuation"
which is a bit strong, but for RDF/XML that is mostly correct.  RDF
does not have namespaces in the model (theory).
