Agreed; I'd rather see some syntactic mechanism for darkening (or more
generally, colouring*) triples that doesn't rely on URI inspection. In
particular, URI inspection doesn't need to be written into the MT
documents - it should just appeal to darkness (or otherwise) that's
determined through a mechanism external to the document.
