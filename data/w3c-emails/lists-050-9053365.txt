Smiley noted, but I must emphasize that this is *not* a case for 
aboutEachPrefix.

(The point about Pat/Guha's proposal is that the reservation must apply 
globally, not in response to something that pops up in the RDF graph.  If a 
colouring mechanism is to appear in the graph then it must apply 
graph-syntactically to every affected triple.)
