Here goes:

<rdfs:Property rdf:about="&rdfs;isDefinedBy">
   <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="&rdfs;seeAlso"/>
   <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="&rdf;Resource"/>
   <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&rdf;Resource"/>
   <rdfs:comment> 
       This property indicates a resource which fully or partially
       defines the subject resource. The subject of this property
       can be any instance of rdfs:Resource and may have as its
       value any rdfs:Resource. The most common anticipated usage
       is to relate a vocabulary term to an instance of rdfs:Schema
       containing defining information about that term.
   </rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:Property>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="&rdfs;Schema">
   <rdfs:comment>
      An RDF/XML instance.
   </rdfs:comment>
</rdf:Class>

(and no, I don't consider the definition of rdfs:Schema to be
 too narrow; folks can still point to N3 instances if they like,
 but an rdfs:Schema is a standard serialization of RDF statements)

Cheers,

Patrick
