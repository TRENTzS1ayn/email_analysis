Yes, well I don't agree that XML namespaces are just punctuation, but
that is not important for this discussion -  I agree with what you say
here. I suggest that the RDF MT can provide for sets of asserted and
unasserted triples, or even for any number sets of triples colored by
whatever name one wishes. For the purposes of RDF/XML _syntax_ the
namespace is a perfectly reasonable way to distinguish which triples are
intended to go into which bucket in an unambiguous and monotonic -- even
monotonous -- fashion. I don't suggest that namespaces are the only way,
simply that for the purposes of RDF/XML they can provide a _purely
syntactic_ way for a parser to flip triples into buckets ... and with
perhaps minimal, but nonzero, changes to the syntax.
