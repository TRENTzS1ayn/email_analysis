Then the entire WWW is an illusion. I will leave others to draw a 
conclusion about that.

Well, sorry, but *that* is nonsense. If there are no namespaces in 
the RDF graph then there is no connection between any RDF graph and 
the RDF + RDFS vocabulary, so all of RDF(S) is meaningless.

Maybe we are using 'namespace' in different senses?? I just mean a 
set of URIs that belong to someone (in this case, the W3C).

No, that is not the proposal.

I do not follow your reasons for objecting to the idea of a set of 
URIs having an owner. Isnt that a given, in all these discussions?
