No, I think this is useful. Would you agree that 'received meaning' 
can be characterized as the social meaning of any logical 
consequences? That gives a clean characterization which I think is 
what Tim is getting at. If you publish a graph G and G  entails G', 
and we interpret G' using the same social conventions that everyone 
agrees could be reasonably used to interpret  G, then you are 
asserting that content of G' as well.  Tim wants to prevent human 
publishers of RDF content from wriggling out of their 
mechanically-inferred social obligations; I want to be clear that the 
machines doing the inference aren't expected to know what all this 
human stuff is about.
