I really do NOT want to introduce a syntax extension, which 
introduces all kinds of extra complexity. We have agreed that 
contexts are out of scope.

What is wrong with URI inspection? One can inspect opaque URIs. RDF 
engines are going to have to be able to at least match one uriref 
with another to see if they are the same, and that is all that is 
required: if a URI is in a certain (externally defined) list of 
reserved URIs, then the triple isn't asserted. That's all.
