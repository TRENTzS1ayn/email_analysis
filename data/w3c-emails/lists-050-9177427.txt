I insist that we do not put this into a spec unless we also say 
something about what we mean by 'define'. That word has no formal 
meaning in an assertional language like RDF and RDFS, and it is a 
very dangerous word to use casually. (For example, the difference 
between a simple contradiction and a very nasty paradox turns on the 
distinction between 'assert' and 'define', and this has been a 
central issue in the Webont layering problems.). I would prefer to 
avoid the use of the 'define' word altogether if we possibly can, 
particularly when used with 'resource'.

Why bother saying that? *Everything* is an instance of rdfs:Resource, 
so this isn't saying anything.
