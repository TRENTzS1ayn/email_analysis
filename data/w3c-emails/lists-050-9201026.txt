I'm just sensitive to this since lots of people see
namespace==XML namespace especially when in web specs that use XML.
The current MT does use namespace in both senses, if I read it correctly.

Re: "A namespace in RDF is just a set of urirefs."

Have we defined this.  Would be nice maybe and if so, should we have
a way to relate (i.e. a property) the namespace to the set of urirefs ?
Relates to the isDefinedBy discussion ?
