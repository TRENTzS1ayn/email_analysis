that's what I believe too

well, we started testing and found no (MT) bugs so far
we actually test and experiment in N3 and we use
for example n-ary relational statements like
  { } :R ( :t1 :t2 ... :tn ) .
and n-ary functional statements like
  :t0 :f ( :t1 :t2 ... :tn ) .
whereby
  { } is the empty graph (which is true)
  ( ... :ti ... ) is a rdf:List (not owl:List)
  :t0 is a function value (which could be a blank node)

I believe it is proposable/reasonable in webont

why not partly in a revised MT document (with appropriate references)?

and still, it should be possible, no?
