I appreciate your view that namespaces are more than punctuation (though
I do disagree) but because namespaces are a point of strong contention,
I feel it is unwise to use them as a basis for identifying unasserted
triples in the RDF/XML syntax.

Also, it precludes

(a) using the same term in both asserted and unasserted triples
(b) using only some terms grounded in a given namespace in unasserted
    triples and others in asserted triples

Now, it may be that both of the above will seldom if ever be needed,
but the preclusion seems arbitrary and needless, simply due to the
coarse resolution of and global scope of the namespace prefix.

I feel that a generic mechanism, such as my proposed rdf:Notation
element, would serve the need just as well without imposing the
above restrictions nor requiring any vocabulary specific definitions.

Regards,

Patrick
