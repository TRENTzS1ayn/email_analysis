Do you mean that the distinction must be based on URI inspection? (I hope
not).

My proposal was that there would be a distinction in the graph syntax. In
NTriples, unasserted statements are either prefixed with a special character
or terminated differently from asserted statements.

As to what you wish to use in the MT notation, feel free to do as you
think best.

I don't see how anything I proposed depends on entailment. Can you clarify?

No it *isn't*. Namespaces do not exist in the graph and URIs are opaque.

If you are talking now about graph syntax, then namespaces simply
do not exist.

I've already proposed some. Perhaps you can clarify why they are not
suitable.

Cheers,

Patrick
