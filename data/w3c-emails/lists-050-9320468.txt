No. The connection is between an RDF graph and vocabulary terms
which are denoted by URIs. The fact that a set of terms are grouped
together in a functional collection, and for editorial convenience
that collection is given the same XML namespace prefix in the RDF/XML
serialization is *irrelevant*.

We could just as easily give every single RDF and RDFS term a different
XML namespace prefix, and the connections between those terms and
their semantics in the graph would be the same (it would just make
RDF/XML a bit harder to write).

But what is the formal connection between a term and that collection
of terms? Where in the graph do we see that relation? Where is
that collection explicitly denoted in the graph as produced by
*every* conformant RDF parser?

You seem to be missing some pieces to your puzzle, Pat.

Yes, the W3C defines a functional vocabulary called RDF, and
another called RDFS, and yes, the terms of those vocabularies
are grounded in the same XML namespace for each vocabulary,
and yes, the namespace URI is taken to denote those functional
vocabularies, *BUT* in the graph itself, there is *no* explicit
representation of the relationship between term and vocabulary
which is accessible to any RDF application.

Show me where I'm wrong.

(and no fair peeking into URIs either, those are opaque, no?)

That's *my* proposal.

You've misunderstood me. I have no problems with a set of URIs having
a single owner. See comments above.
