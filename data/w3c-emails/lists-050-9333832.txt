*YES* by all means, call it a vocabulary. Let's please restrict use
of the term 'namespace' to an XML Namespace, which is strictly
punctuation for XML applications interpreting qnames in a global
scope.

Though, even if you called it a pumpkin, there is *still* no
explicit relation between a term's URI and any such vocabulary
in the RDF graph which could serve as the basis for differentiating
between asserted and unasserted triples.

Cheers,

Patrick
