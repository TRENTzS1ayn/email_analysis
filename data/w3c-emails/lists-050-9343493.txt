I thought the MT already provided for such a distiction.

I never proposed contexts.

Because you *CANNOT* know for sure what namespace URI was used
to generate some term URI by inspecting the term URI. That information
is iretrievably discarded during parsing.

Get over it folks. It can't be done. Let's please move on and
consider other, actually possible mechanisms. OK?

If that's what you want to do, then simply re-introduce
rdfs:aboutEachPrefix but having as its scope the graph rather
than an RDF/XML instance, and allow folks to say

<rdf:Description rdfs:aboutEachPrefix="http://abc.com/blarg/">
   <rdf:type rdf:resource="&rdfs;Unnasserted"/>
</rdf:Description>

and then let the reasoners apply such prefix inspection as
they like on the fly.

But I agree, that's silly. The execution overhead will be huge.

Rather, the graph syntax should have an explicit mechanism
that 'colors' triples as asserted or unasserted, and implementations
can then generically and efficiently separate the two.

Doing things by URI inspection will be IMO prohibitively
expensive.
