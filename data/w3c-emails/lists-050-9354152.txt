This is why the original RDF Schema WG provided the rdfs:isDefinedBy relation.

For apps that care, it provides a common name for indicating that relationship.

Sure, it doesn't force parsers to emit this information, schema authors to
assert it, or database administrators to keep it lying around if they
think it is using up too much disk space.

But that's why we created it. That's all it was intended to do.

rdfs:isDefinedBy was a bad name. We'll live. Let's please move on...
