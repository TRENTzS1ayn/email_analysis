Perhaps, since the central motivation for this property is to
associate a term with a schema, and we already have rdfs:seeAlso,
maybe we could just remove/deprecate rdfs:isDefinedBy and
create a new property rdfs:schema which takes rdfs:Schema as
its range?

Also, since a given functional vocabulary can employ multiple namespace
prefixes for its terms, and there is no formal, explicit notion
of an XML Namespace in the RDF graph, I suggest we avoid the use
of the term 'namespace' entirely.

Cheers,

Patrick
