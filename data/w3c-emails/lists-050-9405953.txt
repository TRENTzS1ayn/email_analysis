OK, but I don't see the utility in this, really. If you need to record
the source of a statement, you have reification to do that. So the
use for recording provenance of statements is not motivating to me
for the existence of this property.

And the property doesn't work really if it is meant to tell some
application where to go when it encounters some unknown term. The
term has no relation to the schema without the rdfs:isDefinedBy
statement, yet that statement is likely going to be in the schema
itself, so there's a catch-22 situation. Either the application
has knowledge about the term or it doesn't. If it does, it probably
doesn't need to go and get any schema. If it doesn't, then it
won't know where to get the schema. So what's the point.

If folks find it useful, fine. I just want to be sure that its
definition (sorry Pat) does not further exacerbate the whole
"what is a namespace" debate by (incorrectly) claiming that
(a) a term relates to only one schema, (b) a vocabulary
is grounded in only one namespace, and (c) namespace URIs
must be URLs that are resolvable to RDF/XML instances. All
of which I strongly disagree with.

> rdfs:isDefinedBy was a bad name. We'll live. Let's please move on...

Fair enough. Thus my recommendations to just use rdfs:schema to
point specifically to an RDF/XML instance, or simply to
make that clarification explicitly with rdfs:Schema.
