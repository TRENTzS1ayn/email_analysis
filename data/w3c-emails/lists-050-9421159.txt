Fair enough, and I should make it clear that Peter was very open that his 
motivation derived from a stylistic concern that axiomatic representations 
of semantics are more error prone.

Just so.

which?

references - with particular emphasis on specific ways it will be useful?

I've got a sense that people in the WG are supportive of this, but I'm 
concerned that its supporters in their enthusiasm for it are being a little 
over zealous in their claims.

I want to take the sense of the WG on this, but I would like the WG to know 
that I have procedural concerns:

   o this is being rushed - and the need for speed is not clear to me.  I 
believe that many of the issues of M&S arose from changes made late in the 
process

   o it is being put together by only a subset of the community interested 
in this area which does not provide an adequate basis for consensus.

     I suppose I might as well be open about one of my worries here.  If a 
subset of the logicians go one way in RDFCore, and a different subset go a 
different way in webont then we will be left with a war between the WG's.

     I still think that the right way to do this is to lock all the 
logicians in a room without a lavatory with all the beer they can drink 
until they agree on a solution and advise both WG's accordingly.

   o the non-normative status of the proposed new document means that 
webont can't build a normative spec on it and that does not seem good 
enough to resolve the issue that is the motivation for doing this.

I would like to hear the WG's thoughts on:

   o to address this problem the solution must be normative; W3C notes and 
non-normative appendices don't hack it.

   o the consensus process must be open to all with a stake in the issue
