Agenda for RDFCore WG Telecon 2002-06-14

Time:
10:00:00 Fri Jun 14 2002 in America/New York

which is equivalent to
15:00:00 Fri Jun 14 2002 in Europe/London

Phone: +1-617-761-6200 (Zakim)#7332
irc: irc.w3.org #rdfcore

Please note: For tomorrows call, I'd like to try something slightly
different and focus primarily on Agenda Item #10 (isDefinedBy) in the
hope of using this call to close an open issue. 

If no one else is willing (and i'm happy to have someone volunteer here)
I'll try and summarize a proposal of what has been discussed on this
issue by tomorrows call in order to expedite discussions.

If it does not look like we will come to consensus on this issue in a
timely manner I'll continue with the rest of the agenda, but i believe
we can do this issue via telecon and would not like to take up precious
f2f time if we can avoid it.

Please be prepared to discuss this issue.
