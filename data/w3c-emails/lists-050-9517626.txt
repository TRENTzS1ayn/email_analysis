This looks like it meets the goals of WebOnt/OWL in that:

1) No intrusive changes to the RDF syntax
2) It would enable WebOnt to use certain RDF triples as syntax for which the
OWL MT might itself give meaning as far as OWL itself is concerned.
3) My assumption is that WebOnt/OWL would be given license to decide which
triples it were to employ as 'reserved' -- as long as these decisions were
documented in the OWL specifications -- and that such decisions would not
interfere with RDF, nor would RDF need concern itself with such OWL details.

This looks like it meets the goals of RDFCore WG in that:

1) no changes to RDF syntax
2) minimal changes to RDF MT

Under the circumstances, particularly given the tight schedule RDFCore is
on, this is a good option and leaves room for future specifications (e.g.
RDF 2, DAML-S, DAML-R) to define their own MTs, as needed, in a coherent
fashion. Ultimately I would like the issue of context/color dealt with in a
proper fashion e.g.perhaps
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2002May/0123.html

These sorts of issues underscore the importance of something like Lbase in
providing a mechanism to coordinate various specifications and their
corresponding model theories which define the various semantic web
languages. I appreciate that issuing a WD corresponding to Lbase may be
outside the current RDFCore WG charter but perhaps the RDF MT could be
aligned, as you have suggested, with Lbase and Lbase itself taken up by
either WebOnt or some more general SemWeb activity as is viewed appropriate.
I could make an argument that this need for coordination, and hence Lbase
itself, has grown out of the issues raised during the OWL/RDF layering
discussions and hence within the WebOnt charter but in any case it is
important work and deserves a good home. Under the circumstances, seeing as
how all the RDFCore folks have already been working overtime, as long as
this gives WebOnt license to get on with OWL, we ought thank you and let you
wrap your own work ASAP.
