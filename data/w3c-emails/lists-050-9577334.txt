The broad thrust looks good to me.  I have a couple of comments - one nit 
and one more substantive.

Nit:  add "(other than that any such triples not having any affect on the 
truth or entailments of a graph)" or something like that.

My more substantive comment:  some folks are going to have to implement 
this stuff, and the above statement doesn't really help them.  Therefore, I 
think the spec should state up-front the form of URIs that won't be 
asserted.  To alleviate the issues of URI-inspection, I think we could 
limit the form to something like:

     http://www.w3.org/2002/06-rdf-unasserted#<foo>

where values of <foo> must be documented in W3C recommendation track 
documents.  Effectively, this designates a single URI for dark triples, for 
which there will be a single associated schema document listing the URIrefs 
whose use suspends statement-assertion.

Death to weasles!
