Second, would somebody please show how this helps with layering?

i.e. show how it relates to the example in...

# Layering OWL on RDF: the case for unasserted triples
Jonathan Borden (Thu, May 30 2002)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002May/0145.html

and/or the 5 "Indicative Statements and Inferences" in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002May/att-0022/01-_all.htm

?

I remain unconvinced of the utility, let alone necessity,
of unasserted triples in any form.
