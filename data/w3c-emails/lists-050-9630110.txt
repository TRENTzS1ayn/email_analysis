Wonderful job. Only one tiny addition needed, and that hasn't been

Good point, but its important to note that this isnt being suggested 
as a final solution to all the worlds layering problems. There are 
still sensitive issues about how to map different languages into 
Lbase in ways that are mutually consistent, for example. But what it 
does do is provide a much more 'open' and semi-machine-checkable 
framework in which to do the work, as it were. Layering still is 
going to have to be done by craftsmen, but this is a better workshop 
(more light, some machine tools :-).

Second, although we are indeed rushing at the last minute to get this 
at least referred to by the RDF draft REC, for essentially political 
reasons, the ideas aren't rushed or last-minute. In fact, to fess up 
completely, none of my friends will be surprised to know that I, for 
one, have been thinking in these terms from day one, but I didn't 
express it that way because, well, I didn't thing the world was ready 
for it yet.

I honestly do not know, but I bet it can be got around by careful 
choice of wording.

Indeed. I would be quite happy for the RDF MT to be the normative 
document, if that is considered an issue.

We havn't pitched it to Webont because that didn't seem so urgent, 
and there are only 30 hours in the day. But I don't expect to find 
serious opposition to the basic idea. In many ways it is similar in 
spirit to the 'axiomatic semantics' done for DAML, and that is more 
popular than the DAML MT. There may be some niggling over the 
details, of course.
