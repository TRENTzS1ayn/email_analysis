Perhaps I didn't make my rhetorical point clear enough. I don't think 
it has any meaning. What I would like to say about "isDefinedBy" is 
something like "this is completely meaningless, but if it makes you 
feel good, you can use it to point to something."  Which, of course, 
would make one wonder just why we even have "isDefinedBy" in the 
language at all. Yes, exactly.

I'm willing to be disabused. If someone in the WG thinks it does mean 
something, then by all means explain what that is, preferably with a 
test case involving an entailment. But saying, in essence, " 
'isDefinedBy' means is defined by" , doesn't actually tell the reader 
(or me) anything.
