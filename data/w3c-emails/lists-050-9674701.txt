The discussion after-hours seemed to be less concerned with
model-theoretic semantics (which don't deal with this at all, and
rightly so) but with application-level and process-level use cases:
namely, building RDF "management" applications for dealing with
sets of schema elements (or "vocabularies", I think the term was used).

Danbri says, for a term (property, class, etc) there is someone who
"owns" or produced the definition for it, so he wants this to act as a
pointer to something that gives a handle onto that.

There may also be machine-processable uses where the thing on the sharp
end of iDB is dereferenced to pull back schema element definitions.

These seem to be two loosely-related notions, both of which have
a plausible application-level story.

(A more complex use case to do with schema and subschema
management where different properties of schema elements are managed in
different places was raised in the after-hours talk but I'll leave that
to the person who raised it to elaborate.)

Basically, as you might expect from a loaded term like "defined", people
still seem to have a few notions as to what it means - most of which are
at the application level, not at the level of individual triples or the
MT.
