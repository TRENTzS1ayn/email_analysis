Brian,

  I didn't know about W3C process included a provision for providing 
beer to logicians ;-)

  I agree that we should proceed slowly and cautiously. All I am 
requesting is that we not hurry to push the spec out when substantial 
issues of layering are still unanswered. I am sure that there is 
consensus that layering is important.  In particular, there are two issues.

  a) avoiding paradoxes in the description logic model theory that owl 
is proposing to use.
  b) specifying the semantics of what I call "mixed graphs", i.e., 
graphs that use constructs from RDF *and* owl. We may have a MT for OWL 
and an MT for RDF, but that does not give us an MT for owl+rdf.

 A solution for (a) does not provide a solution for (b), though a 
solution for (b) is likely to provide a solution for (a).

  I understand that there are process related guidelines (though I don't 
understand their nuances). I would however like to see a consistent and 
perchance even usable framework for the semantic web as a whole (i.e., 
not just rdf), which I am not sure I see right now.
