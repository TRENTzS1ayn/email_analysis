WebOnt does, yes. But RDF's model theory doesn't have negation
at all... but... hmm... I suppose it does say that every
triple (and every graph) is either true or false in
every interpretation. Hmmm... I wish you hadn't pointed
that out; I wasn't worried about it before now. ;-)

I don't see how W3C process is relevant. This seems like
a technical issue; either I can convince folks of my
technical position or I cannot.

The odds seem pretty low, as you say,
and since it's not directly
relevant for RDF 1.0, I doubt I'll even try.
