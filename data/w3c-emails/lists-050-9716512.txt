Why does there have to be one?

It isn't. I don't WANT this connection to be in the graph. If it 
were, then putting it there or not putting it there would be an 
option;  and as soon as it is an option, someone is going to change 
it in a graph somewhere, and then things go nonmonotonic.

Fine. That is all we need.

You aren't wrong, but it doesn't matter. I don't want this to be 
represented in the graph. It should be *impossible* to infer, in RDF, 
that some uriref is reserved.

>(and no fair peeking into URIs either, those are opaque, no?)

They are referentially opaque, but if Im a software agent I can 
certainly look at them. They are just character strings, after all. 
And I can check whether or not they are in some list I might have of 
reserved character strings. That list, of course, came from God: I 
was born with it inside me. My creator just knew about those strings. 
I guess he had read some W3C spec or other.

OK, I vote against that for the reasons outlined in the message that 
Guha and I sent about nonmonotonicity.

OK, then, that is all we need to make this work. Only the W3C has the 
authority to reserve a vocabulary that the W3C owns.
