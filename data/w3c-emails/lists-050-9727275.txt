I meant, complexity in the syntax documents, Ntriples and so on. This 
whole discussion is trivial form a purely MT point of view.

Look, we must be in a disconnect here. Are you saying that when some 
software reads some RDF, that it cannot possibly tell that

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type

is the symbol 'type' on the normative W3C website? You sure seem to 
be saying that. I bow to your expertise, but it seems to me that if 
this is true, then we are in much deeper doo-doo than anything to do 
with dark triples.

No, it MUST NOT have such a mechanism. Any such mechanism in the 
graph is inherently non-monotonic. This whole idea is a dead horse.
