The example in the referenced document uses additional statements:

   owl:List rdf:type rdf:Unasserted .
   owl:first rdf:type rdf:Unasserted .
   owl:rest rdf:type rdf:Unasserted .
   owl:nil rdf:type rdf:Unasserted .

but Guha has explained that that approach is non-monotonic.

The revised proposal simply defines triples using certain URIs to be 
unasserted, regardless of any other triples that may appear in the graph, 
so there's no question that adding a new triple makes a truth out of a 
falsehood.

Referring to my suggestion, the properties used above as owl:List, 
owl:first, owl:rest, owl:nil would be given URIs of the form:

   http://www.w3.org/2002/06-rdf-unasserted#List
   http://www.w3.org/2002/06-rdf-unasserted#first
   http://www.w3.org/2002/06-rdf-unasserted#rest
   http://www.w3.org/2002/06-rdf-unasserted#nil

Actually, I don't think List and nil need to be given this unasserted 
treatment.

Indeed, in the case of nil, I think it may be a serious error, because 
there would be no meaning associated with statements like:

   ex:someResource ex:someListValuedProperty unasserted:nil .
