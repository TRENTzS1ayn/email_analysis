Unfortunately, I can't think of one. I honestly do not think that 
this whole business means anything at all. If I were writing an RDF 
engine it would simply ignore all 'isDefinedBy' assertions, and in 
fact I would feel entitled to delete them from a graph, on the 
grounds that they have no entailments. They say, literally, nothing.

I would love to be proved wrong. What do you think they mean??

BUt OK, let me try to be more constructive. How about:

<rdfs:comment>
This property indicates a resource which contains information about 
the subject. Often, this property is used to indicate the source of 
the subject uriref, where its owner specifies its intended meaning. 
The subject node of this property can be any uriref, and the value 
may be any document or resource; the usage is not restricted to a 
particular form or schema. In the case that the value is a web 
resource which contains RDF triples, the assertion of 
rdfs:isDefinedBy can be taken as a confirming or assenting to the 
content of those triples, ie an assertion that those triples are 
considered by the author of the document to be definitively true, and 
that any consequences of them together with the triples in the 
current document may be safely assumed.
</rdfs:comment>

Is that more or less what is meant? Ive tried to avoid saying 
'define' and also avoid talking about 'namespaces'.
