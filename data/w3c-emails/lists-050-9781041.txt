I would guess so. I would expect that it would be done the same way 
that the W3C handles the RDF and RDFS vocabulary, by a URL linking to 
a set-in-stone page.

Do you mean how procedurally? Thats up the W3C. I would guess that a 
WG would submit some kind of application to some internal 
secretariat, or something like that. Isnt this kind of stuff all set 
out in the W3C process manual somewhere? For example, we are 
proposing to create an rdfd: namespace, right? Like that.
