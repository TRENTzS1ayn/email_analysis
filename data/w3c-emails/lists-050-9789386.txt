Its not a bodge, more like a hole in the RDF wall that can be used 
later to pass things through. We don't need to decide exactly what is 
going to be passed through, but we do need to make sure there is a 
hole there somewhere.

Seriously, this isn't really a technical solution: its just leaving 
some room in the RDF REC for solutions to be proposed in future 
without re-writing the REC. If we have to get a technical solution 
worked out in detail we will never get done; and in any case it 
really isn't our (ie RDF core WG's job) to work out that much 
technical detail, seems to me. All we need to do is to make sure that 
we give Webont (and others) room to maneuver when *they* work out a 
technical solution.
