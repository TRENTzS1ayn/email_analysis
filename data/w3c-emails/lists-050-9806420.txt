I think that all we have to do is to provide a place where other 
normative solutions can be, as it were, attached. The reserved 
vocabulary idea is intended to be just that.

To be exact, there are two proposals here. One is the Lbase idea 
requiring the new document(s). That in itself is not a technical 
change to the current MT.  The other proposal is to put the 'reserved 
vocabulary' idea into both the Lbase (its already in the draft 
document) *and* into the existing MT. That is a genuine change to the 
MT - its the old 'unasserted triples' idea in a new and I think 
better form - but that is also urgently needed; I think that if we go 
forward without this, or something very similar, we will have a 
Webont layering train wreck.

Maybe it would be best for the WG to focus on this second 'reserved 
vocabulary' point first, as this is what will remove the current 
log-jam which is giving WebOnt so much grief. I think it is fair to 
say that both Peter and Jonathan feel that this device will be enough 
to remove the current immediate problems; that they both approve of 
its use and would prefer having it to not having it; and that, while 
they both would prefer a more radical solution (though not the same 
more radical solution), that such agreement is not likely to be 
obtained for any more ambitious proposal which anyone has so far 
suggested.

I hope not. I mean, we write the documents in English, but we don't 
seem to need to say that English is normative, right? (BTW, the 
proposal does use FOL to write the semantics; Lbase is FOL, in a 
slightly unusual syntax.)

To address your specific worries, I think it would be OK if the Lbase 
stuff were presented simply as another way to describe the (same) 
model theory, rather like an expanded version of section 1.6 of the 
current MT draft. If folk are worried about the equivalence, we could 
say explicitly that in the event of any disparity, the MT document is 
normative. The intent of the Lbase isn't to replace the MT with 
something different, only to provide a more useful way of presenting 
the same content; so if we get something wrong (always a risk when 
working in a rush, I agree) then it's wrong.
