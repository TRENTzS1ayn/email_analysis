Hmm. Actually I meant it to be taken seriously. Suppose an RDF 
inference engine just ignores this issue entirely and draws some 
rdf-valid conclusions from a set of triples which uses a reserved 
vocabulary. If the conclusion itself contains the reserved 
vocabulary, then it is harmless.

There is an issue about the possibility of a conclusion being formed 
by existential generalization, but we can fix that by requiring that 
its the property uriref that determines whether a triple is made 
'invisible'. That is slightly more restrictive, but I think it will 
be enough for all the uses anyone is likely to want to make of this. 
Eg it would cover a list-like container vocabulary.

I would be happy with that, provided that future W3c specs can add 
new <foo>s. At this point this is a W3C procedural issue, not a 
technical one, I guess.
