Yes, it would (provided we say that those strings in literals really 
are xsd:strings: Im not sure if some people might want to argue that 
each datatype defines it sown notion of 'string'.) I just thought we 
could use this without appealing to any external datatypes. Maybe 
this isnt such a great idea, in any case.

I don't quite see how. It would certainly be rather a dangerous thing 
to assert in general, which is why I was only half-serious, but I 
think it would be monotonic. I hope so, anyway. Can you give more 
details? You have me worried.
