I  now agree. I think we should only require that *properties* are 
unasserted. This has a beneficial side-effect in any case regarding 
back-compatibility, since then it anything rdf-entailed by an 
unasserted triple is also unasserted; so that an RDF engine that 
ignores unassertion won't cause any 'harm' to one that pays attention 
to it.
