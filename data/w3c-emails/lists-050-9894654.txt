I'm supposed to land in Bristol airport at 7:10 PM
What should I do to go to the Holiday Inn? take a cab?
So I guess to be in the hotel at around 8 PM.
(but last time in Cannes trainstation I thougt to walk
and after 2 and 1/2 hours I reached the Avenue Charles
de Gaules, but that was in the wrong village; the right
one was 12 km further, and it was already dark ...)
