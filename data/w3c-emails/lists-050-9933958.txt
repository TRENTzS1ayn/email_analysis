OK. If by "RDF vocabulary" we simply mean the list of URIrefs which
denote terms of that vocabulary, and it is simply a list, and the
list itself need not have itself any URIref denotation, then I don't
have any problem with that.

*If* that list of URIrefs does need its own URIref to identify it,
then I simply want to make it brutally clear to users that it need
not correspond to *any* XML Namespace prefix URIref.

The fact that the XML Namespace prefix URIref for the RDF Vocabulary
(list of term URIrefs) is also taken to denote that list of terms
is simply a coincidence, and not based on any quality or constraint
in inherent in XML Namespaces.

That's my point.

I don't see how that introduces nonmonotonicity any more so than
saying that some predicate is "dark". Whether the mechanism is
the predicate URIref being a member of some "dark" vocabulary,
or a vocabulary neutral syntactic marker, both mark the triple
as dark. I don't see the difference.

Sure.
