No, it is *not* acceptable to insist on *any* particular URI scheme.

If we replace 'namespace' with 'vocabulary', then I agree.

The benefit of having distinct functional vocabularies such as
RDF, RDFS, Datatyping, etc. is so that applications can more
accurately and economically define the terms they support.

But whether each of those functional vocabularies employs a
distinct XML Namespace for the RDF/XML serialization is simply
not signficant to the definition and management of those
vocabularies.

Keep in mind that, for XML applications, namespaces are distinct,
and thus provide an explicit denotation for a set of terms.

RDF on the other hand, has no concept of namespaces, and thus
sets of terms corresponding to vocabularies must be defined in
some other manner -- at the moment, simply by prose.

The 1:1 correlation between RDF vocabularies and the XML
namespaces used to serialize them is both misleading and
meaningless.
