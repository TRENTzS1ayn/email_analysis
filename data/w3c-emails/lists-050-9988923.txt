How does an RDF only processor know which URIrefs are reserved, so
that it knows which triples are not asserted?

Would we not need a fully generic mechanism to signal non-assertion?

That seems a bit partisan to me. Are only W3C languages layered
on top of RDF allowed to be used with RDF? I hope not.

Bugger. Then every single SW application that only cares about
RDF assertions has to know *natively* which upper layer language
terms are reserved in order for it to determine the truth asserted
by an RDF graph?! Surely I must have missed something here, since
that is ... er, ahem (I'll be nice and not say out aloud)

If it is not clear to all RDF applications using generic, vocabulary
netural means which triples are or are not asserted, then I oppose
this proposal on the grounds of it being completely impractical
and unscalable for real-world applications.

If I write an RDF application that encounters OWL "reserved"
vocabulary, I *refuse* to be required to intern special knowledge
of that reserved vocabulary in my application, which *never*
uses OWL terms, simply to know to ignore those triples and
not consider them asserted.

The distinction between asserted and unasserted triples must
be syntactic and explicit for *every* triple. It is not even
sufficient to define some class such as rdfs:Reserved and
declare each reserved URIref to be a member of that class, since
there is no guaruntee that a SW agent that recieves a triple
with such a "reserved" URIref will also possess the relevant class
membership knowledge for rdfs:Reserved.
 
So, if Lbase layering and unasserted triples cannot be captured
with a syntactic flag without introducing nonmonotonicity, then
it would appear that layering itself cannot be done monotonically.

Patrick
