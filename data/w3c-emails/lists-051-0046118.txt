Quick comment: its dangerous to simply say that the RDF graph *is* a 
graph, even in brief, as in 2 para 1. I got hauled over the 
mathematical coals for saying this, since technically its not a graph 
as in graph theory, not even a labelled one (graphs can't have more 
than one arc between 2 nodes, and labelled graphs are graphs with 
labels added.)

  If we define an RDF graph to be a set of triples, then the answer is 
no automatically.

Any, no associated namespace (What does 'associated' mean??)

I have no opinion on this one.

Which ought to give you a hint :-)

Id say the latter. The graph certainly can be drawn, described in 
Ntriples, and has a model-theoretic meaning. Also it can be inferred 
from a graph that can be XML serialized.
