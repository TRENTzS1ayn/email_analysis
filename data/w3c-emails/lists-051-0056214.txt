Well, then any assertion made using them as property names will be 
false; but still, its not meaningless, so I think we should allow it. 
There might be some reason for someone to treat a phone number as a 
property; its not totally crazy. In general, I don't think we are in 
a position to say that something definitely does not name a property.
