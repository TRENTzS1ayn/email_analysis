Oh, OK, I buy into that v strongly. In _principle_, any URIref might name
a property. In practice, many do not.

There are ISO object identifiers, for eg., that the digital library
community use to name fields in the Z39.50 bibliographic search and
retrieval protocol. They could easily (dunno if they do) have URIs,
which'd basically be something like iso-obj:<long-number>. Seems
very sensible to map into rdf properties, even if no clear notion of
derference of those URIs gets us an RDF/XML schema...
