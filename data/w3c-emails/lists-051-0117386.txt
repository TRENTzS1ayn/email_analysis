Folks,

We need to get some of the outstanding test cases reviewed.  Please can you 
take a look at

   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/allTestCases.html

pick you favourite unreviewed tests and volunteer to review them, 
preferably by Friday.

Jan: is there a difference between PENDING and UNAPPROVED?

Brian
