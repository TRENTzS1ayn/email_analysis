I have reviewed rdfms-xmllang/test001-test005 and believe they are 
correct. However I am unsure about test006 -- I'd have to do some more 
careful spec reading to be sure. The W3C Validator (ARP) and CARA 
disagree, although the former may simply have not been updated to 
support language codes.

DaveB, could you make two more test cases like test006, but with 
parseType-and-xml:lang and just parseType? I think these would be useful.
