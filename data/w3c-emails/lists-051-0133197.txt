I think that it should say that the predicate determines the meaning of any
statement.

It should specify in the specific case of predicate rdf:type that the
definition of rdf:type is that the object determines the meaning of the
statement.

It should then hand off to the URI spec to say that "determines" above means
that those publishing issuing or owning terms are the ones who definitively
define (through specs etc) what they mean.  Issues of
ownership, and dereference are covered not in the RDF spec but
directly or indirectly in the URI spec.

*** The role of the RDF spec is to state what an RDF document means. ***

The role of SMTP spec to say that a message delivered under certain
circumstances is
a message from one party to another.

In other words, other protocols deal with the question of who is asserting
what.
Typically these things are complex and recursive, but the common point of
reference is the meaning of a document.

They are right, RDF Core cannot determine the punishment to meted out to
an individual who makes a false statement in  given case and
a given jurisdiction. However, it is vital that RDFCore explain concisely
and
unequivocally the algorithm for  determining the meaning of an RDF document,
so that legal folks have a sound base for their own arguments, but no
basis for wriggling out between the specs.

Note that RDF specs are referred to by XML specs (via the namespace)
which are referred to by the MIME registry which is referred to by the HTTP
spec which is referred to by the TCP port registry, which is referred to
by the TCP spec, which you effectively agree to when you get an IP
connection.
So there is a well accepted and important chain of delegation, in which
RDF plays a role of one link.

(See my www2002 keynote)

Yes. By delegating to the specification of the Properties and Classes
used as predicate and (in the case of rdf:type predicate) object.

The chain would be  that I mentioned above showing that the
definitions of foo:Liar and foo:email define the meaning of the document.

To then show an HTTP response from server for foo, which has
been, though established social procedures and technical specs of DNS been
demonstrably
delegated the ability to publish information by the owner of the foo.
That response could contain information in a suitable language which
indicated that
foo:Liar was a class of people who were liars, and that foo:email was
an emailmox which a person used, then the chain would be complete
about the meaning of the document.

There is a simple step to show that no one else has your mailbox.

Now suppose that document were published by sending it to
a public email list.  There is an indisputable body of history which
accepts that such a message is considered a public assertion by the sender.
So you could sue.   You couldn't if the document were sent in an attachment
as attachments break the chain, unless there is a something in the cover
note
(e.g. "I agree with the enclosed") to connect the chain of assertion.

It is arguable what happens if it is published
on a website.  Normally it is clear (for example though links from someone's
home page) which documents published are deemed to be asserted, and which
are archive copies of other people's things, for example.  In other cases,
there is explicit link from elsewhere -- such as a chumping in IRC which
agrees with the doc.

No.  I would not want the above to be dependent on the Model Theory at all,
but asserted in the RDF spec.

The model theory does not as far as I know have such a spec hand-off, which
is essential to the meaning of RDF.  It only considers things you can know
by only taking into account the RDF spec, and so, while it gives a mapping
of RDF into set theory, it does not as far as I could see explain what an
RDF document means.  (Maybe I am wrong and I missed it).

So RDF for those claims relies on other specs which invoke RDF.
The RDF Core group should just define the meaning of an RDF document.

I think reference to the other specifications which invoke RDF is more
useful here.
It is *NOT* a good idea to give the slightest indication that you leave to
the courts
any discussion of the connections between IP, TCP, SMTP, MIME, XML and RDF
specs.
