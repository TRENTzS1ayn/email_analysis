Jeremy has noted a couple of times that the validator needs updating
to match more recent RDF Core decisions.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  test005/test006 tests
property attributes without/with xml:lang.  parseType can't be used
in that situation.

test001 and test002 are the parseType without/with xml:lang for
property elements.
