OK, I guess. Suppose P is associated with one namespace in one graph 
and a different one in another graph, what happens if we merge the 
two graphs?

They do? Doesn't the xmlns:  just specify a prefix to be used in 
interpreting the foo: notation in the document? Surely there isn't 
any implication that http://example.org/ba  means anything at all by 
itself, is there (??)

I agree.

I like this.
