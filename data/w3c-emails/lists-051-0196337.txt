This pretty much works for me (I have a different
preferences w.r.t. one of your points of attention below...).
i.e. I'd like to use this
to dispatch

ACTION 2002-05-24#2 (danc) to write up a proposal for incorporating
        daml:collection into RDF

as well.

Umm... syntax editors, does this tell you what you would need
in order to make the edits?

That seems to introduce a dependency from RDF syntax to RDF schema.
I'd rather not do that.

A new namespace would be the cleanest option, but I think on
balance, if we're going to change the syntax, we might as
well use this namespace for first/rest/nil/List.

  http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

I'm also uneasy about leaving the semantics of first/rest
'incomplete' at the RDF level; i.e. allowing layered
specs to constrain their extents further. I think I can live with
it, but I'd feel better if I had a more clear picture
of the rdfms-assertion and MIME type issues.

works for me.

of course, you can use any typednode, right?
