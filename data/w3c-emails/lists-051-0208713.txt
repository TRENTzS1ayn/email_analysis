? What does that mean? (I can only interpret it as something that is 
obviously false, so I must be misunderstanding it.)

It cannot say that, because that is either false or meaningless. 
Rdf:type simply asserts that something is in a class; it does not 
define "meaning" (either of the term denoting the object or the 
expression denoting the class) and it doesn't really "determine" 
anything, since at best it can only be said to *constrain* possible 
meanings, rather than uniquely determine a meaning.

But that is impossible in RDF, since the full 'meaning' of a term 
depends on the total graph of which it is a part, and this may have 
been assembled from a variety of sources. So these sources all 
contribute to the 'meaning' of the term; it cannot be said to derive 
solely from any one of them.

What the RDF spec says is that the meaning of an RDF graph is 
expressed by the RDF model theory, and what that means is, roughly, 
that the meaning of an RDF graph is expressed as a constraint on the 
world being described, that it must make the graph true. Each 
document defines a graph.

If you have something more in mind by 'state what an RDF document 
means', then please tell us what it is. If by 'meaning' you mean 
something like a single unique meaning that can be determined 
computationally, then it is impossible for any spec to provide it. 
That is not a reasonable expectation for any formal specification.

I really think it would be more useful if you didn't take this line, 
as it doesn't lead anywhere. There is no such thing as THE meaning of 
a document, particularly of a document in a formal language. There 
are several precisely defined variations on 'meaning' that you could 
use: for example, we can say what it means to draw a valid conclusion 
from a document, or what it means for two documents to be consistent 
with each other, or what it would mean for a document to be true; but 
we cannot say what a document 'really means'.

?? What algorithm for determining meaning? (Do you mean, algorithm 
for checking validity of inference? We can do that.)

Until you get to RDF, this is all to do with computable operations 
over computable domains, so has well-defined notions of meaning based 
on fixed-point semantics. RDF is where it starts talking about the 
wider world outside the recursive universe of computational 
processes, and that is where 'meaning' suddenly gets far more 
difficult to pin down. The universe as a whole does not satisfy the 
second recursion theorem.

But there are no definitions in RDF. So this can only mean, at best, 
that there are some RDF assertions (in a graph somewhere) which are 
sufficient to constrain the possible interpretations to those worlds 
in which Brian is, in fact, a liar. And that in turn requires that 
the concept of 'liar' is somehow expressible in RDF, which is a 
pretty ambitious claim to make. Suppose Brian sued me and I said in 
response that the term 'foo:Liar' was not intended to express the 
derogatory English meaning of the English word "liar", and challenge 
him in response to show how any conclusion that would be harmful to 
him could be derived as an RDF-valid entailment from my RDF graph. 
Would that be a reasonable defense, in your view? I would find it 
convincing, myself.

What does 'suitable language' mean? Does it have to be suitable for 
use by RDF reasoning agents?

Indicated to what/who? To a human reader, or to a software agent? 
(Does the software agent only know RDF, or does it also know DAML or 
OWL?)

Yes, but you would be suing because it was a public assertion *in 
English* to *human readers*, which has got nothing at all to do with 
RDF. The same slander case would probably work if RDF wasn't involved 
anywhere, and you just had the character string 'Brian McBride est un 
fichu menteur' on the web page. (Notice the use of quotation in the 
previous sentence to mention, rather than use, a character string.)

Sure, but here you are talking about human assertions, right? That 
is, assertions made in the context of human society and human 
discourse, using human language. RDF isn't a human language; it's a 
new kind of thing: a formalism for use by software agents which is 
also public in a human world. I wonder if the courts are ready for 
this; I suspect they will have to deal with a whole new set of issues 
that have never arisen before.

But the spec says that the model theory defines meanings. That is 
what an MT is *for*, to define meanings.

That isn't right. It doesn't map RDF into set theory or indeed into 
anything else. It gives a mathematical account of the *relationship* 
between RDF and possible ways the world could be. It uses set theory 
to describe the world in mathematical terms, because its a 
mathematical theory; but it treats RDF simply as RDF.

Without a model theory (or some kind of semantics) it doesn't mean 
anything. As far as I can see, this is the ONLY way that one could 
explain what it means.

Sure, because these are all technical matters than can be determined 
by computers. But there is a final step, between RDF and the *actual* 
world that it is supposed to be talking about, that is suddenly not 
computable, and ultimately will, I suspect, have to be determined 
socially; that is, by the courts, in the final analysis.
