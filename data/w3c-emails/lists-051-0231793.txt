I basically agree with Brian's comments.

I'll also add a further comment:  even if M&S says a property must be 
associated with a namespace, it's not clear what that actually means.  My 
understanding is that the model theory binds the relational extension of a 
property to the URI, irrespective of any namespace it may be "associated" 
with.  Also, the abstract graph has URIrefs, without any associated 
namespaces.  So the two graphs you offer, under current RDF rules, I think 
must be considered abstract-syntactically and semantically equivalent.

I am also tending to a view that a '#'-separator should be preferred, and 
possibly even inserted automatically when forming a URIref from 
URI-without-trailing-separator + fragment (Jonathan Borden's 
suggestion?).  See some recent comments of mine on www-talk [1], which also 
link some off-list exchanges between myself and Pat Hayes [2].
