Pat,

Again, I'm seeing this "formalism vs implementation" thing throwing up 
dust.  I think I have an inkling of what Tim is suggesting, and I don't 
think it contradicts the formalization of RDF.  I don't know if I have the 
clarity of vision or command of language to explain this, but I'll give it 
a shot.

In one sense, the RDF model theory (MT) doesn't actually tell us what any 
bit of RDF means:  that's handed off to a separate set of definitions - an 
Interpretation - and (in general) many interpretations are possible for any 
given piece of RDF.  Rather, the MT says something about the range of 
possible interpretations (possible worlds) corresponding to a given piece 
of asserted RDF.  The model theory also gives us a well-founded notion of 
entailment, which in turn underpins some valid rules of 
inference.  Further, as you have shown with the RDFS-entailment, if one 
restricts the form of interpretation considered then a greater number of 
inference rules can be supported.

I think that Tim is referring to the use of external (i.e. 
extra-RDF-formal-system) definitions of intended interpretations, and 
putting in place some (non-RDF-formalized) framework for establishing the 
actual interpretations to be used in some assertion of RDF.  So when I 
publish RDF that offers a service for $100, you can't claim that I really 
offered it for 100 cents because some different interpretation was in 
effect.  And intuitively it seems to me that under some constrained 
interpretations additional inferences can be drawn;  e.g. an interpretation 
that constrains the terms "dollar" and "quarter" to be the monetary amounts 
familiar to most Americans would be able to infer that 4 quarters are OK 
for settling a dollar debt.  This can't be formalized in RDF, but I think I 
think the consequent relations can be taken as axioms under interpretations 
that are suitably constrained.

I think these mechanisms for defining or constraining interpretations 
clearly lie outside the scope of the formal RDF semantics, but that they 
are still important.  I suspect we're never going to be able to formalize 
everything about RDF usage, so we need to be thinking about how to make the 
formal and informal aspects play together.

(There's some other stuff in Tim's work, such as the inference mechanisms 
in cwm, which don't seem to be handled within the RDF formalization we have 
so far.  I don't see that as a major problem, provided that it is clear 
which parts of some expression can be treated according to RDF semantics, 
and which can't.  Which I think echoes your thoughts about "dark triples" 
or similar mechanisms.  But I think that's another discussion.)
