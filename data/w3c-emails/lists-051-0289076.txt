Interestingly, both Brian and Pat are correct.

In the XML interpretation, we clearly have two different elements:

   qname:(http://example.org/b)ar
   qname:(http://example.org/ba)r

(c.f. http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pstickler-qname-01.txt)

which any XML processor would treat as distinctly different and which
could have radically different semantics and interpretation.

Yet, given the fact that RDF parsing throws away the boundary between
namespace and local name (as well as the context distinction between
element, element/attribute, and global/attribute), we end up with only
one URI in the RDF graph:

   "http://example.org/bar"

And hence, insofar as the RDF interpretation is concerned, the meaning
of the two distinct elements in the XML serializations are the same.

This was hashed out ad nauseum nearly a year ago on rdf-interest,
with myself as a major source of the noise, and the conclusion
was "tough, that's the way RDF works, it's up to the owner of
"http://example.org/" to make sure such crap doesn't happen".

If you have the stomach for it, c.f.
