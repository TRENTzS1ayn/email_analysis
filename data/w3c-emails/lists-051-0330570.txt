Sure. As a best practice, we should certainly recommend that
namespace URIs used with predicates end in some non-name
punctuation, so that later we can more consistently guess the
"correct" qname partitioning when re-serializing to XML.

It's just not likely that we could ever come up with a truly
generic and workable algorithm for introducing such punctuation
at the partition between namespace and name automatically.

I.e, let's document the issue, and tell folks (as Brian
proposed) use '/' or "#" at the end of the namespace, but be
clear that insofar as the RDF graph is concerned, namespaces
and qnames simply don't exist and have no representation,
significance or meaning. It's strictly an XML thing.

Cheers,

Patrick
