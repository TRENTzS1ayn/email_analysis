OK, I've been through all the outstanding cases - my comments are 
below.   I don't think that any are wrong, but I've raised comments in some 
cases.


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.nt
-- I agree with the UTF-8 mapping &#xFC; --> %C3%BC
-- Does agreement on this transform depend on current IRI debates (I've 
lost track)?  If we are agreed to have all URIs in the graph use just 
URI-character-sequences then I think this is right.

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-uri-substructure/test001.nt
-- Looks OK to me, but I'm not sure what it's meant to demonstrate.


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test001.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test001.nt
-- Did we agree xml"foo" as the form for XML literals in N-triples?  If so, 
it looks OK to me.


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test002.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test002.nt

-- Looks OK to me.


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test006.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xmllang/test006.nt
-- Interesting case (i.e. good test case!):  does xml:lang apply to 
attributes of the element to which it is applied?  XML says yes, but that 
means that the language applies to multiple RDF properties specified as 
attributes.  I think that's all OK.


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-abouteach/error001.rdf
-- I agree with this (rdf:aboutEach is now an error).  Does the group?


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-abouteach/error002.rdf
-- ditto


http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-parseType/error001.rdf

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-uri-substructure/error001.nt

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-duplicate-member-props/test001.nt
-- Hmmm... I agree that it should be allowed as legal RDF, but is there a

it matter?

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test003.nt

(Should there be additional test cases with multiple consecutive whitespace 
and leading/trailing whitespace with and without the xml:space='preserve' 
attribute?)
