I have been actioned by WebOnt WG to send this to RDFCore WG as a statement
of a problem we have been having, with two possible solutions which involve
unasserted triples.

This document, just approved by the WebOnt WG, is a summary of the lengthy
layering issue.

Layering OWL on RDF with unasserted triples.
