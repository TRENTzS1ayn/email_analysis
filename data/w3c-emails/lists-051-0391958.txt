Thank you Jonathan.  I'm sure that preparing this has been a demanding task.

For clarity, please could you tell us:

   o whether webont is considering any other solutions to this problem, i.e
     has webont resolved that some form of dark triples is the only acceptable
     solution

   o what is webont asking of rdfcore?

I will allocate time at rdfcore's next telecon to consider this.

Brian
