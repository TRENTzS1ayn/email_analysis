Yes. This is different from the algorithms we use for (for example) the 
meaning of "vegetable" in common parlance.

However, there are some similar cases.  Some terms, such as
line 31 on the US Internal Revenue Service's 2002 1040 form,
have a well-defined authority.
If you want an answer to the semantics of that field, you ask them
because they own the term, they created it.
The same applies to the Michelin star rating on a restaurant,
except you refer to Michelin  rather than the IRS.

The ability of a body to create such terms is very important in fact.
