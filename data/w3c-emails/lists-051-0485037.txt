Thank you.

Suppose a document in RDF parses to the following statements:

_:b dc:title "Moby Dick".
   _:b dc:creator  _:c .
   _:c  contact:email <mailto:phayes@ai.uwf.edu>.

People actually write documents which parse to statements like that.  
Libraries work only because people accept that such things have meaning.

These statements are taken to mean that you are creator of something 
called "Moby Dick".  Leaving aside niggling over details, time, etc, you 
have to go along with that.
If you are, they are true; if you are not they are false.

If, for example, I accept the assertions of a library card to this 
effect, then to be simple I now know you wrote such a thing.  To be 
complicated about it, the possible worlds which I can  consider this 
world as being among have been constrained to those in which you did 
write such a thing. (I am sure one could be much more complicated - but 
that is not the object of the exercise!))

Now Peter's RDF engine will of course not know this, as you can't 
describe creatorship in RDF from scratch, and he's  not prepared as 
calling peter:RDF anything which involves inference using anything other 
than the RDF spec. Which is limiting, and not what RDF is for. Peter's 
interest in the set of inferences you can make from a statement is of 
course useful, but saying that there is only one set is not. In fact, 
they hard fact of life on the web is that you learn stuff, and some 
people know more than others, and some machines have greater 
capabilities than others.


Let me show you what I mean in another way-- in the negative -- what I 
want to exclude.
Above, dc:creator is the predicate.  It is defined, (say) by the dublin 
core
that the meaning of a statement x dc:creator y is that x wrote, painted 
or
otherwise created a work y.

Now suppose I define the resource  w3c:tim  in a namespace I control, as
follows:
1. w3c:tim is a person, with email address <mailto:timbl@w3.org>
2. w3c:tim is defined such that any statement of the form  w3c:tim 
dc:creator :y  means that Pat Hayes should immediately send me a crate 
of claret.

This would mean that anyone who uses the dublin core vocabulary to 
describe me would end up, by my definition of the term which I have 
introduced, stating that you should send me some wine.

What's the problem?   Informally, it violates the actual practical way 
RDF works, and in fact english too.  The verb defines the meaning of the 
sentence.   In fact, a huge amount of what we do we use rules which 
select on the predicate, and the idea that there be some subject or 
object out there which feels it can override the meaning of the 
predicate would cause everything to fall down.

Now most of the meanings of Properties ar currently defined in english. 
The exceptions may become a formal derivation of numbers, but I don't 
think even then that will be used in practice.

In a level where you are not looking at what information comes from 
where (you have no quotation) and the only rules are the ones from a 
fixed set of specs, this of course does not apply as you are not 
actually saying anything about the real world or using any real world 
classes or properties.  And then when you slip into using RDF to talk 
about the real world, you are so used to looking to the predicate of a 
triple for meaning that you don't even realize you are doing it.  But we 
do have to formalize it so that it is possible on the sweb for someone 
to introduce a term and define it.  Even though the logic doesn't have 
separate language for "is defined to be".

The way I am using "meaning" here, neither of these have it. Only 
formulae have meaning (or, loosely, documents which parse to formulae).

Saying that the meaning of the graph is expressed by the MT does not 
help me. Not when the document parsed to form  the graph is a check 
(cheque) and the bank says it doesn't mean anything.

In the long term, bits of MT will no doubt be added which relate a check 
to other terms in useful ways, but we have to start (and end) with 
english definitions of key things.

Yes, you cannot determine or express the meaning of dc:author 
computationally unless you just link it to other terms which are just as 
impossible.

(Speak for your own documents! ;-)

It is curious that above you ask me, "? What does that mean?"  of a 
document I wrote.  It looks as though you would like there to be a 
meaning.

RDF is not just a formal language.  It has ground terms which are 
grounded in english (etc) prose which relate to the real world. That is 
how it works.  That doesn't invalidate the logical operations.

I want to say what a document means.
You say I can say what it means for a document to be true.
I think that would be the same thing.
I think to say what it would mean for the fact that a document is true 
to be true would mean the same thing.

So, maybe your philosopher's fear of the word "meaning" would be averted 
if you consider "what a document means" to be a shorthand for "what it 
would mean for a document to be true".

No, it starts before RDF.  An SMTP message, to TCP port 25 on an 
internet host, saying "From: xxx"  MEANS that there follows a message 
from party xxx.  This is a real world connection.  The machinery 
communicates my indent to address you with a message, and society will 
hold me to having done that.  The meaning of the message is normally 
human-readable, but in the case of an OFX bank statement download, it is 
machine processable and yet defined in english.

The definitions are almost completely outside RDF.  The DAML+OIL spec 
for example has some definitions of DAML+OIL terms. They are definitions 
in the sense of authoritative statements in that they are made by the 
owners of the terms and published as such.

The conclusion that he is a liar is damaging.  The foo spec states that 
that is what the x rdf:type foo:Liar means.

No.  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than can be 
dreamed of in RDF.

No wonder folks have trouble layering DAML+OIL on top of RDF -- sounds 
like a problem using RDF for any meaning at all.

I am exactly saying that it has.  While our logic may be nice for 
defining numbers, it can't define and shoes and ships and sealing wax.

They will have to deal with (1) the ownership of terms being rather well 
defined, and less easy to argue about, particularly because if you don't 
like foo:Liar you can go define pat:Liar in your own space; and also 
with (2) some small aspect of terms being representable in formal 
axioms.  Here daml:transitiveProperty  is a happy exception, as its 
axioms leave nothing really to be said in addition.  Or it will be an 
exception when you get a complete axiomatic definition when you look it 
up on the web.

These two changes will make automation and validation and stuff simpler 
in a lot of ways. It still won't stop people arguing about what "fair 
use" and "in good condition" mean.
But the MT only helps with (2).  It is (1), the ability to introduce new 
terms, which allows the use of RDF and the layering upon it.
