given
[[
   On 7th December 2001, the RDFCore WG decided to remove rdf:aboutEach
   from the RDF specification.
]] -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach

this testcase should be OK


> http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-abouteach/error002.rdf
> -- ditto

also given
[[
  On 1st June 2001, the WG decided that aboutEachPrefix would be
  removed from the RDF Model and Syntax Recommendation on the
  grounds that there is a lack of implementation experience,
  and it therefore should not be in the recommendation.
  A future version of RDF may consider support for this feature.
]] -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteachprefix

this testcase should be OK as well

I agree with this one as well
only that the MT speaks about rdfs:member
as does the http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/
so an update is in order I think

looking at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/allTestCases.html#rdfs-domain-and-range
the main point is actually the "Positive RDFS-Entailment test"
and the "Positive parser tests" are not testing this specific issue
I think the whole idea should be to approve
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.nt

> -- I agree with this.

my recollection is that we have approved this one and that DanC and PatH
agreed


for the issue
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty
I have done
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/rdf/rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty/manifest.n3
i.e. 4 positive and 2 negative entailment tests
this is indeed RDFS and OWL entailment (in our original etc mode)
and I didn't know how to testcase this issue otherwise
