>Short answer:
>   Yes there is meaning to RDF statements which is not expressed in RDF.

OK, but then we need to come to a terminological agreement. There is 
a clear sense of phrases like 'meaning of XXX statement" or 'XXX 
meaning' (where XXX is the name of some formal language) which is 
widely used throughout AI/KR and logic. With that sense of 'meaning', 
statements like the above are foolish, like asserting that 2+2 is 
more than 4 . We spend considerable effort teaching our 
undergraduates not to make silly mistakes like that.

It has often seemed to some of us that people in the W3C make 
assertions about meanings that are so daft that it is hard to believe 
that anyone would assert them with a straight face, and I suspect 
that this terminological mismatch has been responsible for much of 
this impression. I am still not *entirely* clear what you mean by 
'meaning', and I bet that nobody is (which is fine, as long as we all 
know there is a research agenda here) but we should try to keep that 
notion of meaning separate from the other, perhaps more technical, 
notions. Since usages like "RDF meaning" when used with your sense of 
'meaning', sound to us like insane hubris (it has the connotation 
that RDF has somehow captured in its semantics - ie its model theory 
-  an entire account of English meaning, or human thought), could we 
perhaps agree to use a less ambiguous terminology? For example, how 
about some invented phrase like 'web meaning', or 'social meaning' or 
something like 'full meaning'. So one might say, the web meaning of a 
piece of RDF is more than its (strict) RDF meaning, and happily agree 
that the phrase 'web meaning' has, as yet, no exact specification.

----
I grok the general point: The RDF might 'carry' more meaning than it 
in some strict sense expresses. The full web meaning is determined 
socially, and may be specified by any means: grounding of RDF terms 
in human-readable English definitions, diagrams, whatever; all using 
conventions that link the RDF to the world in some way that goes 
beyond what can be expressed in RDF.

What I find technically unsettling in your reply is your reliance in 
English (NL) glosses to ground meaning. There are many problems with 
this. First, English is itself only a language, and is just as much 
in need of grounding as any formal language; it gets that grounding 
from the human society that uses it to refer to the world that the 
humans see, hear, taste, feel and even imagine; and *that* is where 
the actual grounding in reality occurs, not in English. Second, many 
computational systems are grounded in the world without going through 
human speakers of English (I'm thinking of machines with sensors, 
bank computers handling bank accounts, cameras with facial 
recognition software, things like that) and so the 'meanings' of the 
terms they use will not usually need to be given an English gloss, 
and in fact they will probably not be accurately captured by any 
English gloss, eg what does "see" mean when applied to a smart bank 
security system using infra-red sensors? Third, we don't actually 
have a precise account of English meaning to rely on, so we are 
hamstrung from the start; and fourth (this is a minority view of my 
own, but I hold it passionately)  human natural language in fact 
isn't very well suited to specifying meanings. It evolved for 
situated communication between humans using a narrow bandwidth 
channel, not for specifying meanings for use by an inference process, 
and the evolutionary pressures often went in divergent directions; eg 
English is ambiguous, lexically overloaded, contextual, tensed, and 
full of allusions, ironies, metaphors, poesy and other stuff which 
delights the human left temporal lobe but which is nightmarish in a 
specification language. So using English as a grounding for meanings 
is like building on mud.

Yes, *people* accept that, and libraries are used by people. But that 
isn't the point here. The point is what *software agents* can 
understand, right?

And for the record, and speaking now as a person, I wouldn't have 
read that RDF to mean that I was the author of Moby Dick; I would 
read it as saying something like "if you want to find out more about 
the author of Moby Dick, then send Pat Hayes an email". (It seems odd 
to refer to people by their email boxes: what about all the lucky 
souls who don't have an email account? How would you say that 
Melville wrote Moby Dick?)

>These statements are taken to mean that you are creator of something

Who says I do? Even as a human being, on what basis must I go along 
with assuming that this RDF means the same as your English gloss of 
it? I don't find that at all obvious, and it certainly does not 
follow from the RDF spec, or from any of the conventions outlined in 
the RDF spec. (It might be possible to extract it from the code of 
the library system that used it, by noticing that it - the code - 
drew certain conclusions that only made sense under that assumption. 
Under those circumstances I might agree with the claim, but only 
because the code is now part of the specification of the meaning of 
the RDF, which is stretching the point, but not intolerably. But to 
claim that a piece of RDF means something just by fiat seems silly.)

Its not clear that this semantic way of talking makes sense in this 
context. It would if we had a model theory for English, but 
incorporating one of those would make RDF into a *much* more 
complicated kind of beast.

I thought that this was exactly what RDF was for. I have never heard

Useful or not, it is true; and follows in fact from the RDF specs 
themselves. Well, to be exact, there is one set of RDF-valid 
inferences you can make. Making other inferences from something is 
*possible*, of course - generating random RDF graphs and calling them 
inferences is possible - but its not RDF, any more than inferring "Je 
suis faim" from "Tengo sed" is English.

Of course, but that is irrelevant to the point here. The issue is 
whether that stuff that you learn is written in RDF or not, and 
whether those capabilities are sanctioned by the RDF specs or not.

Wait. HOW is is so defined? If the dublin core just say this in 
English then they are only defining their intent, not the actual 
meaning of the RDF terms. The only way to define meaning in any 
formalism is to write expressions IN THAT FORMALISM which capture 
that meaning by restricting the space of allowable interpretations. 
If one wants to invoke other machinery - as for example is done in AI 
robotics, where sensory inputs are related directly to the physical 
surroundings of the machine - then those 'grounding' links to a world 
need to be specified as part of the semantic account of the formalism 
itself, There are no magic routes to putting knowledge into machines.

What actual practical way? Seems to me that there is hardly any 
actual practice to appeal to, and that in fact this kind of thing is 
going to happen as soon as RDF is widely deployed, since there is in 
fact absolutely no way to prevent anyone writing anything using any 
vocabulary they like. I can write all sorts of misleading things in 
my RDF graph using your vocabulary, and how can you possibly stop me 
doing that? After all, you *published* the terminology. I think the 
first amendment gives me the right to *say* whatever I like using it. 
All you can hope is that a third party will take what you say as 
having more authority than what I say, since the terms are yours. But 
that seems like a slender reed to base a theory of meaning on, if 
definitions can be outvoted.

Well, tough. Earthquakes happen.

Sorry, I deny this. They are NOT defined in English. The only way to 
define meaning for RDF  (DAML, OWl, KIF, ....) is to write RDF (DAML, 
OWL, KIF,...). The English commentaries and comments and glosses are 
just that: comments and glosses. They no more define the meaning of 
RDF than comments in Java code define what happens when the code 
runs. They may well express the intentions of the human writers of 
the RDF, but that is irrelevant to any software which uses the RDF 
(unless the software can read and understand the English, of course; 
but that isn't RDF inference.)

But that is what the RDF spec says the meaning is. I don't see how it 
could say anything else, in fact: what is it going to say, that the 
meaning of the RDF is whatever anyone says the meaning is? That 
hardly reads like a specification.

No, things are not that bad. Its true that any description needs to 
be grounded eventually, but one can do a lot is a reasonably 
expressive ontology language. Quite a lot of content can be expressed 
in a computationally useful way. Seems to me that is the main point 
of having the SW at all, to make some of this machine-usable content 
usable by web engines.

Well, apparently your documents are susceptible to multiple 
interpretations, since I seem to have misunderstood them. That seems 
like the normal situation: we can't always say everything we mean. 
Documents have many possible meanings, usually.

I was speaking as one human being to another (and also informally, 
rather than as someone trying to produce an overarching theory.) The 
semantic web, as I understand it, is supposed to consist largely of 
software agents communicating with one another. They won't be able to 
understand English any time soon. So I don't really care about any 
'meanings' that are invisible to the bearers of the information. I 
want to know what *they* know about what it means, since it is what 
they are inferring and deciding to do that I have to worry about.

I'll accept that idea when you (or someone) comes up with at least a 
beginning of an account of what it means for something to be 
'grounded in English prose'. Years in AI have left me with a very 
cynical view of aspirations like this, which are usually based on 
delusions of grandeur about what formal languages actually mean.

>That doesn't invalidate the logical operations.

Well, it might. That is part of the problem: if you allow meaning 
specifications this broad and underspecified, then anything is 
possible. I could say in a comment that <ex:foo> means childhood on 
Tuesdays but aspidistras on Thursdays.

That would certainly avoid a host of philosophical-logic 
complications, so is a step in the right direction. However, bear in 
mind that truth is a relationship between a document and a *possible* 
world. Its kind of hard to say what the *actual* world is.

Doesnt it actually mean that a certain account on a computer has sent 
the message? If someone sneaks into my office and sends an email on 
my machine, it will say "From:phayes@ai.uwf.edu", but it wasn't me 
hitting the keys. Seems to me that the entire apparatus of 
SMTP/TCP/FTP is entirely inside what might be called the global 
computational domain. (Once we have webcams plus facial recognition 
software, things might get genuinely real-world, for example.)

I'd say that it was defined by the code that processed it, 
ultimately. Any claims about meaning that are not somehow embodied in 
the code are just that, claims. And they are false claims.

They define the meanings *in DAML*, not in RDF. DAML and RDF are 
different languages. (This is just normal usage of this kind of 
terminology, right?)

English isn't RDF, so if you are saying it in English then you aren't 
saying it in RDF. Come on, this is just good usage of terminology. 
Its ridiculous to say that anything that can be said in English is 
"in RDF". RDF is a formal language for machine use, with a tightly 
specified syntax and model theory. Given that specification, I can 
PROVE that not everything that can be said in English can be said in 
RDF. You can't say "P or Q" in RDF, for example. It doesn't matter 
how much English you write about it; if the English says that the RDF 
expresses disjunction, then the English is just plain wrong.

But it seems to me that you are. That is what it means to say that 
some RDF expresses this content. If it can't be expressed in RDF, 
then its not in the RDF. You can't have it both ways. As Peter said, 
this isn't RDF, its RDF+ (mean what I say). Of course you can express 
anything in RDF+ MWIS, but the RDF part isn't contributing much to 
the mix.

OK, I concede that this might stand up in court, but only because a 
*human* reader of the spec and the RDF could come to this conclusion. 
But then if this is the criterion for meaning, then meaning on the 
semantic web is trivial. We can just send numbers to one another, and 
my spec will say "15" means that Brian is a liar. If I then publish 
"7+8", can Brian sue me?

Well then, why did you make it the base layer of your famous diagram,

Several of us have been wondering about that, indeed.  (Now, if RDF

Then I really fail to see what your vision of the semantic web 
amounts to, or how it differs from the existing web. Its just more of 
the same, right? Its content distributed on websites written by human 
beings for use by human readers, perhaps after a bit of processing to 
make it look prettier. What is the RDF *for*, if it means the same as 
the English? Why not just put the English on the web page? Surely the 
idea is to make some of the content accessible to machine use. That's 
the part of the 'meaning' that is relevant to the SW.

It can't define them, but a good KR formalism can describe them in 
enough detail that one can recognize what is being described. Which 
is all that we can do in English, in fact. You can't define natural 
kind terms in *any* language; its nothing particularly to do with 
logic. (I find that logic often gets a bad press here because it was 
originally designed by mathematicians who were indeed interested in 
defining mathematical concepts. But that was in the 1890's; we've 
gotten past that long ago.)

Perhaps you could explain that point in a little more detail? That 
is, I don't think the rest of us know what you have in mind here, and 
we are floundering trying to make sense of 'layering'.  I don't see 
how the ability to define new terms helps with layering at all. The 
central issues seem to be to do with semantics and syntax, not with 
the terms involved. Can you give a simple (toy) example to illustrate 
the point?
