Guys, is there an up-to-date summary of the complete RDF and RDFS 
vocabulary anywhere, taking into account all the changes we have 
decided on? I'd like to get the MT document towards the stage where 
it at least mentions everything, if only to say that it isn't giving 
it any particular meaning.

In a similar vein, I presume that the new daml-style rdf:Collections 
should be put into the MT document as well.  Any objections?

Pat
