There isn't a totally up-to-date rdf: namespace URI list, but the one
in the syntax doc is the latest:

  The RDF Namespace
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Namespace

In my editors draft, this is slightly reformatted:
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Namespace

For the RDF Schema terms, it seems the following sumarises the
vocabular you need:

  RDF Schema overview 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_overview

and is up-to-date.

(rdf:Collections isn't a new term however)
The new rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest and rdf:nil vocabulary will be
added to the syntax doc, in the section/URI above.

The detail of how they *work* will be elsewhere in a section yet to
be written.  If you want, I can reserve a document anchor and
skeleton section, for you to point at in the next MT WD?
