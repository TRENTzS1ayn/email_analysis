Right. However Ive begun to see that Massimo (author of above, as I 
recall) does have a point. Even though blank nodes don't have names, 
they do have an identity. Suppose we start with an RDF/XML document, 
parse it, and generate a(n instance of a) RDF graph A. That contains 
urirefs and literals and bnodes. OK so far. Now suppose that we parse 
it *again* and generate *another* RDF graph B. The urirefs and 
literals in B are the *same* as in A - literally the same- but the 
bnodes are different, right? That is what we meant by 'local to the 
graph'. But in some sense A and B are the same. They express the same 
content, are derived from the same document, they would look exactly 
the same if you were to draw them as pictures, etc. . They are 
virtually indistinguishable, and ought to be interchangeable with 
each other. Maybe it would be useful to have a notion of 'isomorphic' 
which allows one set of blank nodes to be swapped with another 
without 'changing' the graph.

Or, we could say that two graphs are equivalent if they are instances 
of each other. That is a stronger relationship, since equivalent 
graphs need not be graph-isomorphic (example in 
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#graphdefs) but they might as well be as 
far as their meaning is concerned. It was tricky to get 'instance' 
right, by the way.

But I bet they are much more anal about things that get printed.
