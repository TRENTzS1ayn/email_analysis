that's very good to read and I have no fundamental remarks
just something that I don't understand in 3.4

  If x is in D, then ICEXT(x) is the value space of L2V(x)

so the class extension of a datatype x *is* its value space
i.e. the range of L2V(x)

then how could it be that we should take care

  not to identify the value space of a datatype
  with the class of its members
