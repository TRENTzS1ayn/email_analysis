This came from some recent email with Henry Thompson about XML 
schema. XML schema has a very weird notion of 'value equality'. The 
same thing - the SAME thing - looks 'different' to XML depending on 
which value space you look at it 'through'. For example base64binary 
and hexBinary value spaces are both binary octet streams, and Henry 
says that we can say they are the same class with the same members, 
but XMLSchema insists that one of these things seen as a member of 
one value space is different from itself seen as a member of the 
other value space. So XML value spaces are not sets, ie class 
extensions. They are some other eldritch kind of entity, not known to 
set theorists or mathematicians, in some strange world of their own. 
I just thought I ought to caution users, that is all.
