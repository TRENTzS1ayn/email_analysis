I have to knock off for tonite, and it still needs work. The bulk of 
the actual content is now done, however: the rest is editing. The 
Lbase in now in appendix C.

I wonder if it is worth having appendix A, since once brought up to 
date it will not be any more readable than the tables in the main 
document or the Lbase summary, seems to me. It looks neat right now 
because it so woefully incomplete.

Strong views either way, please let me know.
