In case anyone was wondering, the reason that the inference

aaa bbb "foo"^^ddd .
-->
aaa bbb _:xxx .
_:xxx rdf:type ddd .

didnt get put into RDFS (but was left until the datatypes were 
introduced) is because, contrary to what I first thought, this 
inference DOES depend on access to datatype information, in order to 
check that 'foo' is a legal lexical form according to the datatype 
ddd.  So even though it doesnt depend on the particular value, it 
does need external datatype information to be valid.

Just a quick explanation.

Also, after Jos' question I guess I ought to either remove that 
comment or else put in a bit more explanation. Sigh.
