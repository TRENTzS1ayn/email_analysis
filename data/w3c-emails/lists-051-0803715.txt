Semantics (was: MT) copyinprogress is at
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20Model%20Theory_Oct_draft.html

Dtype summary:

RDF: typed literals denote something, dunno what.

RDFS: rdfs:Datatype is a class, dunno whats in it.

Add some datatypes:

If sss is a legal lexical form for ddd then

aaa ppp "sss"^^ddd .
ddd a rdfs:Datatype .
-->
aaa ppp -:xxx .
_:xxx a ddd .

That is pretty much all there is.
