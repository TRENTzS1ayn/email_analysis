Sounds like a mirroring problem :(

I get this problem too, but only sometimes. Several servers sit behind
www.w3.org. The best I can suggest as a workaround right now (no time to
investigate) is to substitute one of the variant IP addresses, eg.:
18.29.1.34, 18.29.1.35, 18.7.14.127 into URLs in place of 'www.w3.org'.
Sorry about this. If your Web browser caches DNS lookups, closing and
re-opening the browser might do the job too.
