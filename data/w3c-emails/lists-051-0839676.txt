Pat--

See if you can get it by selecting the Primer's "editor's working draft" 
link on the RDF Core WG home page (that's a link to the whole directory; 
  the version you want is the rdf-primer-20021031... entry near the 
bottom).  If that doesn't work (it's supposed to be a public link), 
someone on staff needs to help;  I don't think I have authority to 
change the access control list (I've run into problems getting access 
myself at times!)
