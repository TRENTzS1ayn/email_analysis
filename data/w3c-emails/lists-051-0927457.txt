The problem with that line is that adding datatypes produces a 
nonmonotonic inference (when you discover that since the typed 
literal is illegal, it doesnt denote anything in the ddd value 
space). So thats why it is RDF's business, in a sense. Sure, RDF 
can't know which things are legal all by itself, but it needs to not 
unilaterally assume that they are all legal, in case you are not.
