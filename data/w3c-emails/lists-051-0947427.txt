14: 
Proposed Schedule now on overview page

Comment.  The co-chair(s) would like an agreed plan.

The schedule is clearly tight.  The co-chair(s) are asking for agreement to:

  o we will make best efforts to achieve this plan (as ammended by WG)
  o we will signal as early as possible if this plan is at risk


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#microschedule


15: RDF URI Reference The abstract syntax
uses the term RDF URI Reference for absolute URI's with optional
fragment identifiers.  There has been some pushback on using this term
and concerns about how we describe its relationship to URI's.  Where
do we stand on internationalized URI's?

The working principal is that editor of the "natural home" for a
concept names it and defines it.

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0088.html


16: Concepts/Primer overlap
