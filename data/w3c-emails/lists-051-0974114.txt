Jeremy (and Steve, and Dan, and Dave, and Patrick, and most of all, 
Brian;  did I leave anyone out?)--

Thanks for the comments.  As you might imagine, I have not actually 
implemented changes responding to everyone's comments yet.  I've been 
mostly working through Brian's comments, plus some additional work I'd 
been doing already (like synching the names of documents and the 
references).  In the process, I have addressed a number of other folk's 
comments as well. I have, in particular, already made changes 
corresponding to the "critical" comments I've received, in particular:

* changes to the typed literal section (2.6) as requested by Patrick and 
Brian
* removing section 4.3.3 (RDF in HTML) as requested by DanC
* removing section 6.4 (intelligent routing) as requested by Brian and DanC
* removing some material in the section on containers as requested by Brian

I will have to get to the other comments (particularly the more 
extensive ones like making separate pages or Appendices of sections 2.1 
and 2.2) later.

I do have one specific question right now for Jeremy:

Do you mean the reference to RDF/XML, or the material on QNames?
