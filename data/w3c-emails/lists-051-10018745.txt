I think that it is necessary and reasonable to incorporate
datatyping into the basic RDF MT insofar as typed literals
are part of the core abstract syntax, and that there are
certain entailments involving typed literals that hold for 
the core RDF MT without specific knowledge of the datatypes.
E.g. the following "basic RDF" entailment holds:

   some:Thing some:Property "10"@en^^xsd:integer .

RDF entails

   some:Thing some:Property "10"@fi^^xsd:integer .

No knowledge of some:Datatype is required to define that the
above entailment holds in the basic RDF MT. It is part of the
generic characteristics of typed literals.

Yet still there needs to be defined the notions of RDF entailment
versus RDF+Datatype entailment such that there are additional
entailments that will hold with specific knowledge of the
datatypes that will not hold without knowledge of the datatypes.
Thus, the following RDF+Datatype entailment holds where it
wouldn't be a valid RDF entailment:

   some:Thing some:Property "10"^^xsd:integer .

RDF+Datatype entails

   some:Thing some:Property "010"^^xsd:integer .

etc.

So typed literals should be described in the basic RDF MT
insofar as their generic properties are concerned and insofar
as they participate in valid RDF entailments such as the
first example. And then RDF+Datatype entailments can be
defined as an extension of that basic MT.

Eh?

Patrick
