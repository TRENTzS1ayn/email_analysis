The way that RDF says that something is a "resource" is to say
that it is a member of the class rdfs:Resource.

If literals are resources, then the RDF normative specs should define

   rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .

If the normative specs do not define that, then I will rightly
conclude that literals are not resources.

IMO, literals (lexical forms) are not members of rdfs:Resource.

Datatype values, on the other hand, are. I.e., it should be defined that

   rdfs:Datatype rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .

I.e., that all members of all value spaces of all datatypes are resources.

If by "literal value" Pat means a datatype value, the thing at the pointy
end of a L2V mapping, then I think we are in agreement on this.
