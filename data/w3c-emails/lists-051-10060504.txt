>     mailto:member-techplenary@w3.org
>
>There are many fascinating and critical technical challenges to face as we 
>"lead the Web to its full potential".  Tell us which topics you feel would 
>make this 3rd annual event an:
>   -     intensely interesting,
>   -     educational,
>   -     inspiring, and
>   -     unifying
>experience for the diverse group of participants from across the W3C's 
>broad range of Working and Interest Groups.
>
>For those who have not attended a previous Tech Plenary, the feedback on 
>the  programs has been as diverse as their participants:    Good 
>idea.  Fun. Too much process.  Not technical enough.  Too technical.  Of 
>interest to too narrow a group.  Too general. Too much blood (or 
>argument).  More blood! ..... You might want to check out  the agenda from 
>the February 2002 TP ...
>     http://www.w3.org/2001/07/Plenary/Agenda.html
>
>The format for the 2003 event is also open for your 
>input:  Presentations.  Demonstrations.  Panel discussions. 
>Debates.  Audience participation.  Etc.  We want to engage the thoughts of 
>and encourage active participation from as many of the attendees as possible.
>
>What would you like to see?
>
>We look forward to your suggestions for agenda topics and formats. We will 
>carefully consider all input, and publish an agenda in January 2003.

>Thanks in advance.
