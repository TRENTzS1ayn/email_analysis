I wrote that a couple of days ago, I guess it got held up on my PC.

On reflection, I feel this is a good argument to make the primer correct,
which I think we wanted to do anyway. It does not matter at all if people
don't have examples of how to use bagID because its useless. All the
rdf:parseType's are there for other specs to and implementations to build
on - apart from "Literal" which I hope the primer will treat a little. If
the primer doesn't mention property attributes, and then no one uses them,
that won't be a huge lose to humanity.
