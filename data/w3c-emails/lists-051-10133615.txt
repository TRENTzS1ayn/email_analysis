I think there may be a difference between incorporating the principles of 
datatyping (yes) and assuming knowledge of all the datatypes used 
(problematic).

So, yes, it's important to define the concept of a datatype, and how it 
works in conjunction with literals but, I think, also to retain the idea 
that there is a basic form of entailment in which no knowledge of the 
datatype mappings is assumed, distinct from a datatyped entailment in which 
such knowledge is assumed.

E.g. in "basic" entailment:

    Jenny age "10"^^xsd:integer .

does not entail

    Jenny age "010"^^xsd:integer .

But in a xsd:integer-aware entailment (with knowledge that datatype 
xsd:integer maps "10" and "010" to the same value) one *can* draw the 
entailment.

(Hoping this helps rather than confuses.)
