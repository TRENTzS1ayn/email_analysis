Thanks Pat.  Lets get this out there.  My advice, we don't need Lbase.  You 
can't even refer to it at present and I don't want getting the lbase note 
published as a dependency.  Danbri has that action and he is clearly not 
well.  Its the technical meat of the MT we need.  The finer points of 
editing can wait, though html cleanup cannot.
