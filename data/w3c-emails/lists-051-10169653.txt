Well, since the specs are going to be defining a rather static
ontology, it's unlikely that my system is going to encounter
statements about the core RDF vocabulary that would be authoritative,
in fact, for system integrity issues, I may rightfully choose to
ignore any statements which extend the semantics of the core
RDF vocabulary which are not explicitly and already defined by
the specifications.

So, yes, in fact I do think it is quite reasonable to conclude that
literals are not resources, if the RDF specs don't explicitly say
they are.
