Brian has asked me to clarify what the minimum change would be to get me to
drop opposition.

In particular, he hypothesised a paragraph that clearly stated that sections
4-9 took precendence over section 2, in the event of a conflict.

This would just about suffice to turn my opposition into abstention - not
that I cannot understand why the editor objects to using a single word like
"informative" or "non-normative" in place of such a paragraph. (Grudging)

I reemphasize that a decision to retain section 2, in any form, should not
be taken unless the WG is clear that the necessary rewrite for last call and
recommendation is adequately resourced; and has sufficient bang for the
buck.

I could positively support publication with:
- section 2 deleted
or
- section 2 moved to a non-normative appendix
