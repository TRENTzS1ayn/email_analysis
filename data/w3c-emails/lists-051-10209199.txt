The RDF normative specs may or may not define literals as resources, but 
if they do, they better not do it by saying:

 >>>
 >>>   rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .
 >>>

because classes (including Literal and Resource) and subclasses are not 
defined in RDF, they are defined in RDFS (note the namespace prefix). 
M&S said literals and resources were disjoint, but didn't do it using 
declarations involving classes.  We're either going to keep these 
languages separate, or we're not, and either way, we need to be consistent.
