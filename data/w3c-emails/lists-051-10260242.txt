I'm interpretting "just about" as "" in the above sentence.  If that is not 
right and you want me to represent your views at the telecon, you'd better 
let me know.

I would be willing to accept the syntax editor's assurance that he can get 
section 2 into shape for last call.  I'd also be willing to find time to 
assist Dave with the wordsmithing if that would be helpful, though there 
may be others who would be both willing and able to do a better job.  If 
Dave accepted that offer, I would not be seeking to add my name to the list 
of editors.
