Brian hasn't been able to get further reviewing done on this doc 
today.  However, Brian gives it a cautious thumbs up for publishing, having 
found no showstoppers and being impressed by the small number of comments 
on the technical meat of the document from other reviewers.  Brian suggests 
the published version includes:

  o a statement that any conflict between section 2 and the more formal 
sections of the spec, section 2 loses.

  o a disclaimer in section 2 saying that whilst the substance is not 
expected to change much, it is new text that is likely to undergo 
substantial editorial revision.

One of Brian's considerations is there is a need to have WD's to refer to, 
to communicate the WG's decision on datatypes to the webont folks.  That 
should be done soon.  Brian thinks the presence of the datatyping example 
in section 2 will help webont folks see what we have done more easily than 
interpreting the grammar.  He finds this a convincing argument that section 
2 is needed.

Similarly, whilst Brian splattered a load of comments on the concepts doc, 
he found no show stoppers and thinks it should go.
