Sure, I have no problem with that. However it just puts the real 
issue under the rug, since those owl properties now have to be 
reasoned about, and the question re-appears as how best to think 
about owl:TransitiveProperty and so on. It you follow Ian's 
translation of OWL (DLs generally) back into FOPC, the 'rules' just 
re-appear in any case; TransitiveProperty becomes the implication you 
would expect, and so on.

You know, all we are all doing is taking little pieces of logic and 
inventing about 7 different notations for them and then writing long 
papers about how to translate between the notations we have invented 
:-)
