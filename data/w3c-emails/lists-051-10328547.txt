Thanks for all the input. I think I can see how to keep everyone 
reasonably happy. In outline, the basic MT treats all literals as 
denoting strings possibly with lang tags, but will not know what they 
denote. In particular it will not know that a typed literal denotes 
the value under the datatype mapping. (Unless the datatype is one of 
its own, maybe: not sure about this yet.) When datatypes are 
introduced (ie later), these 'loose' denotations will suddenly get 
tighter and more entailments will be visible.  Just like the old days.
