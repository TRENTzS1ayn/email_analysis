I meant the values. All of them, that is: integers and strings and 
uris and whatever. Anything that can be mapped into a value space 
from a literal. Anything that a literal can denote.

Well, they might well exist, but the question is, which of them are 
in the class? It isn't very useful to have a class of *syntactic* 
things, unless we also have some way to refer to those syntactic 
things.

>Do you mean "lexical forms"?

NO!! That's why I said literal VALUES.

Yes, exactly. My message was to the effect that rdf:Literal is NOT a 
class of lexical forms.

That isn't the way I read the M&S, and that interpretation has never 
been in any version of the MT. I agree however that the M&S is highly 
unclear on this point, as on many others, and in particular is rife 
with use/mention confusions in any case. SO to hell with trying to 
deconstruct the M&S: what do WE want rdf:Literal to mean?
