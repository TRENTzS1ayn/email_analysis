Well, I said that IF xsd:anyURI is a set of strings.... I gather that 
it isn't; OK, then not OK.

You seem to be assuming that it is impossible for two different 
datatypes to have the same value space. I wasn't aware that this was 
a general rule. I would have no problem for example saying that 
rdfs:StringLiteral and xsd:String had the same value space. (NOt the 
same lexical space, but the same value space.)
