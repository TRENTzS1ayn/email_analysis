Dan--

I agree.  The XMP bit was added at the last minute and (if my memory is 
correct) is a slightly-reworded cut and paste from an Adobe blurb.  If 
you think it's worth following up, an example would be easy, but:  (a) 
it is (so far) an Adobe idea, so it's bound to be vendor-unneutral to a 
certain extent;  (b) it does increase the length (but of a separate 
section, if we pursue Jeremy's idea.
