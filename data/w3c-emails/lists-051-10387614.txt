I think that is a judgement call for you Frank.  In trying to get some 
consistency of presentation I'm heading towards RDF is a language with one 
abstract syntax and several concrete syntaxes as being the 'formal' model 
of what we think RDF is.  I know not everyone is comfortable with that, but 
we need to pick one.

However, as Graham has pointed out, when explaining things to folks, the 
term 'data model' might well be more appropriate so, if in context you 
think data model is a better term, then there is no blanket - "you are not 
allowed to use that term" injunction.  Jeremy's text, something along the 
lines of RDF's Abstract Syntax, sometimes called the RDF Data Model, ... 
seemed to me to set the right sort of tone.
