Not at all. But see below.

I am presuming, perhaps incorrectly, that for one value space
to intersect with another value space that for any two values
X and Y which occur in the intersection of those value spaces
the same relations hold for them in terms of either datatype.

I.e., if X < Y in datatype 1 then X < Y in datatype 2.

If one datatype has an ordered value space and the other does
not, then can they really intersect?

If X = Y in one value space yet X != Y in the other value space
can they really intersect?

I think not, in both cases.

Since I do not consider the value space of rdfs:StringLiteral
to be ordered, then I do not see that it can intersect with
that of xsd:string.
