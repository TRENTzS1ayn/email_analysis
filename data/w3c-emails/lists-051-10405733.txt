My current understanding is that they can BE either strings or 
(string, lang) pairs, and that they DENOTE whatever they are. I find 
this slightly weird, since we have no way to talk about the 
components of these pairs that are now in the semantic domain, but 
there you are. It has the side advantage (?) of blocking what would 
otherwise be a valid inference of the form

ex:a ex:p "10"fr .
ex:b ex:q "10"en .
-->
ex:a ex:p _:y .
ex:b ex:q _:y .
