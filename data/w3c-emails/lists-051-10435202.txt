I apologize that I haven't had time recently to look through the contended 
section 2 in detail, but on earlier review I did think this contains useful 
material.  I think the presentation of so-called "striped syntax" is very 
useful for showing how RDF/XML syntax can be used in a "user friendly" fashion.

I would prefer the material to be where it currently resides in the 
document.  I found the formal syntax description can be difficult to follow 
if the reader doesn't start out with a reasonably clear idea of what the 
syntax looks like.

I think that many of Jeremy's editorial comments seemed appropriate and 
would like to see them folded in.  (Caveat: I haven't checked them in detail.)

I have no strong opinion about marking this section "informative":  my 
intuition is that it doesn't harm.

If the editor is able to commit a reasonable level of effort, I see no 
reason why the revisions could not be ready for last call (i.e. if he says 
he can do it, I see no cause to disbelieve).
