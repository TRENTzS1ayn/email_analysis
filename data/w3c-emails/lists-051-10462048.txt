To me, using "^^"   makes it clear that ^^ is a syntactic thing
whose semantics are in fact equivalent to "^"  except that
the formal triples representation is different.

So Jos, you can if you want dismantle the triple into two.
You will have a semantically equivalent graph.
Not the one which others want to be the canonical graph,
but one can define a Jos-canonical one.
They would entail each other.

I feel that "^^", being syntactic, should only be usable with a
fixed set of type URIs.
