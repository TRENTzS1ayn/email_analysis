I've been burned in the past where I've seen a post which has been a bit at 
odds with my understanding, but I've assumed it was just shorthand language 
and folks knew what had been decided.  And then I've felt bad when Pat, or 
someone else said, "Oh, I didn't know you'd done that.  Thats crazy ..."

So just checking my understanding, on Pat's advice, we decided we would not 
regard old style literals as datatyped values and there is now no 
rdfs:StringLiteral.  We do still have rdfs:XMLLiteral though.

Have I misunderstood?
