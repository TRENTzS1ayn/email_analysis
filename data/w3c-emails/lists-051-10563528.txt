Well surprise surprise. I guess my suspicions about ^^ were correct.

I reiterate my opposition to the use of ^^ in the abstract syntax.

A typed literal node may *not* be "dismantled" into
additional triples, even if it might be deemed to be semantically 
equivalent to an expansion into a bnode with datatype property
(and I am not convinced that it is). 

If an application wishes to define rules to infer those additional
triples, fine, but the ^^ delimiter does not function in any way
like ^ in N3.

I would like either for the delimiter to be removed entirely or
for there to be an explicit statement that such "dismantling" 
of the typed literal node is not licensed by the RDF specs.
