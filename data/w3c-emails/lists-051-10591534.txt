Hi Patrick,

My first reaction is Tim has dipped into this conversation not having the 
full context and we need to figure whether there is a simple 
misunderstanding here or a substantive issue.  We had a definite answer to 
your question from DanC at the last telecon.  If Tim disagrees, then we 
ought to explore that, but he might have been misunderstood.

So, I suggest, before we get all excited, we figure out if there is an 
issue and exactly what it is.

Last week on email and in the telecon you asked DanC a straight question 
about N3.  You got a firm and definitive answer.  You now think that Tim's 
post suggests he has a different view.  Fair enough.  Why not ask Tim your 
question.

Brian
