Folks,

I'm sorry but the agenda for tomorrows telecon will be late.  I'll do it 
first thing tomorrow, uk time.  In general it will aim to consider 
publishing the concepts and syntax WD's, to address the high priority 
issues per my recent post, consider cross doc consistency issues and check 
on status of other docs.

Brian
