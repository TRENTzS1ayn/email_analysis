I'd have W3C buy us a Bagotronics Business Time Machine (full page ad in 
the New York Times on Tuesday), send the whole WG back a year, and start 
compiling the set of consistent terms and assigning them to documents 
much earlier.  ("Thanks to quark-gluon plasma chip technology, the first 
working time machine is now available for business purposes"; "If 
something didn't work, you just go back and fix it!"  "...performs as 
well as a machine that costs six times as much, but at only three easy 
payments of $299.95, it's affordable to companies of any size." 
"plug-and-play, type-and-travel technology").
