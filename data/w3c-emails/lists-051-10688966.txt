There is a new version of the Primer at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20021031.html

This is (as far as the editors are concerned) ready to be reviewed by 
the WG for a vote to publish as a WD a week from tomorrow.

I will be particularly interested in review of specific sections by the 
editors of the associated normative specifications, if possible, e.g., 
Section 2 (Concepts), Section 3 (RDF/XML), Section 5 (Schema), and 
Section 4 (anyone interested in the container/collection stuff, and Pat 
on 4.2 covering reification).  (I'd also very much appreciate it if the 
reviews go beyond saying what's wrong, to give some suggestions as to 
what to do about it!)
