To the particular notation, or to the very idea?

Well, but do you have any objection to an entailment of the form

aaa ppp "whatever"^^dtypefoo .
-->
aaa ppp _:xxx .
_:xxx dtypefoo "whatever" .

being valid? Its validity would not encumber you to actually perform 
it, after all. I think the 'operational' sound of the word 
"dismantle" carries some bad implications.
