Quick request(s) for feedback. There are 5 parts to this message.

Please say if you think that any of the following entailments should 
NOT be valid in RDF or RDFS, or have any problems with the reasoning 
sketched. Obviously "10" can be any string.

1. (RDF)
aaa ppp "10" .
-->
aaa ppp _:xxx .

2. (RDF)
aaa ppp "10"^^datatypefoo .
-->
aaa ppp _:xxx .

3. (RDF)
aaa ppp "10"@lang .
-->
aaa ppp _:xxx .

 From the above, and assuming bare literals denote themselves, then IR 
must contain all bare literals (cuzof 1) and all values that any 
datatype can map them into (cuzof 2) and maybe all pairs of all those 
things with lang tags (not yet sure about that last one). So we might 
as well say that IR contains all of LV, seems to me. In which case we 
would get

4. (RDFS)
rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Resource .

5. (RDFS)
aaa rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
--->
aaa rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal .

------

Terminology question: now we have lists, should the term 'container' 
be understood to include lists as well as seqs, bags and alts? If so, 
does anyone have an suggestion for a generic term for the older 
containers? (Simple containers? Open containers? Bushy containers?)

------

Can anyone fill in the blank for

rdfs:comment rdfs:range ??? .

------

Er..sorry, I ought to know this, but I am honestly unable to recall 
where the hell we are now. Have we decided to NOT allow property 
datatyping, ie the use of a datatype URI as a property to link a node 
to a bare literal, with the datatype implication that the node 
denotes the resulting value? Or to ALLOW it? That is, should

6.
aaa ppp "10"^^datatypefoo .
--->
aaa ppp _:xxx .
_:xxx datatypefoo "10"

or not? If so, how about the reverse entailment??

------

Finally, here is my current take on the total RDF and RDFS 
namespaces. Please correct any errors or omissions. In particular, 
did we trash rdf:containerMembershipProperty?

RDF:
rdf:type   rdf:Property
rdf:Statement rdf:subject rdf:predicate rdf:object
rdf:Seq rdf:Bag rdf:Alt rdf:_1 rdf:_2 ...
rdf:List rdf:first rdf:rest rdf:nil

RDFS:
rdfs:domain rdfs:range rdfs:Resource rdfs:Literal rdfs:Class 
rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:member rdfs:Datatype
rdfs:seeAlso, rdfs:isDefinedBy, rdfs:comment  rdfs:label

Thanks.

Pat
