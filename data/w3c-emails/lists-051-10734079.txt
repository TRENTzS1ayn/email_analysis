If you suspicions were that RDF was to perverted by the addition of  
extra triples in the definition of an RDF parser then you were wrong.    
Don't panic!

I find the use of juxtaposition very messy for the parser, and  
potentially
confusing for users.  It is much safer in the syntax to use a piece of  
punctuation.
That syntax point is completely irrelevant to question in the rest of  
your message.

I am sorry, I clearly didn't distinguish well enough between things you
do inside a parser and things you do outside.
I was suggesting that one could do what Jos wanted outside the parser.

If you are not convinced that, for a given datatype, a property can  
relate a member of the value space and a member of the lexical space,  
then you must have thought of something I haven't thought of.

That is just what we are talking about here.  You can't stop Jos  
treating his data
in that way.

Exactly it does not.   It is syntax in the RDF spec, not a triple

If they had ben the same, then I would have suggested ^ not ^^.

The RDF spec's job is to define the set of triples which corresponds to  
a given serialization.
Not to define what people do after they have got them.  Do not blur the  
line.
I was saying that Jos could do them *after* the RDF parsing stage.
This draws away from RDF spec some criticsism of it being clumsy,
demonstrating that it can be converted into a different form.
