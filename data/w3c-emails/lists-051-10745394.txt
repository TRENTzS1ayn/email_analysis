Well, the current position is that there isnt a *syntactic* condition 
to this effect (how could there be, when theres no syntactic 
condition on type URIs?) but that if you use a URI that the RDF 
engine can't resolve into a datatype, then it can't draw any 
datatype-type conclusions involving the literal. In effect, a typed 
literal with an unknown type URI is just an opaque string as far as 
the RDF is concerned: it knows it means something, but it has no way 
to find out what that is. It can infer an existential, is about all.

An engine could always throw an exception if it failed to recognize 
an embedded dtype in a literal. Does it matter if the exception is 
called syntactic or datatypish? .
