I see 
  rdfs:XMLLiteral

in
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF%20Model%20Theory_Oct_draft.html

That should be rdf:XMLLiteral, right Dave?

eek... it's there in the syntax editor's draft
too:

If ?literal-language? is the empty string then the value is the
concatenation of """ (1 double quote), the value of the ?literal-value?
accessor and ""^^<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#XMLLiteral>" (1
double quote).

Let's please be careful... there is no
dependency on RDFS from RDF.

I thought we could get away with a combined
model theory spec, at least for a while.
But I think that time is ending.

And I'm starting to wonder about the primer...
ah; the primer is cited non-normatively
from that syntax draft; as long as we
do that, it can have both RDF and RDFS.
