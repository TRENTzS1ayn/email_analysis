Given that position, I can't support the Dting proposal. It seems
bizarre to single out zero-length strings for special treatment.

I _am_ aware that there's a cost involved with introducing
rdf:lexicalType (or, urg, an abbreviated form like rdf:ltype) but I
think it's a better approach than using rdf:type to do this.
