I agree.

While Patrick has just about shown that his solution is implementable I am 
aware that my code would have to jump through hoops to do so.

My judgment is that those hoops are indicative of grammars that are difficult 
for users to understand.

As an exmple, support someone forgets to put in the lexical value, then they 
do not get an error message because what they write matches a completely 
different grammar rule.
