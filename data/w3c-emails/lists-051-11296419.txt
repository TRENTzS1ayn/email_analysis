I would like to suggest that:
- any test cases with relative URIs should use XML Base
- any examples in any of our documents that use relative URIs should use XML 
Base
- that the syntax and primer documents should suggest that the use of XML Base 
is preferred.

Note: rdf:ID introduces relative URIs.

The sort of use that I envisage is that where a document on the web includes 
an xml:base declaration which gives the documents usual base URL.

Not including such base uris makes teh document ambiguous.

For example if I GET

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test001.rdf

then the triples that I find are those in

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test001.nt

However, if I get

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test001

then I get different triples, and these are not the ones in any nt file in the 
test area.

Similarly I might get

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test001.rdf

or

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-%61ttr/test001.rdf

and get different results.

(Sorry to raise this so late; I have only recently noticed this)
