I haven't understood the penultimate bullet (two ways) but otherwise agree 
with all of these points.

Patrick I think you need to concede with as much grace as possible at this 
point! No one has spoken in favour of rdf:type for datatyping other than you. 
You have a lot of support for your document, and this is relatively minor 
change being sought.
