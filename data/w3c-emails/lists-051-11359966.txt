The unicode string in an XML document which gives the lexical form of a 
datatype literal may well be in scope of an xml:lang declaration.

But the current proposals expect the parser to know whether it is parsing an 
old-style literal (in which case xml:lang is significant) or a new style 
literal, in which case it is not.

Thus

  <a:prop xml:lang="en" rdf:ltype="&xsd;string">banana</a:prop>

would deliver the value <xsd:string>"banana" and the language declaration has 
no effect. (If you want an xsd:string, you don't get a langstring.
