The datatyping spec already does. ;-)

However, if I get

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test001

then I get different triples, and these are not the ones in any nt file in the 
test area.

Similarly I might get

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test001.rdf

or

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-%61ttr/test001.rdf

and get different results.

(Sorry to raise this so late; I have only recently noticed this)
