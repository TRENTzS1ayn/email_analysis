It seems to me that only a very small portion of the normative
content of the datatyping spec needs mention in the other specs,
specifically those parts relating to the RDF/XML and graph
representations of typed literals.

It think it would be sufficient for the other specs to say
the minimal amount necessary and reference the datatyping
spec for elaboration, examples, etc.

Eh?
