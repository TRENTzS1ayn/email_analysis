No thanks.

With my parser-writer's and syntax editor's hats on,
in terms of parsing, adding a new namespace is not easier.
We already have all the other syntax-related terms in the rdf:
namespace.

Please just pick your favourite name to use in rdf: from this list, I
can add it to the rdf namespace, add it to the rdf/xml syntax and we
can move on:

  rdf:lType
  rdf:dType
  rdf:lexicalForm
  ...

Please.

I'd also suggest that rdfs:Datatype was better, it is where (most)
core RDF(S) vocabulary lives and where we have been updating
non-syntax-related vocabulary.

I don't see any particular reason to add a new namespace, now that we
are basically putting datatype support in core RDF.  It seems
odd now that we have what seems to be consensus for that choice.

rdfd:type vs rdf:dtype - not much difference there.  Adding a third
namespace means you have two wrong choices for any term.  Also
two 'type' words is bad; I guess I'm prefering a new rdf: name
without the word 'type' in it.
