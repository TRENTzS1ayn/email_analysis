I'd say, any test cases or examples with relative URIs should be
replace with absolute ones first (http://example.org/ etc)

For what cases?  I'd not introduce it unless necessary.  It means
that it is required to have a working (RDF compatible; passes the rdf
core xml-base tests) xml:base support before any other test can be
performed.

OK, only when that is present.  

[I thought we were preferring rdf:about="#foo" over rdf:ID="foo" - a
style issue, but the latter does provide some uniqueness checks.]

I counter-propose suggesting xml:base in test cases or examples when
rdf:ID is present and just recommending it when people feel like it
is useful to make all those long URLs shorter - not prefering it
to be present overall.

Er - don't do that :)

The manifest.rdf files list the absolute URLs to use.  We don't need
to engineer around using the wrong URLs for testing.
