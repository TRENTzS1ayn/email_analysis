Yep.

Yep; although it's odd to move the motivational material to the end.
Editorial stuff like this doesn't need WG approval.

I think this is an error; I've already put my position on this (ie, that
a string and a langstring would appear to be different types)

This does need clarification, yes. But hang on... you suggest that

     <eg:foo> <eg:age> (xsd:integer)"10".

might (with literals "at the blunt end") imply...

     (xsd:integer)"10" <rdf:type> <xsd:integer> .

But if "TypedLiteral" is the class of typed literals, then whenever

     <xsd:someType> <rdf:type> <rdf:Datatype> .

then we have that members of <xsd:sometype> are members of
rdfs:TypedLiteral, and hence members of rdfs:Literal. Which would kind
of imply (since subclassing is a relation of class extensions) that

     <xsd:integer> <rdf:type> <rdf:Datatype> .

implies

     <xsd:integer> <rdfs:subClassOf> <rdf:Literal> .

... which is why I suggested Datatype is a superfluous extension
(particularly since it seems that all literals should carry a type, but
I don't wish to descend into "dogmatic assertions" here :-) )

Yes, again I think the conversation that has arisen about of the
constraining nature or otherwise of rdf:domain and range is probably
going to happen with datatypes.

Yes - again, we need a bag for "here's stuff that we'd like to do".

Seems fine.

That's my tuppence :-)
