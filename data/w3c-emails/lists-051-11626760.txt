Your point of view is explicitly clear; however, I don't consider the
situation it describes to be "clear". I'll shut up though because I want
to hear what others have to say on this.

Yes, I like two of the the options you outlined in the appendixes for
treatment of inline literals - either pick a "default" type (which is
ugly but easy) or use the untidy "mutable type" option, which I find
quite compelling, although I confess I've not looked closely at
technical consequences.
