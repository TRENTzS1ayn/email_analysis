Fair enough. And sorry about any remaining unclarity, wherever it
may be.

Well, having a default type is either non-monotonic, if we allow later
schema assertions to change it, or is rather fragile process-wise, 
requiring great care in the order in which schemas are loaded into
the knowledge base. Either case is IMO unacceptable for real
world use (even if it technically could be made to work).

Having the implicit datatype denoted by a system identifier, similar
to bnode identifiers, seems a very elegant and clear way to model
literals as contextual names.

Of course, that presumes we *are* modelling them as contextual
names, which of course is the crux of the whole untidy/tidy debate,
whether inline literals are global names or contextual names...
