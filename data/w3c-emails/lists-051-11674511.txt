I think it's reasonable to view the desiderata as part of the process of 
arriving at a specification, rather than something that has to considered 
part of the final specification.

To the extent that they aid understanding (the motivation of) the spec, I 
think it's helpful to leave them.  But if we've dramatically scaled back 
the goals of datatyping, I don't think it necessarily helps to include them 
in the reduced document.
