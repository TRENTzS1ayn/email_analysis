 From your last message, it seems my understanding of syntactic datatyping 
is similar to yours.

In that framework, I'm not convinced that *either* of the following 
relations are needed.  I.e. I'm not convinced we need to say anything about 
the rdf:type or rdf:Class of xsd:integer at this time, since it appears 
(needs to appear) only as part of a purely syntactic construct.

Of course, if we're targeting more than purely syntactic datatyping, 
there's another story...
