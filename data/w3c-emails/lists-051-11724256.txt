Brian, Dan, Eric, et al.,

Apologies if RDF Core has already committed to review Namespaces 1.1
and I've forgotten.

Please note that your review is requested by September 28th.

If possible, I'd like a commitment from the WG to do so.

>XML namespaces provide a simple method for qualifying element and

>associating them with namespaces identified by IRI references.

>[Excerpts from the] Status of this Document
>-------------------------------------------
>The XML Core Working Group, with this Namespaces in XML 1.1 Last Call 
>working draft, invites comment on this specification. The Last Call 
>period begins 5 September 2002 and ends 28 September 2002.
>
>This document is a draft of a new 1.1 revision of the Namespaces in XML 
>specification. It incorporates several errata to the 1.0 specification, 
>and one substantive change: the provision of a mechanism to "undeclare" 
>prefixes. Since documents using this new feature will not work with 
>existing processors, this revision is being tied to the 1.1 revision of 
>XML itself. XML 1.0 documents must continue to use version 1.0 of this 
>specification. 
>
>===============
>
>The decision to go to Last Call is minuted at 
>http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2002JulSep/0175 .
>The last call review period ends 28 September 2002. Comments should be
>sent to xml-names-editor@w3.org.  
>
>Unless the review uncovers substantial problems, the next step 
>will be to recommend the document for publication as a Candidate 
>Recommendation.  We plan for the CR period to end concurrently
>with the end of the XML 1.1 CR period (expected to begin in October)
>which we expect to be in mid-February 2003.
>
>The XML Core WG welcomes comments from all during the Last Call
>period, but we particularly request that the follow WGs commit
>to providing whatever feedback they have by September 28th:
>
>* XML Schema
>* XML Query (already committed)
>* XSL (already committed)
>* DOM
>* I18N
>* HTML (already committed)
