Assuming the new approach to datatypes, broadly as described in Part 1 of 
Patrick's document, continues to enjoy the support of the WG, the WG may 
like to consider distributing the contents of part 1 amongst the other 
specifications.

It may seem a strange structure if, for example, the 'Concepts' document 
described the abstract syntax and concepts of RDF, but referred to a 
separate datatypes document for the datatypes bit.  And if it does not, 
then it must describe the complete abstract syntax and duplicate some of 
the datatypes document.  The same is true of the syntax document, the model 
theory, schema (I believe it is affected by datatypes now) and possibly the 
primer.

We are now in a position where datatypes are no longer layered on top of 
the core RDF data model, but are an integral part of it.  We could describe 
datatyping in the specs as follows:

   primer:     Introduction to using datatyped values in RDF
   syntax:     rdf/xml representation of datatype values
   concepts:   abstract syntax; concept of datatyped values
   schema:     datatype vocabulary definitions; effects on domain and 
range; relationship
               between literals and datatype literals
   model th:   model theory for datatype values
   test cases: n-triples

I'm planning to allow some time in tomorrows telecon to discuss this 
approach.  If it finds support, it would be great if we could to the point 
of the various doc editors having actions to update their docs to describe 
datatyping.
