I have already reviewed this.
My proposed comments would be something along the lines of ...

[[[
Our comments on the first working draft have been 
more than adequately addressed.
The namespaces 1.1 Last Call draft is compatible 
with the use of XML Namespaces by RDF.
In fact, we intend to copy your section 7, on IRIs verbatim,
unless you get to Rec before we get to last call.
]]]

I would put the copy in the Concepts and Abstract Data 
Model document.
