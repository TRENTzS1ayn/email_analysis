Actually, not for properties, I think, because EXT is only defined on IP.

I actually happen to not particularly like depending on the fact that EXT
is undefined on non-properties to make non-properties not be subPropertyOf
every property, so I support the change for properties too.  There are
other places in the model theory where the fact that something is not
defined is used.
