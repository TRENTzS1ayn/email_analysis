I'm not clear what you are saying here with "legacy systems which use
bare literals to refer to values".  Are you saying:

  <foo:prop>10</foo:prop>

would give different triples?

ie not
  _:a <http://example.org#prop> "10"
but something else:
  _:a <http://example.org#prop> _:b"10"

I can't yet work out how large the impact is of making all literal
nodes be a (basic node, literal) pair.  This obviously affects
N-Triples but I think it also changes all our test cases and every
piece of rdf code ever written.  Or am I misreading something?

I guess if as you suggested after Connolly [[ use the same bnode for
every literal in the entire world]] that would reduce the pain since
existing systems would implicitly be using that.


I'm also not sure if you haven't sort-of sneaked in literal subjects
which was a postponed issue:

[[
we are able to say things like

Jenny ex:age (_:y, "10") .
_:y rdf:type rdf:Datatype .
]]

The above isn't representable in RDF/XML (with datatypes attribute)
unless we add another one: rdf:datatypeNodeID
