Which document? 

 I had to look at the zip file attached to
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Aug/0100.html
then the one attached to
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Aug/0111.html

-----
Aside:

I'd prefer not attaching a zip of files, it means you can't point
at the documents on the web - they have no URI-refs :)
----

After extracting neither seems to have anything relevant in part 2
(2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

If you think
  Jenny ex:age (_:y, "10") .
  _:y rdf:type rdf:Datatype .

can be represented in RDF/XML (with rdf:datatype attribute), please
include it your email reply.  The crucial point is that rdf:datatype
takes uri-refs, not bnodes, so the bnode given to the "10" literal
cannot be assigned by the creator of the rdf/xml and hence is unknown
to the creator.
