I'd prefer not attaching a zip of files, it means you can't point
at the documents on the web - they have no URI-refs :)

Well, I cant post multi-component documents otherwise
to www-archive (e.g. graphics, CSS, etc.)

Normally, I would have used a directory on our
www-nrc.nokia.com server, but I was explicitly asked
to post the static versions to www-archive and
provide a URL there.

After extracting neither seems to have anything relevant in part 2
(2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

Not section 2, *part* 2.
