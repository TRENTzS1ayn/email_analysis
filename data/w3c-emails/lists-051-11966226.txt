Confirm status of witdrawn actions.

  2002-08-30#2 bwm: the datatype literal attribute seems resolved
  2002-08-30#4 bwm: backed off commenting to the DC architecture people


Agenda Item 8: status of new MIME type internet draft:

  See
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0221.html

  Aaron: was unfortunately beset by ill chance; hopefully everything
  should be ok by Sunday or Monday.


Item 9: review of NS last call.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0058.html

  jjc: responded positively, but feels that that positive feedback
       should come from the WG.

  ACTION 2002-09-06#1 bwm / get feedback to namespaces WG


Item 10: Datatypes

Discuss part 1 of Patrick's consensus building document
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0257.html
along with changes proposed in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0040.html

  This was met with positive noise from all present. Some editorial
  issues remain, however those are going to be pushed down to individual
  documents as the content of part 1 is distributed.

  RESOLVED: that rdf:datatype is the datatyping attribute in rdf/xml.

  ACTION 2002-09-06#2 daveb / add the rdf:datatype productions to the
syntax document

  [NOTE there will be knock-on effects with ntriples and abstract
model documents too to effect that change]

  The WG was unanimous in support of the opinion that, while the DT
document contents are better placed in existing documents,
that the sterling editorial efforts thus far should
not be lost to posterity.

  ACTION 2002-09-06#3 bwm / ensure credit for DT document contents is
not lost.

  Brian's proposed breakdown of document destinations here:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0061.html

  ACTION 2002-09-06#4 jjc / review material thus far on specifics of
rdfs:Datatype, rdfs:Literal and the abstract syntax of literals
and produce a proposal for wording in the Abs. Syntax document.

  PatS pointed out that there are still issues to consider: what to say
and/or do about inline literals, in particular (other issues
probably will be addressed by individual editors)

  ACTION 2002-09-06#5 bwm / as series editor: solicit aid from DT
document editor in assigning parts of the document to other
doc editors.


Item 11: relationship between XML Schema and RDF

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0165.html

  Eric pointed out that our charter requires us to address issues of the
relationship between RDF and XML, we should expect questions
like this.
  Jeremy said that much of this was still an open research issue
  There was mixed sympathy for the specific proposal regarding XMLSchema
namespaced attributed being ignored by RDF/XML.
  DaveB said that rather than this, he'd expect to see a general
namespace exclusion mechanism.
  Jeremy had some sympathy with making an exception for this namespace.
  DanBri proposed the following words in resolution:

  SUGGESTED RESOLUTION (no vote taken but support all round)

  That the possibility of excluding XML Scehma namespaced attributes
from RDF/XML might be considered in the future. However,
we currently see no compelling reason to expect to do this
now, or in the future.

The meeting closed.
