As discussed on the telecon, RDFS editors draft currently has an "@@ find
out what the MT says" TODO regarding this question. Can you let me know
what the current situation is, so RDFS can reflect that?

rdfs:member is a super-property of each of rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc. We call
these the container member properties, and have them as members of
rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty. Do we have rdfs:member in that class as
well?

I just want to make sure that RDFS echos what the MT thinks on this issue.
If there are concerns, we can flag those up in the MT document under
Status or in the appropriate section.

Thanks for any advice,

Dan
