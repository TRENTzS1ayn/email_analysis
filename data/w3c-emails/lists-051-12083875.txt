my understanding of "untyped" is "no type"
which is not the same as "unknown type"

I would say

  :jenny foo:age "10" .

i.e. no type

whereas e.g.

   <rdf:Description rdf:nodeID="jenny">
     <foo:age rdf:datatype="_:t">10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>

would be

  :jenny foo:age _:t"10" .

i.e. unknown type
