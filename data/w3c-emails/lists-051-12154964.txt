Well, I think this is fine if that's what the WG agrees on, though it seems 
a little counter-intuitive to me, for two reasons:

- it means that the internal structure of literal forms is not quite opaque 
to datatyping:  the "xml" flag has an effect.

- the language tag and xml flag are treated differently for the purposes of 
datatyping.

As I said, I don't have a deep problem with either of these even if I do 
have a mild dislike.  But I guess we should be clear about what we're deciding.
