In Patrick's Part I a datatyped valued is represented in the graph as a
pair: a URI and a unicode string in the lexical space.

My take is that what we were really heading for is that in the abstarct
syntax the graph node is labelled with the value.

The test case is:

<rdf:Description>
  <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;deciaml">2.00</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

is equal (i.e. syntactically)

<rdf:Description>
  <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;deciaml">2.0</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>


(I think it is also equal to

<rdf:Description>
  <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;int">2</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

but I would need to check the XSD specs)
