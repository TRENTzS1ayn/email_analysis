If we are going to do this, then let's be sure that
http://foo.com/blarg and http://FOO.COM/blarg are
both mapped to the same URIref node too, eh?

The RDF abstract syntax *cannot* provide representation
for values without groking the L2V mapping of specific
datatypes, and the nature and semantics of specific
datatypes are necessarily outside the scope of RDF.

We are not expecting RDF to know about datatypes anymore
so than we are expecting RDF to know about URI schemes.

All we are providing is an explicit and clear mechanism
for assertions to be made about specific datatype values
(whichever they might be, RDF can't say), which when combined 
with extra-RDF knowledge about the specific datatypes allows
applications to make determinations about those values, just
as applications which have extra-RDF knowledge about specific
URI schemes may make determinations about resources
that RDF itself cannot make (such that the above two
URIrefs denote the same thing).

I most certainly hope that we are *not* heading for
labeling typed literal nodes with values in the abstract
syntax, as I consider that heading for the rocks.

Lifejackets on, folks. Women and children to the boats
first...

As far as I understood it, last Friday's concensus vote
was based on labeling typed literal nodes with a pairing
of datatype designation and lexical form, not with values.

If you are proposing that we pull that stake out of the
ground and do something different, I think you need to
argue in terms of fatal flaws in how it is specified
at present.
