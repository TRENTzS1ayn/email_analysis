No, I think you have misunderstood. I am not reopening any issues.

In

<rdf:Description rdf:ID="subj" >
  <eg:p1 rdf:ID="statement">10</eg:p1>
  <eg:p2>10</eg:p2>
</rdf:Description>

There are three triples with "10" as object:

<#subj> <eg:p1> "10" .
<#subj> <eg:p2> "10" .
<#statement> <rdf:object> "10" .

My understanding of the model theory (any version) is that nothing special
links the interpretation of the "10" in the third triple to the
interpretation of the "10" in the first, which is not also true of the
second.

i.e. in a tidy model theory all three "10"'s are "10"; in an untidy model
theory all three "10"'s are unconstrained.
