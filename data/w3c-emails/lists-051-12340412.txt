Forgive me for not being clear.  Given your statement:

   [[
      rdf:object refers to the syntax of the triple not its semantics.
   ]]

Given:

   <rdf:Description rdf:bagID="bar" rdf:about="http://example.org/foo">
     <eg:foobar rdf:resource="http://example.org/bar"/>
   </rdf:Description>

are you suggesting that equivalent triples include

   _:stmt <rdf:object> "http://example.org/bar" .
