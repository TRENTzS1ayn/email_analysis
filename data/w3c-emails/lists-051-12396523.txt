I would like to ask the WG to join me in expressing our thanks for the 
monumental efforts that Pat Hayes, Sergey Melnick and Patrick Stickler have 
put into the work on datatypes for RDF. The work on datatypes began nearly 
a year ago.  I don't have the tools to determine how many email messages or 
how many document drafts there have been on the subject, but the answer is 
"a lot".  Hmmm, that looks like a lexical form of ... oh never mind that 
for now.

Many others have also contributed to the solution of this problem, but I 
felt that we should specifically acknowledge the contributions of the 
editors of the WD that is now, not to be.

What matters, is that they have led us to, what I believe, is an excellent 
solution and have accepted with exceptional grace that that solution is not 
best described in a separate document.

I have an action from the last telecon to ensure that these gentlemen 
receive appropriate acknowledgement for their efforts.  After consulting 
with Eric, I understand that the mechanism for acknowledging specific 
contributions to a specification, is to include an appropriate paragraph in 
the acknowledgements section of affected documents.

I suggest a paragraph similar to the following (better words welcome) be 
included in the primer, syntax, concepts, schema and model theory documents.

[[

The method described in the RDF family of specifications for representing 
datatype values such integers and  dates, was developed under the 
leadership of Pat Hayes, Sergey Melnik and Patrick Stickler.
