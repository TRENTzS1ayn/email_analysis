I'd be surprised if we did.  We would have to check the text over carefully 
for phrases like "membership of a container is indicated by a container 
membership property ..."

As I recall, we made a decision to have a superproperty, but not that the 
superproperty was a container membership property.

But Pat seemed to indicate at the telecon there were reasons why it had to be.
