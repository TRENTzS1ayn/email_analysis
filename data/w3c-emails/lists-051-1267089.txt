My understanding is:

   - Pat asked the question recently
   - there has been no formal decision
   - Jeremy argued there was in effect because

a b "foo"

entails

a b _:l .

"foo" must be a resource.

I don't grok that one myself.

   - Pat got various bits of feedback
   - whatever the MT says is what Pat is recommending
   - we make the decision by endorsing or not the MT.
   - I hope he recommends we say nothing on the subject this time round 
otherwise we'll get a load of questions asking how to express literals as 
subjects in rdf/xml.  I'd rather we said nothing, or maybe gave the 
implementors some advice to allow for it happening in the future, but not now.

And I'm too tired to go look up what Pat actually decided.
