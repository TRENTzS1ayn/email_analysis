I think I caused the confusion
(too much other math formulae work)
We just have

IF
  ?x a rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty.
THEN
  ?x rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:member.

and I can't find a proof for
  rdfs:member a rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty .

sorry for any confusion

I'd be surprised if we did.  We would have to check the text over carefully

for phrases like "membership of a container is indicated by a container
membership property ..."

As I recall, we made a decision to have a superproperty, but not that the
superproperty was a container membership property.

But Pat seemed to indicate at the telecon there were reasons why it had to
be.
