I quite like this fudge.

I think Patrick exagerates the extent to which one shouldn't discard
original intent. (comments do get stripped). But given the decision that the
execution of the l2v mapping is outside of RDF (which I think sounded like
the majority opinion at the telecon), we can't use c14n inside equality.
