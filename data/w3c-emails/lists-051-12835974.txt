I've been collecting together the feedback on the RDF concepts working 
draft published 2002-08-20, and have published an issue list here:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/DocIssues/RDFConceptIssues.html

At this time, I'd like to ask WG members if there are any issues that I've 
overlooked.  The source of my information so far is recent comments on the 
RDFcore WG list, and feedback send to RDF-comments.

The HTML has been auto-generated from source data in Notation3, which can 
be found at:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/DocIssues/RDFConceptIssues.n3
The HTML generator is pretty scrappy at the moment, and I need to add some 
extra features to my query processor to handle document- and issue tracking 
histories, but I think the issue list is just about adequate for review 
purposes.  The HTML generator software (Python source) is linked from 
http://www.ninebynine.org/Software/Intro.html, file
