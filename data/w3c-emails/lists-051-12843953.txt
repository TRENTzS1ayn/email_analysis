Just so folks know that our efforts are appreciates, in

    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002JulSep/0188.html

along with a bunch of detailed and helpful comments, Bob DuCharme says

[[Overall it's very good, and there are a lot of bad explanations of RDF in 
the world, so it's needed. Of the parts labeled "@@" listing new material 
to be added, I think some of those anticipated parts are too ambitious--in 
othe words, they will require enough work that it's not worth holding up 
the progress of this much-needed document.

...

  I think that the Primer is well-positioned for a technical audience.
