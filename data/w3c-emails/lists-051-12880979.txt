Noting that the test case was not in the repository, and finally getting round 
to adding this to ARP, and using an extreme programming style of starting 
with the tests, I applied the edits above to the test case above and created:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-seq-representation/test001.rdf
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-seq-representation/test001.nt
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-seq-representation/Manifest.rdf

The server seems to be down, so I can't check the permissions right now.

Hope this is helpful.

Jeremy
