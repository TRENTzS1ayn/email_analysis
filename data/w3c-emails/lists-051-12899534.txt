My perception is this:  M&S is not clear, so neither choice is a *change* 
to M&S.

Value based semantics:
   corresponds to the readings of M&S by those doing "information design"
   (e.g. CC/PP, DC, etc.)

String based semantics:
   corresponds to the readings of M&S by those doing software implementations
   (e.g. cwm, Jena, etc.)

Thus, whatever choice me make, it will break *someone's* code and/or data.

I favour value-based semantics, because I think this more closely matches 
the intuitions that are invoked when populating the semantic web, which I 
think will, in the longer run, be the biggest task.

But (given datatyped literals) I think either approach can work.
