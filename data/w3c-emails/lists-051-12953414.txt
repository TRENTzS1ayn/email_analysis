>As previously mentioned [1], [2], at the request of the I18N WG [3],
>the XML Core WG has been considering whether the explicit licensing
>of the use of xml:lang="" to "un-declare" a language should be made
>an erratum to XML 1.0 or merely included as part of XML 1.1.
>
>The XML Core WG has debated this issue thoroughly, seeked the
>input of various groups (including chairs, XML Plenary, and
>various public email groups), and canvased current implementations.
>
>It has been decided that the optimal situation is to issue this as an
>erratum to the XML 1.0 spec.  Hence, you can see this reflected in the
>current Errata document at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E41 .
>
>The XML Core WG thanks all who provided feedback in this decision.
