In constructing code to process containers, I am finding it difficult to 
reliably process members of an rdf:Seq in the sequence order.

By comparison, ordered processing of the rdf:parseType="Collection" form is 
easy.

Which makes me wonder if there's a case for deprecating rdf:Seq.   (I see 
no problem with rdf:Bag or rdf:Alt in this respect, because there's no 
complete ordering to worry about.)
