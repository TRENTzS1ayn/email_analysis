No.  I do not see the point of re-opening that closed issue at this
stage.  We decided a long time ago not to design a *replacement*
container mechanism for Seq, Bag and Alt.  I would say that rdf:Seq
is the most used of the constructs of RDF/XML outside the basic node
and property element and attribute parts.

I see rdf:parseType="Collection" as a complex mechanism more
appropriate for layering, working in a logic or inference style.
