I don't think this is a big deal either way, but note that you argued
against this in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jun/0229.html

In fact that thread is quite interesting:

Jan:
[[
If rdfs:subClassOf is pronounced
"rdfs:subSETOf" then we ought to consider fixing the spelling.
]]

DanC:
[[
Which part of our
spec allows you to conclude the rdfs:range triple?
]]

PatH:
[[
In fact, your entailments aren't even
valid, because two different classes can have the same class
extension.
]]

PatH:
[[
That would be disastrous for the datatyping and in any case not
make sense.
]]

At the time I was somewhat persuaded by Peter's view ...
