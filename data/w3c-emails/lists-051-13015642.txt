Pat,

I don't have any problem with the proposed change, but I'm a little puzzled 
by your explanation.

Looking at the words, I read "A rdfs:subClassOf B is true in I  if 
ICEXT(I(A)) is a subset of ICEXT(I(B))" to mean the second part implies the 
first.  Thus I don't recognize the possible concern that A's class 
extension being a subclass of B's class extension could allow A 
rdfs:subClassOf B to be false.
