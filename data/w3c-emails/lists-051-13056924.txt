I've been thinking not.  We decided to include support for a 
daml:collection like list structure.  The question of alternative designs 
for contains is more general.  A future WG may consider this more general 
question and conclude that with parseType="Collection" no more is needed, 
or they may conclude otherwise.  That just seems like territory we have 
decided not to consider and in the interests of getting done I'm inclined 
to leave it that way.

Thoughts?

Brian
