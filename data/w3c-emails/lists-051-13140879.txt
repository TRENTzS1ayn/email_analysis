Looks like another last call doc or review from the XMLP folks.  Any 
volunteers to review on behalf of the WG?

>The XML Protocol WG is planning to submit one document, "SOAP 1.2
>Attachment Feature", for Last Call review. The abstract reads:
>
>This document defines a SOAP feature that represents an abstract model for
>SOAP attachments. It provides the basis for the creation of SOAP bindings
>that transmit such attachments along with a SOAP envelope, and provides for
>reference of those attachments from the envelope. SOAP attachments are
>described using the notion of a compound document structure consisting of a
>primary SOAP message part and zero or more related documents parts known as
>attachments.
>
>The document is short, about 8 pages including references and boilerplate,
>and does not specify any particular implementation for attachments. The LC
>document will be a very slightly modified version of the current WD [1]. We
>would especially like reviews from the following WGs: I18N, QA, Semantic
>Web (WG's therein), Web Services Architecture, Web Services Description,
>XForms, XML Core, XML Encryption, and XML Signature. My question to those
>WGs (and to any other interested WGs) is whether you would be _unable_ to
>provide a review if the LC period started around Sept 23 and ended around
>Oct 14.
