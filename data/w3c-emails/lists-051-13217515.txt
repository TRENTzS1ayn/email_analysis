I'm suggesting to treat strings with xml:lang specifiers as a new 
datatype (call it "language-tagged string"), disjoint with xsd:string. 
Similarly, XML infosets should simply be yet another datatype, disjoint 
with any other XSD datatype.

These two datatypes were essentially defined as such in the original RDF 
spec. Now that we have a general-purpose datatyping mechanism, we can 
make use of it. The two datatypes should get their own URIs.

If there is enough support for that, I'd like to put the above point for 
vote at the next telecon.

The current proposal for representing typed values in the abstract 
syntax (URI + string) fails for the above datatypes. Therefore, I'm also 
suggesting that this overspecification is not required. In the abstract 
syntax, typed literals may be kept as opaque constants, whereas the 
applications may use their internal representation of choice.
