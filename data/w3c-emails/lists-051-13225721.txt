Er... as far as making group decisions, we're supposedly done.
We've disposed of all our issues.
I'd really rather not put new issues in the ciritcal path.

Maybe you can just work with the editors to make this a
natural consequence of the decisions we made on datatyping;
it seems reasonably consistent with what we discussed.

i.e. in stead of suggesting this for the WG agenda, I suggest
you just take it straight to the editors.

which proposal is that, exactly? I gather the status quo
(i.e. what exactly the WG has decided)
is rather sparsely documented (e.g. the whole discussion
of tidy/untidy options was reduced to pretty much one bit
in today's telcon record), and the editors have actions
to figure out all the details.
