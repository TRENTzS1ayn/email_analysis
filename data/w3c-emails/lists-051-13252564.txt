I think that even though they may be different lists (containing different 
graph nodes), if IR is closed under list construction and the given 
semantics for rdf:first, rdf:rest then each must entail the other -- by 
virtue always being true.

Tricker, I think, is how one gets the expected entailments when a list is 
related to some other entity -- I guess the OWL folks will have to sort 
that one.
