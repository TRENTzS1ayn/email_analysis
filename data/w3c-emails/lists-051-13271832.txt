Yes, rdf:datatype (since it is a syntax thing, and all the other
syntax "scaffolding" is in rdf:)

Part of RDF since it will be one of the core literal types
(exact set yet to be decided)

I think you can explain it before getting to rdfs:Datatype since
it gives you the URI for the dataype-uri slot of a literal
(mutter, also we haven't decided this, hurry up guys!)

As you say, until you explain how schemas work, how defining
datatypes is possible, the full power doesn't become apparent.
