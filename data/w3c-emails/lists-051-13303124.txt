Overall, I like the proposal. A few questions below:

Change 4

FROM
langString ::= '"' string '"' ( '-' language )?
TO
langString ::= ( nodeID )* '"' string '"' ( '-' language )?

Should there be a klene star after nodID? Isn't the
nodeID required? And we wouldn't want more than
one, right? 

Change 5

FROM
xmlString ::= 'xml' langString
TO
xmlString ::= ( nodeID )* 'xml' langString

Again, should the be a klene star after nodeID? Also,
shouldn't there be some clear delimitation between the nodeID
and the 'xml' flag? I.e., is the following an xml literal or a non-xml
literal?  _:hdjhewuwqxml"foo"  How do you know for sure?

Cheers,

Patrick
