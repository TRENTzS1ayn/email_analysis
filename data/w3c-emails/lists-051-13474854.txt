Perhaps this is true for 2-5, but I don't think it is true for 1. And
if inline literal nodes were syntactically tidy, then 2-5 would preclude
untidy semantics.

Thus, the essential point here is that if 2-5 reflect "the conclusions
of elementary mathematics" then 1 must be adopted if we are to have
untidy semantics of inline literals.

I.e. inline literals must have systemIDs or some other means of
globally unique label.
