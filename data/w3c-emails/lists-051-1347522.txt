Pat,

just to let you know that I am now too tired to write up my scribblings.

There were no issues that I saw as critical.

I have got a number of typos etc.
I have one large deletion (the graph syntax bit).
I have some discussion points about other overlap with concepts (assertions,
datatypes, rdfs:XMLLiteral - that last one is close to critical, but all
that means is I like my text about XML much more than yours, so that's
subjective really)
I have a suggestion for restructuring and strengthening the recommendations
made to people extending the rdf collection and rdf reificiation
vocabularies.

However, I will send details tomorrow. Sorry to keep you in suspense.

Jeremy
