Fair enough. I interpret it as a voice of support, and I hope that the 
editors are taking notes...

I'm referring to the pair vs. value decision taken at that telecon. As 
far as I understand the issue, "pair" means that typed values are 
represented as pairs in the abstract syntax, e.g. (URI, string). "Value" 
means that typed values are opaque constants in the graph (applications 
are free to represent them however they like). The group voted for "pairs".

My observation is that there is no room in a (URI, string) pair to keep 
e.g., an xml:lang value, if the language-tagged strings is a separate 
datatype. My suggestion to the editors is to make the pairs more 
flexible, e.g., (URI, something).
