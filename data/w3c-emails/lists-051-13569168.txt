Language-tagged strings in RDF are not subtypes of xsd:strings, and 
aren't subtypes of xsd:tokens either. Is that what you are claiming? In 
mathematical terms, there is no total injective function from 
language-tagged strings to xsd:string...

No, it cannot be a subtype of string. It can only be a derived type 
defined over a cross-product xsd:string x xsd:string.

Of course, therefore language-tagged strings should be a separate 
datatype. I don't see any utility of making the language attribution 
orthogonal to datatyping.
