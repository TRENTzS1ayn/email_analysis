Yes. Datatypes are formal languages with very precise intepretations
of their lexical representations. And we often mix formal and natural
language intepretations for the same lexical representation. See below.

I'll take your word for it ;-)

Ummm, isn't a derived type a subtype? Perhaps we need a mini-glossary
for this discussion.

I've already given one example of how one may wish to constrain
property values to datatypes other than xsd:string and still
specify the language in question.

We may wish to say that the datatype for a given property (or literal)
is a token list, or an XML name, or some other string-derived
datatype, yet also state that values of that property (or the 
particular literal) has meaning according to a particular language.

These two types of attribute, datatype and language, are disjunct; even
though there are similarities in the machinery of datatyping and 
natural language.

And though there is not presently any notable interest (that I can
tell) for datatyping XML literals, should we do so, then the disjunct
relationship of complex (structured) typing and language attribution
becomes even clearer.
