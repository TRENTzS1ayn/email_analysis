Reading what you say below, perhaps you are not dissenting.  The question 
put was:

[[
  where you have an rdf;descipriton element containing a property element 
of <age>10</age> is that tidy or untidy.
]]

You are objecting to

   <a> <b> "foo" .

being untidy but that

   <a> <b> _:dt"foo" .

is ok.

Then, the question as put, if it translated to:

   <something> <age> _:dt"10" .

would you be ok with that?
