>is rdfs:member a rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty?

no.

The rdf:_NN are bastards and having a clean way (not URI inspection) of
distinguishing them from more honest born properties is a high want.


Thus

xxx rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMemberShipProperty .

iff

xxx has a uri being the concatenation of rdf:_ and a positive integer in
canonical form

(does anyones code flag rdf:_007 as not an expected rdf property?)
