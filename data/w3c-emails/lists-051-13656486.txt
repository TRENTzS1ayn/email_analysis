Jos, which are you trying to express here:

1. That <something> has <someproperty> with the value denoted by "somestring".
2. That <something> has <someproperty> with the value of the string "somestring".

???

If 1, then the untidy, implicitly datatyped form is relevant:

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="#something">
      <someproperty>somestring</someproperty>
   </rdf:Description>

which equates to

   <something> <someproperty> _:x"somestring" .


If 2, then you should specify the datatype, locally or
globally, to explicitly assert the string datatype. E.g.

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="#something">
      <someproperty rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">somestring</someproperty>
   </rdf:Description>

which equates to

   <something> <someproperty> <http://...#string>"somestring" .

or alternately

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="#something">
      <someproperty>somestring</someproperty>
   </rdf:Description>
   <rdf:Description rdf:about="#someproperty">
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&xsd;string"/>
   </rdf:Description>

which equates to

   <something> <someproperty> _:y"somestring" .
   <someproperty> rdfs:range xsd:string .

which by the datatyping model theory, is semantically
equivalent to the locally typed case.

And note the compatability of the above two forms of expression. In
both cases, the literal node denotes some value, and whether that
value correlates to the lexical form in the label or some other
value is simply a matter of which datatype is specified.

Do you consider this a good or bad thing, that one could
use rdf:nodeID to refer to a particular occurrence of
an inline literal? It seems a useful and innocuous feature
to me.

Cheers,

Patrick
