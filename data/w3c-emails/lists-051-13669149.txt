It also needs to be pointed out that systemID prefixed
literals are proposed for the abstract syntax and N-Triples,
not for N3.

N3 is perfectly free to provide more user-friendly forms
of expression, such as allowing the omission of the
systemID prefix for inline literals, with the understanding
that each such non-prefixed literal string results in 
a uniquely labeled node in the graph. I.e. the N3 triple

   <something> <someproperty> "somestring" .

becomes the N-Triple

   <something> <someproperty> _:x"somestring" .

etc.
