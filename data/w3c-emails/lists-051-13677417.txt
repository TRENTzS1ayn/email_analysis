none of the above Patrick, just
3. the object of that statement *is* the typeless lexical form "somestring"

I think we need the primitive notion of a typeless lexical form
which is just denoting itself and of course it could be paired
with a rdfs:Datatype to describe a datatyped value but it must
also exist independently I think and identified with itself

PS again sorry Brian, but our Lotus Notes seems to deform
   your name To: "Brian McBride <bwm" <bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com>
   which is causing some trouble I guess, so I corrected the CC
