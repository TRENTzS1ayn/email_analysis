Well, any literal that is typed as xsd:string or a similar datatype
serves this purpose, does it not? Specifying that the datatype
of the literal is a string is synonymous with the tidy interpretation
of the literal denoting its lexical form component.

The lexical form of the string typed literal maps to the string value
that is identitical to the lexical form (i.e the mapping is equality).

Thus xsd:string"foo" with untidy semantics is equivalent to "foo" with
tidy semantics.

In essence, string typing provides tidy semantics, but you just have
to say that's what you want.

Perhaps I'm not fully understanding you. I'm still struggling to
see the added utility of the "typeless" literal over the string
typed literal, apart from perhaps syntactic sugar so one doesn't
have to type as much. They seem to be functionally equivalent.

What am I missing?

Patrick
