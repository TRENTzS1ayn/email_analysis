The way I tend to think of the tidy position on this is that the mapping is 
defined in the definition of the property.  Its not that its necessarily 
private or unlicensed but it is unavailable to a generic RDF processor.  As 
an example, the cc/pp bitsPerPixel property could be defined to be:

   A string which is the decimal representation of the integer number of 
bits per pixel
