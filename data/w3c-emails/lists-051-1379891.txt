Actions 2002-11-01#7, 2002-11-01#8, 2002-11-01#12 bwm were completed.

The concepts document was submitted to the pubteam, completing
2002-11-01#1.

Dave Beckett noted that he was preparing another draft of the syntax
document for publication, but 2002-11-01#2 was completed.

Frank Manola said that he's put up a new draft of the primer with all
critical changes.
DECIDED: Publish primer with editor's discretion
ACTION Eric Miller: publish RDF primer document

Brian McBride noted that he'd cleaned up the HTML of the Model Theory
and placed a copy in the archive. This is the copy that should be
reviewed by Monday night.
ACTION Graham Klyne: review model theory draft by Monday night
ACTION Jeremy Carroll: review model theory draft by Monday night
DECIDED: publish model theory with editor's discretion
ACTION Eric Miller: publish model theory upon receipt from editor

The abstract syntax currently uses the term RDF URI reference for an
absolute IRI with optional fragment identifier. Dan Connolly (in email)
didn't like this. Jeremy suggested we call them absolute URI
references. Aaron Swartz said that this would be confusing, since they
aren't necessarily URI references.
DECIDED: Every document would define URIRef when introducing it with
the special RDF meaning.
ACTION Jeremy Carroll: write up boilerplate to define URIRef with the
special RDF meaning.

Dan Brickley was very happy with the current RDF Schema draft and
noticed it was the one document getting shorter.
ACTION Jos DeRoo: review RDF Schema draft by Monday
ACTION Brian McBride: review RDF Schema draft by Monday
DECIDED: publish RDF Schema with editor's discretion
ACTION Eric Miller: publish RDF Schema upon receipt from editor

Most of the work on the Test Cases document has been done;
only section 3 is being updated.  More work on the test cases themselves
is required.   Eric Miller noted that frequent updates to the Editor's Draft
with messages to developers via the rdf-ig email list will be important to
avoid a long Candidate Review period.
ACTION Dave Beckett: add ntriples to test cases, archive review copy by Monday morning
ACTION Jeremy Carroll: review Test Cases draft by Monday
ACTION Jos DeRoo: review Test Cases draft by Monday
DECIDED: publish Test Cases with editor's discretion
ACTION Eric Miller: publish Test Cases upon receipt from editor

Our schedule is very tight, but we seem to be meeting it so far.
Jeremy suggested an extra week to focus on trimming our documents.
Next week's telecon is expected to focus on the documents.  We'll
check our schedule progress then.
