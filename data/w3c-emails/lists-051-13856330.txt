I would like the meeting record to reflect that the chair asked who 
intended to formally dissent depending on the outcome.  If the decision was 
tidy, Nokia intended to dissent.  If the decision was untidy, W3C intended 
to dissent.

I also see from the irc log

pls let the record show that we haven't heard from adobe, and that danbri 
doesn't think we can conclude much about their implementation.
[14:25:09] danb_lap
