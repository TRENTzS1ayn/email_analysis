Actually, it is rdfs:name that is not a property.  Instead rdfs:label is a
property.  (I changed from name to label above.)

Section 2.3.5 of RDFSS (2000 version).    Also in the new RDFS document.

By the way, explicit domains and ranges are given for most RDFS properties
in the new RDFS document, even when they are rdfs:Resource.  The only
exceptions are the ranges of rdf:object, rdfs:member, and rdf:value.  (I
don't recall seeing rdf:value in the RDF MT.)
