Two points:

   o We have the issue of rdfms-assertion.  The director wants RDF 
statements to carry weight in court and I suspect nonmon would seriously 
undermine that:

    But m'lord, those RDF statements should have been interpreted in the 
light of this schema, which clearly removes the assertion that the number 
of pornographic images on this page is 0.

   o Was it Guha who said at a f2f, that a wise man once told him that 
being a little bit non-monotonic was like being a little bit pregnant.
