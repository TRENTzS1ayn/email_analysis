"Just" fixing isn't an appropriate phrase, when applied to existing
data, existing software (rdf apis), existing software (applications
written to those apis) or anything else, in this matter. Attaching
deprecatory adjectives like "legacy" doesn't lessen the impact of
changes, anywhere, which are _all_ nontrivial. If they weren't, there'd
be a lot less angst over decisions like this.
