I think it all boils down to whether we want inference engines
to function more like Google, with potentially lots of false
positives which *might* be useful, or like a reasoning engine
where a positive result can be trusted (insofar as the quality
and integrity of the knowledge base) and the inability to obtain
a result simply means more information is needed.

If the former, then non-mon is OK. If the latter, then it's not,
and that includes within the RDF layer as well as between RDF and 
higher layers.

I myself have always presumed that SW agents would exhibit
the latter behavior. Otherwise, where would we find any
semblence of trust or authenticity by which non-trivial
decisions would be made by SW agents on our behalf. If we are to 
have a future where we deploy SW agents to do real-world tasks for 
us, I'd prefer that they wouldn't be guessing.
