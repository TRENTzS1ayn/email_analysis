I think the monotonicity issue is an important one, but I also think we 
need to be careful about drawing conclusions about it from these "real 
world" applications (like RDF statements having weight in court).  I 
believe the full statement of this requirement is along the lines that 
RDF statements should have the same sort of weight in court as natural 
language ones, e.g., those that might be made in ads or newspaper 
articles.  In other words, we're not trying to impose more of a 
requirement on RDF than we impose on other kinds of statements.  At the 
same time, we need to cater to omputer reasoners, rather than requiring 
the capabilities of human reasoners.
