> Well, the decision has been made

as scribe I was unclear what to make of the chairs message "On Consensus", 
which is why I thought it worth linking it from the minutes.

As WG member I would support the chair in taking into account Jos's uncast 
vote and unmaking the decision (should the chair so desire).
Also,  I would have resisted the making of a decision with so much dissent if 
that dissent had been visible.
