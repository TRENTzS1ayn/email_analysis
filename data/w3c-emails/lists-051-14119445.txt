I would have said tidy, no doubt about that
and Jeremy actually made a very useful summary in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0256.html
(I'm especially concerned for the cases where
it's not just a one step producer-consumer thing
but a fractal web of those, with exchange of proofs
to convince each other or some such and therefore
we should have unambiguity and monotonicity out there)
