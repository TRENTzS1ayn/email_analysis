As a member of the RSS-DEV working group, and a co-author of the RSS 1.0 
  spec, I feel pretty confident in saying that the RSS spec doesn't have 
a well worked out position on way or the other. You can use RSS and 
extend it with other RDF namespaces in any way you like. The RSS 1.0 
built-in properties are, in my experience, perfectly deployable from a 
tidy perspective. I don't think there's much mileage to be gotten from 
trying to co-opt RSS as strong evidence one way or another in this 
debate. But if you want an RSS perspective on our current troubles: the 
main thing that RSS needs from RDF Core is some cleaned up specs, as 
swiftly as possible, rather than spending a couple more months polishing 
our understanding of subtle and obscure issues to do with literals. 
RSS-DEV is a very practical-minded group and I fear would view our 
current debate as needles-on-pinheads...
