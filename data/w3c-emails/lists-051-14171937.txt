This is the usual weekly call for items for this weeks telecon 
agenda.  Please let me have them by noon UK time on Thursday.

On my current list of possibles I have:

o moving on after last weeks vote - I expect to ask our team contact for 
advice on appropriate next steps

o Writing up the rationale for the tidy/untidy decision

o Abstract syntax for untidy literals
