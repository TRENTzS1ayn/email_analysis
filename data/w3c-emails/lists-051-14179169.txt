well there was/is some discussion in WebOnt w.r.t.
"possible semantic bugs concerning domain and range"
actually quite a substantial thread (40 msg or so) started
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Sep/0307.html
and there was something on this list as well started by
Jeremy I think and I made an attempt as well finished in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0236.html

my belief is currently what Pat has made and
per conjunctive semantics one can further constrain
the property domain/range to make it very sharp

This is the usual weekly call for items for this weeks telecon
agenda.  Please let me have them by noon UK time on Thursday.

On my current list of possibles I have:

o moving on after last weeks vote - I expect to ask our team contact for
advice on appropriate next steps

o Writing up the rationale for the tidy/untidy decision

o Abstract syntax for untidy literals
