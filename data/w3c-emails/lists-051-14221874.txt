Jos, not to give you a hard time or anything, but I'm confused.

In http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0235.html

you respond to Brian in a way that I understood as being OK
with Friday's decision, so long as the untidyness was reflected
in the node labels:

---

right, the latter is untidy
thanks for the clarification Brian

of course I would

So while I understand that you still have a desire for some
form of "global string constant literal", other than a URIref,
you do not appear opposed to the idea of a distinctly labeled,
implicitly typed, untidy literal nodes which denote values
and not strings.

Eh?
