of course not (just that "implicitly typed" is there
too much, should better be "unknown typed" I guess)
as that was "Brian's birthday present" you remember
i.e. datatyped literals but with an explicit/unambiguous
syntax

besides that I think we need a clarification of that
"global string constant literal" or "self-identifier"
or "tidy literal" or "inline literal" or whatever
you call it and I think (after rereading Sergey's
messages several times) we are close to that
