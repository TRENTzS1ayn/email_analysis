Oh, then my question must not have been clear.  You claim that XMP is 
untidy.  I am asking whether there is an objective test whether an API is 
tidy or not.

That is a valid question, right?

I think I see what you mean.  But the question remains, is there a way of 
expressing the entailment in the XMP API.

Ok, fine - that is the test you are applying.  Could you take a look at the 
Jena API and tell us what conclusion you reach when applying the same test.
