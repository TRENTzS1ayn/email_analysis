Hmmm, you don't seem to have responded to this.

Yet that is not the result the test you described in:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0300.html

would give.  I'm having a little trouble understanding what consistent test 
you are applying.

I suggested in:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0284.html

  [[model.contains(c, d, a.getProperty(b).getObject())]]

was an accurate representation of the entailment.  Would you accept that?
