The question was:

   Is the above expression an accurate representation of the entailment in 
the jena API?

I think that is a question which deserved a yes/no answer.  If you answer 
yes, then we can look for an equivalent in XMP.  I am not sure what your 
answer means.

Also you haven't responded to my difficulty in understanding what 
consistent test you are applying to reach your conclusions.

I doesn't seem like this discussion is making progress.  Time to end it 
perhaps.
