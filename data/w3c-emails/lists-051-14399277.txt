OK. The short answer is yes, but it is you, and not Jena
that is presuming string based semantics.

It was an ambiguous question and I have been attempting
to clarify the question in my response.

Your example  does not represent a predisposition of the Jena API
towards  string based interpretation of
inline literals but only illustrates that one *could* implement
an application using the Jena API which exibits such a
predisposition. One could also do the opposite in Jena.
Jena itself doesn't promote either view.

I can't say it any clearer than that.

Patrick

The question was:

   Is the above expression an accurate representation of the entailment in 
the jena API?

I think that is a question which deserved a yes/no answer.  If you answer 
yes, then we can look for an equivalent in XMP.  I am not sure what your 
answer means.

Also you haven't responded to my difficulty in understanding what 
consistent test you are applying to reach your conclusions.

I doesn't seem like this discussion is making progress.  Time to end it 
perhaps.
