The question that this raises, then, is whether it is you, and not the
adobe API, that is presuming value-based semantics :-)

Sorry for the flippancy, but you appear to be saying that evidence from
examining an API is primarily based on the views of the examiner.

The examples you've uncovered are interesting, though: do they support
the notion that the adobe api has value, not string-based semantics for
datatyped literals?
