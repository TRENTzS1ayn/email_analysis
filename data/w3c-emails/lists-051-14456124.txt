Oh dear, that's not the same question at all.  If we were going to ask 
Adobe, it would have been useful to agree the question first.

Oh come, now Brian. It precisely matches the structure
and semantics of the generic entailment. Given two
occurrences of the same inline literal with two different
properties, can we conclude that the interpretation of the
literal in both cases is the same.

If one presumes that the inline literals denote strings, then
the answer is yes. If one presumes that the literals denote
values, then the answer depends on the context of
interpretation, and in my example to Adobe, that context
leads to an answer of no.

If two properties were chosen which happened to assert
the same datatype, then the answer would be yes, and we
wouldn't be any the wiser about the presumptions leading
to that answer. This is why this particular entailment
question is problematic. Because one may arrive at a
yes answer based both on tidy and untiidy presumptions,
if the properties do not force consideration of the context
of interpretation.

I think that the comments from Adobe are more than
sufficiently clear, that XMP employs a value based
interpretation if inline literals in precisely the same
fashion as CC/PP.
