I believe this is the kind of reality this group needs to confront.

As long as we continue to throw more needless things into the core like 
this, we will confuse and alienate such key developers. If this working 
group wants RDF to be popular, it should focus on simplifying it rather 
than make it more complicated.

As XMP demonstrates, if apps want to do value-based comparisons, they 
will do so with or without a decision from us. Let's stop enforcing 
complexity on all for the benefit of few.
