Eric asked in a honest way

I found Eric's message to be quite congenial and
diplomatic, but did not percieve any such request
in its content.

On behalf of Nokia, I again  ask for formal arguments 
from those proponents of tidy semantics.My collegues
have expressed interest in reviewing such arguments
and I myself am unnable to concieve of any that would
be motivating. So those who have strong support
of tidy could and should provide these to the WG.

Surely there must be at least one good argument in
support of tidy, other than the inconvenience of having
to modify code, which folks have had to do alot of
anyway and I don't recall any loud complaints before...

so let's have a *silent* look and give what he asks

No sir. The proponents of tidy semantics have a clear
obligation to (attempt to) demonstrate the superiority
of their position if any decision is to be made on this
issue.

Otherwise, I repeat my earlier proposal, that the MT
assign no interpretation to inline literals whatsoever,
such that no entailments involving inline literals can
be made and they remain semantic "wildcards" and,
for now, dependent on extra-RDF application layers
for interpretation. Likewise, whether rdfs:range
assertions apply to inline literals is up to the 
application.

Maybe it then can be sorted out for RDF 2.0
after some additional implementational experience.
