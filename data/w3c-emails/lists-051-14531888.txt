I'd have preferred the question be asked in terms of neutral names as in 
the original:

   <a> <b> "foo" .
   <c> <d> "foo" .

As expressed, knowledge about the properties you have picked, built into 
XMP may have influenced the answer. 

But Brian, it is *precisely* that built in knowledge we are
testing! Does XMP interpret those literals as denoting
stings or values.

 I'm also not at all happy with the 
accompanying words.

I'm not so sure any words would have been acceptable
if the end result was support for value bases semantics.
