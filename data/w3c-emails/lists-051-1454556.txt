Well, strictly its not actually *redundant*, since range has 'if' 
semantics. So for example if we don't say that the range of 
rdf:object is rdfs:Resource, it is quite possible for rdf:object to 
not have ANY range. There are no closure rules that conclude a range 
assertion, note. Are you OK with that?  I am, myself, but I can see 
that it might seem odd to some customers. And I guess that it would 
be OK to err on the side of redundancy.

I was leaning towards putting those rdfs:Resource ranges in, in fact, 
together with a note that they produce no useful conclusions but are 
put in just for completeness' sake. It wouldn't require your engines 
to do anything new, and after all these rules aren't meant to be 
process rules.

Comments?
