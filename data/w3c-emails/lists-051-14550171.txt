By being different. I don't know quite how else to say it. That is, 
the sequences (of 'firsts') will be the same, but the lists could 
still be different. And that makes sense, because for example they 
might have other properties, such as who made them; or suppose they 
are lists of people in a building at some time. Could have same 
members but still be distinct.
