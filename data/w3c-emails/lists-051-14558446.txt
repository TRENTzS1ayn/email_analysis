The snag is, indicate how?? I have a cunning plan.

Suppose we make the distinction by saying that we will have two kinds 
of properties.  Weakly datatyping properties can impose a datatype on 
a bnode, but they can't force a bare literal to be anything other 
than a string; so that

ex:age rdf:type rdfs:WeakDataTypingProperty .
ex:age rdf:range xsd:integer .
Jenny ex:age <_:x :10> .
Bill ex:age 10 .
Joe ex:age _:y .
_:y rdf:lex 10 .

has Jenny and Joe being ten but is a syntax error on Bill. In other 
words, they use literal equality. But if we had said

ex:age rdf:type rdfs:StrongDataTypingProperty .

then Bill's age would have been ten as well, because those strong 
guys use value equality and can re-interpret a bare literal. This 
would allow users to set generic preferences, eg you could say that 
all the properties in some collection or some namespace were strongly 
typing properties, and then just work with bare literals but do 
semantic datatyping.

This allows the interpretation of the literal node to depend on the 
triple its seen in, so we can have syntactic tidyness and still have 
the nodes look semantically untidy when seen through 
strong-datatyping glasses, as it were.  For example suppose ex:age is 
strong but ex:ageish is weak, then

Jenny ex:age 10 .
Joe ex:ageish 10 .
(tidy syntax, 3 nodes total)

says that Jennys age is ten and Joes ageish is '10' even though 
theres only one literal there.

This also lets a Dan C. protect his turf if he wants to stop people 
drawing the wrong conclusions about his literals, because he could say

rdf:Property rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:WeakDataTypingProperty .

which is a kind of 'keep out of here if you don't think literals are 
strings' (or maybe 'I don't believe in strong datatyping') notice, 
since it would be *inconsistent* with anyone trying to use a 
strong-datatyping property to override his conventions on his data. 
So this lets people declare their preferences and be sure that 
everyone will get the conclusions they want them to have.

Hey, this might actually work.....
