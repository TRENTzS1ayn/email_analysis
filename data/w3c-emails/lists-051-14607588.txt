Eureka!  That is the test *you* are applying.  I think I may have 
understood why we don't seem to be understanding each other here.  How is 
this for a description of the test you are applying:

Does:

   <a> <b> "10" .
   <b> rdfs:range xsd:int;
   <c> <d> "10" .
   <d> rdfs:range xsd:string .

entail

   <a> <b> _:l .
   <c> <d> _:l .

A system for which this entailment holds is Patrick-tidy.  A system which 
does not is Patrick-untidy.

The test I (the wg?) have been using is (modifying the literal in a neutral 
way) is does:

   <a> <b> "10" .
   <c> <d> "10" .

entail

   <a> <b> _:l .
   <c> <d> _:l .

It is possible for a system to be both tidy (in the sense above) and 
Patrick-untidy, but only if it is non-monotonic.

This is actually a plausible implementation strategy for some systems, but 
I believe would not be acceptable in the model theory.

Does that bring us any closer to understanding?

Brian
