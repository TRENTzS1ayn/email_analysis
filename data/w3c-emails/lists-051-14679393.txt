Brian,

how can "tidy" folks contribute to that document? I'd like the reasoning 
of [1,2] to be included. The points substantiated in [1,2] are these:

a) Untidiness is not required for correct modeling, or forward/backward 
compatibility.

b) Untidiness does not solve a general issue of using substitute 
artifacts in property ranges (claimed by untidy folks). Examples are 
using strings instead of names, names instead of persons, strings 
instead of integers, integers instead of kilograms, kilograms instead of 
masses, integers instead of masses, strings instead of masses. This is 
common modeling practice and cannot possibly be forbidden, let alone by 
using untidy literals.

3) Untidiness requires changes in existing apps and APIs, whereas tidy interpretation does not.
