I've suggested that myself before, but the reality is that inline
literals are already used with value-based semantics, and it's
highly unlikely, nor at all IMO reasonable, to expect those
applications or models to have to change.

And folks who are presuming string interpretations of inline literals
can continue to do so even with an untidy MT by simply being explicit
in the RDF which properties take string values as objects.

Inline literals are not going away. Tidy semantics will likely
result in non-monotonicity and/or a schism in the community, while
untidy semantics with string range assertions let's us have our cake
and eat it too.

Is the better choice really so unclear?
