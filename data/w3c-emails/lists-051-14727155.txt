there's actually a simple way to make desirable non entailments

if, for datatype property #bar we interpret
  <rdf:Description about="#foo">
    <bar>abc</bar>
  </rdf:Description>

as
  <#foo> <#bar> (<#bar> "abc")

that would not affect current RDF applications
and would be no problem for generic RDF engines
(and they would then make no entailments
for that film title testcase that we all know)

it would also allow nice datatype inferencing as
e.g. <#bar> rdfs:range xsd:duration could
make things sharper

my main belief in literals denoting themselves
is that that it is sound i.e. out of somthing that
holds one can never derive something that
doesn't hold, but it is indeed incomplete i.e.
something that holds is not necessarily derivable
although canonical lexical forms could make it
less incomplete, to work in that way
