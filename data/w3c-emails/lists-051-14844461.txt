Summary of new actions:

ACTION 2002-09-27#1: bwm, summarize requirements into next iteration of
                      datatyping rationale document
ACTION 2002-09-27#2: Sergey, write up comments about changes to API 
implementation vs
                      changes to applications incurred by change to RDF 
handling of literals.

Summary of decisions:

DECISION:  the decision on untyped literal semantics is reopened
on basis that it was so finely balanced, and our staff contact/
activity lead has so requested.

A request to extend the meeting to complete item 10 was not acquiesced.

None forthcoming.


8: Semantics of untyped Literals - Next Steps

See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0313.html

NOTE It was conformed that a formal decision was made at last weeks
telecon to adopt the semantics known as untidy literals.

As w3C staff contact, eric has concerns about the finely
balanced nature of last week's decision, and asked for it
to be reopened.  He expressed two concerns:
(1) concern with split decision, where group is responsibe to convince 
others...
(2) Schedule -- WG is overrunning -- decision is likely to extend CR period
He also suggested that if we get back to functional requirements,
we may be able to find stronger consensus.

It was confirmed that W3C process permits the WG to reopen a decision
if there is consensus to do so.

DECISION:  the decision on untyped literal semantics is reopened
on basis that it was so finely balanced, and our staff contact/
activity lead has so requested.


9: Rationale for Literal Semantics Decision

See:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0251.html

There was a round-table survey of requirements as perceived by
those present.  See IRC log for details.

Brian will use this as fodder to assemble a
rationale document (requirements on datatyping, and pros and
cons of the different approaches) that will be used to support
whatever final decision we make.

ACTION 2002-09-27#1: bwm, summarize requirements into next iteration of
                      datatyping rationale document



10: Abstract Syntax for Untidy Literals

2002-09-06#4 jjc review material thus far on specifics of
rdfs:Datatype, rdfs:Literal and the abstract syntax of literals and
produce a proposal for wording in the Abs. Syntax document.

2002-09-13#8 jjc update the abstract data model in concepts doc to
reflect the pair denoting a datatype literal

It seems that there is a key issue around whether literals are named or not.

See:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0198.html

In view of the decision to reopen the tidy/untidy decision,
a main thrust of this discussion was to find a common understanding
of what is meant by untidy literals, so we fully understand the
choice we're making.

Discussion focused on whether different literal occurrences need
some kind of label to distinguish them ("sysID"s), or whether
distinct occurrence can be determined by other means (i.e. all
occurrences are distinct).

(Point of order:  DaveB asked for a meeting extension to get a
decision on this matter.  Participants were not all able to
extend, so no extension.)

No decision was reached in the matter of identifying
literal occurrences.


11: possible semantic bugs concerning domain and range
Jos has asked for this on the agenda

See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0288.html

(This agendum not discussed)


12: Proposed technical changes to RDFS model theory

See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0169.html

(This agendum not discussed)


13: Frank's new assertion text
2002-08-23#7  FrankM  Propose alternative text for the concepts and abstract
                  model document to rectify concerns with conflicting use of
                  "assertion".
