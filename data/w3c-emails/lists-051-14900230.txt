Tim has suggested a new issue in

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Sep/0168.html

which I have recorded under the postponed list:

as:

[[When RDF is embedded in another document, it is the enclosing document 
which determines whether the RDF statements are asserted.  How should it 
indicate this to an RDF processor?]]

We do, from time to time get new issues like this, which do not arise from 
changes this WG has made.  I think the time has come to close the issue 
list to such issues.  With the WG's permission I will put such new issues 
immediately into the postponed list without further discussion.  I will 
email the WG of the new issue so that anyone concerned that it needs to be 
dealt with sooner has the opportunity to say so.  I will inform the issue 
raiser that the issue is on the postponed list.

Please let me know if there any concerns about this method of handling new 
issues.

Brian
