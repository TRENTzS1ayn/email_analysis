Er... what *is* a literal here:   if, for some datatype, we have:

     v = L2V(l)

is l the literal, or v?   I think v is a resource (member of IR) but l is 
not necessarily so.

I think Jeremy's argument applied to v.

Intuitively, I would say that l is the literal, not v.  E.g. the MT draft, 
section 1.2, describes a literal as a "referring expression".

But in another message, Pat says:

which seems to be saying that v is the literal (if a literal is any member 
of rdfs:Literal).  This is borne out by the MT draft (e.g. section 3.3.1).

I'm beginning to wonder what is the point of rdfs:Literal.  Fort example, 
looking at:
    rdfs:comment rdfs:range rdfs:Literal
that simply seems to say that the range is a value that *can* be expressed 
using a literal, not that it *must* be expressed that way.  Which I think 
is quite right.  Why do we care?
