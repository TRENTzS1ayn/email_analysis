I would like the record to show that the chair called for comment on the 
proposal to reopen, that several comments were made in support of 
re-opening and none were made opposing it.

The reason for re-opening is not so much that Eric has asked us to, but the 
reasons he gave why we should.  In particular, the WG had not considered 
the effect of the decision on WG schedule.

My recollection is that the observation was made that no one was supporting 
having sysID's on literals and that whilst no formal decision had been 
made, future work was likely to proceed on the basis of not having them.
