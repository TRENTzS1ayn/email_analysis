Hi Patrick,

Thank you for this proposal.

Whatever decision we take, tidy, untidy or "we ain't sayin", we will need 
to write up a rationale for why that is the best decision in the 
circumstances.  I think we agreed Friday that we would write up the 
rationale and then make a decision.  I would like to continue with that 
plan.  In saying that, I don't consider this to be an open ended 
process.  We do need to get done, and soon.

I will be proposing a detailed process in the next couple of days.  What I 
currently have in mind is to discuss this issue at the next two 
teleconferences and then have a vote.

I think that gives us one more chance to review the arguments and come to 
greater consensus.  It also gives us one more chance to find a new way of 
looking at the problem which leads to a new proposal(I know there is one 
out there) that might attract stronger consensus.

So I urge the WG not to think just in terms of tidy versus untidy, but in 
terms of what it is we really need and whether there might be a third 
way.  I note Pat has trying.

With regard to your proposal, my immediate concern is the effect on 
interoperability.  To help us make a decision, can you do an analysis for 
us on the effect this proposal would have on interoperability.

Brian
