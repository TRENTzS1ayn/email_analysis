Why is this question being asked?

RDF/XML is defined above several XML specifications and it is
absolutely clear and easy to find what they are in the Normative
References section of:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-References

which cites the following XML standards:
    Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0, Second Edition
    Namespaces in XML
    XML Information Set
    XML Base

So anything that forms a legal infoset of them, is usable in rdf/xml.

That's not well formed XML - the rdfs:label element doesn't balance.

Yes

But what exact point is this demonstrating?
