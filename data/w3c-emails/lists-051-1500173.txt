Oh dear, I haven't being paying attention properly.  Apologies.  Something 
was niggling me about this, but I now think I see what it was:

The datatyping extension is both syntactic and semantic.  As a syntactic 
extension, it naturally belongs with the core language.  But as a semantic 
extension, it fits more comfortably (IMO) with the schema 
material.  Hmmm... I don't know what to suggest as a solution.  (DanC's 
approach, which we turned down, starts to look more attractive.)

That's not helpful... thinks...  the only thing I can think of that seems 
reasonably coherent is to bring the datatype URI into the core (rdf:), even 
if it is "adding a new term that has a meaning".  It would not be the first 
such term in the core language;  e.g. we already rdf:type, which has some 
defined semantics in an RDF-interpretation.

Is there any reason why a datatyped-interpretation has also to be an 
RDFS-interpretation?
