Brian--

I don't mean to overly-complicate things, but it's not clear to me that 
your expression of the issues captures all the variants involved (maybe 
you're trying to do one thing at a time?).  I may be wrong, but it seems 
to be that we also need to ask something like the following questions as 
well (or at least to have these kinds of questions in mind when deciding 
on our answers):

a.  what is the answer given the following RDF/XML

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="Jenny">
     <foo:age>10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>
   <rdf:Description rdf:about="John">
     <foo:age rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>

[in particular, does this result in "Jenny and John have the same age", 
"Jenny and John have different ages", or "I can't tell"]

b.  is the answer the same given the following RDF/XML

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="Jenny">
     <foo:age>10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>
   <rdf:Description rdf:about="Film">
     <foo:title>10</foo:title>
   </rdf:Description>

together with a schema declaration

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#age">
    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&xsd;integer"/>
</rdf:Description>
