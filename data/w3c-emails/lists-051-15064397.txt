Just the opposite, I think it is essential we continue to have non-typed
inline literals that are "interpreted" at the application level. I.e.
applications that currently use bare literals should continue to work as
expected and not require re-writing.

Steve,

On Friday's telecon, you stated as a requirement:

   [["Inline" literals are required, don't care about model theory]]

What exactly did you mean here.  I thought at the time you meant that we
get rid of non typed literals, but maybe you meant something else.

Brian
