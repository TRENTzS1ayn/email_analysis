I share this concern.

The test cases should:
- test how RDF and RDF/XML work.
- test how RDF interacts with other standards where there is doubt.

I agree with Dave's analysis that there is no doubt here and so think we 
should avoid this test case as the thin end of a very thick wedge.

Do we need to show how RDF/XML interacts with entity refs, chracter refs, 
external entities, various badly formed XML thingies, relative namespaces 
that have been deprecated according to the plenary decision, ....

As an implementator I need to be aware of these issues (or delegate them to 
library code), but that doesn't necessarily make them appropriate things to 
test.

I believe that we have test cases already that use entities for the 
namespace declarations, and I will be surprised if we don't use an entity 
for &xsd; in our datatyping test cases, but perhaps we shouldn't have a 
specific test to demonstrate this. I think I would abstain if this test 
case were put for approval.
