False; here's the test case:

============
consider a similar example:

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="Jenny">
     <foo:age>10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>
   <rdf:Description rdf:about="Film">
     <foo:title>10</foo:title>
   </rdf:Description>

Though the title of the film and the age of Jenny are both written as an
[...]

The formal definition of this question is whether, given the second of
the 
RDF fragments above, entails (implies) the following (expressed in
n-triples):

   <jenny> foo:age   _:l .
   <film>  foo:title _:l .

We have several pieces of code that one can test using this
test case (cwm, euler, some graph matching code that
Jan uses, Jena, others?). The WG owes the community a
clear yes/no answer to whether that entailment holds.
