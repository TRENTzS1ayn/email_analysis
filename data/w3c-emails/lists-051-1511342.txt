I should have said:  my proposed fix is to drop this paragraph.

I don't think this is necessarily a show-stopper, but I think it should be 
considered carefully:

In [1] Section 1.3, 2nd para, talks about treating the assertion of a graph 
as merge with some other referenced graphs.  While we may wish to discuss 
this as a possibility (personally, I am very uneasy about it), I think it 
could muddy the waters in a document that otherwise defines very clearly 
the meaning of an RDF *graph*.  I think the issues of how RDF documents may 
be combined to create the RDF graphs on which entailments are defined 
should be kept very separate from the model theory itself.

Review continues...
