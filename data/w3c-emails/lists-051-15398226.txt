If people are going to continue to say things like this about
literals in RDF vs. XML Schemas, I guess I'll have to take
a much stronger position on 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#danc-02

On the contrary, *every* RDF literal is either an xsd:string
or has one in part.

Proof: "The ?value space? of string is the set of finite-length
sequences of characters"
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string

"A literal in an RDF graph contains three components called:

      * The lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string in Normal Form
        C [NFC]."
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Literals

I think that's a counter-productive direction to take.
