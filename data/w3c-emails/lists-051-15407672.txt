The concepts WD does not say this explicitly.

And are all XSD strings in Normal Form C?  
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string
doesn't seem to say that.

It's clear what a literal in an RDF graph is from the above
definition.  Although an xsd:string would be capabable of
transporting (encoding?) the lexical form part of RDF literal, there
would would be requirement that it was in NFC.

If we added such a (normative) dependency on all of RDF to xsd:string
and hence the XML Schema RECs, I worry what that would imply.
  Would all implementors need an "XML schema implementation" of some sort?
  Would the RDF Semantics WD have to deal with the semantics of XSD?
