The charter constraint did bother us and we did consider it
significant, hence the CG action at the same time when we made the
decision in
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Dec/0089.html

We cautiously made the change and reported to the community in the WD
of December 2001:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20011218/
with very little negative feedback since.  We got 1 LC comment about it
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#chas-01


bagID has been implemented from these WDs and test cases.  We have the
evidence from the number of people that implemented the parser test
case entailments.

It is a substantial change - more than editorial and I thought it was
polite to make all the substantial changes before CR.  We would also
need to write an explanation why this change would be made.

It would be good to get the community to buy into such a change so
that we can leave CR stage.  At present, we have several complete and
correct implementations of the rdf/xml to rdf graph mappings so could
match probable CR exit requirements right now (for syntax WD at
least).  If we change the mapping, we suddenly don't have any
implementations.

Which hat is Tim wearing here?  Let's not waste our time :)

I'll defer to you on the detail of
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/tr.html#last-call

I really care nothing about this bit of syntax, I've never used it.

My concerns are the WDs that will need changing syntax and primer,
existing implementations and documents that mention it.  For our WDs,
I suspect I might have the easier job than the RDF Primer editors.
The implementation change should be ok, removing code.  There is at
least one book being published right now that will be documenting
RDF-as-revised including rdf:bagID.   I know these are are all
"work in progress" but it is a concern.

How do you find that out?  Another WD that asks specifically?
