With reference to the issue:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-16
   "RDF's Expressive Power"

I propose that this is addressed by revisions per:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-concepts/20030401/Overview.html

Specifically:

(1) deletion of old section 2.2.7 (which didn't really say anything not 
covered by 2.2.6)

(2) revised title and rewording of section 2.2.6:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-concepts/20030401/Overview.html#section-anyone

(3) revised content of section 3.5:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-concepts/20030401/Overview.html#section-SimpleFacts

...

The new section 3.5 is considerably cut down from the original version, and 
references rather than duplicates content that is in the Primer.

(This also has an introductory paragraph that aims to capture the sense of 
wording noted by Pat Hayes, per 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Feb/0149.html, and a 
couple of short paragraphs that aim to positively address the questions 
raised as macgregor-01 and macgregor-02.)

The intent of these combined changes is to avoid making specific statements 
about the expressive power of RDF, but to indicate some limits on the kinds 
of information that RDF might express, and to avoid any suggestion of 
universality.
