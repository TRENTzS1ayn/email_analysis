FYI

I do not propose that we have a WG response to this.

>1.  LAST CALL ANNOUNCEMENT: DOM EVENTS
>
>Due to the large number of comments and suggestions on
>the DOM Level 3 Events Specification, there have been a
>significant number of changes to the specification.  The W3C
>DOM Working Group has decided to issue a 2nd Last Call for comments:
>
>http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/
>
>2. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENT REVIEW
>
>The DOM WG asks for review of the following document:
>
>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification
>
>Abstract: "This specification defines the Document Object Model Events 
>Level 3, a generic platform- and language-neutral event system which 
>allows registration of event handlers, describes event flow through a tree 
>structure, and provides basic contextual information for each event. The 
>Document Object Model Events Level 3 builds on the Document Object Model 
>Events Level 2 [DOM Level 2 Events].
>
>The document is available at:
>
>http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/
>
>See Appendix A for a list of changes between DOM Level 2 Events and DOM 
>Level 3 Events specifications.
>
>The changes since the first last call impact throughout the
>specification, and it is therefore not practical to recommend specific 
>parts that have changed more than others.
>
>3. HOW TO SEND COMMENTS
>
>Comments from any W3C Working Group or Member of the Community are welcome on:
>
>www-dom@w3.org
>
>archived at:
>
>http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/
>
>and will be added to the last-call issues list at:
>
>http://www.w3.org/2003/04/DOM-Level-3-Events-issues
>
>4.  INTENTIONS OF DOM WG
>
>Unless the review uncovers substantial problems, the next step will be to 
>recommend the document for publication as Candidate Recommendation to gain 
>implementation experience.
>
>5. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
>
>The DOM WG is looking for implementations of the draft.  If you, or your 
>company, are planning to implement (or already has an implementation of) 
>this DOM module and are willing to participate in the Candidate 
>Recommendation phase with your implementation, please let us know by 
>sending a message to the public mailing list www-dom@w3.org.
>
>6. END OF REVIEW PERIOD
>
>The Last Call review period ends at 5p Pacific Time on May 1, 2003.
