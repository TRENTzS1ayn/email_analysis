I will try and avoid getting into a long procedural discussion and just 
continue with two detailed points ...

I felt the WG resolutions were clear - we were going to say less because 
what we had said was inadequate and we didn't have enough effort left to 
say it well. Hence I find it unaceptable to say more.
I am not an expert on proposotional attitudes etc. but I saw this new text 
and assumed that at least some of the people who are would find it 
unacceptable. Adding it seems to go against what I understood as the WG 
position which is a recognition that we wanted to stay clear of some 
philosophical minefields.

My point here is not that capitalization is good - but simply that the 
documents have been reviewed as is, and while not wanting to freeze them as 
they were at LC I would like to see process in which changes are made 
explicit on the list - having said this, I realise that semantics has 
needed a bigger overhaul than that - but I hope the other documents are not 
getting changed more than is apparent in the e-mail traffic.
