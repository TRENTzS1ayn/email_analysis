I see a lot of merit in this approach.  I'm concerned that we get the 
issues resolved and can move on.  Discussing resolutions to the issues in 
terms of specific document changes works for me.  I've seen responses from 
Peter and Danc to comment dispositions which I recall as "I want to see the 
specific wording before I accept this".  Having the wording to point to is 
helpful.

I would like to be able to point to the wording in the archive, 
however.  Please could we mail a copy of the doc to the archive and refer 
to it there, if you can't get it into the cvs.

We are into judgement call territory here.

We clearly have scope to make editorial clarifications.  But I urge the 
editors to use that scope sparingly.  Changes will be subject to further 
review which takes time an energy from all of us.  In  general lets resist 
the temptation to polish; a dull brass rec is worth more to me than a shiny 
draft stuck in last call.

I suggest Graham was testing the water with these.

Personally, I'd rather they were not added.  MacGregor is happy is issue is 
resolved without them, and I fear they may just draw further fire.  I think 
its better not to mention them at all.

Judgement call: editorial yes - but is it really necessary?

Right it not, but its not hard to change to be consistent.

You were not around when I said I didn't want us making bad decisions just 
to avoid a second last call.  That said, I don't want to do a second last 
call, so I wouldn't want to have to done one as a result of polishing.

My suggestion for process here is that we make the necessary changes, 
emphasis on *necessary* and then we'll look at the docs and decide whether 
to ask for advancement or do a second last call.

There may be some differences of view on the scale of editorial changes 
that are desirable - I urge you to keep them minimal, but that doesn't rule 
them out.  But I don't see anything else that does work in the context of 
the way the wg are doing things.

I am pleased to see such a clear proposal for disposing of pfps-16.  I'm 
hoping for a few more this week :)

I'll make comments on the specific text in another doc.
