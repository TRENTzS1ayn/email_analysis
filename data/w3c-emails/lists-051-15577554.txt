Reading through this, the comment I see is a request that the syntax doc 
contain add a section 10 to discuss embedding RDF in SVG.  I note that SVG 
has created a very nice slot for inserting RDF (and any other) metadata 
into SVG :)  I also note an offer from Chris to help draft such a section.

This looks to me as a nice to have, but not essential, and given the 
comment is very late, I don't think we have an obligation to accept it.

However, if the syntax editor, (or possibly the primer editor) were 
willing, we might indicate to Chris that if he were to provide us with a 
draft, we would try to fit include it.  Another possible home would be the FAQ.

I'm open to advice from our team contact or elsewhere, but I suggest:

   o we don't accept this as a last call comment - too late and not substantive
   o we invite Chris to prepare a draft on how to embed RDF in SVG
   o the syntax editor or primer editor have discretion to use the material
   o if it doesn't go in a rec track doc we'll put it in the FAQ, or 
possibly Chris could put it in the SVG FAQ and we could link to it - ah - 
google doesn't find a W3C FAQ for SVG

Comments?
