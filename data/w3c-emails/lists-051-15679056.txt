I'm happy to accept / co-write a *short* RDF in SVG section but it
would have to be soon.  I expect it would be mostly pointing to the
example in the SVG spec in
  http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/metadata.html
and maybe giving a very similar example.  I can't think of other
gotchas.  Maybe discussing the use of rdf:about="" for describing the
embedded SVG document?
