Brian--

 From the perspective of the Primer, this might be a tad tricky.  We 
explicitly removed discussion of how to embed RDF in HTML from the 
Primer, and while I can appreciate that SVG is a different story, 
nevertheless a reader might wonder why consider this special case, and 
not the more general issue of embedding.  It's also not exactly an 
"application" of RDF, or at least not a distinct one.  There's an RDF 
example in Section 21.3 of the SVG 1.1 spec, but this is an example of 
using Dublin Core vocabulary, rather than a distinct application of RDF. 
  However, one possibility (not necessarily a substitute for talking 
about it in Syntax) might be to add a paragraph to the Primer's Dublin 
Core section noting that SVG example, pointing out that SVG provides an 
explicit mechanism for embedding RDF metadata, and noting, for example, 
that XMP (Adobe) is another example where people are making explicit 
provision for incorporating RDF metadata for describing instances in 
various data formats.
