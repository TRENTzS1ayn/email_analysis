Hmmm... the decision seems to be fairly clear-cut choice:

(a) reject
[[
Reification as defined is implemented in RDF parsers, and we believe that 
there is some actual use, even if the exact meaning is unclear.
]]

(b) accept
[[
Reification does not live up to its intended use, may be a future source of 
complexity and interoperability difficulties, and is hence removed from the 
RDF specification.
]]

I suppose there might be a third way:
(c) fudge (deprecate)
[[
Reification as defined is implemented in RDF parsers, and we believe that 
there is some actual use, but lack of clarity and failure live up to its 
intended use mean that it mar be a future source of complexity and 
interoperability difficulties.  Use of the reification vocabulary remains 
legal RDF, but is not encouraged and is expected to be superseded by better 
defined vocabulary based on broader implementation experience in future 
revisions of RDF.
]]

(a) and possibly (c) remain options only if we decide to pull the plug on 
bagId.
