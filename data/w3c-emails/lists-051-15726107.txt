Er, yes, the double negative isn't only confusing -- it's wrong.  Also, I 
agree the final sentence is out of place here.  Here's what I now have:

[[
In general, it is not assumed that the information about any resource is 
complete: there may be information that is not yet available. RDF does not 
prevent anyone from making assertions that are nonsensical or inconsistent 
with other statements, or the world as people see it. Designers of 
applications that use RDF should be aware of this and may design their 
applications to tolerate incomplete or inconsistent sources of information.
