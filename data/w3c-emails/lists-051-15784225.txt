Er... you're telling them to use plain literals in the RDF but
interpret them as typed literals by the applications. This
means that conclusions drawn from an RDF-only application about
those CC/PP statements will differ from conclusions drawn by
a CC/PP application.

That means that non-monotonicity is being introduced between the
RDF and CC/PP layers.

No?
