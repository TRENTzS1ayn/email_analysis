Sorry this is a bit late.

Propose:

We accept this comment and change the document as follows:

In 6.5 RDF Literals (now 5.5)
[[
The language identifier as defined by [RFC-3066],
 normalized to lowercase.
]]
=>
[[
The language identifier as defined by [RFC-3066].
]]

In 6.5.1 Literal Equality (now 5.5.1)
[[
The language identifiers of the two lexical forms compare equal.
]]
=>
[[
The language identifiers of the two lexical forms compare equal
by case insensitive string comparison
(see  section 2.1 of [RFC-3066]).
]]

Discussion:
This does have knock on impact on tidiness.
Pat seemed unbothered, but we might want to add 'parser' tests like:

tex01/test001.rdf
<rdf:RDF>
 <rdf:Description xml:lang="en-us" eg:p="foo"/>
</rdf:RDF>

tex01/test001.nt
_:a eg:p "foo"@en-us .
_:a eg:p "foo"@en-US .

tex01/test002.rdf
<rdf:RDF>
 <rdf:Description xml:lang="en-US" eg:p="foo"/>
 <rdf:Description xml:lang="en-us" eg:p="foo"/>
</rdf:RDF>

tex01/test002.nt
_:a eg:p "foo"@en-US .


Creating four tests:

test001.rdf = test001.nt
test001.rdf = test002.nt
test002.rdf = test001.nt
test002.rdf = test002.nt

(Of course these are not testing the parser but the graph equivalence
function).
