Before LC, we agreed to place the following comment in the concepts document:

[[
Note: these namespace names are the same as those used in earlier RDF 
documents [RDF-MS] [RDF-SCHEMA].

[[[NOTE FOR REVIEWERS: Some terms in these namespaces have been deprecated, 
some have been added, and some RDF schema terms have had their meaning 
changed. We invite community feedback regarding the relative costs of 
adopting these changes under the old namespace URIs vs creating new URIs 
for this revision of RDF.]]]
]]

I think there have been a few comments about this topic, but not many, but 
I can't locate them.

I think it's time to make a decision and remove the above text from the 
Concepts document.

To kick things off, I'll make a strawman proposal:
[[
It is proposed that the RDF namespace URIs remain the same as those in 
previous versions of RDF, and that the text cited above is removed from RDF 
Concepts.

Rationale:  we have been using the same namespace URIs for some time now 
with the "new RDF", and there has been little indication from the 
user/developer community that this causes any great problems.
]]

(FWIW, I could easily favour a new namespace URI, but I sense --maybe 
wrongly-- that the above is closer to the WG's current view.)
