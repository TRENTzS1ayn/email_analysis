No I'm not.  Plain literals remain plain literals.

I'm suggesting that the meaning of (say, numeric) CC/PP attribute 
properties be defined along the lines of:

     ex:someDevice ex:displayWidth "200" .

be interpreted as saying that the property 'ex:LdisplayWidth' relates 
devices to character sequences which are decimal text representations of 
their display width.  This is perfectly legitimate RDF as currently specified.
