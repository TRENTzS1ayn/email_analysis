Why is that relevant? I think you've got
your quantifiers mixed up.

Well, yes, it would as a matter of course remain in NFC.
Again, how is that relevant?

Why worry about simple facts about sequences of unicode characters?

No more than they already have.

Again, no more than they already do. Both XSD and RDF involve
the concept of a sequence of unicode characters.
