I agree with Peter here.

Another option, and one which I've suggested several times, is to
revert the definition of XML literals to that defined by M&S, that
there would be no rdf:XMLLiteral datatype, but that we would have
three types of literal: the two original M&S types of literal, plain
and XML, for which the lang tag is significant, and the new type of
literal, typed literals, for which the lang tag is not significant.
D-interpretations only are relevant to typed literals. Not to either
plain literals or XML literals.

This way, we can give the special treatment we need to XML literals
without it mucking up the semantics of typed literals.

I would like to make this a formal proposal to both Peter and the WG.

Patrick
