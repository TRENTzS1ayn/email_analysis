Reverting rdfs:XMLLiteral to M&S XML literal would also allow for
removing lang tags from typed literals, since there would no longer
be any typed literals for which lang tags were semantically significant.

This provides for a very clean distinction between traditional, M&S
literals, for which lang tags are included, and the new typed literals
for which lang tags are not included.
