no.

Those are not parser (rdf/xml -> rdf graph) tests - they are model
comparing tests.  No parser will implement them and they must not be
added to the test cases as parser test cases.

I already asked the WG to stick with canonicalizing the lang tags
values to 1 form.  I don't care what it is, as long as it is one way.
Anything else makes simple RDF applications harder.
