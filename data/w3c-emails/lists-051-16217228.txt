Great, that sounds good i.e. we will be compatible (by weakening our
NFC MUST to a SHOULD) but not directly based on the still-changing
IRI work.

Apart from wordings, lThat means any of our test cases that
previously tested the MUST need to be removed and made optional.
That will need a new type of test.
