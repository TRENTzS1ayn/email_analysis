Well, I wouldn't be opposed to rdfs:XMLLiteral being a normal datatype,
if that essentially means that the lang tag becomes irrelevant to
equality tests. In which case, we could still then remove lang tags
from typed literals.

I've never much liked the idea of lang tags infecting XML literals,
which I consider to be fragments disjunct from the semantics of
the RDF/XML serialization itself. But I won't go there (again)...

Agreed.

I think that requiring parsers to do the canonicalization would be
an onerous burden and not one that would be easy to sell. But since
I'm not a parser implementor, and if you and Dave think it's no
biggie, then who am I to suggest otherwise ;-)

In any case, I really wouldn't like to see <rdf-wrapper ...> in
the actual graph. I didn't much like it as a conceptual element.
I will like it less as a real element.

Well, I still think that reverting to M&S XML Literals (and ditching
lang tags from typed literals) is the better way to go all around.

It doesn't change the parseType syntax. It doesn't change the
canonical representation of XML literals. It retains the lang
tag (unfortunately) but in that way remains true to M&S.

The definition of typed literals and D-interpretations is thus
freed from "contamination" from the legacy literal types.
