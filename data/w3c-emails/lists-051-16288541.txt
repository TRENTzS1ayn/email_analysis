This is reversing a previous decision on XML literals being made into
typed literals with the rdf:XMLLiteral URI as the datatype URI.

Please can you explain the new information that was brought up
and the reason for this particular solution.

I wouldn't cite M&S as particularly specific on this point.  We
discussed this many times before and parseType="Literal" was too
vague in M&S.

OK, I'm clear on what you want to do.  I want to know why.

Yes and on this second proposal, please explain what new information
means this change is required.  Which specific last call comments
(URIs please) does it/they address?


Both of these will cause significant implementation
rewritings/reversions - and I *do* know this since I recall changing
it last time.  Plus there is also having to update/revert and check
several test cases and WD text changes.
