Personally I would like to turn these into one case.  Why does the
case of this need to remain around?  For people, it can be printed
prettily, en-US if that's what they want but stored as en-us etc.

On the test cases, that's my only concern - these tests were not for
parsers to deal with - there is no graph comparison in parsers
(applications that perform an rdf/xml document->rdf graph mapping).

I would prefer to require lower case tags in N-Triples and everywhere
else.  It introduces the very first variation that two N-Triples
have to compared by deconstructing them and doing case independent
comparison on one part.  At present string equality satifies.

With the new test type, that's fine.

Once the WG has pronounced on this new language compare, unlike any
other in RDF in being case insensitive, we can move on.
