FWIW, I don't think our earlier attempt to treat XML literals within the 
framework of other datatypes really worked out, and I think this would be a 
cleaner, simpler way to go.

And, as Pat notes in another message:
[[
Jeremy is the one to ask. Jeremy, can we do this?? Note that this would 
then mean that we could GET RID OF LANG TAGS IN THE GRAPH ALTOGETHER. Just 
thought I'd mention it in passing.
]]
It's an unfortunately large change at this stage, possibly involving 
changes to abstract syntax, semantics, syntax and N-triples documents.  But 
I think it would be a usefully cleaner design.

I don't think we really have an option to remove XML literals.
