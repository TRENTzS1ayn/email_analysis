I'm broadly supportive of this approach.

What I think may be controversial here is the explicit incorporation of 
<rdf-wrapper> into the abstract syntax.  It's purpose seems to be to 
capture the language information for this form of literal.  (I have some 
thoughts, but I think to raise them now would muddy the important debate.)

If we go this route, I would favour removing language tags from all typed 
literals in the abstract syntax.
