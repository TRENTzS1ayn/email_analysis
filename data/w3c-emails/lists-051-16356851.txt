I fully appreciate that fact.

Simple. As Peter points out, and I agree, having a single "special"
datatype that does not work the same as all other datatypes is a
problem.

Well, we certainly would be following the intent of the charter if
we clarified things accordingly.

I think the WG would have a very strong and fast concensus of how
non-datatype XML literals would be defined and the editorial effort
would not be prohibitive.

So that *all* rdfs:Datatype's would have identical treatment.

Fair enough. But I think this falls within the scope of "doing it right
this time around".
