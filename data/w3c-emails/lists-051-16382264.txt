If case is syntactically significant, why wouldn't the parser
produce

   _:a eg:p "foo"@en-US .
   _:a eg:p "foo"@en-us .

If we had two separate graphs, one with

   _:a eg:p "foo"@en-US .

and the other with

   _:a eg:p "foo"@en-us .

would the graph merge discard the 'en-us' triple? Why?

It seems to me that either case is syntactically significant or 
its not, and if it is, then the graph syntax should fully respect 
and preserve all variations of case.

If case is not syntactically significant, such that it is normalized
in some fashion, then test002 seems more reasonable (though I would
suggest lowercase as the default/preferred choice).

On this one, I don't see any harm in having parsers transpose lang
tags to lowercase and NTriples only having lowercase lang tags.
