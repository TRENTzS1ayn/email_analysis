Summary:
3.1 quite a lot of change but reflecting the rewording needed for
williams-01. I am happy with it.
3.1 Last Paragraph - not relevant, please excise from this proposal (maybe
relevant to some other issue)
3.2 The only substantive change here was changing
"Arcs are labelled with URI references" to "Arcs are URI references"
This change is incorrect. Please undo that change so that 3.2 proposed
changes are minor wording changes like s/The/A/ and s/node in an RDF
Graph/node/.

(I am not sure if the issue is still open, however the actual changes to
concepts in response to the issue certainly are still open).

Good so far.

Ugggh this para:

This was text from elsewhere and should be considered under a different
issue.

The LC phrase "Arcs are labelled with URI references" is correct.
The proposed phrase "Arcs are URI references" otherwise OK.

s/The/A/ at beginning of para OK, but otherwise LC text is more correct.
