We should look up the reason we made this change last time - why was
rdf:XMLLiteral invented.  It might be it still remains the least
worst option of several.

Is there any *critical* reason why this special case is a problem or
is this just a consistency "yuck" argument?

If the latter there are several choices to make all literals act the
same. Throwing out xml:lang everywhere, adding it everywhere.  Adding
a datatype to all literals such as rdf:PlainLiteral.

Sorry, the editorial effort is not minimal - we still haven't worked
any of the details of the <rdf-wrapper> thing, and I don't like it so far.

So I'm checking for good reasons why, and consistency while nice,
isn't one.

The implementation effort is also greater.

ok, it is consistency.  I rate that as not sufficient alone.

In that case, what is wrong (broken, critical) that we are now meant
to be doing right?   On proposal #2, what is wrong with lang tags on
XML literals, that you cannot live with or breaks something?
