The "new information" here is that someone outside our group took a look at 
the design resulting from the previous decision and said that it was a mess.

That is not of itself compelling, but I think it's significant because I 
think that within the group we've got to a stage that we feel unable to 
challenge hard-won consensus.  I think that it's significant that someone 
outside the group felt strongly enough to raise an issue that seems to have 
some resonance within the group.

None of these are sufficient reasons to make the changes suggested, but I 
think they are sufficient to suggest reconsideration.
