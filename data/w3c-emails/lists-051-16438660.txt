It was closed last week, along similar lines:
[[
16:51:28 <danb_scribe>
resolved: accept
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0155.html
16:51:43 <danb_scribe> (with 3 abstentions)
16:52:09 <bwm>
amended to empaphasize that the proposed equals operation is inappropriate
for the graph mechanism
16:52:28 <danb_scribe> oops (with 2 abstentions)
]]
I have been waiting for the minutes in order to send the message to Tex.
