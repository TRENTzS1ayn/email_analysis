Sorry this has taken so long. For the most part this is because I've
been trying to divine if all of PFPS' comments have been dealt with or
captured as an issue; I believe that to be the case up to now for the
most part, but:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0208.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0206.html
[all editorial, no ack]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0211.html
[IIRC this has been responded to but I can't find the thread that deals
with it]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0228.html
[language tags and datatyped literal design, by Pat Hayes himself. This
is currently being debated on rdfcore]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0265.html
[aaron's comment on 404s attached to pfps-14. No ack from Aaron]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0295.html
[EricP's comment about examples in Primer. Frank's prompted him for
reasons why; this is to do with nonopaqueness issue of URLs. No response
from EricP but I think this is captured in other discussion]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0304.html
[Frank responded with clarification, asking if issue was required, no
response]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0328.html
[question about illformed collections. related to pfps-12 by Brian]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0348.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0494.html
[ter Horst's editorial suggestions, last not ack'ed]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0355.html
[DanC on member and collection; recall this being discussed, can't find
a closing message]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0384.html
[late, another question about creating a class for rdfs:Schema. No ack]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0416.html
[late, typo, no ack]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0440.html
[late, JJC asking about appropriate behaviour for rdfs:foobar]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0362.html
[Massimo: semantic support for Bag/Alt. This was discussed IIRC but I
can't find the thread]

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0598.html
[this is OK, but the response is in the Apr - Jun section, the question
is in Jan-Mar, just if you're looking for it]


That's pretty good going, I think. Basically the "dangling" things are
waiting on an ack from the original poster.
