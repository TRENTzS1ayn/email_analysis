Hi, I'm the one that made that comment and I'll stick by it. The issue
is not that I'm denying that resources as __YOU__ are defining them
exist. I'm not using any other definition of the term other than the one
found in RFC 2396. If it will help we can change the term used in RFC
2396. URIs identify 'froogles'. 'Froogles' are defined as things that
are identified by URIs. It is up to your system to scope and extend the
definition of a 'froogle' to match your systems needs. But that extended
definition is _scoped_ to your application, not to the entire system of
URIs and 'froogles'.

Then you are using the term 'resource' to mean something that is
completely out of scope of RFC 2396. The problem here is that we're
having a terminology collision, not an architectural problem.

Again, those things aren't using the term 'resource' the way it is used
in RFC 2396. Please get that _CLEAR_. RFC 2396 says nothing about
knowledge systems of any kind, way, shape, form or fashion. The only
thing RFC 2396 defines is the fact that there is an identifier and it
identifies whatever it is it identifies. If you build a system that
constrains that further then that is the intended purpose. The thing you
CANNOT do is impose your definition on others.

Within the formal system defined in RFC 2396 that contains only two
concepts: a URI and its Resource, no. You're talking about a much richer
formal system and within _that_ scope you are completely correct.

AGain, you're including concepts such as 'someone', 'year', 'minute',
'hole' which are not defined in RFC 2396. It only defines two things: a
URI and the thing identified by it. Nothing more.

URIs are used in large numbers of places where the only valid thing is a
syntactic engineer. You cannot redefine intended simplicity of URIs to
accomodate your needs to the detriment of things that explicitly reject
the concepts you are talking about. There are other data models out
there and URIs were designed to work with ALL of them, not just a few of
them....
