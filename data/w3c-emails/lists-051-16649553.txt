I suggest a clarification:

Under tex-02 item 17 the minutes state

[[
RESOLVED: accept 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0155.html
 - amended to empaphasize that the proposed equals operation is inappropriate 
for the graph mechanism
(2 abstained)
]]

I think it would be clearer to have
[[
RESOLVED: postponed as in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0155.html
 - amended to empaphasize that the proposed equals operation is inappropriate 
for the graph mechanism
(2 abstained)
]]
