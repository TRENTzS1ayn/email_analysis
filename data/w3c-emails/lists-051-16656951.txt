I'm restricting this to RDF Core.

Pat's objections seem well-taken to me.  But I'd like to describe this 
from a slightly different perspective (or maybe it's the same 
perspective, but a different vocabulary).  If I take the "Semantic Web 
is making the Web like a giant database" analogy, it seems to me that 
saying that a resource doesn't exist (in the Web) unless a URI is 
defined for it is like saying that a resource doesn't exist (in a 
database) unless there's a row for it:  say, in a "Resources" table.  Or 
if you like more specific examples, saying that a Person doesn't exist 
unless there's a URI defined for it is like saying that a Person doesn't 
exist unless there's a row defined for it in the database's Person 
table.  Among other things, this seems like the mother of all closed 
world assumptions.
