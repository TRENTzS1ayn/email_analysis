To: W3C XML Query WG<w3c-xml-query-wg@w3.org>, XML Core WG<w3c-xml-core-wg@w3.org>, XSL WG<w3c-xsl-wg@w3.org>, DOM IG<w3c-dom-ig@w3.org>, HTML WG<w3c-html-wg@w3.org>, XForms WG<w3c-forms@w3.org>, I18n IG<w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org>, RDFCore Working Group<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>, WSD WG<w3c-ws-desc@w3.org>, XML Protocol WG<w3c-xml-protocol-wg@w3.org>, WAI P and F WG<w3c-wai-pf@w3.org>


This note is going to each active W3C Working Group mentioned in the
charter of the XML Schema Working Group under the rubric Related
Activities, as well as to several working groups who appear to have
mentioned XML Schema as a related activity in their charters (at far
as I can judge from the overview diagram at
http://www.w3.org/2003/02/W3COrg.svgz).

Since the publication of XML Schema 1.0 in May 2001, the XML Schema
Working Group has received a number of comments on the specification,
some of which have identified errors in the specification which need
to be corrected.  A list of comments received and the current state
WG's responses is available at
http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xmlschema-rec-comments, and a set of
WG-agreed corrections may be found at
http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xmlschema-errata.

For the convenience of software developers and schema users, the
Working Group has prepared a Second Edition of XML Schema 1.0 which
integrates the corrections made to date.  Note this is NOT version
1.1, for which requirements are still being decided on, just a new
edition encorporating all the errata we have dealt with so far.

A review version of XML Schema 1.0 Second Edition, in which all
changes from the text published in May 2001 are marked, was made
available on 26 February, at

  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2002/09/xmlschema-0/
  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2002/09/xmlschema-1/
  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2002/09/xmlschema-2/

with a note is to alert W3C members and other W3C Working Groups to
the review version of XML Schema 1.0 Second Edition, to invite them to
review the corrections made to date, and to ask you, if you discovered
any problems in the corrections we have made, to let us know by
sending a comment to www-xml-schema-comments@w3.org (archive at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-schema-comments/), with a
subject line including the string "Second Edition" or "2E".

Comments were requested by 24 March 2003; to date we have received
a number of comments, which have all been dealt with.

This note is to let you know we expect to request publication of the
Second Edition as a W3C Recommendation in the near future; if you are
reviewing our errata but are not finished with your review and would
like us to delay publication further, please let me know as soon as
possible.

Cordially,

-C. M. Sperberg-McQueen
  Co-chair, W3C XML Schema Working Group
