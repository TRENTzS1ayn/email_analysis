Yeh, I didnt restrict my last riposte, but I will in future.

Right, and I think it is the same basic point. Things like OWL make 
it even more acute, though, since there you can *prove* that things 
exist that you have no URI for. So I guess it would follow that their 
URI exists even though you don't know what it is, which even if true 
isn't much actual use.
