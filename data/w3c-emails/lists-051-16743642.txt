Though, as Pat's earlier response [1] shows, the argument is not with any 
current URI wording, but with some proposed new wording that isn't yet on 
the table.  Even Roy's new working draft [2] retains the old wording.

When I "dismissed" this as a philosophical matter of little import, I had 
overlooked that several specifications, and (apparently) the official 
position, implicitly look to the URI specification for a definition of 
"resource".  If that definition could be removed to some more neutral 
territory (e.g. the emerging web architecture document), then maybe that 
frees the URI spec to focus itself on syntactical aspects of URIs, and 
those resources that actually have assigned URIs?

<aside>
I think there has long been a tension that URIs serve (at least two) 
different masters:  in the web architecture (wherein the concept 
originated), as a framework for universal identification, but within the 
IETF (who "own" the specification) I sense a broad view that URIs are some 
kind of glorified address.  For many purposes, these are reconcilable 
views, but when issues like this come up one sees the fault lines emerge.
