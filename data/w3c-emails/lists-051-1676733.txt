I've added:
[[
In addition to these classes and properties, RDF also uses properties
called rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3... etc., each of which is both a
sub-property of rdfs:member and a member of the class
rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty. There is also a resource called rdf:nil
that is a member of the class rdf:List.
]]

Refinements welcome.

Fixed.

Fixed.
