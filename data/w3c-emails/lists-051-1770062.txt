I included some in the comments I sent earlier.  You may not have got to 
them.  I was thinking in terms of RDF/XML not comments, but no matter.

rdf:List
label: List
comment: An RDF list.

rdf:first
label: first
comment: The first item in an RDF list.

rdf:rest
label: rest
comment: The rest of an RDF list.

rdf:nil
label: nil
comment: The end of an RDF list.

rdfs:Datatype
label: Datatype
comment: The class of datatypes.

Is that what you wanted?

Brian
