I've got a problem with how I'm thinking about lists.  I first came across 
it reviewing the primer, but I've got the same problem in schema.

We say that the domain of rdf:first is rdf:List.

My problem is whether the resource at the blunt end of an rdf:first 
property denotes (ok we are not doing the semantics but this is just about 
how I should think of this) a whole list, or just a link in a chain?  I've 
been thinking of it as a link in a chain, and so the term rdf:List is 
misleading.  But if it really denotes the whole list then there is nothing 
for me to worry about.
