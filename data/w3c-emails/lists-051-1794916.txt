Some more important ones first:

Next paragraph on XMLLiteral - delete it all.
My section in concepts is better and clearer,
(IMHO!)
given that, there is no need to talk about these
at all in the Semantics.

Next paragraph:
... A 'datatype-aware' RDF engine should be competent
to recognize the 
<suggest-add:

Section 4, should largely be informative, in case of errors, 
the other sections should take precedence.
I suggest one of two fixes:
My preference is:

<<suggest new heading>>
4.1 RDF-entailment and RDF closures (informative)
<<suggest new heading>>
4.2 RDFS-entailment and RDFS closures (informative)
<<suggest new heading>>
4.3 Datatype entailments

Linked with this edit I would
<<suggest new heading>>
Appendix C: Translation into Lbase (informative)

<<suggest-delete, from introduction 0.1>>
[[We believe that the two ... normative.]]

alternatively
In the introduction in section 0.1
suggest-change
[[

and also the closure rules of section 4, 
are all in exact correspondence, but only

0.2 Graph Syntax

[[Any semantic theory ...

New text:
[[[[[
This semantic theory is attached to the abstract

1.3 Assertions, meanings and inference

suggest-add
[[Editor's note: further work on the overlap with 
RDF_CONCEPTS is needed here.]]

(sorry I am not sufficiently on top of the 
assertion issue to help)

Section 0.1
suggest-replace
[[See @@Jeremy ...discussion.]]
with
[[NOTE: This may duplicate material in RDF Concepts,
more editorial work is needed]]

===

Section 0.1

Suggest insert one word:
[[..same semantic theory: directly, and also (in an
**informative** appendix) an 'axiomatic semantics'..]]

Suggested Lbase ref:

Lbase, Hayes and Guha, in preparation.

Global replace untyped with plain

Global search for the word labelled - it is always an error.

[[We refer to urirefs and literals]]

[[We refer to urirefs and typed literals]]

out of time, I have more, but you will have to wait.
