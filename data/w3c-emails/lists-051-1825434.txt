This boiler plate needs a few tweaks:

a.  We need to be consistent as to whether we cite the full names of 
authors and editors, or just their initials.  The current boiler plate 
has a mixture.

b.  We also need to be consistent as to whether we say "Work in 
progress" or "work in progress";  again, there's currently a mixture.

Also, having changed the Primer to be consistent with what I thought was 
the latest Concepts and Syntax documents in citing Schema as 
[RDF-VOCABULARY] (and having announced that to the list on Tuesday), 
we're now going back to [RDF-SCHEMA]?  Boo!
