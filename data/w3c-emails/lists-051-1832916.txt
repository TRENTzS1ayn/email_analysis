BTW, I'm keeping the 'current edit' at 
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_latest.html
this has everything in [1] now de-styled, so anything in red is a 
post-Friday-snapshot edit.

One big change since yesterday:  I have moved the condition

rdf:nil rdf:type rdf:List .

from  RDFS to the RDF interpretation case, since its entirely phrased 
in the RDF vocabulary. Turns out that this makes some other things 
neater as well.

Probably, but its the reduction case for all the entailment lemmas.

Yes, done. Also that section has been re-worded to make some of the 
issues clearer

Gone.

Done.
Re. the following, I have rewritten some of the prose in these paras 
to try to make the meaning more precise. It is tricky to get this 
right!!

Yes, but I don't want to get too deeply into this issue. Ive tried to 
word the token/graph language carefully enough now to avoid this.

That wasn't intended, Ive added a guard sentence.

Good point, changeds to say 'at least.... the primitive...'.

Well, I assume it is covered in the reference to Ntriples.

Right, I hadnt thought of that, good point. I don't think I will go 
into that in the doc, though.

Me too, see below.

I think it can be said in terms of large/countable sets of equations. 
I will try to make some useful remarks along these lines: check the 
doc in a few hours to see.

No doubt one ought to talk about facets, but I really have trouble 
following the XML docs at that point. Ive been using numbers all my 
life and I never noticed they had facets before.

Im working on them. SOme of the proofs are simpler now, one or two 
are distinctly harder.
