It needs to use rdfs:Datatype to signal a recognized dtype, that's 
essentially syntactic.

Wait.... .solution? What exactly is the problem here?

I don't follow you here. Did you mean to say in an 
RDFS-interpretation? Because that wouldnt really be accurate.

No deep reason. Its tricky to say much without mentioning 
rdfs:Dataype and rdfs:Literal , is all.

I think we discussed having rdf:Datatype and rejected it for some W3C 
procedural reason (??).
