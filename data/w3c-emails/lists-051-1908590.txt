Agreed, except that since l can be used in an untyped literal, it has 
to be a resource in any case. All unicode strings, and pairs of them, 
are resources.

No, no, no. The things in the class rdfs:Literal are the literal 
VALUES. There is no way to talk *about* RDF literals in RDF, just as 
there is no way to talk about urirefs (well, except, in each case, by 
using appropriate datatypes.)

It would be better called rdfs:LiteralValue, but I expect its too 
late to change that now.

Me too, particularly as there isn't anything that can ONLY be 
expressed as a literal, given the possibility of defining a URN to 
mean anything the owner wants it mean.
