It's rdf:value.  According to the Issues document:

"At the February 2002 face to face meeting, the RDFCore WG resolved:

     * that rdf:value is a property defined in the RDF namespace
     * that the model theory state that rdf:value is a property
     * that no other model theory semantics is defined specifically for it
     * the issue be closed"

I discuss it in the Primer, and I think a rewrite is needed for what the 
Schema doc says about it (I'm working on a suggestion, but haven't 
finished my read of the Schema doc yet).
