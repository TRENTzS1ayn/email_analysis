I will fix the below as soon as I get back from lunch. MOst uptodate

Well then, why don't we just incorporate the full list semantics into 
RDF? In effect, this does that without pretending not to. I think we 
should do one or the other.

I prefer this for things like the lists and the 'informal' stuff. I 
didn't want to get into this territory there, and was aware that 
these words were dangerous, but wanted to convey something useful.

As editor I will choose options.  If the WG decides to prefer the 
others., it will be a trivial edit to fix.

Thanks for the prose :-)

Yes, I think the strong stance is appropriate here.

That might break some existing uses. I'd rather be a bit catholic at 
this point.

I like the 'MAY' trick. There's a hidden message here, right? We 
aren't saying YOU have to limit YOUR interpretations; but if you 
don't, and some OTHER bloke can't understand YOU, its not OUR fault, 
and its not HIS fault, so guess whose fault it is....

Not sure about that. There could be some nonstandard interps that are 
harmless but useful for some apps, eg lists with hash tables 
incorporated into them, or some damn thing, I will try to craft 
appropriate wording which just imposes the right level of conformity.
