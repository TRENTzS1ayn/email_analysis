I agree.

I need to be able to refer to the things in the value space of that 
datatype, because I want to say what they denote in Lbase. What are 
they? XML documents??

Damn right, it is http://www.w3.org/tr/rdf-concepts#xtocid103643  :-)

All above done.

Ive also tuned the MAY/MUST/SHOULD language here and there, you MAY 
wish to take another look at it in the new version.

Done, but I have to say I preferred my own definitions to the ones in

Graham has already asked for much of this section to be deleted. I 
plan to just keep the first paragraph and remove the rest for now 
(some of the disclaimer pieces have been incorporated into the list 
of what-we-arent-doing-here in the very first intro in 0.1),
then that para is just a technical intro for the next section. Ive 
rewritten it as follows:
------
The basic intuition of model-theoretic semantics is that asserting a 
sentence makes a claim about the world: it is another way of saying 
that the world is, in fact, so arranged as to be an interpretation 
which makes the sentence true. In other words, an assertion amounts 
to stating a constraint on the possible ways the world might be. 
Notice that there is no presumption here that any assertion contains 
enough information to specify a single unique interpretation. It is 
usually impossible to assert enough in any language to completely 
constrain the interpretations to a single possible world, so there is 
no such thing as 'the' unique RDF interpretation. In general, the 
larger an RDF graph is - the more it says about the world - then the 
smaller the set of interpretations that an assertion of the graph 
allows to be true - there are fewer ways the world could be, while 
making the asserted graph true of it.

I have just put a straight reference to your doc here. We can 
rewrite.remove this altogether before final call.

Got one, S'OK. NOt in yet, the @@ is a warning to me.

Moving from UK English to US English fried my spelling circuitry, I'm 
afraid. My software (Eudora and Wurd) accepts both versions for 
labelling labeled nodes. But done.

That whole paragraph is gone, it was left over by mistake from an 
older version. Defs are now in next section.

Apart from as noted, all above is now done.

OK, I'm all awaiting.

Can I suggest you also scan through

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_latest.html

to see how its shaping up? That way you save emailing me about things 
Ive already fixed. I think I have most all of the details in the RDFS 
tables right in that version, for example, and there are a few little 
cleanups in the closure rules, things like that. Ive rewritten the 
definition of 'merge' to be slightly more careful about 
'isomorphism'. The Lbase axioms need bringing into line with the 
rest, that's not done yet but is routine.  Also I need to mention 
rdf:value if only to say its meaningless, so that still needs to go 
in.  Also I need to re-draw the second figure, that will have to wait 
until tomorrow.

There is 1 nasty problem I currently know about and am wrestling 
with.  The proof of the RDFS closure lemma is now not correct (since 
we changed the subClass/Property conditions to IFF) and I need to 
find a way to write out the proof better. SO that is hanging in the 
current version. If I can't this done over the weekend I will just 
weaken the statement of the lemma and put in a small note about it 
for now, as I need to use Monday for all the copy-editing detail and 
linking and refs and so on that needs doing.
