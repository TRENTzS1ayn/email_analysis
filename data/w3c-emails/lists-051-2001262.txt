True. I vote for initials on the grounds that it is less work.

ALso do we need a uniform convention for style of text references? Do we have
[HUNTER] [DAVIS]
or [Hayes&Menzel] or [Hayes & Menzel 2001] or .....

Doesnt that depend on where you are in the sentence?

Maybe it would help if someone in the middle, like Brian, just TOLD 
us what to do here, and then we all did it.

Brian? Can you just tell us what style to use? If we promise not to argue??
