Hi Jos.
No hurry, but I would be interested to see what Euler makes of the 
new version of the RDFS closure definition. I have purged all the 
redundant 'seed' cases that I could see, so some of the old seeds now 
will have three- or four-step derivations, but I think they will all 
get derived eventually. You need to copy the axiomatic triples from 
section 3 as well, in order to get started.

All the missing domains and ranges ought to be rdfs:Resource, if you 
want to put those in, but they shouldn't add any new conclusions that 
you couldn't get anyway.

Pat
