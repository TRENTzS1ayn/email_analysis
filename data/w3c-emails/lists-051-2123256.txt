It may not mean much formally, but I think there are situations where it 
can be useful.

For example, when generating graphical views of RDF documents, Dan 
Connolly's work [1] uses cwm rules to generate new graph-property 
assertions from the RDF statements in a graph, and in so doing defines the 
graphical view to be constructed.  If one interprets the link "seeAlso" as 
meaning that more information about the subject can be found at the object 
resource, then it seems reasonable that definedBy also satisfies that 
description.  Thus, by defining rules that seeAlso links are represented in 
one's graphical presentation, the definedBy links get included when 
evaluating the graph under RDFS closure rules.
