Short response:

I think we're moving toward using rdf:... rather than rdfs:..., and I'm 
happy with that.

Longer...

Yup.

The "problem" I perceive, partly in response to Dave's comment, is that 
datatyping is core language syntax, but that the corresponding semantics of 
datatype-entailment don't really sit there.  I don't think there's any 
fundamental technical problem, but a challenge of presentation that the 
relevant material is presented cleanly (e.g. avoiding dependencies like, 
for example, the RDF core specification on RDF schema).

No, I meant RDF-interpretation.  I was responding to Dave's comment:
[[
Since it is adding a new term that has a meaning (will get some
description in an RDF schema document) rather than something for
building the RDF/XML syntax, I thought our policy was to add stick
them in RDFS namespace.
]]
and suggesting that adding additional semantic rules in the RDF namespace 
would not be overturning some established policy.

Yes... the challenge of presentation?

I don't know now.

I think we're moving toward having rdf:Datatype rather than rdfs:..., and 
I'm happy with that.

(For now, at least.  Having read through the new stuff on datatyping, and 
thinking of Aaron's comments about complexity, I do find DanC's approach to 
datatyping more appealing (sans the lexical form constraint), by virtue of 
avoiding a whole slew of new mechanism.  But, this isn't the time to 
question group consensus and I'm not about to rock the boat here.  But I 
think it's something we might wish to contemplate if there's community 
concern about datatyping in the last call period.)
