It isn't a class; or at least it wasn't till this week; it now might
be rdf:type rdf:List.  Can we batch up all these proposed renamings
and terms moving namespaces?

I've seen:
  rdfs:XMLLiteral (rdf:type rdfs:Class) to rdf:XMLLiteral
  rdfs:Datatype (rdf:type rdfs:Class) to rdf:Datatype
  rdf:nil (rdf:type rdf:List) to rdf:Nil

I want to see compelling reasons to do any or all of these proposed
changes.  So far, I'm not convinced.

Dave
