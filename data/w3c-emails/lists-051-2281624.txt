it's always the same, I shouldn't say
things without testing them first ...
those rules are not helping to derive
  rdf:type rdfs:domain rdfs:Resource.
so I added that triple as a premise

I did a test with rdfs2a and rdfs3a
and we then have a huge increase to
58254261 steps (compared to 174323)
for a set of 69 tests
