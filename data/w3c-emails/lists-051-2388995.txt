I don't think that the entailment requires knowledge of
the datatype. It is just relating synonymous forms of
expression, not adding any knowledge. If the typed
literal is invalid, then the bnode triple will be invalid, but
one does not need to ensure validity to equate the two
forms of expression.

Hmmm... when I stumbled across that niggle, I wondered if you might not 
introduce some "bottom" concept into the domain of interpretation, so even 
invalid lexical forms have a denotation.
