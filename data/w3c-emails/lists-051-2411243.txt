Hmmm...

Well if literals are resources and all forms of literals have
unambiguous and consistent global interpretation then
the only thing blocking them from being subjects is the
inability to express them as such in the RDF/XML.

So it would seem to me that insofar as the abstract syntax
and MT are concerned, literals would be valid subjects.

Bnodes say that something exists. The above says the literal value 
exists. Things that exist (in RDF) are resources.
