[[Resolution: On the 15th February 2002, at the RDFCore WG telecon, the WG:

     * resolved that the current syntaxes (RDF/XML, n-triples, graph 
syntax) do not allow literals as subjects.
     * noted that it is aware of no reason why literals should not be 
subjects and a future WG with a less restrictive charter may extend the 
syntaxes to allow literals as the subjects of statements.
