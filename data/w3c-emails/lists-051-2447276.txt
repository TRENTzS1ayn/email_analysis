That was a bug, the hexadecimal was correct (#x20-#x7E), the comment
was wrong ("... to 127")

Fixed.

Can you give me a pointer to this?  I thought this was being done at
the semantic level, not in the syntaxes?

Why?  I guess this is incomplete since it is refering obliquely to
multiple changing RFCs.  Is checking this unimportant?  Is it defined
elsewhere that is better pointed at?

If I used the above defn, it would be good to explain where it came
from.
