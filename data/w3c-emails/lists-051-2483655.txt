Yes, that's what I was thinking of.


If you are happy with this, I'll make a change, trying try to put
this in terms of this syntax; see below

Hmm, the EBNF we are using from
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-notation can't express the length
restrictions of RFC3066 on the primary-subtag and subtag.

so at best we can have:

  language ::= [A-Za-z0-9]+ ('-' [A-Za-z0-9]+ )?

or if we go for lowercase only

  language ::= [a-z0-9]+ ('-' [a-z0-9]+ )?

I'm prefering the latter I think; with pointers to the RFC3066
section above.  The current N-Triples language definition is too far
away from the RFC3066 etc. version.
