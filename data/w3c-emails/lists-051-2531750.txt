Pat--

I thought the whole point of this effort was to spread stuff all over 
the planet.  You have to start somewhere, and s**t

(a) at least constitutes an existence proof of sorts doesn't it?
(b) is spread all over the planet anyway (not uniformly, of course)

BTW, is there universal agreement on this vocabulary?  I've also seen 
"poo"...  I think George Carlin should be involved here.
