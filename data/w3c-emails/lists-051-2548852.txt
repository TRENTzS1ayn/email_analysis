I've sent a copy that I'd hope is suitable for publication to
www-archive at

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Nov/att-0026/01-Overview.html

(it is valid HTML, CSS, pubrules, links.  The only broken links are
to the rdf concepts, rdf syntax WDs which should be online very soon.
The other change is to s/Editors version of// in the title etc.)

It is substantially similar to the content that has been at the
editors' draft version at http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/
over this weekend.

Changes I've made after comments over the weekend:

   Production language. Changed to match RFC 3066. Added [RFC 2396]
   to normative references.

   3 N-Triples NOTE reworded. Point to RDF/XML as exchange syntax.

   Production character: should be "to 126"

   3.2 Strings Removed suggestion to use UTF-8 for apps.

Other changes since the last WD are recorded in 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Nov/att-0026/01-Overview.html#change_log

The test cases in the 20021112 ZIP files are identical to the
20020429 versions except for 1 character change:

There is a note in the section 2 (the only unchanged section) to
indicate that the test cases files have not been updated.

After this is published, I'd expect to explain this to the community
and update the test cases live at the editors' draft area, as we
discussed on the telcon, point people to:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/

and the latest test cases zips at:
