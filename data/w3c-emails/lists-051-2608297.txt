Having seen two thumbs up reviews from Jeremy and Graham

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0250.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0226.html

and  no unresolved critical objections, I would expect that the editor of 
the model theory document would use his discretion and decide to publish.

Well done Pat and thanks for the reviewers for doing the job so quickly.
