That works for me.

Jeremy's suggestion was closer to my (b):

Not quite, but close.  Jeremy's suggested syntax allows a few forms that 
are not permitted by RFC3066, but I think it's probably as close as one can 
get without count restrictions (or some very tedious syntax productions.

I'm happy either way.  My main concern was that there were two very 
different forms of definition.
