All rewritten. All references to 'unlabeled' purged.

Yes, it is rather odd. The plain fact is that the XML schema specs 
are logically contradictory when one thinks of a value space as a 
set. Enquires have determined that XMLSchema value spaces are not 
sets, but something like categories or algebras. The same thing, seen 
as a member of two different value spaces, is considered to be two 
different things. This is simply impossible in RDFS if we interpret 
value spaces as classes. So I was trying to give the reader a warning 
about this without being so coarse as to imply anything derogatory 
about XML schema.

Done.

OK. Many thanks. Right now Ive finished fixing the proofs (they read 
much better now) and am working on the boilerplate, references, etc.
