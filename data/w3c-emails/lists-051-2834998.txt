is now technically correct, and I think has had all the suggested 
edits done to it, or has been rewritten so they no longer apply (eg 
by having prose cut out of it.) The proofs have been re-written and 
are now rather better, and the Lbase appendix is finished. The 
references are in.  I abandoned the 'summary' appendix A since the 
document already has three versions of the same content, and the 
Lbase is a better summary in any case, IMO.

It still has the RFC 2119 language in it: Graham, can you live with 
that?? If not, I can do a quick purge.

However, there are still some editing problems with it.

For some reason, my local copy of figure 2 has gotten corrupted and 
my Omnigraffle has lost its licence so refuses to let me re-draw it. 
We could go with the old one for now, if anyone has an archive of the 
jpg file.

Also I have not yet managed to get time to correct all the internal 
hyperlinks (mostly to the references) and the HTML has not been 
validated. Hopefully I can do that tomorrow before leaving for the 
airport.
