such a table is quite useful but must reflect state of affairs

I think the following is critical
(but easy to correct by removal)

> rdfs:subPropertyOf
> ...
> Sub-property hierarchies can be used to express hierarchies
> of range and domain constraints. All rdfs:range and rdfs:domain
> properties that apply to an RDF property also apply to each
> of its sub-properties.

NO, please see MT

[[
The semantics given here for rdfs:range and rdfs:domain do
not entail that superclasses of domains or ranges of a
property must also be domains and ranges of that property.
Semantic extensions MAY strengthen the domain and range
semantic conditions to the following:

<x,y> is in IEXT(I(rdfs:range)) if and only if
  (if <u,v> is in IEXT(x) then v is in ICEXT(y))

<x,y> is in IEXT(I(rdfs:domain)) if and only if
  (if <u,v> is in IEXT(x) then u is in ICEXT(y))

This stronger condition will not effect any class-membership
entailments on the elements of the domains and ranges of the
property. The semantics given here was chosen because it is
sufficient for all normal uses of these terms and allows
some subtleties in class reasoning.

same as above

rdfs:member it's not a member of rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty.

I've updated the embedded and linked XML/RDF, fixed a bunch of other
glitches. Haven't yet regenerated the table. XMLLiteral is now included in
RDFS namespace. The new references section is in, but the rest of the spec
doesn't have any text that uses those references yet; maybe someone has a
paragraph we could paste early into the document to accomplish this?
