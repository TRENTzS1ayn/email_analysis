?!?!?

yes, they are:

"A value space is the set of values for a given datatype."

Inquiries may *suggest* otherwise, but only excerpts from
the text of the spec can *determine* what XML Schema
value spaces are.

I'm interested in what leads you to think they're not
sets.

In particular, I'm interested in seeing anything from
the spec that suggests they're not sets (i.e. is
inconsistent with the text excerpted above) reported as a bug
to www-xml-schema-comments@w3.org .
