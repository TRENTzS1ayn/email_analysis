Is the value space of xsd:anyURI a subset of the value space of xsd:string?

yes or no?  A reference to the spec would be useful.  I couldn't find one, 
Henry Thompson hasn't provided one and has said that the spec is not clear 
on this point.

Is
   "http://foo"^^xsd:string xsd.equal to "http://foo"^^xsd:anyURI

(I'm talking denotations here, not syntax).

Reconciling Henry's answers to these questions is what is causing the 
confusion.

Actually Pat seemed to prefer the hex encoding datatypes, but I think that 
example is equivalent.
