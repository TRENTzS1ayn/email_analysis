Have a good time.

We are clearly at a critical time for progressing the documents to last 
call.  What position are you in to work on docs over the next few weeks 
whilst travelling?  One of the advantages of having two editors on a 
document is that whilst one may be unavailable, the other can carry 
on.  Can you please work out with Jeremy how you'd like to work this so 
that we are able to continue to make rapid progress.
