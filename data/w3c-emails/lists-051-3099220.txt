[+cc Henry in case he can clear this up quickly.
If not, Henry, don't feel obliged to reply; I'll
eventually report my problem with this

I wasn't aware there were internal contradictions.
I'd be interested in help finding the text that
contradicts the above.

!?!?!

I was a member of the WG, and I remember no such decision.

I guess I'll have to watch the errata.

I don't see any relevant ones so far.

yes, that's clear enough:

"The ?value space? of hexBinary is the set of finite-length sequences of
binary octets."

"The ?value space? of base64Binary is the set of finite-length sequences
of binary octets."

Something or somebody is confused; I'm not convinced it's
the text of the spec.

Blech.

Eek! Train wreck approaching!

We're supposed to model XML Schema datatypes.

Well, it is our business. You're certainly doing your fair share;
you're not the only one who can send the bug report...
but we are chartered to deal with XML Schema datatypes...

"RDF Schema must use and build upon XML Schema datatypes to the fullest
extent that is practical and appropriate. Specifically, the RDF Core
Working Group is not chartered to develop a separate data typing
language that duplicates facilities provided by XML Schema data types."
 -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

and if they're a mess, we have an interest in cleaning them up.
