This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.

I have in mind to address outstanding technical issues that have arisen in 
the rush to get the WD's out and also to address any issues of document 
structure and overlap, the goal being that each team of editors is clear 
about what needs to be done to their document to get to last call.  Off the 
top of my head, the issue I am aware of what namespace XMLLiteral goes in, 
I'll search the lists for others tomorrow, but it would be very helpful if 
folks would let me know any they are aware of.

I'd also like to discuss issue tracking on the docs from here on in.

Brian
