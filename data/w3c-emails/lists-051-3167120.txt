I gather that there is a conceptual distinction between value *space* 
and the set of members of the value space. The spaces are considered 
to have distinct members, even if the sets are the same.

Well, maybe not. But I no longer have any confidence that I know what 
the text is intended to mean.

I agree.

I said exactly the same to Henry.

Now, to be fair, Henry did say quite explicitly that it would be fine 
for us, ie RDF, to say that two different primitive datatype classes 
have the same members. But he also wants to reserve the right for 
XMLS to say that the corresponding value spaces do NOT have any 
members in common. Seemed to me that this is likely to produce some 
misunderstandings if left unremarked on, so I put in some warning 
prose.
