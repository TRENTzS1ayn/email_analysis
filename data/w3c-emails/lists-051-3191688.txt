Ah, thanks for that clarification. I had not understood that point 
until this message. I will re-write the relevant section of the RDF 
semantics document before final call.

>Thus the REC says

Which is up to the XMLS folk to define for themselves.

But please be extra careful when talking about identity.  If y'all 
say something that sounds like these processes are acting on the 
values themselves, then what you are saying sounds to be logically 
impossible. People tend to read logically impossible claims as 
meaning some other, logically possible, claim. In this case, for 
example, I read our entire correspondence up to this message as 
meaning that value spaces were not sets, or were sets of pairs, since 
those were the only ways it seemed to make sense.

Thanks for your patience, Henry.

Pat
