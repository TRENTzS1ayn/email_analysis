Hi Folks,

I printed out the new WD's today and sat down to take a look at them.  I 
was encouraged by what I found.

Over the last few days there has been a lot of discussion and quite a 
worrying amount of cross document issues.  I think our goal now, has to be 
to stabilize these as far as we can and as quickly as we can, so that the 
editors can concentrate on their on docs, free from outside disturbance.

I'd like to propose a small number of transfers between docs and invite 
folks to suggest others they feel would be appropriate.

Concepts:

   o 1.2 => primer
   o 2.1 => primer
   o 2.2 => primer

Syntax:

   o section 2 => primer

Brian
