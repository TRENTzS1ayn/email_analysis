Brian--

I'd like to suggest that the order of the agenda items below be
interpreted somewhat flexibly since, modulo any content transfers to the
Primer determined in item 11, what remains to be done to the Primer is
much more dependent on what remains to be done to the other documents
than the other way around (I *am* in the process of identifying all that
needs to be done, though).
