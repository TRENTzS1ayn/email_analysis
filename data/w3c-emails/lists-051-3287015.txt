Yes.  (Also, the cited references should move over)

>   o 2.2 => primer

I'm agnostic-to-mildly-against:

These don't really fit with the stated goal of the primer:
[[
This Primer is designed to provide the reader with the basic knowledge 
required to effectively use RDF. It introduces the basic concepts of RDF 
and describes its XML syntax. It describes how to define RDF vocabularies 
using the RDF Vocabulary Description Language, and gives an overview of 
some deployed RDF applications. It also describes the content and purpose 
of other RDF specification documents.
]]

but I'm happy to go with the WG consensus.
