Thanks for the pointer, Graham; I wasn't sure what the x.y
numbers meant out of context...

In general, I prefer to keep the primer lean; I
saw more stuff that should go from the primer to
the concepts spec when I read them.

Let's please keep/make instant gratification as
the goal of the primer; let's not put anything
between our reader and his goal of cobbling
together some RDF/XML documents if we can
help it.

In particular...

No, background in databases and knowledge
representation isn't needed in a how-to document.

No, let's lease not put motivation nor design
goals between the primer user and his/her
goal either.
