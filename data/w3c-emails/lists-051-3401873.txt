While I agree they are not always easy to use, I don't see how they are 
difficult to *maintain*.

I don't think we should *remove* them at this time, though I am happy to 
see additional named anchors added.  When we have confirmation that no 
other documents link to the auto-generated 'xtocid' anchors we can think 
about removing them.
