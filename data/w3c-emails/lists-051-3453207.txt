They're described in
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest.rdf

I've put the major classes of test case in place (as I see them) - still
to do: JJC's entailment (whether we want to approve it or not), round
out the test cases for the other XSD datatypes.


Test case name & description... names are as given in the manifest file
(relative to http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/) -
see manifest file for related files.

test001
A simple datatype production; a language+datatype production.
Simply duplicate the constructs under
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/ntriples/test.nt

test002
A parser is not required to know about well-formed datatyped literals.

non-well-formed-literal-1
Without datatype knowledge, a "badly-formed" datatyped literal
cannot be detected.

non-well-formed-literal-2
With appropriate datatype knowledge, a "badly-formed" datatyped
literal is a semantic error.

semantic-equivalence-within-type-1
Demonstrating the semantic equivalence of two lexical forms of the
same datatyped value.

semantic-equivalence-within-type-2
As semantic-equivalence-within-type-1; the entailment works both ways.

language-important-for-non-dt-entailment-1
language-important-for-non-dt-entailment-2
Language attributes on a datatyped literal make them distinct for
the purposes of non-datatype-aware entailments.

language-ignored-for-numeric-types-1
language-ignored-for-numeric-types-2
language-ignored-for-numeric-types-3
Language doesn't affect the semantic equivalence of some datatypes,
when doing a DT-entailment.

semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes
Members of different datatypes may be semantically equivalent.

This last one needs confirmation.

Generalisation is never appropriate.
