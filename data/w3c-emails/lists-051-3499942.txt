Jesus F. Christ, that gives me a lot of work to do in a very short 
time. That namespace move is a major rewrite for the semantics doc, I 
will have to fold 4.3 into 3.1 and revise from there.

Please nobody use anchors or section numbers later than 3.1 in 
referring to the semantics doc, until I give an all clear (end of 
this week, hopefully.)
