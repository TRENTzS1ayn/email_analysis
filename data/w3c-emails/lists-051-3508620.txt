Not sure what this all means, but please make sure that the test 
cases always have an explicit

<whatever> rdf:type rdfs:Datatype  .

antecedent for all the datatypes used.

Well, er, actually, in this case the entailment DOES hold, strictly 
speaking, rather in the way that False implies anything. But OK, you 
can *treat* it as not holding.

How about

_:x eg:foo "fiewh"^^xsd:integer .
_:x rdf:type xsd:integer .

??Strictly speaking, the MT says that this (trivially) entails 
anything, because its always false. Similarly

_:x eg:foo "fiewh"^^xsd:integer .
_:x rdf:type rdfs:Literal .
