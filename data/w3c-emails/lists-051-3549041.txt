I take it you are referring to

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-primer-20021111/#reification


The vocabulary is defined and we ought to explain somewhere what it 
means.  Schema is currently a little bare on the matter, but I suppose 
Danbri could fix that.

Why are you thinking of taking it out Frank?

I suppose the syntax document refers to it.  We'd be bound to get 
questions.  What does this bagID stuff do?

My inclination is to keep it in.  But we might want to make some 
discouraging noises about its use.
