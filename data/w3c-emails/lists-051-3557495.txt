Pat,

You did a wonderful job of getting the last WD in a very short time.  You 
met an unreasonable goal.  Whilst I want to keep up the momentum, I don't 
think we should set ourselves any more unreasonable goals.  This goes for 
everyone.

If you can meet this schedule, that would be great.  But if its an 
unreasonable goal, say so and we will plan accordingly.

Brian
