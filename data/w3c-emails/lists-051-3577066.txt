It does? Doh. I still think that's broken; but I'll fix the test case.
Basically these cases outline the various issues - I'll correct them as
appropriate.

NO. This is related to what Pat was complaining about. Basically, a
"Positive entailment test" with premise document P and consequent
document C passes if:

- P has an interpretation (ie, contains no semantic errors
  wrt the constraints imposed by the interpretation rules used
  for the test case) AND
- P entails C.

A "negative entailment test" passes if:

- P has no valid interpretations (contains a semantic error) OR
- P is ok but does not entail C.

The reason for this is to permit the following tests to be expressed:
these are all the scenarios we want to be able to test (I think) -

Document D1, semantically ok (wrt some interpretation constraints, let's
say, rdf+rdfs+dt[xsd:integer] ).
Document D2, contains semantic errors wrt the same interpretation
constraints (the MT makes it always come out false).
Document D3, a well-formed entailment of D1.
Document D4, a well-formed document that is not entailed by D1.

With the current test definitions, these can be expressed naturally by
introducing an empty document, E. Then

D1 is semantically ok (+ve ent test, D1 -> E)

D2 has semantic errors (encoded by -ve ent test, D2 -/-> E)

The relationship between D1 and D3 is captured by
(+ve ent test, D1 -> D3)

The relationship between D1 and D4 is captured by
(+ve ent test, D1 -> E)
(+ve ent test, D4 -> E)
(-ve ent test, D1 -/-> D4)


If you want to use straightforward _entailment_ (not this modified
notion used for the test cases) then you can do so BUT this requires you
to come up with a URI for a document that is abosultely false - ie,
unsatisfiable under any set of constraints. While such a document, F,
might be handy, it seems a bit beyond the scope of a test case document
to slip it under the radar. It also means that most of the scenarios
outlined above require multiple test cases to encode. It seemed simplest
to avoid the need for F and to leave test cases captured using the
current constructs.

I'm happy to revise this if you think it's necessary.
