Within _one_ datatype, that's true - this is rule rdfD 2 in the current
MT.

For multiple datatypes, the MT says this:

[[
These rules do not support any entailments based on identity between
values of different datatypes. An obvious generalization of the second
rule would permit such conclusions, but questions of identity between
items in value spaces of two different datatypes should be referred to
the authorities who defined the datatypes.
]]

- so where I've indicated test cases for equivalence between typed
literals in different datatypes, these probably fall into the same
category as JJC's boolean test case: that is, we attach a note to them
or something but don't approve them as part of the subset of test cases
that goes with the test case document. People might want to implement
those entailments, but it's "above and beyond the call".

Like I said, the test cases I've set out are primarily intended to be
illustrative of the various issues surrounding DTed literals. Hopefully
on Friday we can decide what to keep and what to chuck out.
