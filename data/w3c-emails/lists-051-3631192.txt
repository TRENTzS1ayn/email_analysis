I think so, but don't take my word for it.  Jeremy?

Nah - see below - you got it right unless we know that datatype is not 
rdf:XMLLiteral.  We know its not called that, but unless we make a unique 
name assumption, we don't know that its not another name for the same thing.

OK, so because its a neg entailment of the empty graph, then by this rule, 
there can be no valid interpretations.  I thought the model theory had bad 
datatype lex forms denoting something though, in which case there is an 
interpretation.  Right, from 3.4 of the MT:

[[For any typed literal "sss"^^ddd in G, if I(ddd) is in D and 'sss' is not 
a valid lexical form for I(ddd) then IL("sss"^^ddd) is not in LV]]

and

[[(this) condition requires than an 'ill-formed' typed literal, i.e. one 
where the literal string is not in the lexical space of the datatype, not 
denote any literal value. Intuitively, such a name does not denote any 
value, but in order to avoid the semantic complexities which arise from 
empty names, we requires such a typed literal to denote an 'arbitrary' value.]]

Thus there are interpretations of the graph

   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/test002.nt

and the test does not work

Lets get confirmation first
