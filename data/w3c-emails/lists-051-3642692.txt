Oh yes, you are right.  We are straying into specifying things about xsd 
that are not up to us.
But I do think we have to do that for the 10 and 010 cases.  I do think 
those need to be changed, but would want a second opinion.

Right agree.

I'm just trying to get a march on Friday; not trying to give you a hard time.
