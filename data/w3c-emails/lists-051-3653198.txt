I also think it is broken - hard to implement in a efficient fashion.
(And the N-Triples syntax above is wrong; ^^ not #)

Typed literals should be opaque nodes with identity, like URI-refs.
Looking at parts of them for RDF interpretations is wrong.  This
"ignoring the language in datatype interpretation except for
rdf:XMLLiteral" is seeming increasingly stupid.

If it said:
  [[
     <a> <b> XXX .
     <c> <d> XXX .

   where XXX is any legal syntax for typed literal object node

   entails

     <a> <b> _:l .
     <c> <d> _:l .
  ]]

Then it would make more sense to me.
