Yech. The words that the current test case WD uses are _extremely_
woolly

[[
A premise document that contains a semantic error with respect to any
constraints imposed by the entailment rules selected will cause this
[positive entailment] test to fail.
]]

and in particular, it's the case of duff lexical forms for datatyped
literals that I wanted to cover with this. In other words, if a graph
contains datatyped literals that need to be given "arbitrary"
denotations, that's (one kind of) the "semantic error" I was alluding
to.

This clearly needs putting in better terms. If the entailement tests can
be utilised for this purpose in their current form but with better
wordsmithing, that'd be good - but clearly some better words are
required, because the definition is currently clearly lacking!
