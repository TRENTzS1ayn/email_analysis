It turns out that it does, because "Arggggg"^^xsd:integer is given a
denotation (even if it's a "spurious" one), and I don't think the woolly
text in the TC WD is sufficient.

Righto. It looks like the state of play is that the test cases for
"duff" datatyped literals need a rethink, and I think I'm happier with
why and how, now. Since Pat's given us a concrete "this is all you get"
for the DT[xsd:integer]-closure from a duff datatyped literal, that's
enough to rebuild those test cases. I'll sleep on it and come back
tomorrow.
