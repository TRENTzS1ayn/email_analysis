Well, the problem for me is that next week is Thanksgiving week, and 
I will be in California on a phone line rather than in Florida on a 
T3. Which slows things down, I find, and often makes it a bit tricky 
to keep my copy of a doc in line with the copy on my home server. I 
fly back on the 2nd. So I would be happier if the inter doc freeze 
were pushed back to, say, 3 Dec rather than Nov 29, since otherwise I 
have to freeze by the day after tomorrow, in effect. That would give 
me an extra week. I can live with the other dates.

This only applies to sections 3/4 of the semantics doc, by the way. 
The rest should be freezable by Friday. I presume removing things can 
be done after freezing.

The current version is very sparse in internal anchors and the ones 
that are there are a mess, and I plan to re-do them. I will 
(re)anchor all the sections with forms like #section_1_3_1, but if 
anyone else wants a particular anchor in the text please let me know 
where (and if you like, provide the name you want to use.)

BTW, I'm keeping my 'latest' version now at 
http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_finalCall.html
so far it only has had some of the typos corrected (rdsf -> rdfs, 
Massimo's name)
