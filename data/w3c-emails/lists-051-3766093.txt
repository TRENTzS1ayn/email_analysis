Hmmm. So an literal can have three components: a string, a dtype and 
a lang tag, even when the dtype isn't rdf:XMLLiteral??

I just want to get this very clear, as I want to have all the cases 
listed in the basic MT rules. Right now there are cases I am missing, 
apparently.

Yes, anything entails the empty graph, because the empty graph is 
always true. It also entails

<a> <b> _:x .

Yes, I tend to agree at this stage. Still, it would have been fun.
