I tend to agree. Having XML literals as datatypes doesn't seem to 
help with anything and its starting to create new problems, because 
so many things are special to this case, not the least being that it 
alone is in RDF.

BTW, one thing I still don't have clear is what it is exactly that an 
XMLLiteral is supposed to denote. What is the value space of the 
datatype?? I used a form of words in the recent semantics doc that 
was so recondite that I thought one of the reviewers would have 
complained, but I'd rather say something simple and honest.

Yes, but that follows from the basic graph syntax MT, ie its a simple 
entailment. Nothing particularly to do with datatypes or lang tags.
