I defined it as the set of canonical XML documents with rdf-wrapper as the 
root tag.
Perhaps there is a slight lack of clarity in that I am talking about 
Platonic documents rather than actual documents. The "canonical" word sort 
of makes that an angels on pinhead discussion rather than one with any real 
content.

I don't know whether anyone would care to argue whether a document is or is 
not an XSD string. I would think not ... an xsd:string is a sequence of 
unicode code points, whereas a document is a sequence of bytes (a canonical 
XML document is a sequence of bytes in the UTF-8 charcater encoding).

The question is ...

rdf:XMLLiteral owl:sameIndividualAs <eg:dt> .
_:a <eg:a> "a"^^<eg:dt> .

hmmmm ....

which is easier? we could prohibit it.
