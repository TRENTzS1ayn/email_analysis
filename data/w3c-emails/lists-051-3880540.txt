Yeh, and I don't know what those are, or how the use of "canonical 
document" differs from saying that this is the string in the XML 
literal itself. We should define exactly what the lexical space, 
value space and L2V mappings are. Particularly since this will now be 
done first, it ought to be a model for all the other datatyping.

Well, make it more concrete. The value space consists of XML 
thingies. Can there be cases of two different XML literal strings 
denoting the same one of those thingies? That is, are there any cases 
that ought to trigger the inference rule rdfD-2 for XMLLiteral? 
(Assume there are no lang tags.) If not, I propose that we just say 
that the value space is the same as the lexical space.  But if there 
are any rdf:XMLLiteral-datatyping entailments then I ought to say 
what they are and incorporate them into rdf-entailment.

If there are lang tags, does having different lang tags guarantee 
that the canonical XML docs are distinct, or can there be cases where 
the lang tags dissolve into nothing and leave the docs identical? If 
the former, then the MT can treat XMLLiterals just like plain 
literals but with an XML syntax check added, which would be very nice 
and easy.

Lets agree that they are not, as far as we are concerned. After all, 
literal strings are not XSD strings either. Saying what XSD-anything 
is, is up to XMLS to do, not our job.

Nah, a "canonical" doc is in some Platonic doc space, on an entirely 
higher plane than such earthly things as bytes and UTF-8.

On reflection, lets just ignore it. Let Webont worry about that.
