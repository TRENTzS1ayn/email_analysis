On the last telecon we discussed the conflict between the current 
primer and a shorter, task-oriented primer. I've attempted to start 
writing the latter:

http://notabug.com/2002/rdfprimer/

It currently covers the RDF data model, N-Triples, RDF schema, and 
reification. I plan to add sections on model theory closures and 
RDF/XML. It's organized in order of importance, with no 
forward-references. It's written to be a friendly and helpful guide, 
and as a result doesn't sound like most TRs.

I'd like to hear your thoughts. Does the WG feel this is a valuable 
document to have? Do they feel it should be a TR (presumably a NOTE)? 
Is the style alright? Are there errors in the content? Is there 
something else I should cover? Thanks in advance.

The version I wrote today is archived at:

All the best,
