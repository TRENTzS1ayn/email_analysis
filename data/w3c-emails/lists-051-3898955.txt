I think the entailment should hold for all other datatype representations
of the same value where the datatype is a supertype of the xsd:integer.

I.e., if we are talking about RDF only entailments, no it doesn't hold.
But if we are talking about RDFS entailments, then we have to take into
account rdfs:subClassOf relations and the fact that for any datatype X that
is a subclass of some datatype Y, the value space of X is a subset of
that of Y. So the entailment would hold.

So there are four tests here:

RDF                    -> does not hold
RDF        + datatypes -> does not hold
RDF + RDFS             -> does not hold 
RDF + RDFS + datatypes -> holds for xsd:integer and all 
                          superclasses of xsd:integer

If the MT does not capture the above, it should. As should the
test cases.
