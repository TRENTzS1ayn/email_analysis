I've never quite understood why the lang tag was significant
in the case of rdf:XMLLiteral. Is it legacy from M&S or what?
Since the "wrapper" element is not normative and not really
present (and somewhat of a hack IMO) how is the actual meaning
of the literal affected by the lang tag ny differently than other 
types of literals? 

Can't we just treat all literals the same?

I prefer this model of entailment, because it clearly bases
the entailment on the denotation of the typed literal rather
than its representation, which is just a means to an end; that
end being the value, and once you have the value, the lexical
form and datatype is irrelevant.

Agreed.
