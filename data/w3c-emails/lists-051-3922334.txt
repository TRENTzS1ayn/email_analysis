It should be changed/fixed. The above entailment should hold. Any
application should be able to conclude that any two typed literals
which have identical lexical form and datatype URI denote the
same value, irrespective of any lang tag, and that conclusion should
be possible without any special datatype knowledge. I.e., it's
just an RDF entailment, not an RDF + datatypes entailment.
