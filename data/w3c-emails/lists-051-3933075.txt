My view has always been that the value space of an XML (complex) datatype
is the set of XML Infosets which the lexical forms (XML serializations)
correspond to.

Though I believe Jeremy views the value space as being the set of 
canonical serializations. Jeremy?

I think a value space of infosets is more useful.
