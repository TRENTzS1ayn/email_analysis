The earlier treatment had it but in a slightly less in-your-face manner. On
reflection I think the hoops that treatment jumped were more likely to
confuse, and being blunt, kludgy and ugly gains clarity.
At some level we inherited something that wasn't clear - we have made it
clear. If we were to start from scratch we would not have the rdf-wrapper,
e.g. change rdf:parseType="Literal" to be
 <eg:prop parseType="Literal" >
   <!--whitespace comment or PI -->
   <xml-content>
     <!-- just one element allowed, being the root element of the
       corresponding value.
   </xml-content>
   <!--whitespace comment or PI -->
 </eg:prop>

We still have the problems associated with invisibly used namespaces and
xml:lang scoping.

Another problem with infoset is which one?
In your other message you talk about Post Schema Validation Infoset, which
since we don't have a schema, presents particular difficulties ...

Also, Infoset includes a lot of things which we currently don't do, e.g.
entities are preserved, all namespace attributes are preserved. (Does
Infoset include document initial whitespace, or the XML declaration?)

Just put a rdf:parseType="Literal" in a chat or shopping example. The
langtag needs to be there.
