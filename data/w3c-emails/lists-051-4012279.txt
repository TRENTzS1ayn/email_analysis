a P+ means proof found for positive entailment test
a NP- means no proof found for negative entailment test (*)
a NP+ means no proof found for positive entailment test

so I think they're all OK (just that we can't find a proof
for the case semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes)

PS Jeremy, I had some trouble with Jena generated N3 triple objects such as
   " ... a "badly-formed" datatyped literal is a semantic error."
   so I had to escape the inner quotes as \"

It turns out that it does, because "Arggggg"^^xsd:integer is given a
denotation (even if it's a "spurious" one), and I don't think the woolly
text in the TC WD is sufficient.

Righto. It looks like the state of play is that the test cases for
"duff" datatyped literals need a rethink, and I think I'm happier with
why and how, now. Since Pat's given us a concrete "this is all you get"
for the DT[xsd:integer]-closure from a duff datatyped literal, that's
enough to rebuild those test cases. I'll sleep on it and come back
tomorrow.
