I appreciate your concern. In fact, there are two entailment tests for
this case (going both ways). I think the more explicit statement of this
test is a better one, but (since we _do_ say that test cases should be
viewed in conjunction with their descriptive text in the manifest) I'll
add your test case too and put some more words in on this subject.

This test case is about entailment, though, which isn't the same as
generating alternative representations.
