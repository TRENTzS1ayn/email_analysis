right, this is the traditional forward/backward chaining stuff
we do the latter and so start from the entailed graph and try
to find evidence for it in the premised graphs, which is quite
obvious here as the term "010"^^xsd:integer unifies with the
term "10"^^xsd:integer

that is of course working as well

PS I think I was completely wrong to have been suggesting
   examples such as "1E1"^^xsd:decimal as I now see that
   "1E1" is not an allowed xsd:decimal lexical representation

   [[
     decimal has a lexical representation consisting of a
     finite-length sequence of decimal digits (#x30-#x39)
     separated by a period as a decimal indicator.
   ]]
