Once again, our email will be down all this coming weekend;  this time 
from 6AM EST Saturday 11/23 through 6AM EST Monday 11/25 (more computers 
being moved).  Hence, I won't be directly getting email addressed to the 
list. If you need to email me directly during that period, you will need 
to use the attbi.com return address from this message.  I'll check the 
list archives periodically for most of the traffic though.
