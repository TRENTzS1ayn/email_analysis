I don't understand this.  In the previous paragraph, you said freenet
URIs have an owner.  So why is putting weight on URIs having an
authoritative owner a problem?  You may not (e.g., in the case of
freenet) know who the owner is, but is *that* a problem?  Is the problem
to do with being simultaneously "authoritative" and anonymous (and if so
could you explain further)?
