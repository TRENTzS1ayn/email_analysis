Over early uniform normalization, I am opposed to doing anything other than
deletion.

But ...

Maybe I should look over Dave's text and put the anchor back in somewhere
else. Since even without Early Uniform Normalization (which is a processing
model) we still require that literals and URI refs are normalized (which is
a declarative fact).

(Rationale for opposition to non-deletion)
RDF M&S has these future references on character normalization, and the
future is still not arrived. I think DaveB tells me that future promises
shouldn't be in specs; I have come round to that point of view.
