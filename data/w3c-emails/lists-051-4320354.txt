Hmm. NOw I need to know what an 'infoset' is.

Reading http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/. I find no definitions, 
only descriptions which assume that the reader already knows the 
concept. Patrick, do YOU know what they are talking about?

That has the merit of being clearly defined, in contrast to "infoset".
