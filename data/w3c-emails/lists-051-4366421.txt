Well,

I'd hope nobody's referencing that one because it's been flagged as "due 
for the chop" for some time now.

In this case, I think it should probably go (with suitable warning to the 
other authors, of course)... publication checks will pick up any obsolete 
references, which, if they exist, should probably be removed.

Brian, the answer to your later question is the first paragraph above.  The 
corresponding material is being removed.  I think Jeremy has picked up a 
genuine exception to the eminently sensible general rule you have 
established concerning anchors.  If this has a knock-on effect on other 
documents, we have to deal with that.
