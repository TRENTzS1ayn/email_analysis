This is just a heads up on a couple of things.  The first is that I've 
removed section 3.3 (the RDF/XML abbreviations section), and removed 
some of the abbreviations from section 3.1 as well (e.g., nested 
rdf:Description elements).  Basically, section 3.1 now shows you how to 
   take a graph (e.g., a set of triples) and write the most 
straightforward RDF/XML representation of that graph (using rdf:resource 
in cases where the object of a statement is another resource, rather 
than nesting the new resource within the element).  This roughly 
corresponds to the M&S "basic serialization syntax", with the addition 
of the use of nodeID when bNodes are involved.  I point to the Syntax 
spec for the other abbreviations (and I think this dovetails nicely with 
the Syntax spec, since the Syntax spec starts with the "striping" idea, 
whereas I started with how you represent individual statements in the 
graph.)

Reification is back in (and I'm adding an example that I think clarifies 
some things Brian had problems with when he reviewed that section).

I'm beginning to doubt the Primer will be ready for a final review on 
Dec. 6 (although I'll try).  I'm sort of in Pat's spot here:  I'll be on 
the road all of next week (much of that literally;  we're driving to 
Washington DC for Thanksgiving) and not able to work most of that time.
