Yes.

Look, I CAN leave it the way it is, more or less. I had been trying 
to make it be that the document was organized in layers like:

basic graph entailment
RDF and RDF entailment
RDFS and RDFS entailment
Datatyping and D-entailment

.Keeping it layered and having XMLLiteral in the RDF namespace means 
I should put the XML datatyping into the second layer, and the rest 
of datatyping stays where it is but now needs to be rewritten a 
little (that is no big deal). BUt this changes the definition of 
rdf-entailment and hence of rdfs_entailment. Which is rather a bigger 
deal.

Jeremy apparently wants to not have the namespace change make any 
difference to the entailments. LIke I said, we could go that way, and 
it would be a lot less of a change. It then reads kind of oddly, 
though, in that just one thing in the RDF namespace isn't actually 
given any semantics in RDF or in RDFS, but requires access to a 
datatype. But there isn't any datatype for it: the last section 
refers dtype issues to the owner of the datatype, and we ARE the 
owner of this datatype, so its up to us to say what its semantics is, 
right? And if we are doing it, why aren't we doing it in RDF 
already???

I assumed that the namespace change was intended to lead to all these 
changes to the entailments. If not, then I should probably leave well 
enough alone; and then its just a matter of editing rdfs/rdf here and 
there and putting a bit of protective prose explaining why 
rdf-entailment ignores rdf:XMLLiteral.

Anyone object to that?
