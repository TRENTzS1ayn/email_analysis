I had tried ... I'll try again:

Retry.
I support early uniform normalization.
It is about processing and constrains a processing model.
The RDF specs do not have a processing model.
If we wish to have EUN then we either need to invoke some other spec (e.g. 
charmod) or define a processing model in order to constrain it (too much 
like hard work, tail wagging dog).

Another option is to leave a paragraph like the 5.1 text in, and half 
delete it - e.g. make it a note about the future.
This is what happened in M&S and it was, with hindsight, a mistake.

The option of invoking charmod is now dead, so, as far as I am concerned 
the best path is a clean deletion of something that I think I would have 
really preferred to be in.
