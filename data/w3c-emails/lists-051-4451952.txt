Thanks for the pointer and excerpt; this is about wording
details, after all, I believe...

That's pretty good, except we should perhaps s/each URI/most URIs/.

i.e. it is often the case that the chain thru the URI, HTTP, and DNS
specs gets you pretty clearly to an authoritative owner.

But it's not, strictly speaking, the case that

For all URIs u, there exists socially-responsible party p
such that owns(p, u).

If I were going to be precise, I'd say that

For all URIs u, there is some global contract
(that you can find by taking the scheme part of u
and looking it up in the IANA registry, and following
your nose thru references from there) that
says how the name u takes on a meaning that the
global community agrees is authoritative.

This more precise defintion applies to news:comp.lang.python;
if you look up news:, you'll find references to the
USENET news protocols and (I think) eventually to
the USENET policies for creating newsgroups by
proposal/discussion/vote etc. So news:comp.lang.python
means what the community agreed, thru that process,
that it means.

But I think just changing "each" to "most" sufficies...
let's see...

well, there again, the "... from which" part isn't universally true.

can't think of a wording fix just now, but I think I've made the point
above.

That part is fine.

bzzt. RDF doesn't really assume that or rely on that. Practical
use of it does rely on *some* grounding of URIs to social context; but
the social context doesn't have to be an owner; it can be
a historical context like a USENET newsgroup vote.

That's true (and worth saying) in the case of HTTP and DNS,
but the general case is more subtle.

Quite.

I don't think owners are critical, but rather: social context.
