Move the anchor to a changes section.  

I see you don't have one, so I'd suggest adding that.

The link is in my description of the rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces and
rdf-charmod-literals issues at 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#rdf-charmod-literals

so that would have to be updated.  Please suggest what the updated
words should be.

However, that entire section will go at first REC stage.  Or maybe
last call?  I've already added a warning at the start of
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Updated-Grammar-changes

so I can certainly choose to remove it.

Dave
