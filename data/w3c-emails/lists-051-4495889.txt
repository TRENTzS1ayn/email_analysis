Did that thread resolve satisfactorily ...

Concepts start off now

"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for representing
information in the Web."

I note this is logically equalivant to, the slightly less clumsy:

"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) represents information in the
Web."

However, it's much more important that we all have the same one.
