I'd prefer to leave this at "language" rather than "framework".  I admit 
that RDF has "framework" in it, but we never actually say what a 
"framework" is (and the Concepts document starts off immediately talking 
about "syntax", which seems more of a "language" notion).  If we're 
going to describe this as a "framework", I'd feel some compulsion to say 
what we mean by that (including how the "language" aspects of RDF fit 
into that "framework").
