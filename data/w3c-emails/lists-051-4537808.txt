I have uploaded these to:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces/

Two parser tests, one using the RDF from the issues list. The other using
the mathML example from M&S.

Manifest also written.

I used the Validator to create the N-triple and then modified by hand to do
the datatyping. We should check that the number of spaces etc. is correct.
