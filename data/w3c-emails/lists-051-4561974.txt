This action might have timed out ....


Proposed boiler plate. The first two lines should be modified to fit
whatever document. The last sentence also is pretty optional. The crucial
sentence is "Within ...", which is in your face about the non-ASCII
characters

[[
RDF uses absolute URI references extensively.
These are defined in RFC 2396 [*Cite*].
Within RDF, non-ASCII characters may be used as part of
URI references as described in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Graph-URIref">
RDF Concepts</a> [*Cite*].
RDF only uses relative URI references within
the RDF/XML serialization.
]]

I think the model theory text is fine as is (just a straight import of the
term renaming it on the way).
I personally like the syntax doc too ... uses the term from concepts ...

So partly this text is to put earlier in concepts!

(This is intended to help the other editors, if it is not helpful, ignore
it).
