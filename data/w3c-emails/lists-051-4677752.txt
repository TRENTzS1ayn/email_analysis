There is some overlap between section 0.1 of semantics and section 2.4 of
concepts.

An informal decision between Pat and Jeremy was that:

- the concepts editors will explore the overlap
- text in semantics that says points not already in concepts that
could/should move into concepts will be copied
- the concepts editors will suggest shorter replacement text for section 0.1
of semantics.

==

I imagine the outcome will be that 0.1 is reduced to only identifying
limitations, and that things outside the scope of the formal semantics will
be discussed in concepts.
