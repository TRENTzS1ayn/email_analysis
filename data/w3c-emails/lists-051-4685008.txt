Yes; that's a very good specification;
please

(1) put it in the manifest, ala

<rdf:Description about="#datatypesEntailmentRules">
  <rdfs:comment>
An entailment test case that's described as having
datatype support for DTs X, Y and Z is this: that to be able to run the
test case, you are able to decide:
 
 for any two datatyped literals, a and b, with the datatypes
 of a and b coming from {X, Y, Z},
 
 do a and b represent the same value?
 
 (You don't need to be able to work out what that value is; just to
 answer that question.)

(2) say that in the tests WD somewhere too, and

(3) point to it from the relevant tests; i.e. change

<test:entailmentRules
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes#" />

to

<test:entailmentRules
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest#datatypesEntailmentRules" />

I don't think it's essential; i.e. there's no closed-world
assumption that needs to be made explicit. datatype entialment
is monotonic w.r.t. the number of datatypes you support;
i.e. if G1 datatypes(dt1,dt2)-entials G2, then we know
G1 datatypes(dt1,dt2,dt3)-entails G2.
