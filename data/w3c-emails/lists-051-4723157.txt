Lets not.

Why are we creating such dependencies between RDF and xml schema.  The RDF 
test cases should test rdf.  Lets keep to any dependencies of subtle 
aspects of xml schema datatypes out of it.  This point seems to be subtle 
enough to have misled DanC.  And lets not give ourselves any more work than 
we have to.  We are a little short of time after all.

Dan, if you want this to go into an rdf test suite, I'd like to see a 
compelling reason why its necessary for RDF.  The XML schema guys can do 
their own.
