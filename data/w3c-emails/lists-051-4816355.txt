I'm fine with this as long as it is clear (somewhere) that
datatype entailments involving equality of values between 
different datatypes are based on the definitions of the
datatypes themselves, and if the relationships between 
the datatypes are not part of the formal definitions of
the datatypes, then the entailments cannot be determined.

I.e. we need to be clear about the basis for the entailments
and not work solely on the basis of human intuition.
