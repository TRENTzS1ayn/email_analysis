I was looking over XSD again.
It seems to me as though the recommendation to use XSD within RDF raises 
more questions than we have currently been considering. IMO, it may knock 
us off target (and probably should).

I have begun working on what I think would be a set of answers ...

See:

or maybe (the supposedly equal)

(I have a stylesheet issue - in the tables red text may only come out in 
purple with a strikethrough, whereas the green text comes out in purple 
without the strikethrough).
