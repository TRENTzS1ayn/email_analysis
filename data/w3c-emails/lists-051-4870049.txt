Clearly, a target audience for my doc, after I have addressed the string valued datatypes is the XML Schema WG.
I tend to agree with DanC, that we haven't really done datatyping until an implementor can implement. Since HP intend to implement our specs, it is necessary for someone in HP to work out what they mean. When the specs are self-contradictory this is a problem. (Not an uncommon problem :( ).

I think it makes more sense for the WG to do this work once for everyone, rather than leave it to the implementors to do it, possibly differently, one by one.

It's a shame we took so long on the RDF mechanics, and have hence neglected the XSD side of the picture.
