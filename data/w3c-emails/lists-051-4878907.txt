(Not an uncommon problem :( ).

Well, while I also agree in principle with DanC that at the end of the day, this
stuff has to do some real work, I still don't see that it is the concern of the RDF
Core WG that the XML Schema datatypes have some problems -- other than
to perhaps point them out. I.e., if the XML Schema specs say that floats and
decimals are disjunct -- or if that is a possible interpretation -- then let's avoid
those in examples and test cases, but there's nothing wrong with RDF and thus
it is not the RDF Core WG's job to sort out that mess.

That's not to say, of course, that members of the RDF Core WG, also being
members of the RDF and XML communities should not work towards clarification
of the issues, but it's out of scope IMO for the RDF Core WG itself.

Cheers,

Patrick
