Can you please confirm the 'Changes since last publication' section
is since the http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-concepts-20021108/ version?

Maybe you can add those words and link to that section.  Is that
section going to be in the published version (I hope yes).  If any
further section is going to be deleted, please note that too.

Are there any deleted anchors?  There seem to be deleted sections, so
I guess yes.  Is anyone using them?

"Moved all dfn into normative parts of the document, with the
exception of dfn-blank-node-id and dfn-URIref."
?  Why the exception, and why are they in a non-normative section.  A
pointer and explanation please.

Maybe add links to all the linked changes, sections, defns.

Maybe another cross-doc consistency point.  I changed the acks
section in the syntax WD to be paragraphs rather than a large
vertical <ul>.  Using the same words as the first concepts WD:

There are lots of changes to this document and I'm worried about it
since it is meant to be ready for last call and there seems to be
more than just editorial changes so far.  I'm expecting this will
need a substantial review.

Thanks

Dave
