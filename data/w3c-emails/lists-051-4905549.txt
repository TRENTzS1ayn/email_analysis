My pref is not; I am not strongly opinionated on this.

The only candidate is the clown example ...
We have editorial comments suggesting rework and/or deletion.

Apart from you no W3C specs refer to the xtoc anchors.
I don't believe any others have gone .... not sure though.

The blank-node-id is explicitly "not part of the RDF abstract syntax"
[unchanged].
Hence informative seems appropriate.

dfn-URIref is seen as an informal abrbeviation for dfn-URI-reference, which
is normatively defined.

I was wondering about that as a possibility ...

Substantive changes? The adding of the "normative" words, (or is that a
clarification of intent). The deletion of 5.1 which was flagged in the first
version as a possibility. Other changes are dealing with editorial comments
that we hadn't addressed in the rush to the last publication.

No it's not; not until the end of the week!

Rewriting a section to say the same thing in different words is editorial. I
do not believe that there are any changes in the substance of what is being
said here.

We have set aside in the calendar a significant review period.
I am expecting all our docs to require substantial review.
