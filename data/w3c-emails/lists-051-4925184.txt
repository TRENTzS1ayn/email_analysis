Jeremy,

These words were originally penned in response to a comment from TimBL, in 
which he suggested that the predicate was of primary importance in 
determining the meaning of a statement.  There has since been some 
disagreement with what I drafted, and the language has been watered down to 
try and capture a sense of the importance of the predicate without 
asserting that it is of "primary" importance.

I think TimBL was making an observation about the practicalities of using 
RDF that is not easy to capture in its formal specification.  I think your 
revised wording effectively captures the part which is reasonably part of 
the specification (modulo discussion elsewhere about authority).
