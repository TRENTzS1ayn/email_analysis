There were some words in Concepts that tried to address this in the case of 
entailments:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/wip/RDF-concepts/2002-11-05/rdf-concepts.html#section-Entailment

I see this is not in the latest working version.  Probably that's 
fine;  just pointing out.  Are the words any use for the test case draft?
