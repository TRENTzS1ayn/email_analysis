OR... we are describing the consequences of those things specified 
elsewhere under the appropriate RDF+datatype-entailment?  So the suggested 
entailments follow because of those specifications, not in spite of 
them.  I think this can also apply to different-datatypes that are defined 
with overlapping value spaces.
