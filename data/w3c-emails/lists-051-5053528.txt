Item 7: Test cases.
   [the rest of the telecon was devoted to the datatype test cases]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0447.html

  The datatype test case discussion was long and involved (see
  transcript). Outcomes:

Pending editorial changes and small fixes, the test cases were approved,
barring the cross-datatype entailment (although general feeling was
that it also held). A decision on that was held back pending further email
discussion.

ACTION 2002-11-22#1 (jang) ensure test cases themselves are named using
frag IDs (see jjc's OWL test cases)

ACTION 2002-11-22#2 (jang) [test case fix] remove RDFS entailment rules
from the language-ignored-for-numeric-types cases.

ACTION 2002-11-22#3 (path, jjc) Tie MT datatype to the sec that points
out language isn't important to DT entailment
thatexcept for rdf:XMLLiteral

ACTION 2002-11-22#4 (jjc) create an example.org DT-entailment
showing that language is not relevant.

ACTION 2002-11-22#5 (jjc) check that RDF Concepts does not allow a
synonym for rdf:XMLLiteral

ACTION 2002-11-22#6 (danc) review RDF Semantics, with a particular view
to "define a language, not a software spec"

ACTION 2002-11-22#7 (jang) DT test case: range clashing with DT
specification

There was discussion as to whether our current treatment of the
interaction of datatyped literals and language could be improved.

ACTION 2002-11-22#8 (jjc) Liase with I18N people on whether they're
happy with the DT/language setup as it is.
