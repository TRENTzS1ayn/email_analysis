I wasn't shying away from it, I was trying to avoid a last call dependency 
on it.

However, you are pretty serious about this.

It seems to me that what we need, as well as test cases, is an RDF Schema 
for XML Schema datatypes.  If we are going to expect an xsd datatypes aware 
processor to be aware of the class hierarchy, someone should write down 
definitively what it is.

DanC, would you be willing to take an action to:

   1 write an RDF Schema for XSD datatypes
   2 Define a set of test cases to illustrate that schema and the datatype 
entailment rules
   3 Verify that RDF Schema and the test cases with the XML Schema folks
   4 Bring the schema and test cases back to RDFCore for review

Brian
