Yes. Sorry. Typo. I meant

   xsd:decimal rdfs:subClassOf xsd:float .

Hold one... have to check outside my window to make sure
the sky hasn't fallen....  ;-) ;-) ;-)

I think the first two proposals are definitely what we should do. The
timing of the third may be a bit rushed. Since the subtleties of the
XML Schema datatypes within the RDF Datatyping context may take time
to work out fully, and will be significant for some time to come, I'd
rather see it done right than done quickly. Perhaps we could aim to have
at least a draft of a note before proposed rec. Of course, if we can
get the finished note before then, great, but I think it is better not
to bind the two activities too tightly, especially since it really doesn't
affect the RDF specs at all.
