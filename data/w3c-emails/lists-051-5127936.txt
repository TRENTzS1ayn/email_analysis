This has nothing to do with our design, but with ambiguity in
the XML Schema datatyping specs. I read them as saying that the
following assertions are not licensed:

   xsd:decimal rdfs:subClassOf xsd:float .
   xsd:float rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .

i.e. "10.0"^^xsd:float  !=  "10.0"^^xsd:decimal

and if we're going to have test cases for the above, they should
be negative entailment tests, since IMO XML Schema doesn't
license the datatype entailment

IF
{
   thing:A some:Property "10.0"^^xsd:float .
   thing:B some:Property "10.0"^^xsd:decimal .
}
THEN
{
   thing:A some:Property _:x .
   thing:B some:Property _:x .
}

It is NOT the duty of the RDF Core WG to resolve the above
ambiguity or fix XML Schema datatypes so that applications can
fairly consider that "10.0"^^xsd:float  ==  "10.0"^^xsd:decimal,
even if it is relevant to the RDF community.

This seems more like an issue for the SW Coord. Group or the TAG
to resolve.

It is IMO enough if we simply say somewhere "here be dragons".

Surely you're not proposing we throw out the typed literals and
go only with lexical constraints?!

Again, this has nothing to do with the RDF design. In fact, the present
datatyping solution provided by RDF is helping the XML community by
shining a light on these problemmatic issues and "encouraging" the
XML Schema folks to fix them.
