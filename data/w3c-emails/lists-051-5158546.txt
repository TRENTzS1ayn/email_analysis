I think you are missing the critical point here. And that is that
the XML Schema specs say that *NEITHER* of the above are true.

Whether one might argue that the latter is true or not is completely
beside the point insofar as the RDF Core WG is concerned. We do
not own XML Schema datatypes. We have provided a datatyping solution
that allows folks to use XML Schema datatypes in RDF. Such usage
can and should respect that there is no defined intersection of values
between xsd:float and xsd:decimal.

If folks want to ensure that

    xsd:float rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .

is true in the XML Schema specs, then that should happen in/with the
XML Schema WG. It's not *our* concern insofar as getting the RDF
specs out with a sufficient set of test cases.

RDF datatyping works perfectly either way.
