Well, I would say that there are no words whatsoever defining
any subtype relation between xsd:float and xsd:decimal -- and
so the question then is "where are the words" that define such
a relation.

The reality is that neither can be a subtype of the other because
both have values in their value spaces which don't occur in the others.

Whether or not their value spaces intersect, is still an open question.
I think that anyone with half a clue would presume that they do in fact
intersect -- and that if the specs suggest they don't that they should
be fixed -- but the ambiguity is there.

I fully agree, and we should do that, and move on. And when moving
on, avoid the controversial areas of XML Schema datatypes by using
examples where there is clear derivation defined by the XML Schema
spec.
