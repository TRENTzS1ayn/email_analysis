Looking wid' my own lil' eyes, and probably repeating what jjc has
already pointed out:

XML Schema/datatypes document is absolutely clear on this -
Section 3.2.3 (definition of decimal value space) and 3.2.4 (definition
of float value space) are pretty straightforward: where a member of the
value space is a number (most are), the values from decimal and float
coincide. Float also contains the usual IEEE guff: NaN, +-0, +-inf.

So neither type is a subClassOf the other; but many of their values
coincide.

float may or may not be a subClassOf double; that depends on whether
Nan^^float = NaN^^double, etc, which doesn't appear to be expressed in
the XML schema document (possibly in the IEEE doc?)

You know something's gone badly wrong when your algorithm
takes O(n^2) time but uses O(2^n) space.
