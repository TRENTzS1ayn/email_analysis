I completed my investigation doc.

More important points are:

- there are issues with the XSD document: most is clear, a small part is
clear in the opposite direction.
- types derived by restriction correspond to rdfs:subClassOf
- don't use xsd:QName, xsd:ENTITY, xsd:ENTITIES
- even if we stick to the bits that are clear then implementation looks
hard.
Particularly any test that relies on finiteness of a datatype, or of an
intersection between datatypes.


Another hard entailment:

_:a rdfs:subClassOf xsd:postiveInteger .
_:a rdfs:subClassOf xsd:byte .

entails

_:a rdfs:subClassOf xsd:unsignedLong .


(I don't think my paper helps much with that one).
