Yes, clearly this text is inconsistent with other parts of the
spec:

|  ?value space?  A and ?value space?  B where A and B are not

I'd like this WG to report our problems with that text.
Failing that, I guess Jeremy and I can report it.

Amen. I came to that same conclusion in my investigation.
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/util/datatypes.n3

I found that all these were goofy:

    # dt:QName # omitted due to ambiguity
    # dt:NOTATION # omitted; DTD support not merited
    # NMTOKEN
    # NMTOKENS
    # ID
    # IDREF
    # IDREFS
    # ENTITY
    # ENTITIES

some for more aesthetic than technical reasons, I suppose.

Yes; I didn't have this information when we made our 11Oct
decision.

(items 7 and 8)

Though I was vaguely concerned...

We really expect to

Likewise the 6Sep decision

(item 10)

I'm considering asking to reopen them.
