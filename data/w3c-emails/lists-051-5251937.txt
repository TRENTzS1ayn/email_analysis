needs in scope namespaces

needs user defined types (merely an abstract datatype at this level)

OK - but really corresponds to an XML DTD concept.

ditto

Both duplicates of NCName so no need to use them, (except for XML DTD
compatibility issues that I haven't yet come across).

(There isn't an NCNames built-in ...)

Need surrounding document

I am largely in agreement with Dan. When we recommend the use of XSD, we
probably should recommend a subset. I am a little worried about the equality
issues on the datetime objects .... Mainly XSD jsut defers to an ISO
standard for those.
