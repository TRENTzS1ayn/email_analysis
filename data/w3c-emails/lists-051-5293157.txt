To: Graham Klyne<GK@NineByNine.org>, RDF core WG<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>


I just peeked into the list after a couple of days of working on other 
stuff and this was the first message I saw.  I am responding to it without 
having seen other recent traffic.

Have we not discussed different ways of doing datatyping enough?

The issues that Graham addresses here are closed.  I hope the WG will have 
the self discipline to recognise that, and that this will be the only 
response on the list to Graham's post.

Brian
