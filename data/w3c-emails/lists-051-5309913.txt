No. We have discussed it more than I would have liked,
but not enough to air all the relevant issues.
I have seen new information since these decisions

11Oct (items 7 and 8)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0131.html

6Sep (item 10)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0081.html

and now that you have asked the WG, yes,
I support re-opening them. I think the decisions
we've taken will do more harm than good.

Well, I'm confused. You could have just said "this issue is closed;
stop talking about it on this list." But you didn't; you
asked whether we should reopen it; my opinion is
that we should, so I can't just not reply.
