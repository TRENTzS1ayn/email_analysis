I dunno what "the source of the subject uriref" means.  What is the source 
of uriref?  Maybe: just delete?

A statement with this property as predicate, states that further 
information about the subject is to be found in the object resource.  Such 
statements are typically used to identify an RDF schema that contains the 
defining description of the subject resource.  The object resource is not 
constrained to be in any specific form.  It may be an RDF Schema document 
or it may be anything else, including a literal.
