(OK ...) hmmm, what about ...

[[[

This specification allows an implementation some freedom to choose 
exactly 
what string it will use as the lexical form of an XML Literal.  Whatever 
string an implementation uses , it must form an XML document
when enclosed within a start and end element tag, and then
 its canonicalization 
 (without comments, as 
defined in ...) must be the same as the same canonicalization of the 
literal text l.
In some applications, an acceptable implementation is 
to use l without change.
This is incorrect if, for example, l uses entity references or
namespace prefixes defined in the outer document.
