RDFS doesn't make that assumption (although it is *consistent* with 
that, if you want to assume it.) Think of 'class' as meaning 
something like 'classification category' or 'concept', eg it is 
traditional to distinguish the concepts 'hairless bipedal arthropod' 
and 'human' even though they have the same instances. RDFS allows 
such 'intensional' usages.

We are simply allowing intensional distinctions between concepts 
which happen to 'accidentally' have the same instances. That is 
perfectly coherent, and indeed has been argued to be a desireable 
property of a description language by many eminent authorities.
