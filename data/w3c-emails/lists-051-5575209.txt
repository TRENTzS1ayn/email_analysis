I absolutely agree. It is not our job to fix or even to clarify XSD 
datatyping. We can state our requirements in terms of what 
information a datatype-savvy inference engine would require and what 
inferences it can draw as a result, without once making any 
substantial claims about what the actual data obtained from XSD would 
actually be. If Dan and Jeremy wish to help XML Schema get their 
house in order, then all strength to them. In the meantime, however, 
we should get on with our job.
