OK, I'll bite...

You give us:

   Jenny ex:age '10' .
   ex:movie ex:title '10' .
entails
   Jenny ex:age _:x .
   ex:movie ex:title _:x .

But does:

   Jenny ex:age '10' .
   ex:age <datatyperange> xsd:integer .
   ex:movie ex:title '10' .
   ex:title <datatyperange> xsd:string .
entail
   Jenny ex:age _:x .
   ex:movie ex:title _:x .
?

If no, then this is non-monotonic.

If yes, what is this value _:x that is in some sense both an integer and a 
string?
