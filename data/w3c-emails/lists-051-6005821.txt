I'm a little unclear on proposal C... in
particular, what does it say about what
folks can put in schemas to constrain
an age propoerty to be/look-like decimals?


The 6Sep minutes
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0081.html
cite a 29Aug proposal
http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/rdf-datatyping.html
which says "The RDF class extension of an rdfs:Datatype
is its value space."

I want to be sure that whatever spec we come up with,
I can continue to use the datatype property idiom...

So far, our (published WD) specs have been consistent
with a view that classes and properties are disjoint. (In
SWAD, we use that assumption for lint-style checking.)
The 6Sep decision seems to conflict with the
use of the datatype property idioim under
the disjointness-of-properties-and-classes
assumption.
