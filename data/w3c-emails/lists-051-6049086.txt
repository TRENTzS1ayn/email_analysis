Now that we have tidy literals, do we actually agree what (tidy) kind of 
thing they actually denote, so we can say something sensible in the 
concepts document?

I.e., in:

   Jenny age "10" .

is there anything to say about what the "10" actually denotes?

 From past discussion, I'm expecting that the answer will be that a literal 
denotes a composite value consisting of a Uniocode string, a language code 
and an XML flag, or something of that kind.  That would tally with the 
current abstract syntax description [1].

On that basis, my proposed additional text for section 2.4.3 of the 
concepts document would be:
[[
An untyped literal is either a string literal or an XML literal, either of 
which consists of a sequence of Unicode characters and a language 
code.  See section 3.2 for details.
]]
