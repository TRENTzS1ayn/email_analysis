May I point you to the services of 

  Datatyping Dependency Detoxification

the new specially convened forum for members of RDF Core, and other members of 
RDF Interest and RDF Logic who find themselves in uncontrollable e-mail 
spasms with datatyp appearing somewhere in the subject line.

Depending on the severity of your condition we either offer regular one hour 
therapy sessions with our on-line counsellers; or datatyping cold turkey, in 
which our specially trained team come and smash up all your computers and 
other electronic communication equipment. After a week in isolation you will 
be assessed as to the extent of your recovery, and gradually reexposed to the 
dangers of the Internet.

Datatyping: determined - drop the dependency!
