Yes, I was thinking that too.  We have set things up for a FUTURE wg to 
consider this option.  But for now, we have done as much as we can.  I will 
add long range datatyping as a postponed issue to the issue list.  In the 
meantime, please remember that we are out of time and cannot take on any 
more than finishing what we have.
