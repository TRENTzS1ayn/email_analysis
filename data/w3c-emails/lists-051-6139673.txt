Sparse but approved.


6. Semantics of untyped Literals - reviewing most recent information

Information reviewed see:

   webont results
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0055.html
   pat's possible untidy route
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0061.html
   implementations of option F
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0083.html
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0084.html

PatH withdraw proposal after it was suggested that it was complex.
Discussion of merging options C and F, did not receive much support.


7: Semantics of untyped Literals - Picking the most promising option
   The options:
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0049.html

The chair removed option D unopposed.
The chair removed option B unopposed (but DanC was 'unhappy').
(The chair noted that B/C was pretty even within the working group, but the
webont feedback on option B was compelling).
The chair noted that strongest support and least dissent was for option C.
The chair confirmed that the changed Nokia vote was taken into account in
that judgement (cf:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0080.html
).
The chair noted that without an agreement the WG lacked sufficient consensus
to publish a further Model Theory WD.

Mike Dean noted that in this situation he would oppose C. He hoped that it
might be possible to ask both questions (C and F).

8: Semantics of untyped Literals - reviewing the question

   C: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0098.html

(Note: technically this agendum was merged with item 7 during the course of
the meeting).
Aaron was unhappy with the additions, many of the rest of the WG spoke in
support of the additions.
Aaron agreed that he could vote for option C (even with the additions) as
long as it was noted that he maintained his opposition to some aspects of
the additions as a comment.
