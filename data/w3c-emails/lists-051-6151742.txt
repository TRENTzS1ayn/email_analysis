When I came to do the minutes I found I did not have a comment from Aaron
that qualified his vote to the heart of the matter (the tidy entailment) and
not modifying his (previously recorded?) opposition to (overall complexity,
rdf:datatype?).

Realising that I could not do justice to this aspect of the meeting, I
suggest in the minutes that Aaron should reply to them, to comment on his
vote, as part of the meeting record.
