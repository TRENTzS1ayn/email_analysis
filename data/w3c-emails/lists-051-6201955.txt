It takes place at the application layer, which understands the
particular datatypes in question. It definitely happens outside
the scope of the RDF MT.

What the RDF MT does is set the ground rules for how such mappings
are executed and also provides an equality test for pairings having
identical datatype and lexical form. Otherwise, it's up to the
extra-RDF application operating based on the defined semantics
of the datatype (wherever/however defined) to execute the lexical
to value mappings and make any comparisons between values.

Correct. The RDF MT only provides a clear case of equality when
the datatype and lexical forms are the same.

I agree it is definitely not syntactic. I consider it semantic, and
outside/above the scope of the RDF MT, but constrained in critical
ways by the RDF MT.

And because it is outside/above the scope of the RDF MT, all the
abstract syntax should reflect are the pairings, not the values
or anything else relating to the lexical to value mapping.
