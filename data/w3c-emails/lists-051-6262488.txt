Well, it's identical to what "10" denotes anywhere else in
n-triples, and it's distinct from what "010" denotes,
and from what "abc" denotes, and so on.

I'm confused by the above.

It seems to me that the class of Literals is a sort of union:

1.a strings, resulting from
<title>abc</title>
where no xml:lang dominates the <title> propElt

1.b lang-strings, resulting from
<title xml:lang="en">abc</title>

2.a XML infoset thingies, resulting from
<title rdf:parseType="Literal">some <em>very</em> good
stuff</title>
[some text earlier in a thread said that this was a
unicode string; I wouldn't say that; it can be serialized as
a unicode string, as we do in n-triples. But that doesn't
make it a string]

2.b XML infoset thingies, with lang, resulting from
<title xml:lang="en"
rdf:parseType="Literal">some <em>very</em> good
stuff</title>

3.a datatype values, resulting from
<date rdf:datatype="&xsd;date">2000-10-12</date>
These consist of an absolute URI reference
and a unicode string.

I dunno if we have 3.b lang-datatype-values. I hope not.

Nor do I know if datatype values of type &xsd;string are
identical to normal 1.a strings. It seems best, for users,
if they are, but it's sort of an ugly special case.

Test case:

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#something">
  <p1>abc</p1>
  <p2 rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">abc</p2>
</rdf:Description>

entails?

<rdf:Description rdf:about="#something">
  <p1 rdf:nodeID="X" />
  <p2 rdf:nodeID="X" />
</rdf:Description>

(please add that to the test collection, Jeremy/Jan/et. al.)
