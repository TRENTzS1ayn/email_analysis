Re: agenda item 12

Sorry Frank 

we were well into the fag end of the meeting by that point, and I think the 
minutes correctly reported a point that the chair appeared to listen to, 
without recording any official decisions.

I believe Graham and I have taken your text into account, but wouldn't be 
surprised if you feel a need to reraise it when we review the next version of 
the concepts doc.

Jeremy
