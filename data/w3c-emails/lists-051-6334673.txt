OK, I think I see the problem.  In addressing the peripheral issues, I 
overlooked the headline comment...

Section 2.3.1 has:
[[
The RDF model theory treats RDF as a simple assertional language, in which 
each triple makes a distinct assertion, and the meaning of any triple is 
not changed by adding other triples. Based on the semantics defined in the 
model theory, it is simple to translate an RDF graph into a logical 
expression with essentially the same meaning.
]]


And section 2.3.2 has:
[[
RDF/XML documents, i.e. encodings of RDF graphs, can be used to make 
representations of claims or assertions about the 'real' world.

When an RDF graph is asserted in the web, its publisher is saying something 
about their view of the world. Such an assertion should be understood to 
carry the same social import and responsibilities as an assertion in any 
other format. A combination of social (e.g. legal) and technical machinery 
(protocols, file formats, publication frameworks) provide the contexts that 
fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary of some piece of RDF, and which 
distinguish assertions from other uses (e.g. citations, denals or 
illustrations).
]]


The problem seems to be that 2.3.1 seems to suggest that the triples cannot 
be expressed without being asserted.  I really don't want to let the prose 
get bogged down here.  Does this work for you:
[[

each triple makes a distinct claim, and the meaning of any triple is not 
changed by adding other triples. Based on the semantics defined in the

expression with essentially the same meaning.
