They cannot hold based solely on the RDF MT, which has no
clue what those datatypes are and whether there is any
intersection between their value spaces and lexical to
value mappings.

It's straightforward for an application which groks the
datatypes to test the above entailments, yes, but they
are not RDF-entailments.

There will always be cases where typed literals are expressed
in terms of datatypes that some application does not understand,
in which case, that application is unnable to compare the
denoted value with any other in any meaningful way. Cest la vie.
