Ah, I think I now see the crux of discussion...

In Internet protocols, there's a convention that if no language code is 
specified, then one called (something like) i-default is assumed.  (I think 
it's covered in RFC 1766, but have power cut right now so can't check 
reference.)  So I'd assumed that if a literal *can* have a language code, 
but one is not explicitly specified, then some kind of default placeholder 
is lurking in the wings.

Of course, that may not be the case.

But the distinction I was drawing was between a literal which *can* have a 
language code and a string value which (maybe) cannot.
