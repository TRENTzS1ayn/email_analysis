Do they have to be.  It seems to me as though classic literals are behaving 
like 3 or 4 distrinct types:

  1 basic literal
  2 xml literal
  3 basic literal with lang
  4 xml literal with lang

I'm wondering whether 4 folds into 2 because of canonicalization; i.e. the 
lang really does become part of the literal string?

Could we rationalize by giving explicit types to the old style literals:

  1. a basic literal is of type xsd:string.
  2. an xml literal is of type rdf:xmlstring.
  3. a basic literal with a lang is of type rdf:langString
  4. ... if the answer to question above is no add rdf:xmlLangString

  <a> <b> "foo" .

is syntactic shorthand for

  <a> <b> xsd:string"foo" .
