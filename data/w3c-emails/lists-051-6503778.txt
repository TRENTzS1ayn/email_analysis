I guess I wasn't clear. Yes, the MT allows something to be
both a class and a property. I don't mind that.
But it doesn't *require* anything to be both a class and
a property.

So in SWAD, we generally consider it a mistake if you make
something both a class and a property. And we'd rather
not have that sort of heuristic flat out contradicted
by the specs, e.g. if the spec said that dt:date
was a class while we use it as a property.
