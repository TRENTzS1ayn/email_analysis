Subclass relations are not sufficient to determine equality
of values. The class extension of a datatype is its value
space. And if one datatype is a subclass of another, all that
means is that its value space is a subset of the superordinate
datatype's value space. Thus, an integer *value* is always
a decimal value, etc.

However, (and this is what seems to be missed here), there is
no requirement that a subordinate datatype's lexical space be
a subset of the superordinate datatype's lexical space or that
the lexical to value mapping of the subordinate datatype be
compatable with that of the superordinate datatype. How each
datatype serializes its values and the mappings from lexical
forms to values is entirely the domain of the datatype alone,
disjunct from any subclass relations with any other datatypes.

This is what allows us to, e.g. say that a Schema integer is
a subclass of XSD Integer and visa versa, as they have perfectly
intersecting value spaces, yet have incompatable lexical spaces.
It is a critical feature of the extensible nature of RDF datatyping
which allows us to relate datatypes by their value spaces
irrespective of their lexical representations, which is the key
to interoperability between disparate datatype frameworks.

So, just because xsd:integer is a subclass of xsd:decimal, and
the lexical form is the same for both typed literals, that does
not mean that both typed literals (absolutely) map to the same
value. They might (and in this case they do) but they might
not, and RDF does not know this, even with the above subClassOf
relations.

E.g., one could just as well have:

   foo:binaryInteger rdfs:subClassOf xsd:integer .
   Jenny age xsd:integer"10" .
   Bob age foo:binaryInteger"10" .

where in actuality, even though the lexical forms are identical
and foo:binaryInteger is a subclass of xsd:integer, Jenny's
and Bob's ages are in fact not the same.
