Hi 

I am finally doing the work on datatypes in the abstract data model.
I've hit two URI vs qname problems that I *think* somebody in the group knows 
the answer to ...

However, I did not find appropriate normative references in:
- Patrick's document
- the errata for XSD

1) how do I indicate that the URI
  &xsd;integer
is the concept referred to in the (normative ref to) XML Schema Datatypes as 
'integer' in the namespace xsd: [Please give documents that I can normatively 
reference].

2) when creating my own datatype (e.g. derived from an XML Schema Datatype) 
how do I assign a URI to it (rather than a <namespace, local name> pair)

Jeremy
