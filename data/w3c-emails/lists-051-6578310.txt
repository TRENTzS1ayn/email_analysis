One of the questions that came up when I talked to webont about datatypes 
was why we were using rdf:datatype and not xsi:type.  I couldn't remember 
the reason at the time, but I do think we need to have one.  Can someone 
remind me please.

One that now comes to mind is that xsi:type can take qname values and we 
need a URI for the datatype, and the standard namespace ref for xsd: does 
not produce the right uri.  Also there is the potential for confusion if we 
have one attribute that can take qname values and none of the others do.
