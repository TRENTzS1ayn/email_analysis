> one attribute that can take qname values and none of the others

From the parser writers point of view this would be a pain.
The hard work is in supporting the first, and then we can't give (this useful 
functionality) to the users other than in a very limited scope.

Thus qnames in RDF2 looks like a plausible mantra.

There is also a can of worms that we are currently ducking to do with 
invisibly used namespaces (in XML Literals). I find it harder to duck if we 
(like xsi, xslt xpointer ...) decide that invisibly used namespaces are cool.

(Note xsi:type="xsd:decimal" visibly uses xsi, and invisibly uses xsd).
