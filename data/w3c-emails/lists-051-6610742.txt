I'm not sure you're understanding my point here.

Firstly, one cannot presume that all datatypes define a canonical
representation for all values and thus that it is possible to obtain
such a canonical representation, so basing anything on canonical
representations is simply not feasible. Please stop referring to
canonical lexical forms. They don't exist in RDF datatyping.

Secondly, as my foo:binaryInteger example tried to show, one
cannot deduce equality between typed literals simply based on
(a) string equality of lexical forms (even if canonicalized) and
(b) subclass relations between the datatypes. This is because
even if the lexical forms are (canonicalized for each datatype
and) string-equal, they may in fact map to *different* values
in each datatype's value space and thus the two typed literals
do not in fact denote the same value.

The *only* time that RDF alone can deduce equality of typed
literals is when (a) the datatype URIs are identical and (b) the
lexical forms are identical, and that equality is reflected in
the fact that typed literal nodes with identical datatype URIs
and lexical forms as labels are merged into the same node.

If either the datatype or the lexical form is not identical, then
it is not possible for RDF to determine equality, regardless whether
the subclass relations are known or not.
