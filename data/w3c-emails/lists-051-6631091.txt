It is a matter of principle, mostly. RDF Datatyping is (and IMO should remain)
datatype framework neutral. It fully supports XML Schema datatypes, but also
supports any datatype framework which is compatable with the basic datatyping
model defined by RDF.

Having inlined literals default to typed literals of a specific XML Schema
datatype violates this neutrality, and I see no real need for it.
