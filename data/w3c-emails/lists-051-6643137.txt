Does XML schema datatypes, section 3.1 give you what you need?

http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#namespaces

(Possibly coupled with RDF's own concatenation rule for interpretation of 
QNames as URIs?)

Hmmm... that's not quite the full story, is it?  Where does the '#' come from?

I assumed we would invoke the RDF concatenation rule for making a URI from 
a QName.
