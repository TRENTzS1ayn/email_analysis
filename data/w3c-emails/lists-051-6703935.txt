One case in point, UAProf, where three of its four core datatypes
are not equivalent to any XML Schema datatype and it is also
unlikely that they will be defined in terms of XML Schema rather
than by some other means.

True, it is *possible* to define them with XML Schema, but
using xsi:type would, I expect, be frequently misunderstood 
as meaning they *should* be defined somewhere by XML Schema.

Also, what happens when one does XML Schema validation and
the XML Schema validator cannot locate the definitions for
xsi:type specified datatypes? Do we get errors?

I see this as a huge can of worms, the depth of which we do
not have time to probe.
