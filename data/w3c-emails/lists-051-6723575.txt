[[[
 Each built-in datatype in this specification (both ?primitive? and
?derived?) can be uniquely addressed via a URI Reference constructed as
follows:

   1. the base URI is the URI of the XML Schema namespace
   2. the fragment identifier is the name of the datatype

For example, to address the int datatype, the URI is:

    * http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int
]]]

The XML Schema specs don't specify that.

They're working on it; from their charter:

[[[
# the definition of a free-standing specification describing how to name
or refer to arbitrary components in an XML Schema; in existing
discussions these are sometimes referred to as normalized universal
names or NUNs
]]]

I'm supposed to give them a nudge:

Action DC: Write to Schema WG to say that TAG is interested in progress
on this issue.

Meanwhile, I understood that it's "no a problem" that we don't
have explicit support for user-defined datatypes:

I still think that this _is_ a problem; the archtypical
example of a datatype in WebOnt is "integers from 1 to 10".
