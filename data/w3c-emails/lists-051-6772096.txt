We discussed this.  It was felt that asking users to distinguish between 
two uri's for a datatype, one for the class and one for the property would 
be unnecessarily confusing.

The notion that classes and properties were not disjoint has been around 
for many months and has found general acceptance.  I'm not convinced that 
SWAD's lint application is sufficiently strong justification to reopen this.
