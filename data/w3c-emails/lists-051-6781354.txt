that's right Brian, it was an attempt which has to
be tested much better, but it also works for
e.g. _:x"+0010" btw (for the moment we just exlude
xsd:string in the "try numeral-to-number-to-canonical"
another shortcoming is that we have some value range
limitation for the xsd:long and xsd:unsignedLong
in our implementation in Java and C# but there
are possible solutions for that (i.e. be incomplete
there)

Puzzled frown.  Have I lost the plot here?  It looks to me as though Jos is

describing an implementation strategy for value based entailments.  As far
as I'm concerned, that is a relevant contribution.
