Er... it was also felt that confusing the value space with
the mapping is unnecessarily confusing; I'm not sure if that's
part of the discussion you're talking about, since you
don't give a citation, but it is a matter of record:

" The proposal treats datatypes as if they were the classes which
    conventionally have the same name (eg "integer"), but according to
    the XMLSchema spec, they are not."

Which notion, exactly? I see two:

(a) the RDF specs don't guarantee that
classes are disjoint from properties

(b) the RDF specs guarantee that
classes and properties intersect.

(a) has been around for a while; (b) has been with us only
since 6 Sep.

Even in situation (a), some folks can advocate
"keep your properties separate from your classes"
as a best practice (sorta like ala # vs /) while the spec
remains silent on the issue.

With the WG proposing (b), it forces those
of us who advocate keeping properties and
classes separate to object.

I don't think (b) has found general acceptance.
It hasn't found acceptance among the developers
I work with.

Well, perhaps it's not worth re-opening the issue at this
point; we're clearly not going to make everybody happy with
any datatypes design.
But I couldn't let your "everybody thinks this is just fine"
go unqualified.

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get this design thru
last call without objections from the folks I work with.
