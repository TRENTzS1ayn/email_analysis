I consider the XML Schema position to be far too extreme. Yes, some
writing systems may not be expressable as a plain Unicode string,
but many, of not most, are, and as you point out, there is no reason
why there could not exist a subtype of xsd:string which includes
a specialized lexical grammar to provide for such writing systems.
In fact, I would argue that an XML literal, in RDF at least, is
really a subtype of xsd:string, with a lexical grammer that reflects
lexical forms of XML infosets.

IMO, XML Schema got it wrong. 

There's no reason why RDF should repeat that error.

And this is one good reason why RDF datatyping should be framework
neutral, so that we are free to address such requirements as language
qualification of typed literals while still supporting other standards
such as XML Schema.
