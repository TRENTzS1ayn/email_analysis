Fair enough.

Have your colleagues considered how the lint program might be adapted to 
cope with some exceptions where classes and properties are not disjoint, 
e.g. don't issue the warning when its a datatype property?  Possible define 
a class of properties which are also classes and define datatype properties 
to be a subclass of that.
