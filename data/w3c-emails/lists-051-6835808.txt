For any datatype one could define a canonical form if one so chose.
So requiring RDF datatypes is a possibility. (Technically I have required
certain transfinite type systems to invoke the axiom of choice! but I
suspect all realistic type systems are safely countable).

The text in the minority version is intended to utilize a canonical form if
one is provided, and not if not.
