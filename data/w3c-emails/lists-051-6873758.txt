W3C specs should work together.

If XSD is wrong, we should tell them, and it is their responsibility to fix
it - not ours.

If we go off and do our own thing then we condemn the semantic web to
further fragmentation and Aaron's tag line will become "RDF - ten years of
failure"

We *must* be prepared to live with other working groups decisions, even
those we don't like. (Of course, our implementations may choose to diverge,
but as a W3C standards body we should not endorse such behaviour).
