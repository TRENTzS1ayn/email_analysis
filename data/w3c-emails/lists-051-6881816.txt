Agreed, where reasonable and practical.

Agreed, but we should also be able to 'do the right thing' in our spec
while they are fixing their spec.

I see no conflict whatsoever between XML Schema and RDF if RDF allows
additional language qualification of literals.

Exactly what kinds of problems do you see as potentially causing
fragmentation?

We are not saying that XML elements defined to have data content
conforming to anySimpleType must have language qualification. We
are saying that RDF literals may have language qualification,
and furthermore may be constrained by some datatype, which may
very well be a subtype of XML Schema anySimpleType.

I don't see how that is violating anything in XML Schema. RDF property
elements are not simple CDATA based elements. They have mixed content
and the interpretation of that content is defined by RDF, not any
XML Schema datatype.

Where is the problem?

RDF datatyping is not XML Schema datatyping. There is no reason why
we should enforce a restriction mandated by one particular datatyping
framework which (a) is not requuired by other datatyping schemes and
(b) is used by existing applications (mine) and (c) is simply wrong.

But rather than just the two of us debating this issue, I'd be happy
to hear what other folks think.
