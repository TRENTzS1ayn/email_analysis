Dan,

It is my recollection that the idea of datatype URIs being both classes and 
properties has been floating around for some time [*], and this is the 
first time I've been aware of dissent with it (not counting the message to 
rdf-logic as a record of dissent).

I think datatype as class and properties represent current WG thinking, so 
if there is a problem with this I think we should hear what that problem is.


[*] a recent reference is: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0125.html

and from the datatyping draft that was agreed would be the basis for work 
going forward:
[[
4. RDF Datatyping Model Theory

The RDF Model Theory explains the fundamental model-theoretic concepts like 
interpretation, universe, extension etc. used for interpreting the 
semantics of RDF graphs. This section assumes familiarity with these basic 
concepts.

Suppose I is an RDF interpretation of a graph E. Then I is datatyped (with 
respect to a set D of datatypes) if the following is true for any datatype 
URI Reference ddd (with I(ddd) in D):

(1) ICEXT(I(ddd)) = {x : <x,y> in IEXT(I(ddd))}

I.e. the class extension of the datatype class is the value space of the 
datatype.

(2) For any typed literal ddd"LLL",   I(ddd"LLL") = L2V(I(ddd))("LLL")

I.e. the typed literal node denotes the datatype value having the lexical 
representation "LLL" according to the lexical to value mapping defined for 
the datatype ddd
]]

Condition (1) is quite explicit about this.
The same appeared in some of Pat's earlier documents on this subject.
