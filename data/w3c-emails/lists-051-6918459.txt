evaluate effect on the proposed form on literals on the model theory document

ACTION: 2002-08-16#5 MikeD
Mike Dean to write-up daml:Restriction use case where external type information comes from other than rdfs:range

ACTION: 2002-09-27#2 Sergey
write up comments about changes to API implementation vs changes to applications incurred by change to RDF handling of literals. 

ACTION: 2002-10-04#3 ericm

9: LBase Document
Propose approve publication as a note.

10: Literal Abstract Syntax
Questions arising:

o Are datatypes restricted to XSD datatypes?

o Do typed literals have a language identifier?

o Does the abstract syntax require a datatype URI to refer to a
datatype and that the lexical form be from the lexical space of that
datatype

o should a parser barf if it sees a datatype for which it cannot
validate that strings are from that datatypes value space and for
which it cannot compute the lexical to value mapping

o is there a generic value entailment in the model theory:

  <a> <b> <dt1>"foo" .
entails
  <c> <d> <dt2>"bar" .

whenever dt1.value("foo") = dt2.value(bar)?

o The n-triples form:

  <a> <b> <dt1>"foo" .

requires further parser lookahead than say:

  <a> <b> "foo"<dt1> .

The latter is easier to parse.
