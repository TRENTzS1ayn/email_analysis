Hm... that argument suggests that integer and date
are subtypes of xsd:string too, with a lexical
grammar that reflects numerals and date-strings.

XML infosets are not strings any more than
integers are.

I disagree.

Moreover, XML Schema followed the advice[1] of the
I18N WG on this; I recommend we do likewise.

If we do otherwise, I'll be obliged to get the I18N
WG to confirm that we had a good reason for doing so.


[1] I can't seem to find records of their advice.
But I'm pretty sure it's there, and I will have
to check with the I18N WG, as well as the
XML Schema WG, if we do otherwise.
