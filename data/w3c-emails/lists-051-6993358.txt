On the semantics issues, which I don't honestly expect we will reach, can I
suggest we also add rdf:List semantics into the pile of things to discuss,
see:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0081.html

I would like us to reach consensus on list semantics before the next MT WD.

I also have a Webont action that I can't progress until RDFCore makes a
decision here.
