All,

I've placed a new version of the RDF concepts document in www-archive [1].

There's also a copy with stylesheets, etc, at [2].

This version contains Jeremy's edits dealing with literal datatyping in the 
abstract syntax.

There are still a number of document details to be sorted out, but we felt 
it was useful to get these substantive changes in front of the WG as 
quickly as possible.

PS:  is there any way to get a collection of files stored in the same 
directory in www-archive?  I tried uploading the stylesheet and embedded 
images, but they all ended up in separate directories, so cannot be browsed 
directly.
