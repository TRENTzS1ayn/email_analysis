Attached is some example code that should be of interest to
some of you. Includes most of the "interesting" XML Schema
datatypes, as well as the UAProf datatypes and a selection
of some used internally in Nokia.

Once it's complete (meaning once all the datatypes are
implemented, what is there now works fine), I'll be publishing 
it to RDF Interest.

Unpack, cd to the top directory (where relations.rdf is located)
and type "java Datatypes.Test" for starters. Browsing the
javadocs would be a reasonable next step.
