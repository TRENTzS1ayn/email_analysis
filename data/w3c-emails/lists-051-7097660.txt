Yes there is.  I don't believe use case was issue, that can be resolved 
with b-node constructions.  The issue is that Nokia already have code/data 
in this triple form and

   a) they dissented to having datatyped literals without lang identifiers

   b) WG members are sympathetic to Nokia's needs and are unwilling to rule 
their data illegal
