Are we making it clear somewhere that 'datatype' (unless 
otherwise specified) refers to an instance of rdfs:Datatype?

This would prevent any future treatment of XML Literals as typed
literals.

After all, both complex and simple types are addressed by XML Schema,
and it seems intuitive and reasonable to me to simply treat XML Literals
as lexical forms of infosets (as outlined in Part 2 of the restructured
specification, http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/rdf-datatyping.html).

Having 

   XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&rdf;ClassicXMLLiteral>

prevents us from (now or later) saying

   XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&xhtml;h1>

which seems very consistent with typed literals as defined for
simple datatypes at present, and gives us a consistent treatment
for literals, where the alternation between non-XML and XML is
disjunct from the alternation between non-typed and typed. I.e.

                    Non-XML     |               XML
           ---------------------|-----------------------------------
Non-Typed  |      "10"-en       |      XML"<h1>foo</h1>"-en
-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------
Typed      | "10"<&xsd;int>-en  |  XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&xhtml;h1>-en
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Eh?
