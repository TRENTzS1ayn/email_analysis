It just occurred to me that perhaps I misunderstood what you
are proposing. Are you suggesting in fact that


                    Non-XML     |               XML
           ---------------------|-----------------------------------
Non-Typed  |      "10"-en       |      XML"<h1>foo</h1>"-en
-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------
Typed      | "10"<&xsd;int>-en  |  XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&xhtml;h1>-en
--------------------------------------------------------------------

becomes rather

                    Non-XML     |               XML
           ---------------------|-----------------------------------
Non-Typed  | "10"<&rdf;ClassicLiteral>-en |  
           |                    | XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&rdf;ClassicXMLLiteral>-en
-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------
Typed      | "10"<&xsd;int>-en  |  XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&xhtml;h1>-en
--------------------------------------------------------------------


???

So that in fact, we'd never have non-typed literals in the abstract
syntax ever?

And would that provide for typed XML literals such as
XML"<h1>foo</h1>"<&xhtml;h1>-en?

If so, then I would support that. Though, I think that the "Classic"
could be omitted and just call them rdf:Literal and rdf:XMLLiteral.
