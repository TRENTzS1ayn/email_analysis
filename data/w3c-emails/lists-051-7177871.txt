We have to tread as carefully as possible since we want to be able to
justify keeping the rdf: namespace URI the same.  If it seems the rdf
namespace gets too many new semantic terms (Properties and Classes)
then the namespace looks increasingly like it would have to change.

At present, we've removed some syntax things - rdf:aboutEach*
and added some new syntax things - rdf:nodeID, rdf:datatype, so
we are on the line.

If we were changing the namespace(s), we'd surely split the rdf/xml
syntax terms / semantic terms completely.  But not in this round of
specs and not at this stage in document writing.

Just my thoughts.

Dave
