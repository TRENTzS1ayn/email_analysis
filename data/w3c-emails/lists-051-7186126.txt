I agree entirely. Goofing around with the 1999 namespace too much (for
some measure of excess) is impolite. I think we can get away with it a
little since the M+S spec didn't say much one way or the other about the
contents of its namespaces. Putting new classes and properties into RDFS's
namespace is cleaner, changing '99 only to reflect syntactic fixes to RDF/XML.
