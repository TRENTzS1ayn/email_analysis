Excerpts:

[
The GetLiteral function returns the given name in the format of a literal, which you can then use to assert into an RDF graph as a
resource.

myName = RDF.GetLiteral('Eric');
Variations on this function are GetIntLiteral and GetDateLiteral.

...

A literal's value can be read but not written. To change the value of a literal, make a new literal and set it properly:

aValue = literal.Value;

Note that aValue could be a string or an integer in this case.
]

I guess someone ought to let the Mozilla folks that their value-based
semantics conflicts with the RDF MT...

;-)
