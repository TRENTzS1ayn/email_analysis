Please can the record reflect the strawpoll held on this question:

are they [datatyped literals] allowed to have a lang string in the abs syntax"?

4 preferred they do an no one couldn't live with it.

5 preferred not with one can't live with.

The can't live took precedence.

One WG member later stated that they would "object" to this decision unless 
a datatyped literal denoted a pair consisting of a value and lang string.
