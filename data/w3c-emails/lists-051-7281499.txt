in that proposal it is a single node
(which is not my own preference as you know;
why else do we have RDF, interpretation props,
etc.; having now up to 4 pieces of information
in one node i.e. XML bit, lexical form, lang
string and datatype-uri, not to mention the
(un)allowable combinations is not very kiss)
