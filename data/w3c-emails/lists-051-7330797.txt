I'm beginning to think we may have crossed that line now with the latest 
round of decisions.

I don't have my thoughts together right now, but I think it was some of 
Mike Dean's concerns that made me think that maybe we should reconsider 
adopting a new namespace URI, so that the volumes of existing RDF data can 
be migrated rather than invalidated.
