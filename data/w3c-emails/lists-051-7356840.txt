Unless I hear arguments to the contrary (or even simply some opposition) I
will try writing some text along these lines tomorrow.

Possible problems I can identify (mainly for DaveB):

+ N-triples syntax - the following two triples are identifcal:

<a:a> <a:p> <rdf:ClassicLiteral>"foo" .
<a:a> <a:p> "foo" .

Since it is work to drop the latter, I would suggest that the former (to be
more precise with two reserved datatype URIs) is specifically prohibited
(somewhat ugly).

also get the surprising equivalence between RDF/XML docs

<rdf:Description>
  <rdf:value rdf:datatype="&rdf;Literal">foo</rdf:value>
</rdf:Description>

and

<rdf:Description>
  <rdf:value >foo</rdf:value>
</rdf:Description>

==

Another thing, which negatively impacts DaveB, is that it then becomes
clearer that some of the C14N stuff about XML Literals probably ends up in
the syntax doc. I could try and work out what.

===

Motivations are:
- uniform framework
- addresses TBL's desire that XML is not built-in at the lowest level to RDF
- provides argument why lang tags are part of literal
- gives an example of a non-XSD type system that Brian is prepared to
defend.
