These should be in rdfs: given in particular since rdfs:Literal already
exists - http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal

can we stop using <qname> please?

you mean

forbid:
 <uri1> <uri2> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#ClassicLiteral>"foo" .
allow (prefer):
 <uri1> <uri2> "foo" .

forbid:
 <uri1> <uri2> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#ClassicXMLLiteral>"blah" .
allow (prefer):
 <uri1> <uri2> XML"blah" .

which is ugly but I'd prefer to add these rules, if we are going down
this route.

&rdfs;Literal (already exists) or should that be &rdfs;ClassicLiteral ?

Please do.

Hmm.  You mean that rdf datatyping is sufficient for XSD and and
other [non-XSD] datatype systems.

I also support Frank's comments:

  [[I want to see non-XSD types supported, and I want it to be very
    clear in our specs that they are.]]
