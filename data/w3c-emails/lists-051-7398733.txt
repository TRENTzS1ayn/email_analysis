I'm sorry, I'm maybe being contradictory on this. This proposal means that 
either:

  1) A datatyped literal denotes a value, in which case RDF datatypes map a 
pair (lex, lang) to a value which is contrary to the xsd datatyping model

  2) A datatype literal denotes a pair (val, lang) and then we have 
(speaking loosely) French integers being different from English integers, i.e.

   <jenny>  <age> "10"-"fr"-<http://...#decimal> .
   <johnny> <age> "10"-"en"-<http://...#decimal> .

does not entail

   <jenny>  <age> _:l .
   <johnny> <age> _:l .

I really don't want to go anywhere near 2.

No one wants to declare the existing Nokia data illegal, but I currently 
see a choice between:

  o following the xsd datatyping model (except we play a little fast and 
loose on the legacy)
  o or blessing the current Nokia data

I suggest that if we choose the latter, we are in for heavy last call 
comments.  I doubt that the schema datatypes decision that lang was not a 
factor in the mapping was taken lightly.
