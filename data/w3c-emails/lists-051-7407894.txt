Hey guys.  I'm in the process of adding datatypes to the Primer, and
this (plus the message I'm responding to and the Ntriples thread) causes
me to ask for some guidance on:

a.  how to represent typed literals in Ntriples
b.  a new abbreviated form for Ntriples

To start with (b), we'd discussed abbreviating writing out full Ntriples
in examples, and I thought we'd decided that instead of writing out full
URIrefs in angle brackets, we'd write QNames without angle brackets, as
in

ex:index.html dc:creator exstaff:85740 .
ex:index.html exterms:creation-date "August 16, 1999" .

Edging a bit into (a), the obvious extension to this abbreviated form to
handle typed literals would be something like the literal immediately
preceded (or followed?) by the QName for the datatype, as in:

exstaff:85740 exterms:age xsd:integer"27"

However, various threads seem to be discussing these issues, with
various suggestions, but it's not clear there's any consensus.  So:

1.  have we decided on the syntax for typed literals in Ntriples?  If
so, what is it?
2.  given the decided syntax for typed literals in Ntriples, do you have
any suggestions for an abbreviated
    syntax (analogous the one described above) that uses Qnames?
