I wondered if I should have spelt that out more.  Ok, consider:

   <rdf:Description rdf:about="jenny" xml:lang="en">
     <foo:description>Jenny is a pretty girl</foo:description>
     <foo:age rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer>10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>

   <rdf:Descriptin rdf:about="pierre" xml:lang="fr">
     <foo:description>Pierre est un jolie garcon</foo:description>
     <foo:age rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer>10</foo:age>
   </rdf:Description>

Jenny and Pierre don't have the same age.  I'm not sure I want to try and 
justify to the xml schema datatype folks we have adopted their datatyping 
mechanism.

I agree that doesn't look good either, which would suggest we drop the lang 
tag from the abstract syntax, but that invalidates the Nokia data, which is 
undesirable.

I'm suggesting the WG consider which is the least damaging option we 
have.  Patrick: comment?
