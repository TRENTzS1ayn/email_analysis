oops... forgot to say that we think that even if it
would be described with extra triples e.g.
  <#Jenny> <#age> [ xsd:integer "10" ] .
or
  _:x <#name> [ dt:string "chat"; xml:lang "fr" ] .
an application is actually not forced to store the
triples in between the [ and ] in case there is
a (set of) unambiguous properties in there
but instead could use them to construct a single
*function* term or just store them as a [ whole ] term
so why not use above as syntax for typed literals???
(we have been using this trick over the past year
or so, but actually we store both...)

in that proposal it is a single node
(which is not my own preference as you know;
why else do we have RDF, interpretation props,
etc.; having now up to 4 pieces of information
in one node i.e. XML bit, lexical form, lang
string and datatype-uri, not to mention the
(un)allowable combinations is not very kiss)
