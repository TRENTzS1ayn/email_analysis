that's indeed a nice review
I have read the document by now (and also Graham's review)
and I would say "thumbs up"


in 2.1 I'm not conviced that names should be anything
else but urirefs

also in there, why not take decimals as in xsd:decimal?

and is a Relation with an extension which is the
empty set forbidden?

function terms are indeed interesting


in 2.3 can one say that f(y,x1,...,xn) means f(x1,...,xn) =y

again, "the name Relation to denote the property of having
a relational extension"  could that be the empty set?

if E is:                | then I(E) is:
-----------------------------------------------
...                     |
a special name          | ISN(E)
                          ^

that the language is compact is indeed interesting
