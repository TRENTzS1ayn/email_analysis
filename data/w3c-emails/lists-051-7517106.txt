Graham,

 Hope these responses help.

Yes. This is because FOL is only semi-decidable.

This follows from Godel's theorem ... not sure what your book means when 
it says that number theory is first order.

Good point. Let me talk to Pat about this.

Good point. We should clarify. We mean the former (i.e., identifier).

Yes, it can be. So, as Quine pointed out, we don't need individuals.

But variables *are* different ...

Good point.

I defer to Dan and Brian on this.
