Yes, (2) looks like a minor disaster to me.

Suppose I have a URI that denotes the integer 42, nothing more.  Let's call 
it urn:number:42.

If I say:

   <jenny>  <age> "42"-"fr"-<http://...#decimal> .
   <johnny> <age> urn:number:42

does that entail the following, given knowledge that urn:number:42 denotes 
the same number that is represented in the identified ...#decimal datatype 
mapping of "42":

   <jenny>  <age> _:l .
   <johnny> <age> _:l .

I think the answer should be yes.  Then what about:

   <jenny>  <age> "42"-"en"-<http://...#decimal> .
   <johnny> <age> urn:number:42

I think the answer should still be yes.  Then, I think your original 
entailment (above) must also be allowed.  Taking language ids on numbers 
into the domain of interpretation seems all wrong to me.
