Patrick,

Thanks for the response.  I think I understand your point of view better now.

That seems to suggest that you will have to change this data anyway to be 
conformant.  Would it be feasible to change it use a b-node while you are 
at it?

   some:Resource mars:shortLabel _:v .
   _:v  rdf:value mars:Token"Foo" .
   _:v  mars:lang "en" .

or some such construct?

Right, I can see that.

 From a Nokia point of view I can see that changing the code is 
undesirable.  But from a more global  point of view, is it something that 
perhaps Nokia should be willing to do in order to preserve conformance with 
the xml schema datatypes model.  I would have thought that was something 
Nokia would also like to preserve.

Oh Yuk. Right.  Not a good way to go.

Right, that is what is worrying me.

Transforming legacy is always a pain.  To some extent its unavoidable given 
a 'clarification' of the spec.


To be quite frank, RDF over XML has not been an easy sell,

No. I can appreciate that.

Exactly.  But we can try to ameliorate the effects.  I wonder if there is 
scope for a note discussing how to migrate legacy data.

That would be a shame.
