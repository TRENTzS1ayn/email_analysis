In fact, the answer I got about rdf:datatype specifics suggested
to me that we're not using datatype URIs as names at all;
the design doesn't seem to have anything to do with what those
URIs denote.

"unless otherwise specified"??? that's non-monotonic.

Gads, I hope not! Up to now, RDFS closures have not
involved deconstructing literals. I hope we
don't start now!
