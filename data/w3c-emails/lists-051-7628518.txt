Frank,

OK, I think I've now got something closer to what you're suggesting.  My 
proposed section 2.3.2 now looks like this (specifically, the first 3 
paragraphs).

[[
2.3.2 Social meaning

RDF/XML documents, i.e. encodings of RDF graphs, can be used to make
representations of claims or assertions about the 'real' world.  But
not every RDF/XML document does so.

While the formal semantics of an RDF statement (triple) is that of a
distinct assertion, individual RDF statements may convey meaning that
is partly determined by the circumstances in which they are used.  For
example, in English, a statement "I don't believe that George is a
clown" contains the words "George is a clown", which, considered in
isolation, have the form of an assertion that George exhibits certain
comic qualities.  However, considering the whole sentence, no such
assertion is considered to be made.

Similarly, a collection of RDF statements having an assertional form
could be presented in a context that they are not understood to be
stating a truth.  Thus, there is a distinction between RDF expressions
that are asserted, and those that are not.

When an RDF graph is asserted in the web, its publisher is saying
something about their view of the world. Such an assertion should be
understood to carry the same social import and responsibilities as an
assertion in any other format. A combination of social (e.g. legal) and
technical machinery (protocols, file formats, publication frameworks)
provide the contexts that fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary
of some piece of RDF, and which distinguish assertions from other uses
(e.g. citations, denals or illustrations).

The technical machinery includes protocols for transferring information
(e.g. HTTP, SMTP) and file formats for encapsulating and labelling
information (e.g. MIME, XML). A media type, application/rdf+xml [RDF-
MIME-TYPE] is being registered for indicating the use of RDF/XML as
distinct from some other XML that happens to look like RDF. Issuing an
HTTP GET request and obtaining data with a "200 OK" response code is a
technical indication that the received data was published at the
request URI; but data received with a "404 Not found" response cannot
be considered to be similarly published information.

The social machinery includes the form of publication: publishing some
unqualified statements on one's World Wide Web home page would
generally be taken as an assertion of those statements. But publishing
the same statements with a qualification, such as "here are some common
myths", or as part of a rebuttal, would likely not be construed as an
assertion of the truth of those statements. Similar considerations
apply to the publication of assertions expressed in RDF.

Noting that there is no single human opinion about the truth of some
statements, the graph may further contain commentary for human
interpreters to indicate the realm of human interpretation that should
be applied. This means a graph may contain "defining information" that
is opaque to logical reasoners. This information may be used by human
interpreters of RDF information, or programmers writing software to
perform specialized forms of deduction in the Semantic Web.

When a user invokes an application that uses RDF, there is also a
social and technical context of invocation that determines some set of
RDF assertions that will be assumed to be true: the application itself,
and any RDF files that are passed to it. Garbage-in, garbage-out
applies: if the initial assumed facts are wrong or meaningless, the
results will have little value. No specific mechanisms for deciding or
evaluating the validity of any such assertions are defined here.
