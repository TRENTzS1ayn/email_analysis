Thinking about it, what we were saying was that at the RDF level we were 
treating the datatype-literal thing as a pair (or triple); its's only 
entailment that knows that <ddd> is a datatype that makes anything more of a 
<ddd>lll; this would weaken the entailment to be:

*empty*

 {ddd a datatype}-entails

<ddd> rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .

that looks a bit better to me.
