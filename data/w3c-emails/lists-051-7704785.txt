Eh? In what way. All the usage I've seen for a good long time
certainly uses those URIs as the names of the datatypes, denoting
the datatypes.

Can you elaborate, please.

No. I meant as specified in the documentation, not in the RDF.  That
when one encounters the English word "datatype" in the specs, it is
clear whether it means rdfs:Datatype, XML Schema datatype, or some
other kind of datatype.

Well, the structure of typed literals is visible to the MT, so
I don't see how this is a problem.
