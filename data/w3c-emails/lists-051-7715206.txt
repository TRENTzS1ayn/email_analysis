Yes and no. This only works IFF the subclass of xsd:decimal
has both a lexical space that is a proper subset of xsd:decimal
and a L2V mapping that is compatable to that of xsd:decimal.

If you had a subclass (e.g. Scheme language integers or binary
encoded integers) where the lexical space or L2V mapping diverges
from xsd:decimal, then you would not be able to reliably represent
values in terms of that subtype using the simple notatation.

See http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/datatypes.zip for code that bears
this out.

Thus, in actuality, the 'LLL' notation would *only* map to 
xsd:decimal"LLL" and to no other datatype whatsoever.

So yes, 'LLL' would entail any possible xsd:decimal variant
lexical representation synonymous with "LLL" but subclasses don't
actually enter into the picture.

And as an aside, if you're talking about an extension to N3, as
a form of syntactic sugar, fine, but RDF has no built in datatypes
(other than perhaps rdfs:StringLiteral and rdfs:XMLLiteral) so
the default mapping of 'LLL' to xsd:decimal"LLL" would not be
defined for RDF/XML or N-Triples.
