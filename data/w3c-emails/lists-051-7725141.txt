Or rather, the act of putting a class URI <ddd> into a typed literal
embodies the implicit assertion that <ddd> rdf:type rdfs:Datatype,
because that is what typed literals contain, a *datatype* URI.

If that URI doesn't denote a datatype, then that is a semantic error
just as much as if the lexical form specified is not a member of the
lexical space of a datatype.

The term 'typed literal' really perhaps ought to be 'datatyped literal'
which it was originally but got shortened for convenience.

The original closure rule suggested by Jeremy is correct. Putting
a URI into a typed literal label asserts that it denotes a datatype
and applications should be allowed to assume that it does. Period.
