Jos, a nit:

You're mixing representations here that are usually used for integers and 
floats respectively.

I have seen a compelling case argued (I think it was part of the XSD 
debate) that for the purposes of computation these should be regarded as 
distinct value spaces, as computer-floats behave in several ways subtly 
differently than integers and reals.

Ahh... Google is sooo good! See [1].
