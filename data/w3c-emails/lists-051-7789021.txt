I know (is important for imaging)
my take now is always take IEEE 754 double and stay within
te preserved interval of xsd:long and xsd:unsignedLong

Jos, a nit:

You're mixing representations here that are usually used for integers and
floats respectively.

I have seen a compelling case argued (I think it was part of the XSD
debate) that for the purposes of computation these should be regarded as
distinct value spaces, as computer-floats behave in several ways subtly
differently than integers and reals.

Ahh... Google is sooo good! See [1].
