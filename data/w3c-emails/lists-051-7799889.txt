Fair enough, but as RDF is supposed to support arbitrary
datatypes I would expect that machinery proposed for processing
RDF would by default respect that fact, and as such, my comments
are valid.

If folks wish to have proprietary machinery that only works with 
XML Schema datatypes, that's fine, but let's be very clear then when
proposals are constrained in such a fashion, otherwise we spend
too much time re-re-re-clarifying issues such as the above.

This was why I requested some clarification in the specs when
'datatype' is used, since it is clear that some folks mean
rdfs:Datatype and others mean XML Schema datatype and depending
on which is meant, it can greatly affect the significance of
what folks are saying.

Cheers,

Patrick
