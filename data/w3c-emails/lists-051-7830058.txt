I hope that most RDF implementations will strive to support XSD.

Assuming the model theory proposed by Graham at last Friday's telecon,

in these cases Jos's entailment holds:


> >>   :Jenny :age '10' .
> >> simple-entails (with XSD)
> >>   :Jenny :age '+1E1' .

but, for Patrick's preferred? non-standard datatyping

> >>   :Jenny :age '10' .
> >> does not simple-entail (no XSD)
> >>   :Jenny :age '+1E1' .

I think we have done our bit for XSD by making it the preferred RDF datatyping 
mechanism - IMO it doesn't need to be built-in as such.
