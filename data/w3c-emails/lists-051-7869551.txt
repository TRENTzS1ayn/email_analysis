I agree this is minimal change.

The problem that I have come against with this is simply the complexity of
wording.
Doing case normalization during parsing is easy to state, easy to explain,
and very nearly equivalent.

Doing case normalization by regarding case variations as syntactically
identically is basically a smart alec trick that someone like me must have
dreamt up, but may present unnecessary obstacles to non-mathematicians. It
also makes writing text for, for example, datatype mappings more complex.
