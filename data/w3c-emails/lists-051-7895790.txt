Peter has sent this message to webont, which suggests the need to show some
relationship between lBase and one of the SWELs.

[[[
Also, is there a mapping from any semantic web language (RDF, RDFS, OWL
Lite, abstract OWL, Fast OWL, Large OWL) into LBase?  I would think that
it would be a good idea to have at least one such mapping before LBase gets
to be a W3C note.
