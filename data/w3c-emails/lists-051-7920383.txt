Or arguments from the RDF Interest Group (c/o www-rdf-logic)... They
relate to all RDF-based Web language and protocol work.

I see no reason why it can't be revised. In fact I would hope to see it
revised, at least minimally, in the new year.

I tried to word the 'status' section quite carefully, to explain why it is
reasonable for such a document to be published via RDF Core. It may be
that the tone of the rest of the document is less cautious than the SOTD

it.
