This is not quite related to namespaces (really!).

I wanted to get the URIs to address the XSD terms (the quote above).
RDF/XML constructs them in a different way (long story of course) but
the resulting URIs are what XSD defines.  

I don't think
[[defined in the namespace whose URI is:
    * http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes
]]
means anything.  The TAG is still discussing what's at the end of
namespace even now.
