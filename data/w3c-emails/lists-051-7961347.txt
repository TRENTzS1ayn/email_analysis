I don't know; I'd ask the N3 developers.

Sufficient but too terse.

We've implemented, used this and it is nice to have delimiters for
parsing, a bit of readability and in this case, to align a bit more
with what might change in N3.

Thanks for these datatype examples.  The Boolean one seems useful.

Are there any language-based ones; I guess my colo(u)r one was the
kind of thing that was beingexpected?
