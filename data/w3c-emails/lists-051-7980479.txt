I've been thinking a bit about a schedule to completion.  We are aiming to 
be done by March.

Basic Plan:

   Get a new set of WD's out with all technical content by 8/Nov
   Get last call docs out 13/Dec
   Last call closes 24/Jan

25/Oct  Concepts Doc ready for Review
         Syntax Doc ready for Review

01/Nov  Agree to publish concepts doc and and syntax doc
         Primer ready for review
         Schema ready for review
         Model theory ready for review
         Test cases ready for review

08/Nov  Agree to publish Primer, Schema, MT and Test cases
         concepts doc and syntax doc published

15/Nov  at the latest - Primer, Schema, MT and Test cases published

**Note there is a publishing moratorium from 18/Nov to 29/Nov so we can't 
afford to miss this.

06/Dec  Last call docs ready for WG review

13/Dec  Decision to publish last call docs

**Note:  Need to check if this will run into another Moratorium

17/Jan  Last call period ends

More detail is needed on getting through candidate rec.  However, we have 
to start working on now on defining and meeting cr criteria to keep, not 
wait till last call.
