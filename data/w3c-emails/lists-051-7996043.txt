This is misnamed. There are currently bugs in subClassOf and 
subPropertyOf, and I will fix those bugs in the next draft of the MT. 
The question about domain and range is a genuine question, not a bug: 
we can go either way, and there are arguments in both directions, so 
we have to make a genuine decision. And since, by the way, I seem to 
be in a lone minority on this argument, I am willing to just go with 
the flow and accept the Jeremy entailment (superclasses of ranges are 
also ranges). If that will rapidly reach consensus, please let us 
rapidly reach consensus.

>  o semantics of lists

Let me ask that we place lists high on the agenda as we need to get 
this sorted out in order to get the MT done, and Webont needs it, and 
there are apparently some strongly held opinions about it.
