Fair point. The next version of the RDF MT document will have such a 
mapping and will be re-christened 'RDF semantics'. I put up a slide 
of such a mapping for (most of) OWL at the Bristol F2F., you can see 
it at http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/OWL2LBASE.html

We could include all or some of this in the Lbase document if people 
feel it is useful.

I also now feel that the document should refer more thoroughly to 
earlier work in 'axiomatic semantics', just on grounds of 
scholarliness and due form. I will put a few sentences in the doc if 
nobody objects.
