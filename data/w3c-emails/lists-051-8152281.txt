I seem to have missed this. Does the above mean that if I have 

   xsd:byte rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .
   age rdfs:range xsd:byte .
   Jenny age "1000"^^xsd:decimal .

that there is no conflict between the range assertion and
the value specified for Jenny's age? That the above range
assertion entails

   age rdfs:range xds:decimal .

???

If so, then I would consider RDFS to be hopelessly broken
and unusable.

Could someone please clarify?

Thanks,

Patrick
