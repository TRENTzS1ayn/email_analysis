You are only in a minority of one in webont on a different but related
issue.
My take is that there are currently no strong advocates of the "Jeremy
entailment" (I am not one). However, this issue does interrelate with webont
issues - I suggest we:
- decide whether we prefer the Jeremy entailment or not by a straw poll
- indicate that preference to webont
- ask webont to accept this or ask us to change quickly.
(I will create the relevant web issue later today).

As the person with the strongly held opinions I guess I should articulate a
way forward that I could support:
[[


RDF Core provide only syntax
Webont use range constraints etc to convert rdf:List into owl:List

owl:List subClassOf rdf:List
owl:unionOf rdfs:range owl:List
owl:List owl:unionOf << _:nil _:properList >> .
_:nil owl:oneOf << rdf:nil >>
_:properList is restriction on rdf:List to things
with exactly one rdf:first and exactly one rdf:rest.


There is still a need for a magic wand to be cast by Pat or Peter to address
the problem that we really want finite non-circular lists, a constraint that
is not first-order. That wand is cast in WebOnt.
