This proposal extends the XSD datatyping model to allow the lang string to 
take part in the mapping to the value.  Our charter states:

[[Specifically, the RDF Core Working Group is not chartered to develop a 
separate data typing language that duplicates facilities provided by XML 
Schema data types.]]

Whilst what is proposed is not separate, it is different.  Bearing in mind 
that this is not exactly a tranquil area, I suggest the WG should prefer an 
acceptable alternative which does not extend the xsd datatyping model.

We were influenced largely by the desire not to rule Nokia's data 
illegal.  Despite that, the majority were in favour of not having the lang 
code on the literal, but Nokia's willingness to dissent carried the 
day.  Since then we have learned that Nokia's data is illegal anyway and 
Patrick has said:

   [[So I guess the WG can omit lang tags from literals entirely.
It's looking like it won't matter to us one way or another.]]

Which I take to be a withdrawing of that dissent.

Yes - its neater.

That's hardly a reason for doing it.  And I think you are perfectly aware 
that there are folks who are not comfortable with this.

Yea, legacy is like that.  As I recall, it was the W3C team rep who 
strongly advocated XML literals being different.

Can we run it past Misha asap and get a quick view.
