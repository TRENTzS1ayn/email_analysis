I don't support it either, but it could make sense
to have IFF (if and only if) semantics such that
Range(P,C) iff (forall x,y P(x,y) -> C(x))
and in that case rdfs:Resource would for instance
be the range of any property

well, it all depends on the chosen semantics for range
and I support the oneway IF as well
