I think you are missing the point.

N3, and hence cwm, does not support the ^^ notation. It's not a matter
of making N-Triples compatable with the present definition of N3, but
with some undefined future definition of N3. And if the N3 interpretation
of ^^ is anything like ^ then that will mean that N3 will be producing
a different graph from RDF/XML which I find unacceptable.

I have no problems showing deference to N3. I simply smell an anticipated
extension to N3 that will cause problems.

DanC, please correct me if I am wrong here, but is not the ^^ notation
a mechanism that is expected to allow cwm to treat typed literals as
bnodes with properties?
