When I wrote that, my understanding was that either the data has to change 
or you have to fix it up in the processing stream somewhere, right?  And if 
you have to do that, you could switch to a bnode idiom for representing the 
language at the same time.

I had understood the reason for the dissent was so that Nokia did not have 
to change existing data.  I now no longer understand the justification, 
since, as I said above, my understanding is that the data has to be change 
or be 'fixed up' in the processing stream anyway because of other decisions 
we have made.

Please could you explain the dissent, noting that dissent is a weighty 
tool, not to be used lightly.
