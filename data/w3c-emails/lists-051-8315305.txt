And as I pointed out, if we have to start using our own idioms that
are not supported elsewhere for something that has been a feature
of M&S then RDF loses a great deal of benefit with regards to
portability of our content between arbitrary systems and tools.

That was not a correct understanding.

It was that we rely on the attribution of literals for both datatype
and language tag and removing the language tag from typed literals
forces us to find some other *non-standardized* means of providing
for language qualification.

We do not use it lightly. We are not interested is causing others grief.
It is as much an issue of how we presently use RDF as how we feel RDF
should be used.

We are in the process of preparing a statement regarding our dissent
to the decision for string-based over value-based semantics. I would
prefer for us to not have to include this issue in that or another statement
if that can be avoided.
