I would think that it is all there
e.g. some N-triples
  :a :c "10"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int> .
  :a :c "bleu"@fr^^<http://example.org/mycolourspace> .
  :a :c "blue"@en-US^^<http://example.org/mycolourspace> .
or some N3 triples
  :a :c "10"^^xsd:int .
  :a :c "bleu"@fr^^eg:mycolourspace .
and all above statement objects denote values.

As far as I can see it could also fit nicely with
your prima http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/datatypes.zip
