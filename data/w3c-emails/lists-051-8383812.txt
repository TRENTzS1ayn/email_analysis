Ah, its becoming clearer.  Nodia is not dissenting on the ground their 
code/data would have to change. Nokia is dissenting if the WG fail to 
standardize a mechanism for expressing ... I'm struggling to find words to 
describe what you are trying to express.

Maybe Nokia could submit a note on the b-node idiom for representing 
whatever this is.  There is a good chance it would gain wide 
acceptance.  There are many things we are not standardizing.  I'm not sure 
what's special about this one.

And as for it being in M&S, this seems to be bound up with datatypes.  M&S 
didn't say anything about datatypes, and I don't see how we are taking 
anything away from M&S (noting that rdfs:range was in schema) that affects 
this issue.
