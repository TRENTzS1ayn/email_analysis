:)

Brian thinks that Patrick and Brian agree on a lot more than they disagree 
on.  They just spend more time and energy on the disagreement.

On the other hand I am not sure Brian and Patrick have agreed till Patrick 
has expressed a view about the test case.

The co-chair is not sure that is entirely fair.  The current proposal is 
not the only way to respond to that feedback.  On the other hand, the 
co-chair is concerned about eliminating potential negative feedback where 
that is possible and sensible.  We are time constrained, so we don't want 
to waste time on issues that we can reasonably avoid.

The co-chair hopes to resolve this today.
