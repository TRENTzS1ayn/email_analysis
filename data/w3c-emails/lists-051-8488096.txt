Perhaps not, but in that sense the lBase doc has then also excluded XML
Schema from being a semantic web language, since (unless you buy some of
pfps's contortions in Yin/Yang), it cannot be expressed as a logical
language in the way that lBase requires.

I think being less ambitious and more specific in scope is desirable.
