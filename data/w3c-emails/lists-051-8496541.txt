Comment on this new draft (sorry if I'm reopening something here):

In section 2.4.2 the draft says:  "The label on a node indicates what 
that node is meant to represent...Some URIrefs may indicate web 
resources, and a node thus labelled denotes that resource.  Other 
URIrefs represent abstract ideas or values rather than a retrievable Web 
resource...".

It seems to me that we can't decide in our concepts document what 
URIrefs denote (especially since RDF doesn't know whether a URIref is 
that of a retrievable Web resource or not).  If I write triples

<http://www.mitre.org> ex:corporateName "The MITRE Corporation"

with the intent that <http://www.mitre.org> denotes The MITRE 
Corporation, it may be a poor choice of URIref for The MITRE 
Corporation, but that's still what it denotes, right?  On the other 
hand, if what Section 2.4.2 says is correct, it seems to me that the 
Model Theory ought (if it doesn't already) state that what the URIrefs 
of retrievable Web resources denote is predefined.
