Hi Jeremy

While I appreciate that you were trying to make my life easier, I 
don't think this does, since this particular datatype is so different 
from all the others that it will need to be given a special semantic 
treatment in any case: and I think it would be less confusing if we 
simply said that undatatyped literals were indeed un-datatyped and 
they always denote themselves. This way we get the same entailments 
and avoid all the debates about whether a datatype should map from a 
string or a pair, etc etc. . And this also neatly handles the lang 
tag issue, since if the syntax says that the lang tag is part of the 
literal, then indeed it is there in the denotation; and if it says it 
isn't, then it isn't. The semantics in this case just tracks the 
syntax.

The rdfs:XMLLiteral is a masterpiece, on the other hand, and I would 
like to keep that around.

Pat
