I also remember it this way 
  (thinking it was one more set of things with little or no semantic
  value - to join rdf:value, rdf:Seq, rdf:Bag, rdf:Alt, but I digress)

and I support this.

I want to concentrate on a small part of what you mentioned in
passing, just to make sure you see what RDF/XML is providing.

So, assume there is an owl:List class:
  owl:List rdfs:subClassOf rdf:List.
which OWL uses for some purpose, not important here.  That's fine.

However, the convienence RDF/XML syntax we have for these collections
(which, as we are discussing, may have no particular semantics in RDF)
is as follows:

  <ex:prop1 rdf:parseType="Collection">
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="uri1"/>
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="uri2"/>
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="uri3"/>
  </ex:prop1>

which gives a big pile of triples:

  _:node ex:prop1 _:genid1 .
  _:id1 rdf:type rdf:List .
  _:id1 rdf:first <uri1> .
  _:id2 rdf:type rdf:List .
  _:id2 rdf:first <uri2> .
  _:id1 rdf:rest _:id2 .
  _:id3 rdf:type rdf:List .
  _:id3 rdf:first <uri3> .
  _:id2 rdf:rest _:id3 .
  _:id3 rdf:rest rdf:nil .

but the triples for the nodes in the middle of it are of rdf:type rdf:List.

There is no way for those to be made into owl:List using this form of
abbreviation, hence no way for OWL to have a convienent notation for
what might be called OWL lists.
