I had a look at

  2.4.3 Literals
  2.4.4 Datatypes
  4.2 RDF Literals

http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it/jeremy/RDF-concepts/2002-10-26/rdf-concepts.html

and it looks good to me as well, but I'm still concerned that

  "chat"@en^^my:dt
  "chat"@fr^^my:dt

denote the same value

??? why not have that

  "chat"@fr

*is* the lexical form
and of course for

  "10"@de^^xsd:int

the mapping fails because the lexical form is not in the
lexical space of the datatype associated with the datatype URI

Looks good to me.
