Three of our specs begin their abstracts with a statement of what RDF 
is.  They all differ!

Primer:  [[The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for 
representing information about resources in the World Wide Web.]]

Concepts: [[The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a data format for 
representing metadata about Web resources and other information.]]

Schema: [[The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general purpose 
language for representing information in the Web.]]

Whilst its kinda trivial, I suggest that it would be good if we all agreed 
on a one sentence description of what RDF is.  How about:

[[The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for representing 
information in the Web.]]
