I still like my formulation:

a.  the "about resources" leads people to think about what "resources"
are (discussed, for starters, in the following sentences of the
Primer);  and what's objectionable about saying the *Resource
Description* Framework is for representing information *about
resources*?  

b.  I'm not sure leaving "about resources" out doesn't change the
meaning slightly.  Anyway, if we say "for representing information in
the Web", what about those people who use RDF for representing
information elsewhere (e.g., in files)?

c.  For a first sentence, what's wrong with saying the *World Wide*
Web?  Is our parent organization going to change its name to "The Web
Consortium"?  We can refer to it as "the Web" in all subsequent
material.

However, I vote "concur".
