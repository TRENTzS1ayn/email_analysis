That's a healthy ambiguity in my opinion; at least through the end of
the first sentence!  Resolving this ambiguity (which is sort of built
into what we're doing in some respects) in one sentence is a laudable
goal, but I really did try to clarify this in the next few sentences. 
Oh well, I suppose it's fair if *all* the editors have to change
something!  

Let me suggest something else:  if we're going to standardize things
across documents, how about we standardize the way we do references: 
e.g., 

*  for the Model Theory, Dave and I have [RDF-MODEL] and Concepts has
[RDF-SEMANTICS],  
*  for RDF/XML, I have [RDF-XML] and Concepts has [RDF-SYNTAX], 
*  for Schema, I have [RDF-SCHEMA] and Dave and Concepts have
[RDF-VOCABULARY], 
*  Dave and I have [RDF-MS] as a normative reference and Concepts has it
as an informational reference, 
*  etc. etc.
