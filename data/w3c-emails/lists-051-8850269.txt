The key imho is that the information is being exchanged using Web
technology. The information itself is about all sorts of things (people,
places, ideas, products, artifacts) which may or may not be 'on' the Web
according to your intuitions about that extended metaphor. But their
descriptions can reasonably (imho) be said to be exchanged 'in' the Web...
