You guys!  "for marking up content on the Web" sounds like you'll be
creating lots of RDF inside tags that you use to delimit ordinary
content, or that you stick on Web pages as annotations interspersed with
the regular content.  Technically, neither the information, nor the
things referred to, need to be on or in the Web (depending, of course,
how you define "on the Web" or "in the Web").  How about a
meta-definition:  "The RDF Core Working Group is a group of people that
tries, mostly unsuccessfully, to describe complicated ideas in single
sentences."  [sort of like trying to describe complicated relationships
using triples without asserting too much!]
