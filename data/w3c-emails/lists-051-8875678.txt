Suggestions for things for consistency across the docs that the
Series Editor - Brian -  might want to consider:

1) The phrasing, order and titles of the documents at the start of
   all the RDF specs, usually in the Introduction section (as Frank raised).

   For example:
     http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Introduction 
   which I seem to have in a random order; I can't recall how I
   picked that one.   Or in the latest primer draft:
     http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20021027.html#intro

   We really need the new model theory doc title if it is changing

   Pat: Is it something like RDF Formal Semantics: Model Theory ?

   Maybe also consider if this list should be in all documents?


2) The [RDF-SEMANTICS] reference labels to use

   In particular I'm trying to use the new title
   "RDF Vocabulary ..." [RDF-VOCABULARY] etc. rather than emphasis
   the schema word.


3) The acknowledgements section with respect to current/former WG members.

   I offer my shorter version of the concepts doc section (last two
   paragraphs):

   http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Acknowledgments

More trivially:

4) Example code block styles
 
   I think primer and syntax are mostly in alignment here since they
   we use the same style.  I tend to give each one a label, link to
   it and have files that can be clicked / downloaded / validated
   particularly for complete examples.


5) Figure colo(u)r schemes

   If we cared, so that the nodes and arcs were similar.  However
   Pat's pictures are so pretty, I don't want him to change them ;)

   I had a comment that the black-on-red nodes I used was bad
   contrast and a bit difficult to read, especially when printed.
   Maybe the black-on-green nodes also has this problem?

Cheers

Dave
