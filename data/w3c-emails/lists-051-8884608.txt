I hate to nitpick, but this isn't really true. RDF isn't a language, 
it's a framework. Part of that is RDF/XML, which is a format. But even 
RDF/XML doesn't represent information. More accurately, it encodes it. 
And the Web--that's a whole 'nother can of worms. Now we get into 
issues of whether my poodle is the Web. (And if so, will he get eaten 
by a spider?)

The best description I've heard is one I got from DanBri: The Resource 
Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for describing resources.

To provide a little more information we might want to say:

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides an simple abstract 
syntax, an XML-based encoding, and a mathematical model for describing 
resources.
