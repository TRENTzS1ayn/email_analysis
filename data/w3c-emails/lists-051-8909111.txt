I knew raising this was a bad idea when I did it.

Let me make the following points:

   1) We have more important things to worry about than this, so lets not 
spend too much energy on it.

   2) RDF is effectively defined by its abstract syntax and a model theory 
therefore it is a language, or close enough for an introductory sentence.

   3) If we are into "my text is better than yours" and arguments over 
style, I don't think I've got the energy.  I've suggested it would be good 
to have a common one sentence "RDF is ...".  I've made a 
suggestion.  Hopefully we can at least all agree its not a data model.  If 
any editor feels that his text is sufficiently better that it justifies 
being different then just go ahead.
