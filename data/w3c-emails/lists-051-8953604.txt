1. section 2.1

para 1 delete 'also'

para 3
"A graph can be considered a sequence of paths of the form Node, Arc, 
Node, Arc, Node, Arc, ... which walk the entire graph."

reads oddly to me: it suggests that all graphs must be a single 
connected path. In fact, most graphs cannot be traversed in this way 
(without backtracking, at any rate). Maybe if you said "....a 
collection of paths.... which together cover the entire graph"   it 
would read better.

Minor point.

On the whole, a *super* document. First time I have ever understood 
what 'striped syntax' means.
