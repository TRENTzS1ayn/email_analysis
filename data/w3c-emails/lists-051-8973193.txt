Hmm... I wonder.

Deployment of RDF has suffered from poor "marketing" as much as
anything else; getting agreement on item 1 for any RDF FAQ,
namely "What is RDF?" is quite valuable, in my estimation.

I agree with Aaron on this: the Resource Description Framework
includes a languaged defined by an abstract syntax and model
theory, but the RDF/XML serialization is an integral part
of the framework too.

Yes, the RDF specs specify a language. But RDF *is* a framework.

I'd like to enourage you, as series editor, to persue this a bit
further.

Eventually, we'll need to write a press release about RDF,
and it would be handy to have an agreed-upon "RDF is..."
sentence for that purpose. Maybe we won't get that far
in this discussion, but I think brainstorming about it
is pretty valuable.

I spent several hours coming up with this ditty for the RDF home
page:

"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) integrates a variety of
applications from library catalogs and world-wide directories to
syndication and aggregation of news, software, and content to personal
collections of music, photos, and events using XML as an interchange
syntax. "
-- http://www.w3.org/RDF/

Unfortunately, that doesn't actually get around to saing what RDF is.
But maybe it provides some inspiration.

Somebody... danbri, I think, added to that "The RDF specifications 
provide a lightweight ontology system to support the exchange of
knowledge on the Web." which I don't care much for, but haven't
found inspiration to improve upon.
