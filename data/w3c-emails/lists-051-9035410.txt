Jonathan,

We too are very short of time.  I think webont is further ahead than we are 
and it is dependent on us.  I do not intend to allow starting discussion on 
new issues unless it is absolutely unavoidable to complete the work we have 
already done.

It is not currently allowed.  Dave, correct me if I'm wrong.  We 
don't  allow combining rdf:datatype and parseType="Literal" do we?

It may be useful but that is a matter for a future WG.  I could add it to 
our list of postponed issues if you like.
