My understanding was that most of the other editors currently use nodes with
labels.
I think we can do this in three ways:
a) hold Pat to his previous commitment !!
b) get everyone to change
c) I finesse it in the Abstract Data Model and permit both (isomorphic)
views elsewhere

I suspect that we do not have time in this round to do any of these, and so
suggest that we leave it as it is, and fix it before last call. There is a
note in the Concepts highlighting this as an unresolved document issue.

I am concerned that the traffic that we have already seen suggests most WG
members would like this round of publication to have a level of
cross-document editorial consistency (including avoiding duplication, and
use of identical terminology) that I think we cannot meet giving the
timescale. I believe many of the issues raised can be postponed until Last
Call.

Personally I think that (c) is the best fix. I would be happy to accept an
action at Friday's telecon to attempt (c) next week - if I don't succeed we
would have to back-up to not fixing this time round.
