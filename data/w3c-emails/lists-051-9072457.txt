Union datatypes.

given where we've got to, there's no longer any reason to exclude them.

Right. I see now what you mean. Though it is not the case
that any values of a union datatype do *not* have at least
one lexical form, in the component (non-union) datatype,
only that there is no L2V mapping to the value in the union
datatype due to ordering of the union definition. The value
*still* has a lexical representation. It's just "hidden" in the
context of the union datatype.

So the RDF requirement that all values have at least one
lexical representation does not necessarily conflict with
XML Schema.

But if folks want to remove that requirement, I don't see it
causing any real problems...
