I've prepared the attached as some briefing notes to help Danbri do the 
update to schema.  Please feel free to correct bits that you think are 
wrong or add bits that are missing.

Datatypes
=========

o Define rdfs:Datatype the class of all datatypes.
o rdfs:Datatype is a subclass of rdfs:Class, i.e. datatypes are classes
o The class extension of a datatype class is the value space of the class.
o a range constraint on a property can take a datatype as its value
o rdfs:XMLLiteral is a member of rdfs:Datatype
o rdfs:XMLLiteral is a subClass of rdf:Literal
o some discussion of notion of a datatype inconsistency - lex form does not 
come from lex space or range constraints with disjoint value spaces

Collections
===========

o Define terms rdf:List a class
                rdf:first a property
                rdf:rest a property
                rdf:nil  a resource
o rdf:rest has a range of rdf:List
