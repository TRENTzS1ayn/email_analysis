No, we don't.

In particular parseType literal is not what I'd like to encourage
using as an extension mechanism, especially for datatypes!

We used to think of the parseType="Literal" as setting an is_XML flag
on the literal to be true, now we think of it as a datatyped literal
where the URI of the datatype is rdfs:XMLLiteral.

As I understand it, the XML Schema WG has an issue to provide URIs
for their more complex datatypes ("particles"?) but hasn't yet
addressed it.  I just remember hearing this, I may be wrong.

So if that happens, then it'll be

  <rdf:Description>
     <ex:foo rdf:datatype="uri-of-complex-xsd-datatype">&lt;foo&gt;...the serialization here ...&lt;/foo&gt;</ex:foo>
  </rdf:Description>
