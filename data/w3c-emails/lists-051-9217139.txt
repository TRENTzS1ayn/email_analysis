No, I intend it to be normative ("relating to or dealing with norms")
and these are normal, standard and legal examples.  It also informs,
but it is expected to be correct (the complete examples have been
machine checked).

There are plenty of examples given in normative sections of
specifications, and this is one section - it defines what a node
element, property element etc. is.

No.  People needed examples and there were definitely a need for them
plus an explanation of how the syntax works - this document isn't
just for parser writers.  I've already had positive feedback on this.

Definitely not.  See above feedback.

I didn't mention whitespace in the text, but pointed to the
concepts doc section on XML Literals.

I doubt object is a better word to use than value in terms of
lessening ambiguity.  There are probably 3-4 different categories of
things in the RDF/XML document that people might call objects,
depending on their background.

Would the phrase "object node" would make more sense?
