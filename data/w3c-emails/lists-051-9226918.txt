Clearly a matter of disagreement.

Non-sequitor. A non-normative appendix is still part of the doc, still
available for the reader. The primary role of a normative spec is to
specify. Other docs can give examples.


Jeremy:

This is still a non sequitor, but I won't push this point. (Useful material
can be published independent of a spec. A clear recommendation can only be
published as part of a standards process).

The concepts doc on XML Literals normatively defers to XML Canonicalization,
which I think normatively defers to the XPath Nodeset, where I believe you
find the whitespace as significant (or you may need to go further back). A
reader faced with a *normative* section that says that the object node
labelled with XML content beginning a:Collection, and faced with some
RDF/XML that delivers "\n     <a:Collection ..." may be forgiven for not
following the refs and simply adding a spurious trim() function to their
understanding of how RDF works.

Yes, you used that a few times, it's better but still awkward though. There
is little clarity in section 2 as to when you are talking about XML and when
you are talking about RDF. ... I'll try and be constructive in my detailed
comments tomorrow.
