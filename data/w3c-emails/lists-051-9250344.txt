Of course the primary role of a normative spec is to specify.  Including 
some examples doesn't diverge from that role;  in fact, it aids in the 
performance of that role.  More specifically, the primery role of a 
normative spec is to *convey the meaning of that specification to the 
people who need to use it*.  A normative spec that no one could 
understand wouldn't be terribly useful, in spite of how "normative" it 
was.  The RDF/XML specification is supposed to describe the RDF/XML 
syntax in a normative way, and I would interpret that to mean "not just 
to parser writers and parsers" (who can process syntax rules and 
determine whether a piece of RDF/XML is written properly or not). After 
all, many W3C  normative documents include examples. I'd suggest people 
look at this the other way:  I can't think of a better way to insure 
that what people think RDF is (including both RDF/XML and Schema) is 
what's described in the Primer than to make all the normative specs 
"bare-bones normative" (and hence virtually unreadable).  The specs 
people can read tend to become "normative" by usage.
