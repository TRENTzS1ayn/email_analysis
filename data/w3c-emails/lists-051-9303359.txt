I think it can go as is for now.

I think that deals with with the 'not all isomorphisms will do' 
comment.  Should be a colon on the end of that though.

for some notion of structure, but different isomorphisms can preserve 
different aspects of the structure.

Well established where?  In mathematical circles?  You are not writing just 
for mathematicians.  I don't know what it means.  If I am a member of the 
intended audience of this document then a part of the intended audience is 
not going to understand this bit.

I suggest saying this in the draft.
