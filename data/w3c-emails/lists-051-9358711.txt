Thanks, I'll advise CC/PP accordingly.

I just realized I have another question:  are all instances of 
rdfs:Datatype also rdfs:subClasseOf rdfs:Literal?

i.e.

   _:x rdf:type rdfs:Datatype
entails
   _:x rdfs:subClasseOf rdfs:Literal

?

(This was not mentioned in Brian's note [1] on RDF schema.)
