Why?  The job of a spec is to specify.  If we wanted to explain why things 
are the way they are we should have written a rationale as well.  I feel 
pretty strongly about this.

Ah that sounds right.

Well you say [[Datatyping in RDF is the use of a datatype to associate a 
lexical form with a denoted value.]]  That is a means to achieve the end I 
suggested [[Datatypes are used in RDF to represent values such as integers, 
floating point numbers and dates.]]  Then goal is to express values.

What point?

Err, RDF isn't a protocol.  You are right it needs some mention, but as I 
suggest, perhaps fewer more focussed words.
