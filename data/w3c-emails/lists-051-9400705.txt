Jeremy--

Is "+1" merely an expression of agreement, or does this mean you're 
changing your title?

WG (especially other editors)--

I'm probably not the only Editor who's trying to keep track of all these 
last minute "little suggestions" floating around that potentially affect 
their spec, and I'd sure appreciate it if you could be very explicit as 
to any changes that are actually being made.  For example:  if you 
change the title of your document, it affects all the others.
