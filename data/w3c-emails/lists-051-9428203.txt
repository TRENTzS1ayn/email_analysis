Frank makes a good point here.  I'm only just beginning to appreciate how 
tricky it must be to keep the docs in sync.  I was looking at Dave's syntax 
document yesterday and noticed that he has some pretty precise references 
to internal sections of the concepts doc (e.g. 2.4.4 ...)

I guess we need a policy on how to handle these.  This is really up to the 
editors though I have a suggestion.  We could aim to have a reference 
freeze about a week before final review and publication.  In that week the 
editors are not allowed to change section numbers, etc.  Each editor must 
go through his doc in that week and check that all references are correct.
