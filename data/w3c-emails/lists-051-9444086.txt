I have no objection.

I think it may be tricky to completely excise all instances of "data model" 
from the text, as there may be places where "abstract syntax" doesn't fully 
connect with the readership.

I've recorded this as a document issue [1], but noting Frank's concern will 
not act upon it until the WG is ready to coordinate any such changes.
