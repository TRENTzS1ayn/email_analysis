I am not doing anything to the doc this week.
I was waiting to see what was said in the telecon (which I won't be
attending ...)

I think given the scale of comments we've already seen on both docs we are
reviewing this week we need to decide how much change we want before
publication.


I no longer believe that this round of WD will be consistent in their
cross-referencing.

Overall I hope the WG can direct the editors as to the desired changes, and
the editors make a good faith attempt to meet the easier ones in the
timescale, and we just accept a certain amount of screw up as inevitable.

I fear that all our docs may need considerable work before last call; and
getting on with it seems good - even if it looks a mess from the outside.

Possibly we could stagger publication. e.g. concepts goes out first, with
refs to previous drafts of everything, then syntax, with refs to new
concepts and previous everything else, etc. I don't think its worth the
effort. I prefer a status fo this document that says that our goal on this
round was to present all the technical material, and we are aware that there
are editorial inconsistencies both internal to each doc and cross-document.
