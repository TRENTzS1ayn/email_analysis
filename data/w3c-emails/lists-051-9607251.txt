There is a possible snag here. I think we are (as a group) still 
somewhat unclear about the meaning of rdf:Literal. In the MT I was 
very explicit that that class contained literal *values*, not 
literals. I was expecting a backlash, but nobody noticed :-). Now 
that datatyped literals can denote non-strings, the difference 
between those two interpretations of rdf:Literal is again rather 
important, so can I ask the group to decide clearly and firmly which 
interpretation they want to have? Note that if rdf:Literal is 
supposed to be the class of literals, then all triples of the form

aaa rdf:type rdf:Literal .

will be false in all interpretations. Or else I could just wrote 
rdf:Literal out of the model theory and declare it semantically 
underdetermined, like rdf:comment.
