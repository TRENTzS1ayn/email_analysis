For RDF I would agree, For OWL and layering I think the case for 
Lbase is much stronger.

But this fails to acknowledge the fact that for 9  months we were 
stuck trying to do it that way, that at least two papers were 
published claiming that it was impossible, and that the only way we 
managed to actually do it, finally, was by using a technique which 
(although I didn't emphasize this in the documents) was in fact based 
on an Lbase translation.  I think that to say that the model theory 
has been useful as a way of *resolving* layering issues is really not 
accurate.
