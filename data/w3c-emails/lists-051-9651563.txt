There is an broader issue of terminology here. We have many audiences 
to speak to and they bring different presuppositions to bear on what 
we write. So I think it is OK to occasionally err on the side of 
loquacity in order to avoid possible misunderstanding, eg using 
phrases like 'object, in the sense of the third item in the triple'
