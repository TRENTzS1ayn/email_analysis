I don't find the reasons give all very convincing. In particular, 
arguments from formal elegance should only be used as tie-breakers. 
But the last one, about XML accidents, is a reasonable one.

I would suggest that we let the model theory merge the cases back 
together, by ignoring the lang tag for non-XML literals. It has no 
meaning outside XML in any case: the *strings* "chat"eng and "chat"fr 
are the same string. If we want to distinguish them, then we should 
call them 'words' and have a domain of words in the model theory for 
them to denote.
