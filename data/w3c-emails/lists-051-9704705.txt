No, it doesn't mean that. Seems to me, at any rate. rdfs:Literal is 
the class of all literal values, not all literals. If it were all 
literals then nothing would be in it, since there is no way to name a 
literal in RDF and use that name in the subject position in a triple.

Its badly named, for sure.
