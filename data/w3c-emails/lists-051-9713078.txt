I thought there might be.

Yup.  Oh bu**er I see what you mean.  Or do I?  There is a value space for 
rdfs:XMLLiteral, say XMLVAL..  There is the set of things that literals 
(not the XML variety) denote, say LITVAL.  The  class extension of Literal 
is XMLVAL union LITVAL.  Does that work?

I don't follow that one.  We have been careful not to say whether literals 
are resources or not, but we all know they are really.
