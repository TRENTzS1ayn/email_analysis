Indeed, the design I have in mind doesn't provide everything
you need to do prolog-style recursion; it only provides
a RDF/XML short-hand syntax for first/rest/nil, not the
semantics to support recursion.

But I suggest that syntactic shorthand support is necessary
and sufficient for the RDF layer; it's necessary because
users require straightforward syntax for lists, and
WebOnt can't change RDF/XML syntax (nor can anybody else
but this WG, i.e. the WG that edits the RDF/XML syntax
spec); and it's sufficient because the unique first constraint
can be layered on top, using owl:cardinality, rdfs:range,
etc.

Note that such a layering is *impossible* with
the older rdf:Seq/rdf:li syntax.

An alternative to consider is moving FunctionalProperty
into RDFS... but that would only get it as far
as RDFS, not into the RDF layer, so it doesn't
really help...

Another alternative is to back this change out altogether,
since, as you point out, having the syntax suggest
semantics that aren't there can be confusing in its
own right. I don't think there's sufficient new
information to go that far, but I wouldn't mind
talking it over.

Isn't it pretty obvious that the code to implement
graph matching (i.e. RDF simple entailment) is very
different from code to implement the sort of reasoning
with equality involved with a functional rdf:first
property?

If not, then I hope Jeremy or Jan or Graham or
maybe Jos can elaborate; I'm not in a good position to do so
just now.


Now as to process/social stuff...

Indeed, that's why we have meeting records: we agreed to what
the record says we agreed; you're not bound to my recollection
of the meeting, only to the record we all reviewed and
approved over the next week(s). I guess
I was negligent in reviewing the record, now that I see
that Jeremy and Graham remember it that way too.

and I admit I haven't read your proposal in detail...

No, I didn't make myself clear.

If you happen to be on the phone with Jeremy or Graham, please
discuss it with them. I'm not sure I've explained my
position very well.

As discussed above, we are committed to what the meeting
record says, and the meeting record doesn't say we
are committed to this sort of semantics.

No, not yet...

Right; the editors are working out the design details.

Formally, WebOnt hasn't yet decided to close its list
issue, but the expectation is that the editors' proposal
will get adopted. RDFCore *has* decided the issue,
and whatever the editors come up with is what we'll
go with, unless somebody can (a) argue that it
conflicts with recorded decisions or (b) brings
up new information that merits re-opening the issue.

I don't think so. I don't think Jeremy thinks so either.

I think it's important that semantically, the RDF layer
is just the existential-conjuctive fragment of FOL.

Your point is well made, but I, for one, considered it before we
made the 31May decision, and I maintain that the risk
is manageable.

Yes, when I look at it closely, I think so.

So that RDF/XML parsers know their names without looking
in the OWL spec.

rdf:List (i.e. the semantics-free one I have in mind
that comes from from parseType="Collection") isn't very interesting
to me. Mike Dean argued for
it on some implementation grounds that I'm not very clear on.
I think it's in the syntax document, and I don't have much
of an argument for taking it out, now that it's there.

I hope you find the position in the middle coherent, if not
convincing. Jeremy, maybe you have some time to try to convince
PatH?

Now why don't you tell us how you *really* feel, Pat?
