Sorry Pat I should have commented earlier - I am feeling much happier about
the LBase doc on the basis that you are working on and will soon publish an
LBase treatment of RDF.

(I suspect I would prefer it as part of the note - but that's another
issue).

I think I have no more issues that must be addressed on that - in fact, with
an LBase treatment of RDF I could positively support publication.
