Sure, I don't mind having XML structures in the literal value space; 
after all, they are a kind of datatype value. My concern is really 
more to do with the issue that came up in a msg from Patrick last 
week, where he seemed (and he is not alone) to be assuming that 
rdf:LIteral  was the class of literals. I hope its not, because now 
that literals have gotten so complicated, they are certainly not 
literal values any more. It used to be strings all the way down, but 
times have changed.

Do we? I don't think they are any more. Literal values might or might 
not be, but literals???
