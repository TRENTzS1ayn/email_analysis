Well, it would cause me disappointment with respect
to the expectations I came away with from our
18 Oct meeting:

====
  Proposal: to distinguish between RDF-entailment (without DT knowledge,
  where DTyped literals in the abstract syntax don't have an equality
  based on value mappings) and a parameterised RDF+DT-entailment
  (that is, parameterised by the set of datatypes involved in the
particular
  entailment)

  There seemed to be general agreement that this distinction was
  important and useful.

Or... hmm... would I be pleasantly surprised, rather
than disappointed?

i.e. what you're talking about now is consistent with
what I expected as of a vew days previous...

# details of rdf:datatype? Dan Connolly (Mon, Oct 14 2002)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0133.html

but the responses to that message showed
that other WG members were expecting something else... more
like what we discussed on 18Oct.

I suspect it will, but I would need time to investigate
the details...

Ah! yes, now I recall: it's fine
as long as your API knows about all the datatypes
it's ever going to see in an RDF/XML document.
But as soon as the code reads a document with
a datatype URI that it doesn't recognize, it
sort has to throw an "I can't make sense of
this literal" exception; I don't see any
way to continue gracefully, i.e. without
acting non-monotonic.

That really doesn't bother me that much;
it means that datatyping is less
flexible/extensible than it appeared
in many of our discussions... but I can
live with that.

(if that looks like a jumbled mess rather
than a coherent answer to your question, you have
accurately understood the level of clarity
in my head at this point.)

Yes, quite; hence my hesitation to get into all this stuff,
and my rdfs:format proposal.

# a low-impact datatypes proposal: rdfs:format
Dan Connolly (Thu, Oct 03 2002)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0031.html

I'm starting to wonder if working out the details
of our datatypes decision is giving me enough
new information to ask to re-open it. Hmm...
certainly not before the next WD, but after that,
I hope we'll all take a deep breath and re-evaluate
what we came up with.
