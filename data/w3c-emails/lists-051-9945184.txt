I believe that the exclusion of language tag from typed literals is a change
not requested by any reviewer. The WG has spent enough time on this issue
and I think we should delete the words
", in the particular case of an XML literal (see section 3), "

The rest of that para makes it clear that the value depends on the string;
the previous section makes it clear that XML Literals are exceptional.

Peter's comment can be fully addressed by deleting the bullet point
beginning:
"Each member of the value space is paired "; this also deletes the defn of
lexical representation, which will be a great loss for humanity (i.e. I
think the rest of the doc will read OK despite it).
