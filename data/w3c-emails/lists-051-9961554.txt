"real lists" if it doesn't involve a functional
rdf:first.

On pragmatic grounds, I don't have a problem.
cwm makes this assumption, for example.
But on theoretical grounds...

There is that.

I still think having the short-hand list syntax
is a good thing, and that it's usable in WebOnt.
I wish I could collect my thoughts in a convincing
