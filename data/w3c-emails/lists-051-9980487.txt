Er, what about

   "foo"^^xsd:string

Looks like an xsd:string literal to me...

If you mean that inlined literals (non-explicitly datatyped) would
be interpreted to be xsd:string's, then that's not allowed anyway.

I agree, though, that is very odd for the lang tag to participate
in the L2V mapping. It's really a scoping issue, not a characteristic
of the lexical representation.
