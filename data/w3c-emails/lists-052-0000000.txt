I note that the role of (RDF/XML) parsers is to create an abstract syntax 
graph from RDF/XML input, not N-triples.  I think *requiring* parsers to 
case-normalize is over-specification, and I think the case-agnostic view 
for the abstract syntax proposed by Jeremy is about right. [**]

But adopting a convention for N-triples, which is a concrete representation 
of an abstract syntax graph, that case-insensitive values are presented as 
lower case seems to address the other concerns I have heard.

[**]  Note: this doesn't mean that parsers MUST NOT case-normalize where 
appropriate:  that is an implementation decision.
