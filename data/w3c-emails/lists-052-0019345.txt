I think that's OK.  So let's move on to concrete changes.

For N-Triples, we are proposing that one case (lower) is required to
match the single case in the abstract syntax graph.

This is already the case:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#language

So nothing need be done.

That means the examples/test cases that were flying around were
illegal N-Triples.  That's OK since Jeremy has already agreed to
change them to be RDF/XML test cases with variant case.
