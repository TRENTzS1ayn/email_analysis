Review agenda:
Since DaveB had to leave early due to timezone conflicts,
the agenda was somewhat reshuffled. I've recorded here
the items in the order they were addressed.

Next telecon:
April 11 2003 10:00 Boston time. Scribe: Jeremy


Minutes of last telecon:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0097.html
  Review of minutes carried over until next week.


Confirm status of completed actions:
  ALL DONE.


Item 7: CC/PP review comments
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0186.html

  There was some discussion of the merit of getting a second group to
  ask XSD if 1/2 (rational) = 0.5 (decimal) but it was not felt to be
  vital to persue via this route.

  RESOLVED: (BWM propose, jang second, 0 agin 0 abst)
  To approve the review comments with the (tactful) addition that
  the WG suggest that CC/PP should adopt the use of datatyped literals.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#1 (bwm) To send review comments (with addition of
suggestion of adoption of DTed literals) to CC/PP


Item 12: RDF in SVG.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0020.html

  DaveB noted that RDF in SVG was much simpler than RDF in (x)HTML.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#2 (daveb) work on a small section on "RDF in SVG"
for inclusion in the syntax document.


Item 16: Issue chas-01
  Proposed disposition:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0026.html

  RESOLVED: (DaveB prop, jjc second, 0 agin 0 abst)
  The WG approved the comments in DaveB's response.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#3 (daveb) send response to chas-01 outlined in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0026.html


Item 18: Issue timbl-02
  Proposed dispositions:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0031.html

  ACTION 2003-04-04#4 (path) Editorial action to emphasise in SEMANTICS
that reification is NOT quotation.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#5 (danbri) Editorial action to emphasise in SCHEMA
that reification is NOT quotation.

  MikeD, PatS and FrankM all indicated that they had applications which
relied on reification as it currently stands to operate

  RESOLVED: (prop PatS, second jjc, 0 agin 0 abst)
  The WG rejects comment timbl-02.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#6 (gk) Send response wrt timbl-02; draft response
to rdfcore first.


Item 19: Issue timbl-01
  Proposed dispositions:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0001.html

  DaveB noted that after much searching he'd found one user (RolandS)
  of bagId.

  When asked (although this issue does not mention rdf:id to reify
single statements) MikeD said that his aplications were using
rdf:id in that manner.

  RESOLVED: (Prop PatS, second danbri, 0 agin, path abst)
  The WG resolved to drop the bagId syntax.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#7 (daveb) Respond to timbl-01 (bagId).

  ACTION 2003-04-04#8 (daveb) Remove bagId from SYNTAX.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#9 (jang) Remove bagId tests from test cases.
We need a 'bag Id removed' test case.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#10 (daveb) Let RolandS know that bagId has been
removed.


Item 11: Issues pfps-04 -05 -06 -07 -10

  GK's review (long) is now in:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0033.html


Item 13: horrocks-01
  ACTION 2003-03-14#11 (path) produce words for a resolution to horrocks-01

  PatH: I'm doing that after the call.


Item 14: tex-01
  Jeremy's proposal:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0077.html

  JanG wanted the premise and conclusion documents to be in RDF/XML,
  he and DaveB felt that lang tags should be normalised in NTriples.
  JJC said that with RDF/XML documents for the entailment test, the
  NTriples lang tag issue could be skirted.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#11 (jjc) Produce a test case for tex-01 (as outlined
in message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0077.html
with RDF/XML premise and conclusion inputs) and reply to
issue raiser.


Item 15: williams-02
  Proposed disposition:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0154.html

  RESOLVED: (prop jjc, second gk, agin 0, abst 0)
  The WG resolved to remove the NFC constraint on RDF URI references.

  ACTION 2003-04-04#12 (jjc) review the test cases for NFC constraints.

  RESOLVED (prop bwm, second gk, 0 agin, jjc abst)
  We continue to use the term "RDF URI reference" [although we note that
  the definition currently aligns with that of an absolute IRI ref.]

  ACTION 2003-04-04#13 (jjc) respond to williams-02


Item 17: pfps-16
  GK's revised proposal (not in agenda)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0045.html

  JJC was concerned that the changes proposed included editorial changes
  beyond those required to address pfps-16.

  The issue continues.


Item 20: jsr-118-01
  GK's proposal:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0021.html

  BWM's proposal:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0037.html

  RESOLVED: (prop gk, second jjc, 0 agin, 0 abst)
  Reject the JSR-118-01 comment for the reasons given in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0037.html

  [We note that this issue was the hardest for the WG itself to reach
  agreement on; that there was dissent at the time]

  ACTION 2003-04-04#14 (gk) send response to jsr118-01


The meeting ended due to time constraints, with the chair much more
optimistic about the rate of progress :-)
