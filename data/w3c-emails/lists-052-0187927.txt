Concerning section 3.2
I think these changes would be better logged as miscellaneous editorial.
They are quite minor.
As always I dislike your decision to use UK case conventions on headings 
rather than US ones. Not that I am pro-american, simply for consistency with 
W3C house style.

(This is more positive than I was last night about this section).

You missed one change required by williams-01
[[ Note that such blank node identifiers are not part 
of the RDF abstract syntax, and the representation of statements containing 
blank nodes is entirely dependent on the particular concrete syntax used.
]]

'statements' is incorrect. suggest
"representation of statements" => "concrete representation of triples"
