I have now completed my review of your proposed changes.

I note that sometimes I have been more negative in the summary message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0139.html
and less negative in a more detailed response (or on one occassion:
the reverse:
section 3.5 [[ s/object/resource/ :) ]]
In all of these cases, the more positive comments stands.

Jeremy
