that seems to be conclusive that the text should go.
One of the many problems with section 4 was that some people did not like the 
idea that there is a defining authority. If the other text we have concerning 
defining authorities is questionable, then deleting it feels like a safe 
option (since RDF with no defining authorities even for datatypes is not 
really significantly more broken than RDF with no defining authorities except 
for datatypes).

(I am sorry Patrick I haven't even tried to understand your argument for why 
it is wrong, or how to fix it)
