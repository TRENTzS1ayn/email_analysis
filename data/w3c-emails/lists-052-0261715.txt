Its not quite that simple.  We have a last call comment

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0490.html

which hasn't made it to the issues list yet, so I've added it:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#efth-01

If someone were to propose a resolution this week, perhaps along the lines of:

[[
Considering that:

   o the WG, have in multiple editions of WD's indicated its intention to 
not to change the URI REFS for the RDF and RDFS namespaces

   o the WG explicitly requested feedback on this intention

   o very little negative feedback has been received

   o there is significant cost and complexity in changing the namespace URI 
REFs

the RDFCore WG resolves

   o not to change the URI REFS for the RDF and RDFS namespaces

   o to ACTION the document editor's to make such editorial changes as are 
required by this decision

]]
