I thought that was addressed by the uses we had identified...

I didn't catch that Frank was using this.  That would be four users known 
to us.

That's for the working group to decide.  My action was to draft a response 
based on the decision we made.  (So far, we've decided that pain/confusion 
of keeping it is not so great...  it's not as if we've only had "a few 
days" to think about it.  Also, it appears that the R-vocabulary is useful, 
but not for what Tim wants to do.  It doesn't feel like a corresponding 
situation to me.)

I guess I should add that to the response?
