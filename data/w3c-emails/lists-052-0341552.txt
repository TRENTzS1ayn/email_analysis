Hmmm... maybe.

I think it's very clear from our discussions that "nodes" of a graph are 
its "subjects" and "objects";  cf. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-concepts-20030123/#section-rdf-graph
which I understand to reflect the graph discussion.  Otherwise, yes, I agree.

That's better that mine.

Ummm... this appears to be inconsistent:
(a) use "subject" or "node", not both (see above).
(b) the subject node *represents* a "resource that is the subject", but an 
object node "is the object ..."

I think my wording here can be improved, but I don't think yours does 
it.  Following the lead of:
[[
6.1 RDF Triples

An RDF triple contains three components:

     * the subject, which is an RDF URI reference or a blank node
     * the predicate, which is an RDF URI reference
     * the object, which is an RDF URI reference, a literal or a blank node

An RDF triple is conventionally written in the order subject, predicate, 
object.

The predicate is also known as the property of the triple.

Here's another attempt:

[[
Each triple represents a statement of a relationship between the
things denoted by the nodes that it links. Each triple has three parts:

a subject,
an object, and
a property (also called a predicate) that denotes some relationship between 
the subject and object.

Fair point.  Or just?:
[[
The direction of the arc is significant: it always points toward the object.
]]

That's not what your normative text says :^)  (see above)

I don't recognize any such risk associated with the word "assertion" -- 
it's simply something that is claimed or presumed to be true.  I think the 
risk arises only when we start to discuss how such claim is established.

I think this fails the intent of this (non-normative) section, which is to 
provide some lead-in/background to the concepts that underpin RDF.  "The 
meaning of an RDF triple is the statement it represents" feels rather 
circular to me.  I prefer the form of words I proposed (which IIRC were not 
mine, but offered by Pat).  But maybe one could be tighter about use of 
some terms:

[[
The assertion of an RDF triple says that some relationship,
indicated by the property, holds between the things denoted by
subject and object of the triple.  The assertion of an RDF graph
amounts to asserting all the triples in it, so the meaning of
an RDF graph is the conjunction (logical AND) of the statements
corresponding to all the triples it contains.  A formal account
of the meaning of RDF graphs is given in [RDF-SEMANTICS].

My collected counter-proposal:

[[
3.1 Graph Data Model

The underlying structure of any expression in RDF
is a collection of triples, each consisting of a subject, a
property and an object. A set of such triples is called an
RDF graph (defined more formally in section 6).
This can be illustrated by a node and directed-arc diagram,
in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link
(hence the term "graph").

   *picture*

Each triple represents a statement of a relationship between the
things denoted by the nodes that it links. Each triple has three parts:

   a subject,
   an object, and
   a property (also called a predicate) that denotes a relationship.

The direction of the arc is significant: it always points toward the object.

The nodes of an RDF graph are its subjects and objects.

The assertion of an RDF triple says that some relationship,
indicated by the property, holds between the things denoted by
subject and object of the triple.  The assertion of an RDF graph
amounts to asserting all the triples in it, so the meaning of
an RDF graph is the conjunction (logical AND) of the statements
corresponding to all the triples it contains.  A formal account
of the meaning of RDF graphs is given in [RDF-SEMANTICS].
