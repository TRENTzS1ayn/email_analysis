Fine.

Mumble. Maybe so.

Yes, that's better.

I disagree (strongly) that it needs to be justified by a last call comment.

This is based on some words that Pat noticed (by Shelley, I think), and 
which he commented would be very helpful to use in some form.  I think the 
additional words help to convey the intent of this section, and do not 
otherwsie change it, and as such are fully justified as an editorial 
enhancement.

*if* and *when* our reviewers choose to take issue with the text being 
proposed, I would say that reconsideration is appropriate.  Until then, I 
do not think we should be afraid to make to the text that we feel improve 
its conveyance of the intended message.

Here, I find it difficult to match changes exactly with issues raised.  In 
his comments, Peter raised a number of objections about the comparison with 
database and n-place predicates, and the changes were made to address those 
concerns.  Because I was able to reference a (now stable) discussion in the 
primer, it seemed most appropriate to cut back the text as I have done.
