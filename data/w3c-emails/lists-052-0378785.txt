>Concerning section 3.2

The problem is that the phrase:

"the representation of statements containing blank nodes"

can be parsed


  representation
  /                 \
the                of statements
                              \
                              containing blank nodes

with the statements containing the blank nodes
or

        representation
    /         |                   \
the     of statements      containing blank nodes

with the representation containing the blank nodes.

Neither statements nor (concrete) representations contain blank nodes.
Blank nodes only appear in triples, which are abstract representations of 
statements. I take the representations here to be concrete representations in 
which blank nodes are indicated for example by a blank node identifier.
(I would accept that blank nodes appear in representations drawn as graphs 
with circles without labels)
