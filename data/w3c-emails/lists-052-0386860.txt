I will settle for striking "arbitrarily".

on striking of example ...

Looking in the archive I found:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0320.html

where Peter seemed mainly concerned about ill-thought claims concerning 
expressive power. Deleting the single sentence addresses that problem.

I can't see any others in the archive - what I am missing?

The LC text does not claim that the RDF representation is equivalent, merely 
that it is an expression of, an n-place predicate or a n-column table.

The primer does not deal with this problem, which is why I thought we had this 
text in the first place.
