I'm fine with that, but our use is internal, so I can't provide links.

But in a nutshell, we use reification to record the source of statements,
by which we infer authority. E.g.

   #subj #pred #obj .

   _:s rdf:type rdf:Statement ;
   _:s rdf:subject #subj ;
   _:s rdf:predicate #pred ;
   _:s rdf:object #obj ;
   _:s #source <http://some.server/some_schema.rdf> ]

   <http://some.server/some_schema.rdf> dc:owner #auth .

We can then qualify queries based on either source or authority.

Shortly, when I get sw.nokia.com online and functional (a week or two) this will
be evident in the public metadata published there.

Hopefully the above summary suffices for the record, re the WG's decision
on this issue.

Well, if the WG chooses to remove the reification vocabulary, we will
simply have to define it ourselves, which is not hard to do, but
then, there at least is a degree of reasonable interoperability
afforded by the present vocabulary, and I also think a good bit
of concensus about its usage.

I would hate to see it go (but could live with it going).

I fully agree. We should be clear about the various uses we identified
in our discussions and clarify which use we chose as the intended use
and warn folks not to use it for the other uses.
