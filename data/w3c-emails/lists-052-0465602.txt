If you want to distinguish between symbols rather than the things they
refer to, wouldn't you also balk at

<s1> owl:sameIndividualAs <s2>

since they're clearly not the same? Should we ask that a health warning
be attached to owl:sameIndividualAs?

I'm really concerned about this test case. It seems to mix formal
notions (owl:sameIndividualAs) and woolly ones ("strongly suggests").

Presumably there is an analogous warning to be attached to datatypes?
Since (sooner or later) we might find the situation that

_:jan eg:age "21.0"^^xsd:decimal .

"strongly implies" that

_:jan eg:age "21"^^xsd:int .


We decided NOT to deprecate reification, but to attach a note indicating
that people (trying to) use it for quotation were getting it wrong.
Adding more and more "health warning" (this might go wrong, this
strongly suggests something bad, it makes your nose fall off, etc) seems
like de facto deprecation to me.

As we already saw when DanC and I discussed options for "alternatives"
to reification, there are hard decisions to be made when it comes to
designing a quotation mechanism. The WG didn't explore those options;
currently, if you are interested in the URIs people used to express some
RDF, you are stuck with slapping the document in a parseType="Literal"
:-/
