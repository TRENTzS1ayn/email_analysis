Right. Sorry for the confusion. Thirty lashes for me for trying
to answer email and participate in a meeting at the same time ;-)

If only I could multitask like Linux... ;-)

Pick away.

Insofar as what that statement is saying, yes. But not
necessarily in that particular form. I.e. all of the 
following are synonymous:

  <s1> <p1> <o1> .
  <s1> <p2> <o1> .
  <s1> <p1> <o2> .
  <s2> <p1> <o2> .
  ...

and it is quite true that the source denoted by #x expresses
the assertion that any of those synonymous permutations
of that assertion.

Since reification is not quoting, everything is fine, and
the entailments based on the owl:sameIndividualAs assertions
do not "make" the source say something it has not. It *has*
said

  <s2> <p2> <o2> .

even if it hasn't used those URIrefs to say it.

The inferences are not "putting words into the schemas's mouth".

Fine. So what.

Exactly. So long as they understand that reification is not quoting,
and that any free variation of synonymous URIs does not make the
source say anything new, then they will have grokked reification as
now defined.

'Expressed' may be better than 'occurs'. I think the key distinction
to be made in the specs is that reification captures what is
asserted, not necessarily how it is asserted. I.e., whatever the synonymous
<*1> and <*2> URIrefs denote, what matters is what is being asserted about the
resources denoted, not the specific URIrefs being used to assert it.

Right?
