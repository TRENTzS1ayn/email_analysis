OK, now I see.  Thanks.

I propose:

   "the representation of triples containing blank nodes"

which is almost what you suggested, less the word "concrete".

So the revised paragraph in 3.2 would be  (noting that "statement" was 
previously similarly misused in the first sentence):

[[
A convention used by some linear representations of an RDF graph to allow 
several statements to reference the same unidentified resource is to use a 
blank node identifier, which is a local identifier that can be 
distinguished from all URIs and literals. When graphs are merged, their 
blank nodes must be kept distinct if meaning is to be preserved; this may 
call for re-allocation of blank node identifiers. Note that such blank node 
identifiers are not part of the RDF abstract syntax, and the representation 
of triples containing blank nodes is entirely dependent on the particular 
concrete syntax used.
]]
