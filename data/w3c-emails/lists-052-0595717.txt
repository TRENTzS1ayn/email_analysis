I think I agree with that last bit...

The _statement_ which can be represented by the _triple_ "<s2> <p2> <o2> ." 
is asserted by (or entailed by, though that would seem to be less direct) 
the RDF schema referenced.  The triple itself does not necessarily appear 
in any representation of the schema.
