The relevant messages are:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0154.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0315.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0320.html

which I interpreted to embody a complaint that RDF does not express the 
same as an N-ary predciate.

Well, I thought that was part of Peter's problem.  For this point in this 
particular document, I thought it was sufficient to indicate that the 
binary predicate form could be used to express the facts commonly 
represented by (say) an n-column database table, which I think it does.

I'm not sure, now, what "this problem" is, that is not covered by the 
proposed revised text.
