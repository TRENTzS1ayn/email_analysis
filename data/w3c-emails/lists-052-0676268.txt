As I saw it the LC text was intended to indicate one way to migrate legacy 
relational data into RDF. I had considered proposing to cut this text 
completely when I reworked the example a couple of releases ago. I decided 
against on the basis that relational data is the most important type of 
legacy data, yet the topic is slightly beyond the primer treatment. Nothing 
Peter says seems relevant to that judgement.

While I am not particularly attached to this baby see your proposed changes as  
throwing it out with the bathwater.
