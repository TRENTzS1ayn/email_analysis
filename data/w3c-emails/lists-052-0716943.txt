Sending another complicated email, describing agreements on bits of 
proposals, disagreements, amicable or otherwise on others etc does 
*nothing* to reduce my confusion.

I would like to see, for each issue, a single email, with an appropriate 
title, e.g.

   pfps-16: proposed disposition for WG decision

and content that we can put to the WG.

Is that so unreasonable?
