Well, I surely don't think this section is trying to promote a "migration 
strategy".  I think it is appropriate here to indicate that the simple RDF 
binary predicate form can be used to express the same information (if not 
the exact same facts) that may be contained in a relational database, which 
I think the text does.

I remain satisfied with the currenbt text.
