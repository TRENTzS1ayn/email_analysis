Further to my message:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0136.html

I have re-submitted to the list a number of proposals for changes to RDF 
Concepts.

I list below the *latest* message URIs.  The changes compared with the 
earlier proposals are wording changes in response to comments received.

Since the proposals are framed in terms of specific proposed text for 
changes to the Concepts document, it would help me if comments on the 
proposed text could be submitted to the list.  If possible, I would like 
any teleconference discussion of the issues to be focused on: "It's OK" or 
"There's not yet consensus for this change -- bring it back later".

The current issues, which I hope can considered at the next teleconference, 
are:
