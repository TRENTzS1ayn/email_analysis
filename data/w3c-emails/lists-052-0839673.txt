AOB 1: Section 3.3 in Concepts
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Datatypes
which bits are normative?
Editorial agreement (jjc+gk) to move normative sections
from here to Abstract Syntax part. Jeremy to circulate
draft since it will technically be substantive.

AOB 2: OWL Test Cases
Jeremy indicates that the plan is to move this to LC fairly
soon, so a review now would be premature.
