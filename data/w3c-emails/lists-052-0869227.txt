I was actioned to identify four issues for discussion:

I suggest 
  danc-02 goofy ltierals, 
  xmlsch-01  Typed Literal Structure
  xmlsch-02 whitespace facet
  pfps-13     Datatype Facets
  xmlsch-03 lexical mapping


Moreover I will send e-mail to xmlsch-wg concerning
  xmlsch-04 values without lexical forms
