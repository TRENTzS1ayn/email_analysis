PROPOSE: Reject this issue - the text is self-consistent.

History (rewritten):
Dan [1] says:
[[ 
specification of literals is goofy... "A literal in an RDF graph
  contains three components called: ...
  The datatype URI being an RDF URI reference. ...
  A plain literal is one in which the datatype URI is absent."
Hello? you just told me every literal has one.

Specify that the datatype URI and language identifier
are optional.
]]

I replied [2]:
****
I wanted to check that you had 
seen the line in that subsection:
[[
The lexical form is present in all RDF literals; the language identifier and 
the datatype URI may be absent from an RDF literal.
]]
*****

Dan replied [3]:
[[
Ah, no, in fact, I didn't see that.

I suppose that's sufficient, but...
]]

However, I had discussed other options, which was with hindsight a mistake.

Since Dan sees the current text as sufficient I see no reason to change it.
