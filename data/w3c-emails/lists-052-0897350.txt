There is a version of the editors draft at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_Editors.html

which has quite a few more changes made to it in response to more 
comments. In particular some of the intro text has been reworded to 
bring it a bit more up to date, and the rules concerning literals 
have been reorganized. Lots of small changes.
----

Jeremy/Graham, I'd appreciate your glancing at the green tables and 
the surrounding text to make sure Ive got the XML literal 
story/terminology more or less right.

Graham, I may not have dealt with all your comments on the earlier 
draft yet, sorry. I will ASAP.

Jos, when you wake up, could you check the new rules? In particular, 
Im not sure that they get all the right properties from the empty 
graph, eg that all the built-in classes are in fact type rdfs:Class 
and all are subClasses of Resource.

Note the change to rdfs7 and the new rule 12 (rule 11 is an old 
datatype rule) . Also Ive put all the 'trivial' Resource domains and 
ranges into the axiomatic triple table, note.

Brian, you can archive this if you like, but I will have a rather 
firmer one in a few days; this still has some internal anchors loose 
and isnt linked to the decisions in the minutes, and hasnt been run 
though the W3C HTML checker.

As soon it is archived I will send out responses to all the done 
comments on the semantics list, which I think is now most of them. 
(Still need WG consideration: pan-01 (same as qu-03?), xmlsch-07, 
pfps-01 )
