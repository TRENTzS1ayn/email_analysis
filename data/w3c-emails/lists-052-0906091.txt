>Dear Chairs,
>
>1. LAST CALL ANNOUNCEMENT:
>        Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Version 2.0 (2nd Edition)
>
>        W3C Working Draft 11 April 2003
>
>This is a Last Call announcement from the W3C Math Working Group  for
>review of MathML 2.0 Second edition.
>
>2. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENT REVIEW
>The Math WG asks for review of the document
>
>   Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Version 2.0 (2nd Edition)
>
>The document is available at:
>
>http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-MathML2-20030411/
>
>and a color-coded version of the Working Draft showing the differences
>since MathML 2.0 is also available at:
>
>http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-MathML2-20030411/overview-d.html
>
>
>Abstract
>
>This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or
>MathML. MathML is an XML application for describing mathematical
>notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of
>MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed
>on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for
>text.
>
>This specification of the markup language MathML is intended primarily
>for a readership consisting of those who will be developing or
>implementing renderers or editors using it, or software that will
>communicate using MathML as a protocol for input or output. It is not
>a User's Guide but rather a reference document.
>
>This document begins with background information on mathematical
>notation, the problems it poses, and the philosophy underlying the
>solutions MathML 2.0 proposes. MathML can be used to encode both
>mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty of the
>MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another
>about one hundred and fifty provide a way of unambiguously specifying
>the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how
>the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML
>renderers might be implemented and should interact with
>browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of MathML
>characters and their relation to fonts.
>
>While MathML is human-readable, it is anticipated that, in all but the
>simplest cases, authors will use equation editors, conversion
>programs, and other specialized software tools to generate
>MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools already exist, and a
>number of others, both freely available software and commercial
>products, are under development.
>
>Status of the Document
>
>This is the W3C Last Call Working Draft of MathML 2.0 2nd Edition for
>review by W3C members and other interested parties.  It is a revised
>edition of a document that has been reviewed by W3C Members and other
>interested parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C
>Recommendation.
>
>This document has been produced by the W3C Math Working Group as part
>of W3C Math Activity.  The goals of that W3C Math Working Group are
>discussed in the W3C Math WG Charter (revised February 2000 and June
>2001 from original of 11 June 1998). A list of participants in the W3C
>Math Working Group is available.
>
>The MathML 2.0 specification was reviewed extensively during its
>development, as provided by the W3C Process. During end of that period
>the W3C Math Working Group members encouraged implementation using the
>specification and comment on it; a report on Implementation and
>Interoperability experiences and issues has been made public. It is
>intended that this will be updated from time to time by the continuing
>work of the W3C that oversees the MathML 2.0 Recommendation. The W3C
>Math Working Group maintains a public Web page http://www.w3.org/Math/
>which contains further background information.
>
>The preparation of a Second Edition of the MathML 2.0 Specification
>allows the revision of that document to provide a coherent whole
>containing corrections to all the known errata and clarifications of
>some smaller issues that proved problematic. It is not the occasion
>for any fundamental changes in the language MathML 2.0.
>
>This Last Call Working Draft is based on the public interim Working
>Draft, published on 19 December 2002. It incorporates the resolution
>of all issues reported
>on previous drafts.
>
>3. HOW TO SEND COMMENTS
>
>Please send comments and feedback to the public mailing list:
>                   www-math@w3.org
>
>An archive is available at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-math/.
>
>Comments will be added to the Last Call issues list at:
>
>http://www.w3.org/Math/Documents/WD-MathML2-20030411-issues
>
>
>4. END OF REVIEW PERIOD
>
>The Last Call review period ends at 23:59 UTC on 9 May 2003..
>
>5. INTENTIONS OF THE MATH WG
>
>The decision to give this document Last Call status is noted in the
>minutes of Math Working Group teleconference at
>http://www.w3.org/Math/Documents/WD-MathML2-20030411-issues.  As the
>changes in this second edition are largely based upon implementation
>experience and public comment on the existing Recommendation, it is
>anticipated that after the Last Call review period, the next draft of
>this document will be a Proposed Recommendation.
>
>Appendix J provides a revision history.
>
>6. REQUESTED REVIEWS
