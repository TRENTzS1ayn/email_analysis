Im going to keep 'isomorphic' since equivalent means logical 
equivalence in the MT. Isomorphic graphs are logically equivalent, of 
course :-)

@@But I may be able to manage without this definition at all, in 
which case I'll just scrub it. Will check tomorrow.

Would it, in fact? Even if literal values are resources and have 
urirefs, there would still be a syntactic distinction between the 
uriref and the literal itself. Eg numerals aren't urirefs, right?

This has been aired, as you know, and Im sticking by my guns.

No, really, it is an inference rule.

right, it does.

Well, inference rules don't replace; they add.

But it applies to entire graphs, not to triples. Ive added a phrase 
by way of explanation.

Good point. Done, its now in a little section 3.3.1. all on its own

Ive left that since its informative and hardly worth putting

Section 3.4 has been rewritten. I think it is now much tighter and 
harder to misunderstand.

@@We need to get this right. My understanding of the situation is this.

1. lang tags are syntactically legal in typed literals (though I have 
no idea why, it seems like a bloody silly decision for non-XML typed 
literals)

2. Apart from the XML case, they are ignored by the semantics and the 
datatyping. So while the tag might be present in the literal, it is 
ignored and is NOT part of the lexical space of the datatype.

It would if the pair was understood to be the thing in the lexical 
space, but it isn't.

The issue is whether sss is in the space. The ttt is deliberately ignored.

I agree, we need to have a consistent story about this. There is no 
doubt it is a mess whichever way we do it.

FWIW, seems to me that by trying to keep the syntax a wee bit simpler 
we have made everything else a lot more complicated. I would like to 
see lang tags purged from typed  literals altogether, they seem to 
play no useful role, even in XML (since you can always include them 
in the actual XML document-character string, right?).

cover the stuff that Herman introduced, in any case. @@Not done yet,

I decided to just scrub this, its more confusing than helpful.

Thanks for comments and detailed reading.
