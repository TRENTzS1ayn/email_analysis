There are a number of points I have marked in my review [For discussion], 
which means I think they are _potentially_ problematic.  I would be 
slightly uneasy about going to last-call without at least having those 
points checked, but OTOH there's nothing there that is so troublesome that 
it couldn't be checked out during last call.

In summary:  I would prefer [For discussion] points to be checked before 
last call, but would not insist on it.
