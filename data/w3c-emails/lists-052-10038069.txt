We just had a comment on this test case on the rdf comments list:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0043.html
and this means an approved test case needs to be corrected to match
the rdf/xml grammar.

This result:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test003.nt

needs the following change:

15c15
< _:j88096 <http://example.org/prop1> "" .
---
> _:j88096 <http://example.org/prop1> :j88097 .

to match http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#emptyPropertyElt
where when both rdf:ID and rdf:bagID are both present, the statement
value is a blank node (the "Otherwise" clause) not an empty literal.

The good news:

[[P.s.Using SWI-Prolog from the CVS snapshot it processes the rest of
the test-suite properly now.]]

So that makes nearly 4 full implementations of the parser test cases
(detailed evidence for this will have to be collected).
