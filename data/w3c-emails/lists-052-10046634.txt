WebOnt asked me to ensure that RDF Core was sufficiently aware of the 
importance webont attach to the issue raised by the OWL Semantics' editor 
concerning the semantics of literals in RDF.

The details can be found at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0014.html

further discussion, including how this impacts OWL semantics is at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003Jan/0093.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003Jan/0171.html

My understanding is that this is a critical issue that should be fixed 
before we move semantics to last call.

The best outcome for webont would be that Pat and Peter discuss the 
problem, agree a resolution, and this is reflected in the RDF Semantics 
Last Call (and also the OWL Semantics Last Call).

A minimal outcome is that RDF Core replies to Peter's comments soon to 
indicate what will, or will not, be done in the RDF Semantics Last Call, so 
that Peter can take whatever action is necessary in the OWL Semantics Last 
Call.

While my personal understanding of this issue is limited, it does seem to 
me to be in the showstopper category that merits attention despite the 
near-freeze on our documents.
