Sorry Dave, I am having difficulty reconciling what you say here, with your 
message to Jan on the comments list.

I had given him a zip of the current W3C CVS, and I believe he had picked 
up the change you made (on Friday?) to make the object a literal not a 
blank node.

My understanding of the approved test is that the object is a blank node, 
and that there are no literals in this test case.

If this differs from yours we need to discuss it.

In particular I disagree with:
[[

Revision : 1.2
Date : 2002/12/18 11:31:28
Author : 'jgrant'
State : 'Exp'
Lines : +2 -2
Description :
Raptor fix: this now gives an empty literal, not a bnode.
]]

Revision 1.1 was correct and did not fixing.

Jeremy
