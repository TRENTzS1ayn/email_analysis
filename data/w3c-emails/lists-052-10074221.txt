But when?  That isn't much use without a date.  Jan [Grant] makes
snapshots as zips available and puts them in the CVS for the WDs.

and the change was wrong, as I said in the subject of this message.

and the fix restores that.  If you read the diff in the messsage I
sent you will see it replaces the empty literal object with a blank
node.

No.

This change was made nearly a month ago and as I just emailed,
I am proposing a patch to correct it.

Can you confirm the change I proposed to the version in CVS now fixes
it.  Please can you explicitly state that the test is approved if
that change is made.
