Brian--

A couple of questions:

1. Peter Patel-Schneider made the following comment about the references
section of the Primer:

> It is very weird that a non-normative document has normative references

I recall asking about this distinction (as far as the Primer went) but
don't recall getting an answer.  I had been using "normative" references
to refer to those that were normative as to RDF and RDFS (and specs we
*use*, such as URIs and XML), but not to those that were normative as
far as RDF applications were concerned (like PRISM;  the PRISM specs are
normative for PRISM, but not for RDF).  However, I'm not clear as to
whether there is a separate concept of "normative as to a given
document", which Peter's comment seems to imply.  Do you have any
opinion on this?

2.  Is there specific boilerplate text we should be using in the "Status
of this Document" section for the Last Call drafts (or should I just
concoct something similar to what is now in the Concepts and Syntax LCC
versions)?
