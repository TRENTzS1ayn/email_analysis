I personally think we have 'new information' [1] in that the reagle decision 
allows a simplish resolution of pfps-08 to align XMLLiteral with the other 
datatypes, which then means that the lang tag would never be used on type 
literals and could be purged. I guess that procedurally that would be 
reopening reagle-01, reagle-02, pfps-08 - and it might be better to get on 
with the other issues first. (Even superficially related ones, such as 
danc-0? goofy literals, are orthogonal).
