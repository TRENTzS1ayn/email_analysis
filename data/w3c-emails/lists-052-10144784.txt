The LCC version of the RDF Semantics as referenced on the RDF Core WG home
page, at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/,
*explicitly* does not make the class extension of rdfs:Literal have
any relationship whatsoever to LV.  There is even an entire section of the
document on the non-relationship between ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) and LV.

This decoupling of ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) and LV causes lots of problems,
as detailed in a message I sent to RDF comments
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0014.html).
