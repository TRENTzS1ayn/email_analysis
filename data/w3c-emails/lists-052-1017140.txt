Is it possible to say less yet still sufficiently address this issue?

by the URIref as it might occur in the RDF document identified 
by the URI part.

I think that the minor edit of removing the statement that a URIref
denotes a "view" or "fragment" of an RDF document (which is IMO
in most cases not true) and simply saying that the interpretation of
the URIref is the same as it would be if the base URI were an RDF
document and the URIref occurs in that RDF document (which is what
I think is all we really should say) addresses the issue of how
the MIME type affects the interpretation of the fragment identifier
without having to posit some kind of "view" or "fragment" nature
to the resource denoted by the URIref.
