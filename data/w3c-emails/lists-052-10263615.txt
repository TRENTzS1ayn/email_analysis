It was my understanding (or misunderstanding) that the WG
had decided that the class extension of rdfs:Literal corresponded
to those things denoted by literal nodes in the graph. The
only odd man out being things (presumably) denoted by well
formed but semantically invalid typed literals.

I guess this needs clarification ASAP, and probably some
revision of the MT.

Pat?
