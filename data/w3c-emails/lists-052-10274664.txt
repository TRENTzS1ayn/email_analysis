I see no reason to constrain objects of rdfs:seeAlso to web
accessible resources. I would consider it acceptable to
refer to e.g. a person, organization, printed book, etc.
as a related resource.

The nature of the associated resources can be described 
further, to clarify whether they are web accessible etc.
