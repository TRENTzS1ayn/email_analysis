Not a show stopper, but still a big nit...

This still IMO reads that "any XML Schema datatype" rather than "any
datatype that conforms to the definition of an rdfs:Datatype".

Perhaps:

[[
RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes 
[XML-SCHEMA2], and may be used with any datatype definition that follows 
this model, even if not actually defined in terms of XML Schema. A datatype 
consists of a lexical space, a value space and a datatype mapping.
]]
