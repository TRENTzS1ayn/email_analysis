Dave,

Great review.  Thanks for all the detailed comments.

As noted below most of formatting/linking/typo errors now fixed.

Will take after last call.

Done

consider after last call

No longer.

I wasn't planning to.

After last call.

I'm tempted to just delete the sentence.  After last call.

after last call

Fixed

Can't find one!

That's a case where the term rdfs:Class is used in the section defining 
rdfs:Class.  I had a policy of not linking sections to themselves 
throughout.  I claim it is consistent (but maybe wrong).

Fixed.

Not needed here.

<tt> fixed.  others would be same section references.

Nope.  That would be for the primer.

After last call.

There are a lot like that.  fixed.

fixed

same section reference

same section reference

Changed; naughty of me; its not really a typo.

I consider it normative.

done

Decided not to.

Too cute.  Meant to take it out.  Fix in last call.

address in last call

pointed to example

We have a terminology problem here.  The class is called rdf:List.

address in last call.

fixed.

Nope.

address in last call.

Thought I'd fixed that.  Found one that I missed and fixed.  Consider it a 
typo :)

Address after last call.  Didn't want to get into that in this doc; left it 
to the primer.


>5.3.1

Done

>  and 'predicate of an RDF statement'

that was already done.  haven't linked them all - just the first one


>[is statement==triple ?]

No.  I had hoped that was clear.  Address in last call.  We'll get lots of 
comments on this section anyway.

Now marked as informative.


Yes.

Yes, maybe later.
