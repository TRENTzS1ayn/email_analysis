To: Graham Klyne<GK@NineByNine.org>, RDF core WG<w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org>


Graham,

Thanks for the review.  Detailed comments below.  Out of this, I think 
there is one change I think should be made before last call and that is the 
comment on XMLLiteral should become:

   [[
     The class of XML literals values.
]]

Brian

I agree.

The text says:

[[The class rdfs:Literal is the class of literal values such as strings and 
integers.]]

That seems pretty open ended to me.

I think we can take this as word smithing in last call.

Lets see in last call how many folks get confused.  I find your 
misunderstanding rather hard to understand, but we might come up with 
clearer text later.

I don't understand this comment.  The semantics of domain and range are 
pretty clear, no?  I think its a mistake to start speculating about folks 
misunderstandings.  Thats a game we could play forever.

The 'stating' is consistent with the language used throughout this 
document.  I'm inclined to leave it alone or change all of it, and I don't 
want to change all of it at this stage.

I agree it should the class of xml literal values.  I recommend we fix that 
before it goes.
