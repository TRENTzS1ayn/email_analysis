Jan,

In the light of your comments, I propose the following changes to the last 
call candidate:

strike:

[[As such, RDF data can resemble an entity-relationship diagram.]]

strike:

[[
Note that if a class were the same thing as the set of its instances
then common (Zermelo-Fraenkel) set theory would prevent it being an
instance of itself.]]

replace:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_range

[[states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is an
instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the objects of triples whose
predicate is P are instances of the class C.]]

with

[[states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is an
instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the resources denoted by objects 
of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.]]

replace
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_domain

[[states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is a 
instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the subjects of triples whose 
predicate is P are instances of the class C.]]

with

[[states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is a 
instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the resources denoted by subjects 
of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.]]

replace
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_subclassof

[[...is used to state that one class is a specialization of another.]]

with

[[ ... is used to state that all the instances of one class are instances 
of another.]]

replace
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_subpropertyof

[[The property rdfs:subPropertyOf is an instance of rdf:Property that is 
used to specify that one property is a specialization of another.]]

with

[[The property rdfs:subPropertyOf is an instance of rdf:Property that is 
used to specify that all resources related by one property are also related 
by another.]]

I tend to agree about striking that sentence.

Again, I'm tempted to agree and would suggest it goes now.

That is not what we have decided.

Fixed

There is a use/mention error there.  That should be "the objects of 
statements ..." since the object of a triple is a URI.  I propose fix 
before last call.

OK, I'll ignore it.

fixed

Right. That should be fixed.

Not by RDFS, but I don't want to draw attention to it.

We are going nowhere near that.  Way outside our charter.
