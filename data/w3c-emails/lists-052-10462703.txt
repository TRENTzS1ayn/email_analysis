Technically, it's not what "the web" considers to be named by the 
URIref, it's what the "owner" of the URIref considers to be named by it. 
  Also, there isn't really a problem when the "owner's" interpretation 
of a URIref as far as RDF is concerned ("it identifies my home page") is 
the same as the (HTTP)web's interpretation of that URIref when you plug 
it into a browser ("it identifies a web page"), right?  It's just the 
case when the URIref is "overloaded" that creates the issue.

I don't know that the Primer is all that explicit about shooting it 
down.  The Primer (in Section 2.3) points out that when a URIref is 
overloaded like this, it creates some ambiguity, and (in Appendix A) 
points out that although this is a convention that is sometimes used, 
RDF (per se) doesn't *assume* this convention.

Certainly I agree that the link between RDF (and OWL, and ...) and the 
original Web (the one consisting of resources that can be retrieved if 
they have http URIrefs) is really important, and needs to be thoroughly 
worked out.  However, I think we've done our job if we point out the 
issue (Concepts has some text on this too).  I don't see this as an 
abdication of responsibility:  we haven't been given the responsibility 
to deal with this, and there may be ways of doing so that we haven't 
thought of yet, so I don't think we ought to be seen to be biasing the 
future direction.  I seem to recall Tim Bray, among others, not being 
overly disturbed about this situation.  Again calling on my memory, I 
believe he thinks additional descriptive information *about* the URIref 
as being a way to handle this, and I think he has a point.  This could 
be considered an issue of the "role" the URIref was playing, and roles 
could be described in RDF.

I agree that "it's not our job" doesn't suffice as an *answer* (and as 
I've said above, I agree with you about the importance of this), but it 
is in fact the  truth.  It's also not our job to designate whose 
responsibility it is, and in a sense it would be misleading for us to do 
so.  What you might consider doing as a thought-experiment is thinking 
about what text you would like to see in RDF documents that fully 
resolves this issue to your satisfaction, and then thinking about 
whether the rest of the W3C would think it an appropriate action of the 
RDF Core WG to appear to commit the W3C to those things in its 
specifications.  Alternatively, if you can come up with text that at 
least identifies the issue more clearly than what we currently say, we 
could certainly consider inserting it in appropriate documents during 
Last Call.

One man's opinion.
