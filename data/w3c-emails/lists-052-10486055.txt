Pat has managed to get an updated LCC semantics doc to me.  It seemed best 
to load it immediately to the website, which I have done.

There are no accompanying change notes, so I'm not sure what's 
changed.  However, based on my conversation with him, I'm expecting that:

   o he has fixed the problem Peter raised about rdfs:Literal
   o he has made at least one other change in response to a comment from Jan.

Peter, could you take a look and see if it does indeed resolve the issue 
you raised?

Other reviewers, could you check any critical issues you raised are dealt with.

Brian
