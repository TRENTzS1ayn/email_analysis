I've updated the previous draft materials below
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/
with the changes previously emailed.

This corresponds to CVS 1.462 of
http://cvs.ilrt.org/cvsweb/redland/rdfcore/syntax/index.html

I've updated the status and abstract somewhat to last call words,
dates, to be lightly edited near @@s in order to ship it and done the
usual pubrules checking and tidying.

I changed all the RDF Core WD urls to be in the
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/ area so a global
change from http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/ to /TR/
would fix them.  The "This version" link will have to be fixed by
hand.

Hopefully that'll do.

Cheers

Dave
