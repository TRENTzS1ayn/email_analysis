Unfortunately, IL is inconsistently defined for rdf:XMLLiteral

In Section 3.1 there is

if ... IL("xxx"^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is the XML canonical form of xxx
if ... IL("xxx"@yyy^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is the XML canonical form of
xxx with the language tag yyy

In Section 3.4 there is

for any typed literal L of the form "sss"^^ddd or "sss"@ttt^^ddd in
G, if I(ddd) is in D and "sss" ("sss"@ttt) is a valid lexical form
for I(ddd), then IL(L) = L2V(I(ddd))(sss)

which is inconsitent for rdf:XMLLiteral as long as there is any
langauge-tagged XML document whose canonical form depends on the language
tag.

(I have actually fixed up the semantic rule.  As it is actually stated, it
doesn't even make sense.)
