Hmm.

Actually, it might be OK, but only because of the wording outside of the
conditions that the extra conditions are ``on all datatypes other than the
built-in datatype''.  This wording is cryptic in the extreme.  There also
needs to be some clarification here as to whether datatypes are members of the
domain or URI references.

The individual conditions in the table need to have the exclusion
explicitly and individually stated by something link, ``if I(ddd) is in
D-I(rdf:XMLLiteral)''.  However, adding this exclusion to the fourth
condition would require adding a subclass relationship between
rdf:XMLLiteral and rdfs:Literal (which should, in any case, go into RDFS
interpretations).

Otherwise, however, these extra conditions *require* that 

IL("..."@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral) = L2V(I(rdf:XMLLiteral))("...")

and

IL("..."@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral) = L2V(I(rdf:XMLLiteral))("...")

which requires that the denotation of XML literals be independant of the
language tag.

The translation to Lbase ignores language tags for all typed literals.

Agreed.
