From CONCEPTS:

A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language
identifier.

which can be read ambiguously. Either as,

... is a string optionally combined with a language identifier
(ie, a plain literal is from { x | x a string } union
{ (x, y) | x a string & y a language identifier }

or as,

... is from { (x, y) | x a string & y a language identifier
or "the null language identifier" }


If you read it as the former, and you're asking questions about
RDFS+D(xsd:string)-satisfiability, and if you have a classic
set-theoretic intuition about the equality of character sequences (ie,
no intension or type tag as "part" of the denoted value), then it would
appear that the answer to your test case is, "yes".

No, using either reading of the definition of a literal in CONCEPTS.

Following the link, section 6.5 of CONCEPTS would seem to support the
first reading of that sentence. So your question of satisfiability has
then to be answered by looking at your definition (and XSD's defintion)
of a "string", that is, a "character sequence".
