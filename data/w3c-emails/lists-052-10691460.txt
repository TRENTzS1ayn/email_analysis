Peter,  I missed your previous comment.  Thanks for raising it again.

Brian,

I think this should be fixed in LCC if possible;  if not I've noted it in 
my issues list anyway, so it doesn't fall through the cracks.

Details...

[RFC-3066]
RFC 3066 - Tags for the Identification of Languages, H. Alvestrand, IETF, 
January 2001. This document is http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3066.txt.

the phrase "RFC 3066 - Tags for the Identification of Languages" is 
hyperlinked to "http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2279.txt".

The hyperlink *should* be to "http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3066.txt"

Brian,

this raises a general comment about RFC citations, which we (or you as 
series editor) might want to consider as a cleanup item in the last-call 
period.

Proposed above is a minimal change, but I note that we're not very 
consistent about which of the several URLs we might use for linking to 
RFCs; e.g.
   http://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt
   ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3066.txt
   http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt
   http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3066.txt
all return the same document.

As all RFCs are published by the RFC editor, it might be argued that the 
rfc-editor.org URL (HTTP flavour) is a better choice.  That is also the 
(HTTP) URL ultimately used by the RFC editor's search service.

Should we care about this?
