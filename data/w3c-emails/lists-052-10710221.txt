Yes

My recollection is that the WG discussed this at a telecon and agreed to 
arrange things to that it would be possible that a plain literal without a 
lang tag could denote a member of the value space of xsd:string, i.e. we 
agreed that a plain literal with a lang tag did not denote a pair with a 
null lang tag, but just denoted a string.

If this needs clarifying, I suggest we do so in last call, and as Patrick 
says, as part of clarifying the class hierarchy of xsd datatypes.
