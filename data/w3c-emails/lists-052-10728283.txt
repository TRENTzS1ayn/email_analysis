The above is satisfiable in just about any version of the RDF semantics.
 In simple entailment and RDF entailment, rdfs:range has no built-in
meaning.  In RDFS entailment, xsd:string is an uninterpreted class.   In
XSD datatype entailment, the class extension of xsd:string consists of
the data values of the XSD string datatype, which includes strings.

If you had said,  "abc"@"fr" on the other hand, it would not be
satisfiable under XSD datatype entailment.

The rationale given is incorrect in any case.

In XSD datatype entailment it does, because the value space of  XSD
strings is defined as finite-length sequences of characters which are
RDF strings.  In XSD datatype entailment, both "abc" and
"abc"^^xsd:string denote the sequence with elements 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

(Well actually the RDF MT is broken here, but the only reasonable fix
here would make this so.)

Here the *only* problem is that the value space of XSD strings does not
include pairs of strings and language tags.

I note that the reference to RFC 3066 is not yet fixed in RDF Concepts.
