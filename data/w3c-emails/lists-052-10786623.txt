Gentlemen,

We are scheduled to take a last call vote Friday.

This, I think is our current status.

   - syntax:     required changes applied
   - concepts:   required changes applied
   - test cases: required changes applied?
   - primer:     reviews in and no critical issues
   - schema:     reviews in and required changes proposed

   - semantics:  reviews in and critical issues addressed

Graham and Jan's issues are fixed in the current version.  Reading Peter's 
latest post,

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0091.html

[[Actually, it might be OK, but only because of the wording outside of the
conditions that the extra conditions are ``on all datatypes other than the
built-in datatype''.  This wording is cryptic in the extreme.  There also
needs to be some clarification here as to whether datatypes are members of the
domain or URI references.]]

my interpretation is that there may be some further clarification needed, 
but that can be done during last call.

   - LBase has been ready to go for a while

It would be helpful if the schema reviewers could indicate by email that 
the proposed changes are acceptable and deal with their issues.

Brian
