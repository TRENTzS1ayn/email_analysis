I think that's a good point.  We have had three reviewers go through it, so 
I think its close to our intent, but your sharp eyes have identified some 
issues.  One of the issues may be that we have looked at it so often.  We 
are not seeing it with fresh eyes.  One of the reasons I think we need to 
get more eyes on it.

I note your later post where you point out this may be covered but need 
clearer explanation, if I understand you correctly.

I'm currently inclined to deal with this in last call, but we will discuss 
this at Friday's telecon.

Hmm, that's a shame.  However, again I think of these as editorial errors 
and suggest that we take those that we can't do as a quick fix, as last 
call issues.

Right.  Its been ready for a while, we've just been prioritizing other 
things.  Publication is already approved - we just need to crank up the 
publishing machine.
