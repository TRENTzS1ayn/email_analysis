Thanks for remembering this.

I vaguely remember some discussion, but I did not recall a resolution.

I think it does need clarifying, and that doing so during last call is fine.

But, I think (given the way the MT is written) the abstract syntax needs to 
be clearer
about what a plain literal *is*, separately from clarifying the xsd 
datatype hierarchy.

(I think the xsd:string definition is quite clear about what it's values 
are;  I think we need to match that clarity -- see my original message [1], 
particularly the references)

I've added this to my issue list.
