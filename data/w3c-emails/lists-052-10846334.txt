re
13: LBase Document
2002-11-01#16  danbri  team contact for publishinging LBase note

http://www.w3.org/2002/06/lbase/20030116Snapshot.html is ready to roll. I've tweaked 
it in various dull ways to make it W3C publication-rule compliant (css, 
xhtml, link check, mandatory stuff in headers). 

One thing is left to do: the Abstract mentions 
RDF, RDFS, OWL and needs hyperlinking to the References section, which needs appropriate
links and text for each of those. 

Currently the citations are 
[[
[OWL] F. van Harmelen, P. F. Patel-Schneider, Ian Horrocks (editors), Reference Description of the DAML+OIL (March 2001) ontology markup language

[RDF] O. Lassila, Ralph R. Swick (editors), Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification, 22 February 1999.

[RDFS] D. Brickley, R.V. Guha (editors), @@@TODO: update reference.@@@ Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schema Specification 1.0, 27 March 2000 (W3C Candidate Recommendation).
]]

...these need updating to more appropriate/timely links / entries. 

Here we get into document synching issues, and I wonder whether to move the lbase 
directory over into shadow TR space. I'm not quite sure how to reference RDF, RDFS and 
OWL: do we want to point to the last call version (url to be determined), etc. Do we 
want to cite all 6 specs?

Apart from that, all is good to go.

Dan
