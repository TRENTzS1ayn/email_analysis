The XML Schema group would prefer us to use the term "lexical mapping" instead 
of "datatype mapping".

I see no reason why not, and so PROPOSE that we accept xmlsch-03 and action 
all the editors to look for the term "datatype mapping" and replace it with 
"lexical mapping".
[[
    We agree that it is useful to define a term to denote such mappings;
    in the interests of inter-specification consistency, we wonder whether
    you would be willing to consider using the term lexical mapping, which
    we are introducing in our forthcoming draft of XML Schema 1.1. The
    term datatype mapping seems unlikely to be usable in the XML Schema
    specification, where it would suggest to some readers a mapping from
    one datatype to another, rather than as here a mapping from lexical
    space to value space. (XML Schema 1.0 got by without a term for this
    concept.)
]]


Two reasons we might have for not accepting are:

1) it may be quite a large editorial change in terms of number of bytes
2) if we decide that our whitespace treatment is sufficiently different from 
XML Schema's that we should use a different term
