At risk of repeating myself, I still think there's a lack of clarify here, 
when all relevant documents are read together.

The above text can be read that a character string may be some part of a 
literal, so a literal is not actually a character string.  Later, the same 
document says that for a plain literal, I(E)=E, so whatever a plain literal 
may be in the abstract syntax is also its denotation.

In view of Jeremy's comment, I think the WG intent is that a plain literal 
without a language tag denotes a Unicode character string.  In light of 
I(E)=E, that means said literal in the abstract syntax must be a Unicode 
character string.  I don't think that's clear.  It wouldn't take much to 
make it so.

I'm not yet fully understanding what fix Peter Patel-Schneider is 
requesting, but I suspect that whatever that is may also clarify this 
matter in some way.
