[following your discussion with Herman]

Although it is the case that
{{?X rdf:type ?A} => {?X rdf:type ?B}} => {?A rdfs:subClassOf ?B}.
I fail to see what an engine could ever do with that...
Suppose it only has following facts loaded
:Pat rdf:type :Human.
:Pat rdf:type :American.
:Peter rdf:type :American.
does that then mean that it can conclude
:Human rdfs:subClassOf :American?
Of course not, as that would be nonmonotonic,
but what else could it do? What am I missing?
