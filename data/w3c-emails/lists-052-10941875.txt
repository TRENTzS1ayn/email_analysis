I think we should say something like "rdf:XMLLiteral denotes a datatype".

Hmmm... I think we've understood in discussion that we don't expect *all* 
XSD datatypes to be recognized, but I'm not sure if the limitation here is 
adequately expressed anywhere.

I'm not sure I fully understand this, but the final suggestion seems 
reasonable to me.
