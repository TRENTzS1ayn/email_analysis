Brian--

I don't wish to unnecessarily raise process issues, but as I read
Section 5.2.2 of the process document, where point number two says that
one of the entrance criteria is:

"formally address all issues raised by Working Group participants, other
Working Groups, the Membership, and the public about the Working Draft"

I don't believe Primer technically meets this criterion (assuming I'm
interpreting it properly), since I have not yet responded to PPS's Dec.
27 set of comments about the Primer LCC.  I'm in the process of
composing a response, but the comments were rather extensive, and I
haven't completely decided what to say I'm going to do about all of them
yet.  Sorry if this creates a complication.
