If the test case LCC is approved for publication then I will be
generating new zip files of the "current state of play" test cases. A
link to this will be the only change made to the document itself prior
to LC publication - although I think there's WG support for the approval
of the remaining pending test cases. If that's also the case (confirm at
telecon?) I'll change their status prior AND the summary table in the
document prior to publication.
