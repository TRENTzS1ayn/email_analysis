rdf:XMLLiteral denotes the datatype. It is not itself the datatype.
It is a URIref.

I'm not really sure what your saying here.

I'm not aware of any XML Schema datatype that does not conform
to the definition of rdfs:Datatype.

Can you be more specific?

This doesn't make sense to me. A URIref is a name. It denotes 
something. A name is not part of the thing it denotes. It is
fully concievable that there can be multiple URIrefs that denote
the same datatype, just as there can be e.g. multiple URIrefs
that denote the city of Paris, France. A URIref denoting the
city of Paris is not part of the city of Paris.

Further, one can use OWL mechanisms to express such equality
of denotation if in fact multiple URIrefs denote the same
datatype.

I would consider the inclusion of the URIref as part of the
datatype definition a mistake.
