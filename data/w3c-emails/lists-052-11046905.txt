Brian--

My problem here is that I'm not sure to what extent my judgement and
Peter's are consistent as to what is "critical".  I actually don't think
any of them are critical as far as going to last call is concerned, but
obviously he may disagree.  Some of them are clearly editorial, or
clarifying points he thinks may mislead people, and of those, some of
them I can see he has a point about and intend to try to address (in
some cases after last call), and am saying so.  Some of them I need
further guidance from him on (and am saying that).  He's said it's
misleading to start off using an example that describes a Web page
(because it actually has a URL, and this mixes up the usage of URIs as
abstract identifiers and as things that can actually be retrieved), but
I did that for what I think are pedagogical reasons (I wanted to
introduce the idea of URIs to identify things, and people are used to
URIs identifying web pages, so I start with that).  If I have to change
that, it means some substantial rewriting.  Similarly, he doesn't like
the appearance of the material on containers and reification, and the
discussion of "intended meaning" but we've been through that and I don't
think we plan to change it now (besides it being in Semantics the last
time I looked).  I can, of course, further amplify on the fact that
these are just suggested conventions if necessary (but I thought I was
pretty clear on that already). He's also said he wants datatypes used
more in the examples;  I can do that (although I was trying to avoid too
much of that, because it makes the RDF/XML look really ugly without
introducing entities, which I didn't want to do, and I wanted to get
across the idea that the RDF/XML was really not too bad).  My intent is
to formally address, in the sense of respond to, all his comments (but
not necessarily agree with all of them).  I'm was just reporting that I
haven't done that yet.
