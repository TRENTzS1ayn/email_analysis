If that's the case (and your position seems reasonable) then I don't see
that we have any choice but to include the language tag contents in the
L2V mapping for all datatypes, OR to drop it from XMLLiteral.

The reason why PFPS was suggesting that the URIRef be made a part of the
datatype definition was (as far as I can tell) so that we can ensure
XMLLiteral gets a separate treatment. I would much rather remove this -
clearly awkward - special case and give a regular treatment to all
datatypes.
