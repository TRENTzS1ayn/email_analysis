Now I see the utility, that is a nice rule for OWL
[[
added http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/owl-rules#rule8s7 thanks to Jeremy
]]
so we had
{ :rule3r1. ?R owl:onProperty ?P; owl:hasValue ?Y. ?X a ?R } => { ?X ?P ?Y
}.
{ :rule9r2. ?R owl:onProperty ?P; owl:hasValue ?Y. ?X ?P ?Y } => { ?X a ?R
}.
and now added
{ :rule8s7. ?A owl:onProperty rdf:type; owl:hasValue ?B } => { ?A
rdfs:subClassOf ?B }.

Any other cases?

Not sure if this is relevant but, ...

in OWL full

<a> rdf:type owl:Restriction .
<a> owl:onProperty rdf:type .
<a> owl:hasValue <b> .

entails

<a> rdfs:subClassOf <b> .

by this rule.

(in fact the OWL Full expression could be seen as a definition of
subClassOf)
