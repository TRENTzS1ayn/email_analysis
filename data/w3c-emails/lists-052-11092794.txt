I object to the proposed datatypes solution. It is overly-complex, 
requiring RDF processors to understand a large system of datatypes and 
their relations. (It also has many edge-cases that are likely to cause 
more of the problems and incompatibilities this WG was chartered to 
fix.) It is backwards-incompatible, requiring all software with RDF 
data structures to be changed.

I support the rdfs:format datatypes proposal of Dan Connolly:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0031.html
It is simple, elegant, and fully backwards-compatible.

I also support the null datatypes proposal.
