  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0065.html 
]

APPROVED: WG confirmed there are no changes required for Primer LCWD.


8: Schema

Last Call Candidate:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0071.html

Some changes proposed:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0068.html
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0078.html

Reviewers are happy with the changes proposed and DanBri considered
that there were no other comments considered critical.

Discussion of where/if rdf:XMLLiteral was defined as a datatype and
need to check if in schema/concepts WD and fix it:

ACTION 2003-01-17#2 bwm: check that it is clear that rdf:XMLLiteral
  is a URI or a datatype.


APPROVED: WG confirmed there are no changes required for Schema LCWD.


9: Concepts Doc

Last call candidate:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/

GK confirms the final changes have been made. 
Discussion of definition of literals in concepts versus that in
semantics and various pointers.  JanG noted section 6.5 of LC concepts:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#sectioan-Graph-Literal
which is section describing literals.  Agreement it could be polished
a bit more.

Brian suggested:
  The WG should be as clear as possible can about the
  denotation of a plain literal and work out later on how it relates to
  xsd:string during LC process
which was confirmed as acceptible. MikeD saw this as acceptible and
critical to answer since he had been hearing questions about the
relationship between an RDF literal and string.
       
APPROVED: WG confirmed there are no changes required for Concepts LCWD
(apart from that required by ACTION 2003-01-17#2)
