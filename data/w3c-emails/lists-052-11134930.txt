I am now also assuming that a plain literal is an xsd:string
and I'm conviced by Peter and by DanC and by the fact
that it is working
so we then have that the empty kb entails "khk" a xsd:string
and that :jenny :age "11" entails :jenny :age "11"^^xsd:string
and vice versa

(there is then also no need anymore for a class rdfs:PlainLiteral)
