I don't know what people are planning on doing to track LC comments, but
assuming that editors are going to (potentially) want to merge fixes
into a working copy as comments come in, can we agree a change-control
process for that? Ie, a space where the "post-LC" version lives.

PS. In the absence of anything else, we might also want a per-document
page pointing to messages in the comments archive, but that's a detail.
