No. See below.

The 'antecedent' of this inference rule amounts to the existence of a 
subproof  of x type B from x type A, with the variable in place. (In 
fact it doesnt have to be a variable, as long as the subproof doesnt 
use any other antecedents which mention the particular subject, since 
then the subject could be changed and the same derivation would 
work); and this entire subproof is the reason this must follow for 
ANY x, hence the final conclusion.

This isn't a closure rule, but it is a valid inference rule. 
Searching for inferences like this make life hard for implementers, 
though, which is why hardly anyone directly implements natural 
deduction systems (except maybe for proof *checkers*). So the task I 
have is to show that this proof rule isnt actually needed since 
rdfs12 covers the only way it could be used, so RDFS can be fully 
captured using only closure rules.
