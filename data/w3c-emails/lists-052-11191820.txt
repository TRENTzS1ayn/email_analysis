Though note that after a significant amount of internal discussion
and debate, we decided not to formally oppose the present
solution, and the chair was notified of that. Though there 
remains a strong degree of dissatisfaction in certain aspects of

in the need to recode large amounts of existing content and
the lack of a mechanism for implicit datatyping).
