Patrick,

Thanks for the clarification.  If I read that correctly, you are saying 
that Nokia has NOT raised a formal objection to the datatyping solution 
adopted and therefore I am currently planning not to reference the message 
identified above.  I do think it would be appropriate to encourage feedback 
on the datatyping solution in particular, as it has caused the WG most 
difficulty.

Brian
