I've copied Lbase draft Note into shadow TR space, and am 
fixing up the references section to cite our later docs.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/NOTE-lbase-20030117/

Also need to update the lbase axioms, copy from (@@url?) PatH's 
latest Semantics doc. Talking of which, where do I find
Pat's refined version?
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0147.html
doesn't tell me. To my knowledge, the shadow TR versoin hasn't 
had these updates yet.

Pat, I can update w3.org if you give me the file...
