I consider this ready to go, and expect to make a publication request 
as soon as I get the (already requested) W3C Director's go-ahead.

I have replaced section 3 with updated material from Pat, fixing HTML and formatting 
bugs. Pat, can you confirm that pt 3 was the only bit you changed, since I have 
only copied that bit in from your last email'd snapshot.
