Eric--

The revised version of the Primer based on the results of the Friday 
telecon is at http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-20030119.html

I think it's ready to go.

I've made some (but not all) of the changes suggested in the three 
RDFCore reviews (basically, I haven't yet made those involving major 
changes to examples or figures), and some changes based on PPS's 
comments (most of those will require some additional thought as to the 
necessary wording changes, and/or feedback from Peter).

I've also added some links to definitions in the Concepts spec at 
various places (possibly creating cross-ref problems until we get all 
the LC documents together), corrected a bunch of misspellings, and 
updated the copyright statement (and the various associated links) based 
on the results of a pubrules check of the December 17 version which 
showed all kinds of obsolete stuff in there.  I've *not* updated the 
references to the latest dated versions of the normative documents.

Let me know if you need me to do anything else immediately.
