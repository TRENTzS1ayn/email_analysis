As far as I can see, "rdf:XMLLiteral" is a string, rdf:XMLLiteral is a
QName that is used in RDF as if it was a URI reference, and
I(rdf:XMLLiteral), for I some RDF interpretation, is a resource.
It thus appears to me that it is the RDF Semantics document that is making
a use/mention confusion when it refers to rdf:XMLLiteral as a datatype.
Of course, there is nothing against a resource being a URI reference, but I
don't think that that is the intent.

Well, perhaps, but I would think that the RDF Core WG would like to have it
be that XSD-interpretations actually make sense.

From Section 3.4,

     In any XSD-interpretation, any uriref of the form
     http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#sss will be understood to denote the
     datatype named sss in [XML-SCHEMA2].

What then does http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#FOO denote?

Sure you can do this, but is this sort of thing part of Datatyped
interpretations?  If so, what is the form of the documents that make the
connection?  If not, then how can I, in datatyped RDF, make the connection
between http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/myexample#octalinteger and
the datatype that turns octal numeral strings into integers in the usual
way?  I don't see any way, in RDF, of so doing.

Well then, how can I, in datatyped RDF, arrange it so that 

"10"^^http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/myexample#octalinteger

denotes the integer usually written as 8?   If I can't, then what use is
RDF datatyping?

Then what good is RDF datatyping?

Well the difference would be that in a D-interpretation with a datatype
<u,l,v,l2v>, the denotion of the URI reference u would be that datatype.
