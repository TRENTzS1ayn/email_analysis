I have made two comments [2],[3] on this new WD [1] that the WG may wish to
endorse, or follow up on.

The relevant text is:
[[
3.1.2 Desiderata
3.1.2.2 Systematic treatment of fundamental facets (RQ-24)
Make the treatment of fundamental facets more systematic. Define canonical
forms for all types, and specify the rules for generating the canonical
form, given a value. Clarify the status of anySimpleType and define its
value space (if any). Clarify the assignment of types to nodes in the
absence of relevant schema components. Distinguish our identity relation
from the mathematical relation of quantitative equality.
]]

and

[[
2.5.1 Desiderata
2.5.1.1 First class objects (RQ-23)
Define an algorithm for generating a URI for any construct in a schema (or,
possibly, in a schema document), thus making schema constructs first-class
objects in the Web. Minimally the algorithm should cover element( type)s,
attributes, simple types, complex types, and notations. Optionally it may
also cover other constructs such as named groups and items in enumerations
of legal values.
