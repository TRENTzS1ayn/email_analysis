Are XML Schema datatyping facets meant here? If so, then
this is outside the scope of RDF datatyping. RDF datatyping
does not provide mechanisms for defining datatypes, only
for denoting datatypes and associating lexical forms with
datatypes to unambiguously denote a datatype value. How
a given datatype is defined, e.g. whether it is with XML
Schema or some other framework, is irrelevant to RDF.

> Define canonical

NO. Definitely not. If a datatype defines canonical forms, fine,
but RDF Datatyping does not require them. They are insignificant
to the the semantics and therefore such a requirement would not
be justified and would preclude the use of datatypes with RDF
which do not define canonical lexical forms.

This is a datatype specific function completely outside the scope
of RDF datatyping and should not be addressed in the RDF specs.

RDF does not say anything about any particular datatype. This
is for the XML Schema WG to define, and/or to be addressed in
a separate Note addressing XML Schema datatyping issues in RDF.

I would expect, though, that the class extension of xsd:anySimpleType
would be equivalent to the membership of rdfs:Literal.

Default types? Other than rdf:Resource? I don't understand this
one.

Ummm, XPointer?
