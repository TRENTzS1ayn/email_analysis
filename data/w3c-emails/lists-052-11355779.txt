:)

Of course this is encouraging, but I'm not sure how many of them both
accept all the positive parser tests and fail all the negative ones
(which is my idea of compliant re rdf/xml parsing).

But the state so far is looking promising.

It seems like a good idea to collect some pointers.  So far I've seen
announcements of conformance from:

Which is great since the majority are by non WG members ;)

There are likely to be others I'm sure.
