Brian--

(Only partially tongue in cheek) To be perfectly fair to all concerned,
you might want to note that there were roughly 80 million messages (I
think I have that number right!) exchanged that led up to the "datatypes
solution" being objected to here (and maybe part of that "solution" can
be explained by the exhaustion of many of the participants) so we sure
would prefer that any external comments would do something other than
jump in at message number 476.
