That is true. This was a deliberate decision, but it could be 
changed. The essential change is to require that 
ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) = LV, rather than being a subset of LV. In 
this case it would probably be better to also make LV part of the 
interpretation and add semantic conditions on it.

Unless anyone objects, I will make this change in the final 
publication version. The effect of this can be summarized by saying 
that untyped literals will then be treated like typed literals with a 
'blank' datatype which has the identity mapping as its 
lexical-to-value mapping.
