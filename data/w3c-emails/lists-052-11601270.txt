I've been doing a little hacking.

There is now a preliminary last call issues document at:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/

which is automatically generated from the RDF graph at

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/issues.rdf

using two preliminary schemas

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030126-issues
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030126-misc

I intend to maintain the RDF graph as the master issues list.

Brian
