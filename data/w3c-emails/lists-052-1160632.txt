The version (dated 18b April) now at that URI has a modification to 
the monotonicity lemma (plus surrounding text) in section 3.5 (it was 
formerly in 3.4 and was wrong) , and has all the citations and RFC 
2119 vocabulary markup fixed to conform to the W3C style manual. 
Also Ive fixed an obscure bug in the CSS style sheet, so the glossary 
links are now unobtrusive.
