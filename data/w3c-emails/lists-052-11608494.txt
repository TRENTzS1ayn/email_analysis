That is true, and I had indeed not previously noticed this case, 
which requires the notion of closure to be re-worded slightly. The 
inference can be obtained as follows:

ex:foo ex:prop "a" .
|=
ex:foo ex:prop _:x .

is sanctioned by the general RDF entailment conditions, and the other 
triple is then inferred by the rule rdfs4b. However, this means that 
the closure rules need to be applied *after* some RDF inference is 
performed.

The definition of closure will be re-worded so as to first add all 
existential conclusions on triples involving literals, then apply the 
closure rules. This will handle this exceptional case.
