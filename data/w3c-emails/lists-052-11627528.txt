I do not feel it is strictly necessary to respond to this comment, 
but the intended properties of an Lbase translation are stated in the 
Lbase document referred to in the semantics document. And in any 
case, the appendix is intended only to be an informative summary of 
the semantic conditions rendered into a logical notation. Its 
intended meaning will be obvious to anyone with a logical training, 
and irrelevant to any other reader.
