I would say that these cases are not impossible to use, but rather 
that certain entailments involving them are not well-defined. Section 
4.3 of the semantics document explains which entailments require 
which kinds of information about a datatype. In the cases where such 
information is unobtainable or undefined, the corresponding 
entailments will not be supported.
