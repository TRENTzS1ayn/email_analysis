Pat,

Now we are in last call, we have to be a bit more disciplined about 
handling comments.  We discussed the process for handling last call 
comments on Friday's telecon.  To some extent we are figuring it out as we 
go along, but here is the gist of what I have in mind:

   o comment arrives in www-rdf-comments@w3.org
   o if its an "immediate response" e.g. "we say that in section xx.yy" 
then the editor responds pointing this out and hopefully the commentor 
agrees and that's all very lightweight.
   o if its not an easy response, the editor requests a comment id from me, 
and the comment gets added to the lc comments list:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/issues.rdf

  o such comments are discussed by the WG and a disposition agreed, actions 
recorded and feedback sent to the commentor, who may accept the resolution 
or raise an objection.

I've got a couple of concerns about this at the moment.  It puts me as a 
bottleneck in allocating id's.

There have been occasions in the past where corrections have got 
lost.  We've got make sure that stops happening.

Brian
