Hmmm... this makes me think this decision should have been made at editors' 
discretion, rather than as a group decision, since it is ultimately an 
expository matter, not one that (should) affect the meaning of any 
RDF.  (Though I realize this decision involved coordination between two 
documents.)

Which, looking forward, leads me to suggest that if Pat/Jeremy can agree on 
an alternative treatment that gives clearer exposition of the intended 
meaning, they should be allowed discretion to do so.
