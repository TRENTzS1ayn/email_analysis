        action complete
     ]]

(Scribe note item 9 appears to have been continued after item 10)

10: Handling last call comments.

Examplar suggested by DanC:
  http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/12/LC-xml-names11-doc

The chair suggested without opposition that:
            
We start with one public list for tracking last call comments, maintained by 
bwm, if we get too many comments we think again

One editor needs to take the lead on each comment; reflect it back in 
different words. Informational, or small typos do not go on to issue list at 
all. If we put [closed] in the subject line for such items then that helps 
some software.

9. (I think) yet more actions

ACTION danbri remind RSS people to send their comments to www-rdf-comments
ACTION bwm send announcement to chairs list
ACTION jjc Send msg to XML C14N WG asking for relevant LC review

Discussion about Mike Dean's formal objection. If he gets a pointer out soon 
enough it will be included in announcement message.

- integration points should be tested before PR

ACTION bwm start draft request to advance to PR
 ACTION em start drafting press release
