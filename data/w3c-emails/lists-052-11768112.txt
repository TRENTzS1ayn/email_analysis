Jeremy's terminology (using "equal" for syntactic equality) seems to rub
pretty much everyone up the wrong way, although it is technically
correct. A move to using "graph isomorphism" is pure syntactic sugar,
although I'll note that this terminological fix will also require a fix
to a couple of words in the test cases document: Massimo objected to
using "isomorphic" to describe the, erm, isomorphism relation between
graphs, which is why test cases now points to jjc's definition...

[[
A parser is considered to pass the test if it produces a graph  equal to
the graph described by the N-triples output document, according to  the
definition of graph equality given in [RDF-CONCEPTS].

Agreed; possible different interpretations of this make it hard to
answer GK's question: can the literal "a" denote the same thing as the
typed literal "a"^^xsd:string. I'd support clarifying this wording so
that any remaining ambiguity is solely on the XSD side.
