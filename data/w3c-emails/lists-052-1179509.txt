In Semantics I always refer to this as 'lexical-to-value mapping' . 
Anyone want me to change this to 'lexical mapping'? The longer form 
is readable (just) and harder to misunderstand, seems to me.

BTW, I have also now introduced the term 'datatype map' to refer to 
the D's in D-intepretations, since they are now mappings from urirefs 
to datatypes (sets of pairs) rather than simply sets of datatypes (to 
handle the 'naming' issue properly).  So this is yet another source 
of potential confusion with the 'datatype mapping' term.

I could change that 'datatype map' terminology if people feel 
strongly about it, by the way. Any other suggestions for what to call 
a mapping from urirefs to datatypes? A datatype scheme? A datatype 
naming scheme? A naming of datatypes?
