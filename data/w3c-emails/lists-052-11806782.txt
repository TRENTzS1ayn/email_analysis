I'm figuring this out as we go along.

I'm wondering if I did that too quickly.  I'm planning to try to update the 
comment tracking doc once at the beginning and once at the end of each 
working day.  I could wait for the editors to request an id, but if I'd 
done that Peter might still be waiting, so I've been using my judgement, 
which may save the editors a small amount of work. This may mean I allocate 
an id to a comment that is soon withdrawn.  I regard that as my bad luck.

Good plan.


>So I send a message to Dan and to www-rdf-comments

I'd suggest you just reply to the message I sent allocating the id.  That 
keeps the related messages together in the thread and you'll inherit the 
title of the thread - which now includes the comment id.

Having the reference in the subject is good.  See above.

"[closed]" is good.  I'd call this withdrawing the comment rather than 
closing it in the text.

Same as above.  Reply in thread if possible.  The idea is to clarify the issue.
In general its good practice to reflect all raised issues back in the 
editor's own words to check understanding.

That bit is a bit redundant, given my previous response.

Looks excellent.  If Dan remains dissatisfied with the status quo, then you 
can bring proposed text to the WG Friday.
