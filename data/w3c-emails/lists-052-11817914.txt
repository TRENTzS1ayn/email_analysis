Gee... I would hope this is a simple editorial tweak, not
the sort of thing where the WG need be involved.

Nobody has to change any test cases or code over this;
it's just a matter of how the text is written.

It's fine to be conservative about these things,
but if it were me, this wouldn't warrant an issue.
