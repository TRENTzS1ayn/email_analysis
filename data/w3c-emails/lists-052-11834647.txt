Or maybe you do... danc-01 might turn out to be more significant

That's a rule of thumb I use, yes. But you/we should also
consider that a spec could be technically/formally correct
but so confusing as to hamper deployment of the technology...
or that a commentor who could potentially cause
wide deployment of the spec might get discouraged
by dismissal of their comments as "merely editorial."
