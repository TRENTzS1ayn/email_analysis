Jeremy's talking about *syntactic* equality (ie, "X equals Y" means
"every expression involving X can be rewritten with Y substituted for it
and the expression's value is preserved"), not identity (X and Y can be
equal but not identical; if X and Y are identical then they're equal).
This terminology is used (in my experience) by some mathematicians but
not all; depends on the field and personal choice. In the sense it's
used it's ok (I think) so it comes down to choosing a terminology and
sticking to it. If this is going to cause wide-scale confusion it might
be better to revert to couching this in terms of "isomorphism" which is
a less overloaded term.
