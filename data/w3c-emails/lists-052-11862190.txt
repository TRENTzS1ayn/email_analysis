Hmm... I wasn't familiar with that idea before... I'll have
to think it over.

But my intuition says the difference between syntactic
equality and identity matters to the RDF spec.

For example, if X and Y are distinct graphs that
art syntactically equal, what's the cardinality
of the set {X, Y}? It's 2, right?

The model theory spec does stuff like putting
graphs into sets, and I think it matters what
the cardinality of the resulting set is;
if X and Y are the graphs arising from
the n-triples document jeremy gave as
an example, I think the model theory
spec depends on the cardinality of {X, Y} being 1.

But I'm not certain. It could be that it doesn't
matter.
