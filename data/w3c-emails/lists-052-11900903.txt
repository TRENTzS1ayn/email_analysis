Brian--

I'd like some further input on the last-call comment process regarding 
further mods to the Primer.  Specifically, I had some comments from Dave 
and Jan (and one from you) on the LCC version that have not yet been 
made (generally editorial in nature, but need to be done, like using 
appropriate "example.org" URIs).  Also synching the references (are we 
going to use "Manola F" or "F. Manola", for example).  Can I go ahead 
and make those changes?  I also had a whole set of comments from PPS, 
some of which I haven't dealt with yet.  Can I go ahead and make the 
fixes that seem "editorial" without further WG input?  Others seem more 
substantial (but I haven't heard back from him on them);  *those* I may 
want to "escalate".  Comments?
