I agree with Pat.  See below.

I like "lexical-to-value mapping" myself.  It seem to me leaving one end 
of the mapping out is asking for trouble, unless you are very firmly in 
context.  I myself would have tended to interpret "lexical mapping" as a 
mapping TO lexical, rather than a mapping FROM lexical (and would have 
thought a more natural name for this would have been "value mapping", if 
you had to name only one end).

I like "datatype naming scheme" myself.  It certainly makes it clear 
that URIrefs are (here) being used as names for datatypes.
