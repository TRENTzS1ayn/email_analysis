Fine, as long as there's a record, so that in case a member
of the WG disagrees about whether it's editorial discretion, 
someone can speak up...

Perhaps include such things as "issues" but differentiate
between editorial and WG issues -- and telecon aggendas
only address issues identified as WG issues, but the others
are documented/managed in the same place, in case what is
thought to be a simple clarification actually changes
something non-trivial.

New issues would be unclassified until the chair and
editors agree on whether they are editorial or WG
issues.

Eh?
