8: Handling last call comments.
Comments on comment tracking documents:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/issues.rdf
What to do with the app source code?

DanC suggests editors discretion to make editorial corrections
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0214.html

Patrick suggests WG should review whether it considers issue editorial
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0229.html

WG's views?

Frank asks - what about comments we delayed to last call:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0223.html

Suggest:
  Editor's have discretion as we decided above
  Others - please send bwm email so he can register them in the lcc list

Tracking Changes:
  We need to ensure that agreed changes don't get lost.  That means a
  list of edits for each document.  A list of changes made in each doc would
  also be useful for readers/reviewers of future versions.

  Suggest:
    o each doc maintains change list with id and pending/done status
    o each response to commentor which accepts a change includes the id of
      the change which should be listed in ed's draft when message sent
    o we need new editors drafts of the docs to point to from wg page

www-rdf-comments
  o is for process - not general discussion
  o please let editors or the chairs handle comments process
  o please keep threads together - i.e. reply to messagage

Any other process issues?
