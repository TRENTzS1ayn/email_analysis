I am hoping for still greater clarity at the telecon.

In the example of danc-01, danc-02 - I think there is a discussion to be
had, and I want WG involvement in that discussion - should I be having this
discussion:
- on w3c-rdfcore-wg
- on www-rdf-comments
- at the telecon

or all three or what?

Such discussion might result in substantive textual changes.
