In general, my mental model is we clarify the issues(s) on comments, then 
take it for discussion within the WG.  If the editor chooses to keep the 
commentor involved, we can use rdf-interest I think - danbri - would that 
be ok?

I'm still hoping that we can:

  a) avoid cross posting
  b) keep comments for process oriented traffic.
