Like Jeremy, I too am hoping for greater clarity.  For example, what 
does "editorial corrections" cover?  In the case of the comments delayed 
to last call, we have categorized them as "editorial" (including PPS's 
comments), but they may involve rewriting and/or adding material.  I've 
no problem handling them as editorial, but I don't want to be bypassing 
the WG if it wants some say on whether/how these are handled.  Certainly 
if it comes to a (potential or actual) disagreement between, say, Peter 
and I on handling something, I would raise it as an issue, but I'm less 
clear about other things.

PS:  As I mentioned earlier this week, I will certainly not be on the 
telecon at the beginning, and may not make it at all.
