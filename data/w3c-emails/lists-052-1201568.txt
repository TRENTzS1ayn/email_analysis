Well, are we debating it? I still think that having meaningless tags 
in non-XML typed literals is silly, and that we ought to either write 
them out of the syntax or let datatypes take account of them. I havnt 
seen or heard any good reasons given yet for the tangle we currently 
have.

In fact I would like  write them out of the XML literal syntax as 
well, but I won't press on that one.

If the WG votes to reject this, I will accept that vote (obviously).

5 7 and 10 are done.

4 and 6 are awaiting a resolution of how exactly to refer to a 
well-formed XML literal: the way I have it right now is broken, and I 
need input from Jeremy and/or Graham before I can get this finally 
fixed. Knowing Peter as I do, if I say they are closed at this stage 
he will object. This is only a matter of terminology: the actual 
semantics is OK (and I think Peter agrees).

Ive responded to Graham by making a number of changes to the 
document, mostly minor edits and moving some stuff back from RDFS to 
RDF.

I don't recall Jan wanting any changes, unless they were minor and 
are now done and forgotten (??) Jan, slap my wrist with a URI if Im 
wrong.

All for now.
