In order to make clear that RDF Datatyping is compatable with but not
equivalent to XML Schema Datatyping, I propose the following changes:

1. Concepts, section 3.3, para 2, change

RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes 
[XML-SCHEMA2], and may be used with any datatype definition that conforms 
to this abstraction, even if not actually defined in terms of XML Schema.

to 

The conceptual framework for RDF datatyping presented in this specification 
is compatable with the type system defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes
[XML-SCHEMA2]. It also can be used with any datatype definition, not only 
XML Schema defined datatypes, which conform to the characteristics of datatypes 
as defined below.

2. Concepts, section 3.3, last para, change/expand

RDF provides no mechanism for defining new datatypes. XML Schema Datatypes 
[XML-SCHEMA2] provides an extensibility framework suitable for defining new 
datatypes for use in RDF.

to

RDF provides no mechanism for defining new datatypes. XML Schema Datatypes 
[XML-SCHEMA2] provides one possible extensibility framework suitable for 
defining new datatypes for use in RDF. Note, however, that the means by
which a datatype is defined (rules, facets, regular expressions, etc.)
are fully opaque to RDF and RDF Datatyping semantics.

3. Primer, section 2.4, 4th para from end, change

RDF datatype concepts also borrow a conceptual framework from XML Schema 
datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2] to more precisely describe datatype requirements. 
RDF's use of this framework is defined in RDF Concepts and Abstract 
Syntax [RDF-CONCEPTS].

to

The RDF datatyping framework is defined in RDF Concepts and Abstract 
Syntax [RDF-CONCEPTS].

Patrick
