| 8: Handling last call comments.
| Comments on comment tracking documents:
|   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/
|   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/issues.rdf
| What to do with the app source code?
|
| DanC suggests editors discretion to make editorial corrections
|   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0214.html
|
| Patrick suggests WG should review whether it considers issue editorial
|   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0229.html
|
| WG's views?
|
| Frank asks - what about comments we delayed to last call:
|   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0223.html
|
| Suggest:
|   Editor's have discretion as we decided above
|   Others - please send bwm email so he can register them in the lcc list
|
| Tracking Changes:
|   We need to ensure that agreed changes don't get lost.  That means a
|   list of edits for each document.  A list of changes made in each doc
would
|   also be useful for readers/reviewers of future versions.
|
|   Suggest:
|     o each doc maintains change list with id and pending/done status
|     o each response to commentor which accepts a change includes the id
of
|       the change which should be listed in ed's draft when message sent
|     o we need new editors drafts of the docs to point to from wg page
|
| www-rdf-comments
|   o is for process - not general discussion
|   o please let editors or the chairs handle comments process
|   o please keep threads together - i.e. reply to messagage
|
| Any other process issues?

Brian:  each editor keeps a list of changes and links back to the original
message
        it is the editors role to bring stuff back to the group
Jeremy: strip list in editors draft for PR and one can still look into
editors draft
DanC:   these are the changes for LC and say to director they are all
editorial
        (otherwise another LC)
        clarification: "editorial" meaning minor, i.e. reviewers would
agree
        "yes, my review still applies after those changes have been made"
JanG:   which document do we update as we go along?
Brian:  new editors draft
DanC:   not a good idea, strong preference to have them in CVS
        one commit per week and the one underneath the WG directory
Eric:   published docs were modified.
        ensure the REAL TR documents go under the rdfcore/TR doc
        make sure to checkout first

==========================================================
ACTION: Brian put lcc application code in CVS
ACTION: Brian to update the WG page link to editors drafts
==========================================================


| 9: FAQ: Relationship to XML Family of specs

Brian:  any volunteers to do the update?
        there is a chartered deliverable
        [[provide an account of the relationship between RDF and the
        XML family of technologies (particularly Schemas and
Infoset/Query)]]
        -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

JanG volunteers to make weekly trawl through rdf comments
and check we aren't dropping any.
the link is http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/

Jeremy: is wondering; take e.g. reagle-01
DanC:   you can either say:
        1. yes the design is goofy, but here are the 3 testcases
        2. here is a design change
PatH:   be careful here, may influence other documents


| 12: XML Schema 1.1 Requirements
|
|
| See:
|   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0163.html

Jeremy: made 2 desiderata
        those were made personally; asking for WG blessing; there could be
a 3rd one
DanC:   propose to endorse the second comment in above (on first class
objects)

================================================================
RESOLVED: endorse the First class objects (RQ-23) with consensus

corrections

issue editorial
15:39:04 <JosD> JosD has joined #rdfcore
15:39:20 <jang> jang: danc just reads out the contents of jang-01
15:39:58 <JosD> ACTION: to review JanG proposed text for testcases
15:39:59 <jang> bwm: accepted?
15:40:20 <jang> ok, cheers
15:40:52 <JosD> [jang-01] resolved with consensus
15:41:03 <jang> ACTION: jang to create test case for jang-01 and send
details to jos
15:43:30 <DanCon> no, Brian, we (the WG) doesn't need to decide a disposion
of every comment. Only those that raise substantive issues.
15:45:01 <DanCon> ah... now I see what you mean by "every comment"; it's
"every comment that resulted in an issue". yes, we have to decide all
those.
15:45:52 <JosD> ======= 11: Comments Review
15:46:45 <JosD> JanG volunteers to make weekly trawl through rdf comments
and check we aren't dropping any.

15:48:19 <JosD> jeremy: take e.g. reagle-01
15:49:43 <JosD> DanC: 1. yes the dsign is goofy, but here are the 3
testcases
15:50:00 <JosD> DanC: 2. here is a design change
15:50:31 <JosD> Path: be careful here, may influence other documents
15:52:55 <DanCon> "oh, Jeremy's only moaning at .3dB this week. We're good
to go."

15:52:59 <JosD> ========= 12: XML Schema 1.1 Requirements
15:53:09 <jang> q+ aside, if we sort out process would a 10-point bulletted
list of "this is how we successfgully ran our LC process" be helpful to the
wider w3c?
15:53:40 <jang> zakim, if you understand the nature of teh syntactic error
I made then you bloody well ought to try supplying my missing punctuation.
imho
15:53:41 <Zakim> I don't understand 'if you understand the nature of teh
syntactic error I made then you bloody well ought to try supplying my
missing punctuation. imho', jang
15:54:44 <JosD> Jeremy: made 2 desiderata
15:55:44 <JosD> Jeremy: those were made personally; asking for WG blessing;
there could be a 3rd one
15:56:23 <jang> q+ to mention that meta-issue as AOB when everything else
is done (as AOB, brian)
