http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_Editors.html

is now dated 21a April.

I have modified the terminology of XML literals (see intro to section 
3.1) to make the conditions both readable and right, and corrected a 
mistake concerning the RDF namespace definition: thanks to Peter for 
noticing these.

Jeremy and/or Graham, I think this handles the grouse I had with you 
about the needed XML literal terminology from Concepts.  I still 
think it would be better if your document defined this stuff, though.

Peter, does this now read OK to you? If so I will formally respond to 
your listed comments about XML literals.

Otherwise this is unchanged in its essentials from the version of the 18th.

The appendices are still to do.

Pat
