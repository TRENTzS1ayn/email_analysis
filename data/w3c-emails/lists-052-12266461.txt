I messed up the design of the software that does last call comment
tracking.  It requires a separate response for each issue, otherwise we
get responses that are of type "accepted" and "notaccepted"
simultaneously.

When responding to issues please generate a separate response for each
issue.

Jeremy, I'll send refs into comments for each issue pointing to your
bulk xml schema response to keep my software straight.

Brian
