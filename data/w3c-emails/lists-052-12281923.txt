Wow.  That's effort above and beyond in that we'd previously agreed that
n-triples, as a format for representing test cases, need not concern
i18n.

DanC has explained why it is the way it is.  Unless I hear a howl of
protest, I consider this comment closed.

Really?

I've just asked half a dozen people to pronounce 'N3'; people unfamiliar
with SW.  They called it "n-three".  I asked several of them if they
might have said "n-triples" (out of earshot of the others) and the
general response was "don't be silly".

The participants were all brits except one american.  could be a
cultural thing I suppose.

This wasn't exactly a well designed human factors experiment - but I
found no evidence of confusion.

Changing a name can also cause confusion.  I've seen no evidence to date
of the present name causing confusion, nor is there anything in your
comment beyond speculation that it might.  N-triples has been so named
for quite a while now with no complaint.  Weighing the non-zero cost of
changing it together with the possibility of the change creating the
very problem that it seeks to avoid against the evidence that a real
problem exists, I think its unlikely that the WG will want to take this
comment any further.

Say now if this is not acceptable.

http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples begins:

[[
N-Triples is a line-based, plain text format for encoding an RDF graph.
It was designed to be a fixed subset of N3
]]

Is that sufficient?
