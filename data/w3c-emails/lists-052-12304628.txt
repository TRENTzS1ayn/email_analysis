We've been asked [2] to be clearer about RDF namespace terms (full message 
below).

I'll try and pick out some key points for discussion.


1. "syntactic" URIs.

I think we could be stronger about these and say that they MUST NOT appear 
in an RDF abstract syntax graph.  (Does the syntax document already say 
this?)  Concepts (section 4) currently says that they "should not be used 
in RDF to denote any kind of resource" -- which might be strengthened to 
"must not".


2.  Status of rdfs:Class rdfs:Class rdfs:Class .

My view is that this is syntactically legitimate RDF, whose truth is 
neither asserted nor denied by the RDF specification.  Use of statements 
like this in RDF data is strongly discouraged, except as part of a semantic 
extension in conformance with the General Monotonicity Lemma [1].

Some extra words to this effect might be added to Concepts section 2.2.6:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-anyone

e.g.

[[
While legal RDF data may make assertions about concepts that are introduced 
by the RDF specification (the values, classes and properties indicated by 
specific RDF vocabulary terms), such use is strongly discouraged and may 
lead to RDF data that is useless when processed in accordance with normal 
RDF entailments.  As noted in the RDF formal semantics [RDF-SEMANTICS], 
semantic extensions may further constrain the meaning of RDF vocabulary 
terms in ways that conform to the General Monotonicity Lemma.
]]

Also, the paragraph in section 4 that currently reads:
[[
Vocabulary terms in the rdf: namespace are listed in section 5.1 of the RDF 
syntax specification [RDF-SYNTAX].  Some of these terms are defined by the 
RDF specifications to denote specific concepts.  Others have purely 
syntactic purpose (e.g. rdf:ID is part of the RDF/XML syntax) and should 
not be used in RDF to denote any kind of resource.
]]

could add something like:

[[
The meaning of non-syntactic RDF vocabulary terms is defined by the RDF 
Semantics specification [RDF-SEMANTICS].
]]


3.  what is the status of OWL's use of the RDF and RDFS vocabularies?

I regard these as fine as long as they conform with the General 
Monotonicity Lemma [1].  I can't easily tell, but I assume they do   I 
think this is covered above.
