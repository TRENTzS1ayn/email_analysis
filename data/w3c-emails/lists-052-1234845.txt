Well, yes, but is this really a "naming scheme" specific to datatypes?
Seems like it's just the generic URI to resource denotation/mapping
and the only thing relating to datatyping is that the resources in
question happen to all be datatypes.

I wouldn't want to see a term that could easily be misunderstood to
indicate something other than that basic, generic URI to resource
mapping.
