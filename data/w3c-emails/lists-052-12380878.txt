now embodies the weakened RDF semantic conditions we decided on last 
Friday and has complete sets of entailment (nee 'closure') rules plus 
proofs of the various lemmas. It also has a lot more internal links 
from technical vocabulary to definitions, and passes the W3C 
validators. .

There is still one issue that we may need to discuss, concerning the 
status of 'strings'. I have linked to the relevant pieces of text in 
the change list notes. Apart from this, and obvious finishing-off 
edits such as getting the title right and suppressing all the red 
highlighting (redefine 'newstuff' in the header), I think this is now 
ready to go.
