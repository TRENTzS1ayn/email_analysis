Peter,

with reference to your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0086.html

archived as pfps-09, we accept your comment.  As you know, there have 
been extensive modifications to the datatyping semantics since your 
comment was written.

The current editor's draft 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html#dtype_interp
now contains an account of datatyping which defines interpretations 
relative to functions (called datatype maps) from URIrefs to 
datatypes. This provides a way to have a URIref be a 'name' of a 
datatype while not including the name as part of the definition of 
the datatype itself. As the text notes, datatypes are first-class 
individuals which can  be subject to identity reasoning in semantic 
extensions (such as OWL).

Please reply to this message, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org, 
indicating whether this response adequately addresses your comment.

Sincerely

--
