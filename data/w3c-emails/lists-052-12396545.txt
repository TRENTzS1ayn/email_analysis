Peter,

with reference to your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0091.html

archived as pfps-04, we accept your comment.  As you know, there have 
been extensive modifications to the RDF entailment rules since your 
comment was written

The current editor's draft 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html
now contains a version of the RDF entailment rules which I believe 
corresponds directly to the RDF semantic conditions in the sense 
described. You can check the proof at 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html#RDFEntailmentLemmaPrf

Please reply to this message, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org, 
indicating whether this response adequately addresses your comment.

Sincerely

--
