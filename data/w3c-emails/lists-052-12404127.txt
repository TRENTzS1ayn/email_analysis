Peter,

with reference to your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0089.html

archived as pfps-06, we accept your comment.  As you know, there have 
been extensive modifications to the datatyping semantics since your 
comment was written

The current editor's draft 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html
now contains an account of datatyping and XML literals which treats 
XML literals uniformly with other typed literals and is more explicit 
about the exact status of LV.

Please reply to this message, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org, 
indicating whether this response adequately addresses your comment.

Sincerely

--
