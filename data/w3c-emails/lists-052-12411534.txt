Herman,

with reference to your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0042.html

archived as horst-01, the situation has been resolved as follows. 
Details can be checked in the current editor's draft at 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html

First, many thanks for your close attention to the technical matters 
and your helpful comments, which have required the WG to re-examine 
several of its earlier decisions.

The RDS semantic conditions on subClassOf and subPropertyOf have been 
weakened to be 'only if' rather than 'iff' conditions; under these 
conditions, the entailments that you noted are no longer valid.

The document mentions the stronger (iff) conditions under the heading 
'extensional semantic conditions', and describes some inference rules 
which are valid under these stronger conditions, including rules 
which cover the case you describe; but it does not claim to offer a 
complete set of such rules for these stronger conditions.

A proof of the completeness of the (somewhat shortened) list of RDFS 
rules WRT the weakened semantic conditions is provided in appendix B. 
As you will see, most of the complexity of the proof has to do with 
the treatment of literals; the RDFS rules correspondence is now 
straightforward since all the semantic conditions map directly into 
forward implications.

Please reply to this message, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org, 
indicating whether this response addresses your comment adequately.

Sincerely
