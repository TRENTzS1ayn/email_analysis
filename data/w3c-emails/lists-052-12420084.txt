Peter,

with reference to your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0093.html

archived as pfps-02, we accept your comment.  As you know, there have 
been extensive modifications to the treatment of XML literals since 
your comment was written.

The current editor's draft 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html#Lbase
now contains a version of the Lbase translation rules which I believe 
adequately covers the case you mention. XML Literals are now treated 
exactly uniformly with other typed literals in the Lbase axioms.
Please reply to this message, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org, 
indicating whether this response adequately addresses your comment.

Sincerely

--
