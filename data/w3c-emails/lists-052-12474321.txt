Ah, but some of us don't have that option.

If I follow you, you seem to be saying that as long as a character 
string has no XML markup in it, then its just text and there is no 
'real' difference between it thought of as XML or as a Unicode string 
or as an XSD:string.  But as soon as it contains actual XML markup, 
it becomes something different: there is a real difference in kind 
between '<this>is XML</this>' considered as an XML fragment and the 
mere string of characters which looks the same but isn't being 
treated as XML. If this is more or less right, it seems to require a 
three-way distinction between mere text, genuine XML, and what might 
be called faux XML, which is text that looks like XML but isn't. This 
is pretty much what we have in RDF at present: mere text is plain 
literals, genuine XML is XML typed literals (encoded using 
rdf:parseType='Literal' in RDFXML), and faux XML is a plain literal 
which happens to be in the lexical space of rdf:XMLliteral but isnt 
inside a typed literal (or maybe is typed with xsd:string).

It is not obvious that they are the same. It is also not obvious that 
either of them is the same as "Some text" considered as an XSD 
string. I don't say its obvious that they are different either, mind 
you: only that nothing is OBVIOUS in this area.

Because we were chartered to include the XSD datatypes. Honestly, 
that is the only sensible answer. If you want to ask pointed 
questions, why did XSD feel it necessary to define *strings* as a 
*datatype* in a markup language?

Maybe the key is this notion of 'flavor'.  That reads wonderfully, 
and I THINK I see what you mean, but when writing a formal semantics 
we need to get more precise. Ive tried to make the general notion of 
hypertext precise on several occasions, but its beyond me. Can you 
tell me what it MEANS to be a different flavor of text?

>Also, an XML fragment that is just only text is just that, just only text.
>Anything that is just text can be an xml fragment.
>XML is text + markup.

And is the text in the 'text+markup' still 'just text' or is it 
somehow changed by the markup into something rich and strange? So is 
'chat' marked up as French *different* from the same text marked up 
as English? Yes, surely; but then the markup *changes* the text, so 
its not 'just only text' any more. So its rather disingenuous to 
write "text+markup": that addition isn't as simple as adding two 
numbers. Its more like applying a function: markup(text); and then 
you have to ask, what is the value space of that markup function? For 
HTML-style markup it is plausibly something like what you see on the 
screen , ie a 'document' in the Xerox sense (a pixellated screen 
image of some kind), though that doesnt really deal with URLs; for 
TeX it is clearly a printed document image.  But for XML more 
generally I have no idea what it could be.

BUt the text has to be something more than 'just text' if it is 
considered *capable* of having that extra 'value' added to it. Maybe 
we need a notion of 'text ready for markup' as something more than 
mere text, rather in the way that concepts take on extra significance 
when one considers them as existing in a modal context.

There is a technical reason why this would be nasty for RDF. Either 
it would require RDF parsers to recognize, and distinguish in the RDF 
graph, the cases where the object of the rdf:parseType="Literal" was 
or was not mere text or genuine XML markup (and I bet that this would 
lead to users complaining that their XML fragments were getting 
mislabelled) ; or else it would require an RDF reasoner to have 
redundant ways of expressing the same content (as a plain literal or 
as an XML typed literal) and be able to reason about their identity: 
such reasoning is to be avoided whenever possible as it leads to 
combinatorial explosions in simple reasoners.

The fact that since they are encoded differently, SOMETHING has to do 
some work to figure out that they are supposed to mean the same thing 
(if indeed they are).
