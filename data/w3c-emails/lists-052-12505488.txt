I support this.

Two points:

1) We could include this ref to aczels work, which indicates that it is 
nearly twenty years old.


Aczel, Peter Non-Well-Founded Sets. With a Foreword by Jon Barwise. 
Distributed for the Center for the Study of Language and Information. 131 
p. 1988 Series: (CSLI-LN) Lecture Notes

(I have seen a ref to the unpublished manuscript dated 1985)

2) I think the OWL DL work should be reference to the WebOnt WG rather than 
myself, I will dig out appropriate refs in response to your qu-03 comment.
