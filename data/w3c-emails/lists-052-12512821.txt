I agree.  Remember, we specifically drew your attention to this change
because we felt it was important that i18n review it.

Noted.  However, turning to the higher priority issue b), I suggest we
lay out the issue (I've taken a stab) and that we analyse the pro's and
con's of the WG's decision.  Largely, I suggest we do that with test
cases and use cases.

To RDFCore I say, Martin and his colleagues on I18N are experts in these
matters.  I strongly encourage listening their *arguments* with an open
mind.

Given as an example:

<rdf:Description xml:lang="en">
  <foo:prop parseType="Literal">
    <em>chat</em>
  </foo:prop>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description xml:lang="fr">
  <foo:prop parseType="Literal">
    <em>chat</em>
  </foo:prop>
</rdf:Description>

Your contention, I think, is that users familiar with XML will be
surprised that these two statements have the same object; that the outer
xml:lang does not affect the object of the statements.

Martin: is that the sum of your objection?  Can you provide better
examples that clearly indicate the force of your argument?

RDFCore considered a number of options, but the relevant ones were that
the object of the statement should either be one of the following xml
fragments:

<wrapper xml:lang="en">
  <em>chat</em>
</wrapper>

or 

<em>chat</em>

The former carries the enclosing lang tag, the latter does not.  The WG
preferred the latter, though, as I recall, this was largely an aesthetic
judgement.

I'm going to make a trawl of the email archives this morning and see if
I can lay out the various pro's and con's, but I'd sure be happy if
someone beat me to it.
