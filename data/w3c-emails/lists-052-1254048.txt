[[
So what happened to the XML Schema datatype facets?  Are they part of RDF
datatypes?
]]

Proposed response:

punt
(This is neither an accept nor a reject, just close).
plus some changes

OLD TEXT
[[
Datatypes are used by RDF in the representation of values such as integers, 
floating point numbers and dates.

RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes 
[XML-SCHEMA2], and may be used with any datatype definition that conforms to 
this abstraction, even if not actually defined in terms of XML Schema.

A datatype mapping is a set of pairs whose first element belongs to the 
lexical space of the datatype, and the second element belongs to the value 
space of the datatype:

NEW TEXT (2nd para, 1st and 3rd para unchanged)

abstraction, even if not actually defined in terms of XML Schema.

(With e-mail message)

[[

Dear Peter,

the rdf documents do not provide an ontology for datatypes,
and the RDF Core WG does not have an opinion as to whether the facets of an 
XML Schema datatype are part of the same datatype when considered as an RDF 
datatype.
In as much as the facets impact the lexical-to-value mapping, the lexical 
space or the value space, the facets are visible and implementations should 
be aware of them.

However, we did change the wording in response to your comment:
