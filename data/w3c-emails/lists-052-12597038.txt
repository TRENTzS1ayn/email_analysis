Right, it doesnt claim to be complete for simple entailment, only a 
complete rendering down of vocabulary entailment to simple 
entailment. To check simple entailment you have to refer to the 
relevant section and it tells you to use the interpolation lemma.

Ah, I wondered about that. Anyone else got any opinions? It would be 
real easy to take that out. I wonder though if one can have a 
date-stamped use of RFC 2119 vocabulary??
