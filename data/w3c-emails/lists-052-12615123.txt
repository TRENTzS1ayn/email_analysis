As far as I can see, that is pretty much the wording in the draft. I 
tweaked it slightly to ensure that the closures were finite, by 
avoiding allocating bnodes to older bnodes. This also simplifies the 
statement of the completeness proofs a bit.  There is a paragraph in 
the ed. draft text (last para before section 7.2) which mentions that 
one can get all instantiators (!!  I needed that word) by allowing 
that case back in.
