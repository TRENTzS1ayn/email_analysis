I imagine the chair would like some discussion of the concepts issues on 
Friday, and I note that I will not be present.

I believe I have now executed on my action to bring proposals to close four 
(in fact five) concepts issues:

xmlsch-01
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0247.html
xmlsch-02
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0219.html
xmlsch-03
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0230.html

danc-02
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0210.html
pfps-13
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0248.html

For all of these, except danc-02, I would be happy for the group to make 
whatever decision in my absence. With danc-02 I would be happy tor the group 
to agree with me in my absence ! (but won't be surprised if that does not 
happen). I believe there are subtle interactions here.

I note that Pat or Frank seemed close to making a counterproposal on xmlsch-03 
lexical mapping -  maybe that could be carried Friday. (I think the proposal 
is to use the term 'lexical-to-value mapping' throughout)

I note that Patrick endorsed one of the positions I described on xmlsch-02 
(whitespace), maybe he could move that as an issue resolution.

I will not be surprised to hear back from the group that you want adjusted 
proposals on some of these issues.
