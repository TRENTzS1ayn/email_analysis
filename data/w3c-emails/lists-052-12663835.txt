Pat, it is good to read that
[[
The entailment rules have been divided into a normative set
corresponding to this simplified semantics, together with a
statement and (appendix B) proof of a completeness result
]]

skipped to those and tested with
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/rdfs-rules
and it's running well ;-)

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html

now embodies the weakened RDF semantic conditions we decided on last
Friday and has complete sets of entailment (nee 'closure') rules plus
proofs of the various lemmas. It also has a lot more internal links
from technical vocabulary to definitions, and passes the W3C
validators. .

There is still one issue that we may need to discuss, concerning the
status of 'strings'. I have linked to the relevant pieces of text in
the change list notes. Apart from this, and obvious finishing-off
edits such as getting the title right and suppressing all the red
highlighting (redefine 'newstuff' in the header), I think this is now
ready to go.
