It mentions that decision, but does not give any justification.
Any place that's documented? Can anybody supply a good writeup?

This is unrelated (except for being about i18n)

This is related in that the RDF Core WG, by using exclusive
canonicalization, actually cares about namespaces inherited
from (maybe far) outside the actual literal (apart from
namespaces implied by qnames in attributes and element content,
which is not RDF's fault). It seems very odd that at the same
time, inheritance of xml:lang was thrown out, even though
the later is clearly used in M&S, whereas the former is
definitely unclear in M&S.

agreed.
