This perhaps suggests that what we should be doing is noting we were not 
chartered to improve the I18N support in RDF, but however feel that there 
is at least room for exploration - requirements gathering etc. Hence we 
could create a new issue "I18N and the semantic web" and postpone it for 
consideration by the coordination group.

I believe we have already fulfilled our charter obligations to clarify the 
I18N support already in M&S; we have also updated much of the M&S work in 
light of advances in charmod; we have made it much clearer how XMLLiteral 
is meant to work. We have exceeded what we had to do, but I fear that there 
is still more that could be done, and probably should be done in the next 
phase. We have postponed one I18N issue to do with language ranges, I 
wonder if we should not at least suggest to the CG that, after RDF and OWL 
are at Rec, it would be worth having a task force with adequate I18N IG 
support to at least scope what else could be done.
