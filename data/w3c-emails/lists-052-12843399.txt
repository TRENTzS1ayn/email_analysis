For an implementor who is implementing datatypes then the current solution 
requires *no work* except in the parser, and the defn of an L2V mapping 
which is essentially the identity.

Pat's solution requires work all over the place, and does not require less 
work in the parser.

Implementing from scratch, without datatypes, and not implementing 
datatypes at all, I would concede that Pat's solution is possibly easier.
