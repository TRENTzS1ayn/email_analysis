Hello Pat,

Many thanks for your mail.

I definitely do want to leave the choice of the actual details to the
RDF Core WG, but I just want to confirm that the design that Pat
laid out below would be as acceptable as wrappers or any other,
equivalent design.

I also have to admit that trying to treat XML literals exactly like
all other datatypes looks to me quite like the proverbial hammer
that sees everything as a nail.
