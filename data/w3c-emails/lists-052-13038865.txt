Sigh.  Another action I missed.

I've updated the draft editor's draft (sic) to remove the two
informational notes that mentioned this.  One was in the 5.1
namespace section, the other near where aboutEach* is mentioned in 7.2.5.
Changes to CVS 1.502 at
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/

So apart from those two deletions, the 26 June draft of
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/
remains the latest for review.
