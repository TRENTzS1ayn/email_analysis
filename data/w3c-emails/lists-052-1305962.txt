Er, no.  In this context, it's a (relative) URI that happens to be an empty 
string.

I mentioned this because it touches upon the discussion we had a while ago 
(c. Cannes, IIRC) about how to interpret a bare fragment identifier in RDF, 
within the scope of an xml:base declaration.

The suggested revised wording for RFC2396 allows an interpretation of this 
scenario that might be regarded as less surprising than the current 
situation concerning xml:base in RDF.
