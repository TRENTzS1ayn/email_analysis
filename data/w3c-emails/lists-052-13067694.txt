Well, shame on me at least for not realizing that the primer
didn't address rdf:parseType="Literal". For some reason I
recalled that it did (maybe at some time it did).

Yes, Frank, I think that Martin's input clearly reflects the
need for XML folks to understand the difference between view X
and view G, as Pat puts it, and how the RDF/XML serialization
is an encapsulation of any XML literals and that the
rdf:parseType="Literal" attribute indicates the boundary between
the encapsulation and the encapsulated.

I think that Pat had some very good material in his recent post
that would fit well into the primer. I'll be thinking myself
on how this might be best expressed.

Cheers,

Patrick
