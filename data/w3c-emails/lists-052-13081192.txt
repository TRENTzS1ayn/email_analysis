I would also point out that many members of RDF Core can point to similar
commitments to I18N issues; RDF Core has consistently come to I18N for
advice; we have studied and taken heed of charmod; there has been much
support and little resistance to support for I18N issues.

RDF developers have already deployed NFC checking code, whereas XML 
developers are resisting the NFC constraints in XML 1.1
