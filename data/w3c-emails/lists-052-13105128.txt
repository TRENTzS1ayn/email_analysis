I am not convinced by the "*implementors*" part here.

At the time I got the impression that the rest of the group just found what 
I was advocating (retaining the wrapper element) too complicated.

I don't think we discussed "too complicated" for whom.

After, as I was contemplating the arguments made by the rest of the group 
it seemed that really this "too complicated" is too complicated for someone 
beginning RDF, it's a dirty hack whose inelegance is such that it will put 
people off understanding this construct.

Since, as Pat so rightly points out, we take the G view, we are unwilling 
to have a hack that messes that up badly.
