Hmmm....  sorry, but I don't myself buy that explanation.

I don't see how asserting a datatype to a literal (presuming an
untidy treatment of course) is any different than asserting a 
type for any resource. If long range datatyping is non-monotonic
then all RDF typing is non-monotonic.

The *real* reason, IMO, why the proposal should be rejected is 
because to accept it would require literals to be subjects and
I think the WG has a fair bit of consensus that such a change
would not be allowed by the present charter.

(Though I fully agree that having literals as subjects and
allowing rdf:type assertions with datatype objects would have
been the most elegant solution overall)

I suggest that the response be changed to focus on the disallowance
of literals as subjects rather than positing non-montonicity of
long range datatyping (which I don't see is a problem).

Cheers,

Patrick
