All these usage scenarios are embedded XHTML rather than embedded XML. I 
point this out to stress that span (or div) *is* a viable work around. The 
argument that some XML may not have a neutral element is spurious, in that 
in such cases we are talking about embedded data, when Patrick's arguments 
have additional weight.
