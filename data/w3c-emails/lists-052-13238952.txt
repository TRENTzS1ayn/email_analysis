Yes, OK

I think this is OK. The only people to whom it might matter are 
extremely picky logic types who worry about equality, and they have 
the exact statement in Semantics to go on.

:-)

All following changes now made to the latest editors draft at

   http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html
