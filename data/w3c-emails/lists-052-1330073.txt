The above text says to me that the definition of rdfs:Datatype
is identitical to the definition of a datatype in XML Schema,
which I think is where the misunderstandings about the "missing"
facets is coming from.

Perhaps some wording with even less rigorous ties to the actual 
definitions in the XML Schema specs:

"RDF uses a datatype abstraction compatible with that defined
by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2].  ..."

This then (hopefully) avoids a strong/literal interpretation that
the definition of RDF datatypes is *identical* to the definition
provided by XML Schema (which it is not, since the RDF datatype
abstraction is generalization of that defined by XML Schema,
albeit a fully compatible one).

Yup. Definitely keep this latter part.
