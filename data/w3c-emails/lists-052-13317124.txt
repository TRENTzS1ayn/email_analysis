On the contrary, it is because RDF/XML is a data markup language,
not a textual markup language, that this 'data issue' is precisely
relevant.

And by what basis do you presume that all XML literals will 
constitute natural language textual content?!

That's why the encapsulation view is paramount. It does not 
matter in the least what is encapsulated. The semantics of the
encapsulation language have no relevance whatsoever to the
semantics of the encapsulated content.

Again, the error in RDF/XML is that plain literals are infected
by xml:lang and xml:base applies to canonicalization of XML
literals. We should ourselves have been more diligent to preserve
the boundary between encapsulated content and encapsulating structure.

But in this final moments, to the degree we are able, we
should try to minimize those errors and not use them
as justification for proliferating them or their like
further.

Agreed. But it will take alot more time and work to resolve,
and we are very much at the end of our time.

What we now have is not perfect. It never was expected to be.
But it's an optimal solution, all things considered.

Future WGs, both RDF and others, will surely continue to
work on these issues. We no longer have the time to solve
so far reaching a problem as the distinction between presentational
versus structural content in XML serializations.

Again, you seem to be presuming that if it is an XML literal, it
is natural language content. That presumption unfounded.

Fair enough, but I don't know that it is the RDF Core WG's task
to clarify XML Schema, even if we had time to try, which we don't.

This is perhaps an issue for the TAG.
