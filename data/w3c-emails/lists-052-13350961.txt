I largely agree with what you said there, but that isn't what I was
trying to say.  I was trying to suggest that for the typical use case of
embedding a literal in an XML document, then the following code fragment
is typical:

  if (literal instanceof XmlLiteral) {
    write(literal);
  } else {
    write(escapeReservedXMLChars(literal));
  }

This of course is not the only way to do things.

My attempt, to make in part the point you make Patrick, was in the
section about it being architecturaly inappropriate to put XML specific
stuff in the core RDF model.
