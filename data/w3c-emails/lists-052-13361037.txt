Also for the record... I have no problem with either of the implied goals 
here in isolation (i.e. no distinction between XML without markup and plain 
text, and xml:lang applies to XML literals.)

Where I do have a problem is to say (as seems to be needed to square all 
the goals being promoted here) there is no distinction between XML without 
markup and plain text, and AT THE SAME TIME to say that there is a 
fundamental difference in type between an XML literal with markup and plain 
text.
