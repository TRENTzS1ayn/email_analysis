Yes indeed. Please note that the inclusion in RDF of literals with
XML was mainly if not solely for the first puprose; for arbitrary
data structures, RDF has better things available.
[I'm not sure I agree with your 'presentation framework' point,
but that's a separate issue that we don't need to pursue here.]

RDF is not another flavor of XML. But we need to be able to have
XML as literals, as an extension of plain literals, for i18n.

I discussed this with Tim a few weeks ago. He was not aware of
the fact that you don't need an infoset to handle XML literals
in RDF.

And the inclusion of XML literals in RDF is not a mistake, it's
important for i18n reasons. I feel it's terribly sad that this
gets ignored here time and again.
