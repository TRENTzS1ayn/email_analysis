Sorry for my delay in answering over the weekend.
And please don't remove the I18N IG mailing list address.

Yes, you can. But that's not the primary goal of XML literals, and
that's not what they are usually used for. Let's not design things
so that we can make a point, but so that they are most useful for
what they are most used for.

And by the way, coming back to one of the main points, plain literals
do inherit language information from the context (if there is such
information), and there is always xml:lang="" if that's not desirable,
and on the other hand, there is no guarantee that plain literals are
natural text.
