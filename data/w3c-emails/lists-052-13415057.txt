Hmmm... I'm not sure what the implication of this may be.

RDF/XML syntax is (now) defined in terms of the XML infoset
of the containing XML document.  So, I think, that suggests that
XML literals in RDF/XML must likewise be defined.  Or maybe not,
because RDF literals are defined (in some cases partly) in terms
of the Unicode string that represents the literal.
At best, it feels rather convoluted.

You don't quite say this, but this suggests the purpose of XML
literals in RDF is for I18N.  If so, this would be the first time
I've heard that suggested.

This is very suggestive of the role of XML as text-with-markup, and
to my mind does little to square that role with XML-for-arbitrary-data.
I find this lack of clarity about the role of XML to be really unsettling,
because, as Pat has pointed out, there are some real tensions here.

(Hmmm... general W3C process point:
given I18N is regarded as so fundamental, I think the purpose would be
better served by having I18N *participation* from the beginning, or
at the beginning, not occasional reviews later in the process.)
