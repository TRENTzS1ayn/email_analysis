RDF (and therefore RDF/XML) is indeed mainly designed for data.
But parseType="Literal" is different. Actually, if RDF were only
for 'pure' data, parseType="Literal" would never have been put
into M&S. So parseType="Literal" and XML literals are the missing
piece that allows to bridge both worlds.

Well, maybe not all. But a lot. Natural language text and
mixed content. That's what's not covered well in the rest
of RDF. Sticking data-oriented XML into a parseType="Literal"
will be done mainly by people who didn't understand RDF
in the first place.

Also, when discussing this very topic in Budapest with Jeremy
and Brian, I got told that they had never seen anything else
than html in parseType="Literal", and were using that as an
argument that using <html:span> as a wrapper would always
be fine. We would appreciate if the RDF Core WG would be
able to at least agree on some basics.

We may agree or disagree on what the correct model is.
But it seems strange that you are happy with an inconsistent
system, as far as you just got some of your points.
It may be much better for you to acknowledge that the
model is different (as originally designed!), and that
a consistent approach has a lot of advantages.


Regards,    Martin.
