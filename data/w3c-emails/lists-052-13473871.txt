Sorry, my CC lists are autogenerated, something must have slipped.

Well, point taken, but we really have to design the semantics so that 
they are at least internally coherent for *all* uses, not just the 
currently popular ones. If RDF only gets used for things that it is 
usually used for right now then it will have been rather a failure.

Also, I would question whether XML literals have a single primary 
goal, other than to provide for XML content. Once (if?) RDF/XML 
becomes common, this use case may well become important.

True; that functionality was explicitly requested by one of our user 
communities who needed it for deployed large systems. We supplied it 
as requested, but with some misgivings.

True. In fact, they could be XML text, right?
