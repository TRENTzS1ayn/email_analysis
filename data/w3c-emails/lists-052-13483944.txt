Can you expand on that point? WHY does i18n require RDF to have a 
distinctive XML literal type? And since you want XML literals to be 
an extension of plain literals, why not use plain literals?

What would break if someone used plain literals to represent XML 
markup? The 'plainness' doesn't prevent them containing markup: it 
just says that the RDF treats them as character strings, so it would 
be up to a suitable application to check them for XML properties. But 
this functionality has to be provided somehow, even for XML literals.

Again, can you explain this in more detail?

That is, I can see the general utility in having XML literals as a 
distinctive type, though I think its merits are often overstated. 
What I cannot see is why this is of *particular* significance to 
i18n. In fact, I cannot see why RDF in itself is of particular 
significance to i18n at all, any more than, say, Javascript or LISP 
would be.

What am I missing? What internationalization issues arise at the 
level of the RDF graph syntax?
