Sorry for my imprecision. I think I should have said that
Tim wasn't aware of the fact that there was no need to use
the Infoset in an RDF store. An RDF parser will of course
use the infoset in whatever way it is exposed by the API
of the underlying XML parser when it parses RDF/XML.

It is true that I18N was a major advocate for including them
in RDF in the first place. That does not mean that XML literals
in RDF are for I18N only, of course. But it hopefully makes it
understandable that changes to the original design (such as
throwing out xml:lang from XML literals, disconnecting plain
literals and XML literals,...) are seen in a very bad light
on our side.


>This is very suggestive of the role of XML as text-with-markup,

Yes indeed. As I said already, that's what XML literals
were designed for, because there was no other standard way
to include text-with-markup into RDF, and because text-with-markup
was considered too important a thing (expecially for i18n) to
just drop.


>and

Yes, it doesn't. And for RDF, it doesn't have to. If you have
structured data, and you want to handle it in RDF, you should
use RDF, not XML. I'm surprised that I should have to tell you.

The tension is here. But RDF has the chance to absorb this
tension in an elegant way, rather than to increase it.

As Misha already pointed out, I18N was involved from early on
in the M&S days. Misha was a full participant in the RDF WG.
Also, there was a joint meeting at the Technical Plenary in
Cannes in Feb or March 2002.
