Martin,

Please may I direct your attention to a message I sent to you last
Sunday

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0089.html

and resent today in updated form (the archive appears to be broken, I
can't supply a link).

It ends with two questions, specifically for you.  I would be grateful
if you would be so kind as to respond as soon as you can.

Brian
