Er, maybe I'm being plain dumb here, but I still struggle to grasp the 
implication.   In a sense, it's "obvious" that an infoset processor is not 
*needed*, since infoset is an abstract data model, and implementers can do 
their own thing.  On the other hand, RDF/XML being defined in terms of 
infoset does somewhat confine its behaviour to be in terms of the infoset.

My current take is that the XML literal has an lexical form (in the RDF 
abstract syntax) that is the EXC-C14N representation of the infoset 
elements corresponding to the content of a parseType-Literal element.  That 
is what I meant by convoluted.  But maybe that's just how it must be.

I think this is useful data.

OK, I can appreciate that desideratum.

(You don't have to tell me -- I've always favoured such an approach.  But 
at this point I'm trying to understand where the *requirements* are coming 
from, and for that purpose am trying to suspend some of my own technical 
preferences.)

That would be good ;-)

I shall think some more about what you say, and maybe respond separately.

As I responded to Misha, somehow the I18N role of XML literals somehow 
didn't come over clearly, at least to me.  (This is not intended as a 
criticism of any persons concerned, but as feedback which may or may not 
help you to achieve your worthy goals more effectively in future.)
