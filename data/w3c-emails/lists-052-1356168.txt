Did you prefer Brian's text? - he talked about both literals as subjects and 
non-monotonicity.
He certainly phrased it more gently, which is a good thing.


My view is that the crucial test cases that determined the current design were 
ones like

<jenny> age "10" .
<film> title "10" .

entails

<jenny> age _:b .
<film> title _:b .

I was trying to indicate that without getting into detail.

(Patrick both you and I disagreed with the WG decision on this test case; 
however, that does not mean that we cannot try and articulate why, having 
decided this test case, much of the rest falls into place. I would ceratinly 
agree that the WG could have gone the other way, and not had a monotonicity 
problem with global datatyping)
