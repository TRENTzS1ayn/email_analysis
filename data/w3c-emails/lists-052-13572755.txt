Er. That might not be *your* primary goal...

But that's why it is crucial to maintain the division
between the encapsulated literal and the encapsulating
markup -- because given the broad applicability of XML,
we cannot *know* what the goal of those literals are,
and thus, we need to be sure we don't stomp all over
someone's application space by infecting those *literals*
with contextual artifacts.

Again, I know *alot* of folks who will disagree with 
you there, myself included.

Rather, let's choose a design that is general, and agnostic to how 
XML literals are used, and equally supportive of all RDF applications.

But as has been pointed out, it should not even be possible,
using the machinery of the encapsulating markup, to modify
the semantics of the encapsulated content.

I agree. And I've already noted that the infection of plain
literals by xml:lang is a bug, but one that legacy considerations
prevent us from fixing this time around.
