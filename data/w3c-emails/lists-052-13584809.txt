Again, it boils down to where you're intepreting the content.

The entire RDF/XML instance, including encapsulated XML literals,
is of course defined in terms of the infoset, and an RDF parser
has full access to all of the XML machinery when parsing an RDF/XML
instance.

But the RDF graph, and XML literals as fragments, are not
defined in terms of the infoset.

It's only convoluted if you try to consume RDF knowledge
based on RDF/XML rather than the graph.

I'm not surprised that I18N would have a view of XML that
is tightly focused on natural language text. But I would be
surprised, and like Graham concerned, if the members of the I18N
WG would not appreciate that the focus of I18N constitutes a
subset of XML usage, not the entire scope of XML usage.

It would also be good, as has been suggested a few times
recently, that the TAG would be called in to clarify this
tension between the use of XML for markup of natural language
content versus the use of XML for markup of data structures.
