I don't disagree, in principle, with that.

What we seem to disagree with is how far that bridge should
extend into either world.

Er... like me?  ;-)

I really find your view of what is "usual" XML usage or
"proper" RDF usage to be grossly overrestrictive.

I won't attempt to answer for them, but I suspect that
they were referring to XML with natural language content
as XML literals, not arbitrary XML literals. 

I think, though, that the WG does have a fairly strong
concensus about this issue, about where to draw the line
between encapsulated content and encapsulating markup,
and that the present solution reflects that concensus.

I am not completely happy with an inconsistent system.

But I am less happy with a consistently wrong system.

My view remains unchanged that the present solution is
the most optimal -- all things considered. It is not
perfect. I've stated that clearly. It is not 
consistent. I've also stated that clearly. It has
what I consider to be errors. I've stated that
clearly. But it is better than any of the other
options that have been proposed/considered, and we
do not have the luxury of taking time to consider
any new options.

We must leave it for a future WG to provide that
ellusive perfect solution.
