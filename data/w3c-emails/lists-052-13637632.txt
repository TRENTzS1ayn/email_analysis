Hello Graham,

Many thanks for writing this up. I think you understood
me very well, maybe too well (in the sense that you express
things more pointedly than I would have done).

This certainly describes very well the basic motivation
for adding parseType="Literal" to M&S. It is definitely
not the only possible used of XML in RDF, but these other
uses would not be affected by your points below.

Regards,    Martin.
