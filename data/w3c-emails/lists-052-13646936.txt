Understood. But as far as I'm aware of, nobody has claimed that XML
literals with language tags would be in any kind of serious conflict
with these other uses.

Very interesting. Any pointers?

Does this mean that you (personally or as a group) did not like
the idea of attaching language information to literals? Could
that mean that you were in some way just happy to find a reason
(or excuse) to remove them from XML literals when some people
complained about some problems?

Or am I wildly miss-guessing in the wrong direction?
