Dear Chairs,

This is to let you know that the Communication Team has created a
homepage for the editors of W3C documents:
http://www.w3.org/2003/Editors/

The goal is to gather as many useful resources as possible and link them
from this page, so that it becomes easier to become an editor in a
Working Group, as well to learn more about existing techniques to
fulfill this role (an earlier survey by the QA WG showed that a
significant number of editors didn't know about XMLSpec, for instance).

Please share the informations with the editors in your WG. If you have
any comments or suggestions of other resources to be linked from there,
please let me know.

Regards,

Dom
