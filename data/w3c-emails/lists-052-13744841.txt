I'm uncomfortable with that... my strong intuition is that this
loss of information is going to hurt.

Meanwhile, I've been aware of the issue for over a year...
wow, more like two...
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure

and I haven't developed any particular implementation experience
that validates my intuition. cwm doesn't really grok
parseType="Literal" at all, and it would probably be easier
to support this interpretation of it. So I'm not in a position
to object.
