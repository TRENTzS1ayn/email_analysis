Patrick,

Thank you for this suggestion.

A couple of questions:

 - is it necessary to drop the definition of the xml:literal datatype?

 - What triple does

<rdf:Description>
  <ex:foo rdf:parseType="Literal"><em>&lt;foo&gt;</em></ex:foo>
</rdf:Description>

generate?

 - What triple does

<rdf:Description>
  <ex:foo rdf:parseType="Literal"><ex:foo ex:b='b' ex:a='a' /></ex:foo>
</rdf:Description>

generate?

Some incomplete noodlings that might be relevant can be found at:
