The end of a paragraph got lost in an edit in my last message, sorry.

-------

I note that XSD datatyping is curiously ambivalent about language 
tagging of strings, which are arguably merely a form of text (a case 
which has been made very strongly by some members of Webont and the 
RDF WG, who feel that plain literals and literals typed with 
xsd:string should be indistinguishable.) I think we - that is the 
entire world, not just the RDF WG - need to get this distinction 
between character strings considered as objects, and text considered 
as a description,worked out more carefully.  It gets particularly 
tangled when the text contains markup, of course, and traditional 
mechanisms like quoting probably need to be extended in new ways.
