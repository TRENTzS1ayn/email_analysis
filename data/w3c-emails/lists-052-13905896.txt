It does indeed simplify the view of literals having XML markup.

The only issues that I have been able to think of are:

1. At present, one knows that any lexical form of type rdf:XMLLiteral
is a well formed XML fragment.

2. If RDF systems wish to re-serialize literals using parseType="Literal"
then each literal will need to be checked for well formedness.

Essentially what this means is that there are no longer any "XML literals"
per se, but only a means for serializing literals as XML, in the RDF/XML,
and that distinction is lost in the graph.

From a modelling perspective, that actually feels right, since the graph
is agnostic about the serialization used, there shouldn't necessarily be
any special distinction between literals with XML markup and literals
without XML markup in the graph, simply due to the fact that XML
is used for the official serialization syntax of a graph.

But I'm waiting anxiously to hear from the parser implementors.

From my position, as a consumer of RDF and RDF/XML, there
are no significant concerns to this loss of distinction.
