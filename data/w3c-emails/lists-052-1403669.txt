I thought TimBL's point was that the 'this is a List' statements could
be inferred through knowledge of the rdfs:domain of rdf:first and 
rdf:rest. Anything familiar with the meaning of these rdf properties 
will know that they can be truly applied only to lists. In that light,
forcing parsers to emit this data explicitly is indeed rather redundant.

The OWL use case should be fine without the explicit extra triples, 
since OWL is all about inferring extras.

http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first notes this quite explicitly,
[[
5.2.2 rdf:first

rdf:first is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to indicate the first item of a list.

A triple of the form:

    L rdf:first O

states that L is an instance of rdf:List and that O is the first item of the list.

The rdfs:domain of rdf:first is rdf:List. The rdfs:range of rdf:first is rdfs:Resource.
5.2.3 rdf:rest

rdf:rest is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to indicate the 
sublist that contains the items of a list other than the first.

A triple of the form:

    L rdf:rest O

states that L is an instance of rdf:List, that O is an instance of 
rdf:List and O is the list L without L's first item.

The rdfs:domain of rdf:rest is rdf:List. The rdfs:range of rdf:rest is rdf:List.
