Committed:

Revision 1.16  2003/07/11 13:57:42  danbri
Updated in light of iff->if decision on subPropertyOf, subClassOf. See
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0161.html for
details.

...I backed off commiting my rdf:List wording tweaks to get this done,
which was more straightforward. Let me know if there's any problem.

cheers,

Dan
