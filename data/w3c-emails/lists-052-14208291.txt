Well, as a working group, we *have* been creating normative documents 
covering both RDF and RDFS...

Hmmm... I interpreted your comment there to relate to the idea of being 
able to use RDF without committing to use of RDFS, and were seeking to 
avoid language that suggested otherwise;  I still agree with that.   I did 
not interpret it as a request to downgrade the status of RDFS or to 
completely separate treatment of RDFS from RDF.  My apologies if I did not 
read your comment closely enough.

I think it is useful, and reflective of much actual practice with RDF, to 
have both namespaces mentioned in Concepts.  As to whether they're 
normative or not, I think that's less important.  Given that the URIs are 
specified normatively in the corresponding syntax/semantics/vocabulary 
documents, I'm tempted to suggest that section 4 of Concepts not be normative.
