I've written all the SOTD so far, for syntax.  It
is the last thing to write, I feel.

Yes, that does read a bit odd.  Suggestion

FROM:
    The construction of RDF URI references from XML attributes can
    generate the same RDF URI references from different XML
    attributes.  This can cause ambiguity in the grammar when
    matching attribute events (such as when rdf:about and about XML
    attributes are both present).  Documents that have this are illegal.

TO:
    Different XML attribute events can generate the same RDF URI
    reference.  This can cause ambiguity in the grammar when matching
    attribute events such as both when rdf:about and about XML
    attributes are present.  Documents that have both the namespaced
    and non-namespaced attribute on the same element are illegal.

(I'm not making this change yet, just offering it)

There are several uses of must in these paragraphs.  Are you
suggesting they should be MUST?

I'm not the W3C XML Schema expert - I added this after a WG decision,
on http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-02
from your (Jeremy) proposal in:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0097.html

True.  Done.

For this document or refering to others?  I think this needs a WG
decision to publish things before I can do that.

I prefer after; it more clearly tells you which was first.

This is:
  "RDF URI references identifying subject and object nodes can also
  be stored as XML attribute value or XML element names using QNames"

Yes, you are correct.  Done.

Yes. Done.

Yes, that is better. Done.

Done.

Is it not that no external in-scope xml:lang (or xml:base etc)
has an effect rather than xml:lang has no effect in the XML literal
content?

No changes made.

(Incidently I fixed a problem with the N-Triples output for
example09.rdf - it now is the correct canonicalization, I checked
with ARP2).

I don't like that style personally, and it doesn't match the other
examples, so I'm not going to change this.

OK.  I've added:

  Both forms require a base URI to be known, either from an in-scope
  xml:base or from the URI of the RDF/XML document.

The order of collections has come up several times and the
XML-derived syntax order has been a problem in the past (rdf:li).  I
felt it was better to flag this earlier.

It isn't clear what RDF Core is going to do with the mime type
document at this time.  It is possible we might embed it in this
section (after TAG finding) or write a different commitment about the
RFC.

Yes, I missed that (correct in refs).  Done.

Thanks.

These changes are made in the ILRT CVS 1.503 at
  http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/
