Item 9: pfps-22 pfps-23
pfps expresses continuing dissatisfaction with the text:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0006.html

The WG had a long discussion on this. Eventually the following
amendments to concepts section 4 were proposed:

Revised para 1:
[[
RDF uses URI references to identify resources and properties.  Certain
URI references are given specific meaning by RDF.  Specifically, URI
references with the following leading substrings are defined by the RDF
specifications:
]]

Revisions to para 4:
PatH suggested deleting "purely" since we do not wish to be
proscriptive.


Item 11: Post last call comment from I18N
[the discussion was transcribed closely, salient points below]
Martin: users expect to take language-tagged literals and be able to
add small amounts of markup without losing the language-
tagging.

Martin: If plain text happens to be labeled as an XML Literal, those
should not be completely different things.

Ralph: an initial goal of M&S was to be "XML friendly" - that is, the
RDF serialisation shouldn't look too unusual to XML users.

PatS: how about if pt=L was a quoting mechanism, and the plain/DT
distinction rested on the presence of a datatype attribute?

DanBri: I think the objection is that our usage is dramatically counter-
intuitive to people who have learned about xml:lang in an XML
context

bwm in summary:
[[
I've tabled discussion on this for the next SW coord meeting (this also
affects webont) what I'll say there is that we've not heard a
showstopper, but i18n are clearly not happy with the present situation
]]

Martin concurred that this was a fair representation.

The meeting closed.
