The OWL specs reference rdf:List, but they don't care how one learns about
these Lists, ie. whether an RDF/XML parser tells you directly versus 
whether they are inferred from the semantics of rdf:first and rdf:rest.

Could a member of the WebOnt WG confirm this?

It's not like we're considering the removal of rdf:List from the langauge,
we're just considering the removal of a requirement on RDF parsers to 
emit a claim that all RDF-based inference systems could figure out anyways.
