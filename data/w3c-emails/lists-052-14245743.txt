In reviewing the text we agreed at Friday's telecon, specifically:
[[
RDF uses URI references to identify resources and properties.
Certain URI references are given specific meaning by RDF.
Specifically, URI references with the following leading substrings are
defined by the RDF specifications:
]]

The following small change to that text might be more in keeping with 
non-dependence of RDF on RDFS:
[[
RDF uses URI references to identify resources and properties.
Certain URI references are given specific meaning by RDF and RDF Schema.
Specifically, URI references with the following leading substrings are
defined by the RDF and RDF Schema specifications:
]]
Note addition of: "and RDF Schema".  I think this makes it more explicit 
that the RDF schema namespace is not meant to be treated as part of the RDF 
core language.
