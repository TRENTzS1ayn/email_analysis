A further comment on this distinction.  In section 1 of Concepts, there
appears:

"The framework is designed so that vocabularies can be layered on top of
a core. The RDF core and RDF vocabulary definition (RDF schema)
languages [RDF-VOCABULARY] are the first such vocabularies. Others (cf.
OWL [OWL] and the applications mentioned in the primer [RDF-PRIMER]) are
in development."

In Section 4, there appears:

"Used with the RDF/XML serialization, these URI prefix strings
correspond to XML namespace names [XML-NS] associated with the RDF core
vocabulary terms."

This seems to suggest that the two things we have to try to distinguish
are "the RDF core" and RDF schema, and that there are differences
between "RDF", "RDF core", and "RDF Schema". If there are such
differences, could you say what they are?  In the Primer, I've been
trying to keep distinct "RDF" and "RDF Schema" (the word "core" doesn't
appear, except in connection with the name of the WG).  If there's no
difference between "RDF" and "RDF core" (as being the language for which
Concepts defines the abstract syntax and Syntax defines the RDF/XML
syntax), then I'd sure suggest deleting the word "core", as causing
potential questions.
