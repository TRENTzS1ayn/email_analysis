Er, yes.  That was attempting to follow the semantics spec, where 
entailments are dealt with in terms of simple-, RDF- and RDFS-.  I also 
seem to have used terminology inconsistently :-(

I think this could be improved, e.g. revising the section 1 paragraph you 
quote to read something like:
[[
The framework is designed so that vocabularies can be layered on top of
the basic RDF language.  The RDF vocabulary definition language (RDF 
schema) [RDF-VOCABULARY] is the first such vocabulary. Others (cf. OWL 
[OWL] and the applications mentioned in the primer [RDF-PRIMER]) are in 
development.
]]
and changing later use of RDF core to be just "RDF".

I feel too close to judge if this is a needed editorial change at this 
stage, though I do feel inclined to make it.
