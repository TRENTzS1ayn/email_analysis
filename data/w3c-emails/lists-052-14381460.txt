Thanks for the pointer, Martin.

I agree that escaping of XML in XML is a problem. But it is a common
problem for any encoding which can recursively embed nativly encoded
fragments.

In such cases, multiple level escapment is unavoidable (as any UNIX script
writers will appreciate).

This is not a problem with XML, or RDF, or RSS. It is a general problem.
It is simply the nature of  the beast.

Though, granted, multiple level escapement in XML is pushing the limit in
terms of readability and convenience. No argument there.

Literals expressed as either attribute values or element content are
unescaped
(top level entities resolved) when mapping them to the graph -- because XML
is the serialization model, and that's what happens to PCDATA.

If someone actually wants "...&lt;..." in the graph, they have to say
"...&amp;lt;".

Cest la vie.

(they should try Bourne shell programming with scripts that autogenerate
other scripts that also include regular expressions! Now there's some
escaping ;-)
