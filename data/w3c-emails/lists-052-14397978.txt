Sorry, I misunderstood, and thereby misstated.

Yes, the WG did remove the semantic relation between a
rdf:XMLLiteral typed literal and an enclosing language scope.

The motivation for that was that the special treatment of
rdf:XMLLiteral was causing havoc of various sorts in
the MT, and having no lang tag was not viewed as a
serious technical loss, since XML provides the means
to express that language information in the literal itself
(accepting the special challenges of mixed content).
