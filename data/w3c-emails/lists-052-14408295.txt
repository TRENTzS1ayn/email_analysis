I meant to send this to RDFCore but messed up the distribution list.
Sorry folks.

During the summing up on last Friday's telecon, I asked whether folks
felt we had identified a show stopper problem with RDFCore's I18N
support.  Pat said he wasn't sure what the problem was; others agreed. 
Patrick said he saw issues but didn't see them as show stoppers.

However, some folks had dropped off the call as a result of a comms
failure and didn't have a chance to respond.  Please could you respond
to this email, if you feel such a showstopper has been identified and
can describe what it is.

Brian
