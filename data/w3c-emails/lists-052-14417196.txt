Graham,

I suggest Dan has a point.  If schema were to be updated and the
namespace changed, It doesn't seem appropriate to have to update the
concepts document as well.

Schema already defines the namespace; is there a need to define it
twice?

Re - moving the reference to informative - are there any normative
references to schema in the document?

Could
