Martin--

Thanks.  As I said in my original message, this is a related issue
then.  That is, you may think that the XML namespace information
*should* be carried over into the XML literal, per your response to my
question #3, but if you look at the Test Case associated with Example 9
of the Syntax specification, example09.rdf (the RDF/XML) has the "a"
namespace declaration, but that namespace declaration does not appear in
the XML literal generated as the object of the corresponding output RDF
triple (example09.nt).
