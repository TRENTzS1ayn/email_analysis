Discussion of the refinement to literal handling, capturing the X and G
views
(contextual vs. non-contextual literals) as outlined in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0165.html

Providing the benefits:

1. XML literals can be encoded as contextual (plain) or non-contextual
(typed).

2. Allows contextual XML literals to have language tag associated, providing
    consistent treatment of language qualification for all contextual
literals, plain or XML.

3. Removes special distinction in RDF graph between plain and XML literals.

4. Allows complex typed literals (e.g. xhtml:table) to be serialized as XML.

5. Only requires tweaks to RDF/XML syntax and RDF/XML to graph mapping.

Benefits #1 & #2 directly address concerns/wishes (as I've understood them)
expressed
by Martin and I18N WG (albeit not all of them) while still addressing the
concerns/needs
of those wishing to use the RDF Datatyping machinery (conveniently) for XML
literals.

Benefit #3 addresses earlier concerns by TimBL about an artificial
distinction or special
treatment for XML literals separate from plain literals which breaks
layering.
(c.f. TimBLs comments:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/29-rdfcadm-tbl.html#xtocid103643)

Benefit #4 makes RDF more convenient for managing XML fragments with
explicit typing.

Benefit #5 addresses the needs of the RDF Core WG to get things wrapped up
without
major rework.

--

While I think it has been agreed that there are no showstoppers in the
present design,
I have difficulty dismissing the view that the above minor changes are
warranted.
