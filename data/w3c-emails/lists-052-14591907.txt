I think those who want to qualify mixed content
with language tags and maintain a distinction
from plain literals. I.e. those who want to say

   xml"..."@en

or

   "..."@en^^rdfs:XMLLiteral

neither of which are supported by RDF directly.

Of course, that's simply qualified that blank node
more precisely, without actually clarifying its
denotation ;-)
