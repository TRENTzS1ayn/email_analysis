Well, my perspective of what may or may not be minor is of
course limited.

Since what I am proposing is (I believe) exclusively a change
to the RDF/XML syntax and RDF/XML to graph mapping, I was waiting
to hear from Jeremy and Dave particularly.

Jeremy didn't seem to thrilled, though I think he is seeing
ghosts. I didn't want to get into that before/unless there
was some clear indication from the WG and you in general that
this is something we should actively address further.

For contextual XML literals, it would be the same as now defined
for rdfs:XMLLiteral lexical forms.

For non-contextual XML literals, it would correspond to the
literal string, with the top/first level of escaping
unescaped, following normal XML conventions.

So I don't see any new territory there. Only some finessing
of what we're already doing.
