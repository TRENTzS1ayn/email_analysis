I have been confident that the basic framework agreed for XML Literals as 
we resolved the original issues (in Cannes?) works.

I am not confident that a fundamental change to that framework would work.
I might be seeing ghosts, but we would need to work through application 
scenarios for embedded XHTML in detail. I have failed to come up with a 
succinct example as to how it does not work but remain prejudiced against 
any variant of the proposed change.
