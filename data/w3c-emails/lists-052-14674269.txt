This might be a question about the meeting I missed ...


Have we added a horst-01 test case?

We should (or perhaps merely could) add a test that is more or less 
Herman's initial comment and say that it is a non-entailment.

I would then also add this very same test to the OWL test suite as an 
entailment.

If we have not done so then we could have this on the agenda.

(I may be a little late tomorrow, and will not be reading my e-mail before 
the meeting. In one scenario I will also not be available after the first 
60 minutes).

(I could probably manage to add the test case to the website this evening 
if prompted to do so).

Jeremy
