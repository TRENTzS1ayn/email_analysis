I sent this to a bad address originally - bad address completion - and 
Martin's reply also got lost.  I'll resend that too.

I've just been chatting on the phone with Martin, discussing what might
be done to address the comments I18N have made concerning xml literals
without changing the design.

We came up with:

   - create a postponed issue to revisit support for
internationalization  in the triple structure

   - add a section to the tutorial suggesting care be taken when chosing
to use plain or xml literals

   - add a note to 3.4 of concepts with a similar warning

Martin further suggested that we consider changing the canonicalization
algorithm to omit the conversation to utf 8.  I pointed out that this
has the benefit of avoiding false equals between similar plain and xml
literals, but I agreed to raise it anyway.

I believe Martin feels these steps would go a small way to addressing
the I18N concerns, but would not satisfy them that their concerns had
been adequately addressed.

Brian
