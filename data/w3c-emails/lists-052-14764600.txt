There is a new version of the Primer at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-2003LCrevised15July.html
(If you're looking at the directory, it's the one dated 18 July).

While I'm still going through making some very minor edits (like I've 
caught a few periods where they shouldn't be), this is ready to be 
seriously looked at as far as I'm concerned (in particular, Dan and 
Peter can look and see whether they think I've adequately addressed 
their Primer issues that have "pending" outcomes listed).

PS:  While this version mentions that XMLLiteral is a built-in datatype, 
there are no examples describing the use of XMLLiterals or describing 
parsetype="Literal" (NB:  no one complained about that omission during 
Last Call), so if there needs to be coverage of this subject (especially 
if the coverage needs to go much beyond what's described in the Syntax 
document), we should discuss this at some point.

PPS:  The numberings for the files containing the figures have not 
always kept up with the renumberings of the figures in the document, so 
that probably should be rationalized as some point.
