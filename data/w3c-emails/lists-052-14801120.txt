Martin,

what you're saying here about XML doesn't seem to fit with what you were 
saying earlier about text with markup.  Particularly:

[[
I.e. an XML literal denotes an XML fragment the same way an
integer denotes an integer.
]]

Here, you seem to say that an XML literal is *not* text with markup, but 
your original comments seemed to be focused on the disparities between 
treatment of XML literals and plain text.  If we're to have a constructive 
discussion, I think we need to remain clear about the requirements we're 
trying to address.
