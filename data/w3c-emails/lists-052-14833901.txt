Ok.  I should have known better.  I didn't read far enough down the
section.

The text states that the following triple is added to the graph:

  e.parent.subject.string-value <e.URI> o.string-value

where o.string-value links to:

[[
string-value

        
        The value is the concatenation of the following in this order
        """ (1 double quote), the value of the ??literal-value?? accessor,
        """ (1 double quote), "^^<", the value of the ??literal-datatype??
        accessor and ">". 
]]

This is then overridden by

[[
The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal is the Exclusive
XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]) with comments and with empty
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList of the literal text l, i.e. the entire
element content of this property element.
]]

The term lexical form of the XML literal does not bind strongly to
o.string-value.  Thats why I got confused.
