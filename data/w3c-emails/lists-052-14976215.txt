Thanks for moving this forward.

Titles may be multilingual. Titles may need markup for bidirectional
rendering. Titles may contain Ruby Annotations or special glyph
variants.

As I have tried to explain in another mail, the last point here is
really where I'm very sceptical. There is no 'Web applications', the
Web is one single big application. Similarly, there should not really
be anything called an 'RDF application'. All RDF together should be
the application.
