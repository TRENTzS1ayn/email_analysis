I have done these four actions, as per the telecon minutes:

I18N interest:
JJC   add warning to Concepts 3.4 to use XML if markup required

more boring:
JJC   apply pfps-22/23 changes as agreed last week
JJC   remove normative references to RDFS URI
JJC   remove references to term "RDF core" in Concepts
(mainly impacting section 4)


Editors draft URI:

Graham, please review section 4, and if the overall text looks OK give peter a 
heads up to see if he is less unhappy.

The text I have added to 3.4 is a normal paragraph at the end of the section 
which reads:
[[
For natural language text that may require markup, the use of typed literals 
with type rdf:XMLLiteral is suitable. In such cases, a language tag, if 
required, must be explicitly included within the markup, usually as the value 
of a xml:lang or lang attribute, possibly on a span or div element, 
additional to the principal content [XHTML]. 
]]

The informative reference to XHTML is new.
