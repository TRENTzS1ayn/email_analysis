I would instead say

Because of requests from a WebOnt member (hi Jeremy) the syntactic
definition of OWL DL when written in RDF triples requires that list
elements be subjects of triples with predicate rdf:type and object
rdf:List.

I do not believe that the correspondence proof would need much change.

I oppose this change.  OWL already depends on them being there.
