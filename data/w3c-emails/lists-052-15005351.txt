Why is this (apparently) restricted to "natural language text that may 
require markup", as opposed to something more general like "text that 
contains markup"?  The point is that people who use XML as a data 
exchange representation (ala SOAP messages and so on) don't necessarily 
think of that XML as being "natural language text", and type 
rdf:XMLLiteral is there to represent XML literals of all kinds.
