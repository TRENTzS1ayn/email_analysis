I think this is a valid point. Please note that I18N has never said that
XML Literals could not be used for data exchange. But it is extremely
important to make sure that the reader gets the message that XML literals
can be used, and should be used, for text with markup.

This should be changed so as to not give the impression that XHTML may
always be appropriate, and to make clear that this in essence changes the
actual markup.
