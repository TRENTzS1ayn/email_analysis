Mostly, this seems OK.  I did not feel the final paragraph was fully 
motivated.  I would suggest emphasizing the point that treatment of plain 
literals and XML literals is different, which would give the reason for "or 
design the application to handle both plain literals and rdf:XMLLiteral's".

Hmmm... can't say I love the use of rdf:XMLLiteral here as a noun, but 
that's just a stylistic nit.
