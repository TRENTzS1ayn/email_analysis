I'm sorry, I just can't buy that.

Further, the web architecture document [1] makes numerous references to 
"applications" in the web...

[[
Depending on the application, an agent may invest more processing effort ...
]]

[[
Furthermore, designers should expect that it will prove useful to be able 
to share a URI across applications ...
]]

[[
The Web can be used to interchange resource representations in any format. 
This flexibility is important, since there is continuing progress in the 
development of new data formats for new applications and the refinement of 
existing ones.
]]

[[
Sometimes it is necessary (and good for given application) to break layers.
]]

[[
The trade-offs between binary and textual data formats are complex and 
application-dependent.
]]

[[
All things being equal (a rare state of affairs) textual formats are 
generally preferable to binary ones in Web applications.
]]

[[
There are many cases where final-form is an application requirement ...
]]

[[
Authors and applications can use URIs uniformly to identify different 
resources on the Web.
]]

[[
Some applications (and some users) will undoubtedly build new resources by 
combining several representations together.
]]

etc.
