Trying to incorporate comments from Pat, Frank and Martin ...


[[
For text that may contain markup, the use of 
typed literals 
with type rdf:XMLLiteral is suitable. 

In such cases, if a language tag is required it must be
explicitly included within the markup, usually 
as the value 
of an xml:lang attribute.

[XHTML] may be included within RDF in this way.
For mixed content XHTML requiring a language tag
an xml:lang 
or lang attribute can be included on an additional span or div element.
