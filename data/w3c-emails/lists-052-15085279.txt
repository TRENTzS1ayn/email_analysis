I think this is better.  I have some stylistic comments, modulo acceptance 
of the broader thrust...

"suitable" seems an odd word to use here.  Suggestion:
[[
For text that may contain markup, use datatype rdf:XMLLiteral literals.
]]

This presumes a particular form of language annotation.  Suggestion:
[[
If language annotation is required, it must be explicitly included
as markup, usually by means of of an xml:lang attribute.
]]

(I suggest this runs on directly following the previous sentence.)

This seems to repeat some of what has gone before.  Suggest:
[[
[XHTML] may be included within RDF in this way.
For mixed content XHTML an xml:lang or lang attribute can be
included on an additional span or div element.
]]

All taken together, this would yield:
[[
For text that may contain markup, use datatype rdf:XMLLiteral literals.  If 
language annotation is required, it must be explicitly included as markup, 
usually by means of of an xml:lang attribute.

[XHTML] may be included within RDF in this way.  For mixed content XHTML an 
xml:lang or lang attribute can be included on an additional span or div 
element.
]]

BTW, what's "mixed content XHTML"?

Are we going to try and relate this to Brian's suggestions [1] for the Primer?
