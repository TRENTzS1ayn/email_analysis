My latest attempt, I guess this will need one more go :(

Taking some of Graham's ideas (but not all).
(I dropped the term "mixed content XHTML" because it is not (to my knowledge) 
an accepted term of the art - "XML mixed content" is a sequence of text nodes 
and element nodes, so I hoped this was clear, but it is probably safer to 
avoid it).

[[
For text that may contain markup, use typed literals with type rdf:XMLLiteral. 
If language annotation is required, it must be explicitly included as markup, 
usually by means of an xml:lang attribute. [XHTML] may be included within RDF 
in this way. Sometimes, in this latter case, an additional span or div 
element is needed to carry an xml:lang or lang attribute.
