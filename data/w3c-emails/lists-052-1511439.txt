I'm sure this'll need some more rewording.

Summary: postpone

[[
The RDF Core WG has considered your last call comment captured in

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-12

raised in (XML Schema)
  section "4.5. On the relation between RDF and off-the-shelf XML tools (policy, substantive)"
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0489.html 

and (Butler)
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0531.html

and decided

   URL-HERE

to postpone it.


The main points we felt you raised in this comment are:

1)  RDF/XML sucks because
   - doesn't match the RDF graph model well
   - many ways to write things (elements, attributes, attribute values , ...)
   - cannot write a W3C XML Schema, Relax NG schema, XML 1.0 DTD
   - "not convienient" to use XSLT, use XQuery, other XML tools

We know and could give you more problems.  However we felt we
couldn't fix it all due to the charter constraint:
  [[The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF syntax, ...]]
  -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

Although we note, most of the above XML technologies mentioned above
are successfully used with RDF/XML.

So we propose to postpone dealing with this in this WG, recording
your comments for any future work.


2)  RDF and XML need not be on different paths
   - models, QLs, APIs, editors, tools
   - this cleft is not required

We encourage work to help integrate better but recognise this is
heading into larger web architecture issues.


3) Propose that the XML serialization were modified to capture more
   of the regularity of the RDF data model, offer help.

We welcome this offer to help with any new XML serializations.
