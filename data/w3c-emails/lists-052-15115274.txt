I took a look at that, and immediately come up against a problem:
[[
 From an end-user perspective, no matter where a link leads, the browser 
will be able to cope intelligently with the data received. From a system 
viewpoint, all clients and servers should be able to at least communicate.
]]
which implies (to me) that the only thing the web is supposed to do is 
browsing.  To me, the web (and especially the semantic web) is about 
browsing and much much more.

The document then raises the need for multiple data formats for different 
purposes, and goes on, as far as I can tell, to talk about no data format 
other than HTML.

As a discussion of web *browsing*, I'm not criticising this document, but I 
do think there's more to the web.  (I also think that RDF is a technology 
that has, or should have, uses *beyond* the web, but that's probably not an 
argument to swing in this forum ;-)

In citing those quotes from the architecture document, I saw a clear 
distinction between "agents" (which the architecture document also 
mentions) which appear to be the "identifiable pieces of software", and 
applications which I see as multiple cooperating software components 
communicating across the Internet using Web architectural principles.

I think there's a false dichotomy here:  we're not talking about a "single 
application", not is it multiple "independent applications", but a web of 
networked applications that share concepts and ideas to the extent that 
it's useful for them to do so.  In particular, RDF is not separate from the 
rest of the web, nor is it just another part of "the Web application".
