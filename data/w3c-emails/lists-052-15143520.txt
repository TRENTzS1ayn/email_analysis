Working group member developers,

We are in the process of assessing RDF implementation for drafting a 
directors decision and we need your help.

Please run your code base against the test cases [1] and report your 
finding to w3c-rdf-comments as soon as possible. We need this in the 
next week.  Please include in your finding the toolkit name and 
description. Describing your toolkits in RDF gets you bonus points :) 
[2]

Please feel free to forward this request to other developers who are 
working on RDF toolkits.

thanks for all of your help,

--eric
