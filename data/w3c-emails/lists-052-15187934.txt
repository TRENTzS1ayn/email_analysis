Pat,

I think there's a possibly valid objection in that XMLLiteral datatyped 
literals are now not self-denoting, if I understand the latest Concepts 
specification correctly.  Apparently, the literal form is a sequence of 
characters, but the literal value is a corresponding sequence of octets 
encoding those characters.

[[
The lexical space
     is the set of all strings which:

...

The value space
     is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty 
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ) ...

Note: The lexical space and value spaces differ in that the lexical space 
is a set of Unicode strings, whereas the value space is a set of UTF-8 
octet sequences.

to find more details of the distinction, you need to follow some links...

[[
The exclusive canonical form of a document subset is a physical 
representation of the XPath node-set, as an octet sequence, produced by the 
method described in this specification.
]]
-- 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#def-exclusive-canonical-XML

This is enough to see that the value space is an octet sequence rather than 
a character sequence.  For further details, dig further...
