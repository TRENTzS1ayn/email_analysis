Dave,

a few wordsmithing suggestions along the lines you suggest.

Suggest:

[[

...

  a) can represent all the RDF graphs that RDF/XML can represent

An alternative would be to define a new syntax that is describable with a 
DTD or an XML Schema but doing so is beyond the scope of RDFCore's current 
charter.  We note that the XHTML WG have expressed interest in working on 
such a syntax and have been encouraged to do so by RDFCore.  RDFCore also 
welcomes XML Schema's offer to help with this work.

We have added this issue to the RDFCore postponed issues list.
