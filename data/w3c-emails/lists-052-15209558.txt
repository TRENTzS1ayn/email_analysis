Achieve clarity for whom?  We already describe datatypes in the Primer. 
We already mention (just like Concepts does) that all these datatypes
are defined externally to RDF except one:  rdf:XMLLiteral.  We already
describe how typed literals are written in RDF/XML.  We now want to add
discussion of parseType="Literal" to the Primer.  OK, that's cool, but
how does it strain clarity to explicitly say that, at bottom, datatype
rdf:XMLLiteral behaves like all the datatypes we already talk about,
except that (at the moment) it wants some often-a-pain-to-write-by-hand
lexical forms (described in Concepts), and we provide
parseType="Literal" to help with writing them (at least that's one way
to spin it)?  It seems to me that the corner case, if there is one, is
parseType="Literal", not the datatypes.  

I'd note that Section 5.1 of Concepts says "RDF provides for XML content
as a possible literal value. This *typically* originates from the use of
rdf:parseType="Literal" in the RDF/XML Syntax [RDF-SYNTAX]."  My
emphasis on the "typically", which certainly seems to leave one
wondering about the other cases. 

By the way, you never answered the "What happens..." question?

Well, I guess you could say that about lots of things in the Primer. 
It's the result of all that "clarifying" of the other documents... :-)
