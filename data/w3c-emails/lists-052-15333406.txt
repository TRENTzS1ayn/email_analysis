Hi Martin,

Whilst this is a continuation of a previous conversation, as I'm
including the archive, I've dropped the context and am starting afresh.

I understand that I18N have concerns about the current RDFCore design
for literals.  I have recently sent an argument [1] to I18N that I hope
will persuade you to support the current design.

Whilst I am happy to discuss this issue with you personally at any time,
I would appreciate the opportunity to hear feedback from the rest of
I18N directly, and to address any questions they might have.

I understand you may be considering raising a formal objection.  I think
it would be best to meet with I18N before that decision is taken, and
further, I think it would help my understanding to observe the process
of taking that decision.

Brian
