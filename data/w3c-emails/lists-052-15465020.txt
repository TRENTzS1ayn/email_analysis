I'm happy for you to suggest somewhere better, but this looked ok to me.

The primer doesn't have to cover everything.  I think we need stability
more than text on parseType="Resource".

Ok - dropped rich text.  Added more words about care.

The text does.  Its used in the example and there is specific mention of
not inheritting it from its context.

Looks like XML to me.

I'm inclinded not to make this too complicated.  I suggest it makes the
point we need to make and that is sufficient.

That is a corner case I don't expect to cover in the primer.

New text follows shortly.
