Two points should be made:

   oThe descriptions of the relations on the value spaces of Schema
    datatypes are normative for schema processing but are advisory
    for other applications.

   oThe WG is aware that some of our primitive datatypes have
    values that could reasonably be identified with values from
    other primitive datatypes.  For 1.0, at least, we chose to
    make those values (artificially?) unequal *for schema
    processing purposes*.  This decision gets occasional discussion;
   some would like to change it.  The WG hasn't yet thought out
    all the ramifications of such a change.

Personally, I see nothing wrong if other applications choose to
treat such values as identical.  I *hope* that the WG will decide
to make such a change for schema processing, but there are many
numeric datatypes for which the corresponding ramifications are
more complicated, and it may take awhile to get them sorted out.
