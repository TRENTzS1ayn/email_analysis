No alternative needed, it's fine there.

Well, it doesn't have to cover everything, but there's already an 
example of parseType="Resource" in the Primer (in the rdf:value section 
4.4), it just isn't explicitly discussed at all.  And, having added a 
discussion of parseType="Literal", I think it would look funny to 
explicitly talk about two of the three (current) values of the 
rdf:parsetype attribute, and not the third one.  Anyway, I've already 
written the description to go into Section 4.4, and it's only three 
additional sentences.

One instance of "rich text" remains, but it's easy to take out.

Ok, good.

Yes, but the original text *said* it was HTML.  Anyway, your new text 
fixes this.

Since the text no longer mentions HTML, I agree we don't have to deal 
with this.

Hmmm.
