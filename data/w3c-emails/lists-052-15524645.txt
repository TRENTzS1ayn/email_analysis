Right.  The denotation of an XML Literal is an octet sequence, as
defined by the xml canonicalization spec, see the note in:

Pat, does this suggest deleting from section 3

[[
This terminology is deliberately agnostic as to whether or not XML data
is considered to be identical to a character string; note however that
the XML data values corresponding to well-typed XML literals are in
precise 1:1 correspondence with the XML literal strings of such
literals.

The statement you make is correct, in that the terminology is agnostic,
but its also unnecessary and maybe a little misleading.
