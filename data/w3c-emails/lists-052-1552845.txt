er... are you sure it can't be added at a higher level?
It seems to me all we'd have to do is add

rdf:first rdfs:domain rdfs:List.
rdf:domain rdfs:domain rdfs:List.
rdf:nil rdf:type rdfs:List.

to RDFS.

That seems circular. He's asking that it *not* be generated
by the Collection syntax.

Sure there is; rdfs:domain/range as above.

OK, but those uses don't say it has to be generated by parsers, as
far as I can tell. Have I missed something?
