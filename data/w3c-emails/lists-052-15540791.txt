I'm soliciting comments on the media type registration draft for  
RDF/XML:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml- 
mediatype-02.txt
http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype 
-02.html

As required by section 2.3.1 of RFC 2048, I've sent it for review to  
ietf-types and ietf-xml-mime.  Dan Connolly says the document has  
undergone sufficient W3C review because it is [referenced from the  
syntax draft].  However, I'm happy to take any comments from the WG or  
other W3Cers/RDFers at the same time. Do folks think sending a note to  
www-rdf-interest or something would be in order?

[ref]  
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#section-MIME- 
Type

I plan to fold in all the comments I receive and release a new version  
in two weeks. (After that, I need to ask the IESG if they want to do  
their own Last Call, wait for RDF to go to Recommendation, update the  
draft to refer to the Recommendation, and then submit it to be  
published as an RFC.)
