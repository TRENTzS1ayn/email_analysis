Dave,

Thank you for responding.

[...]

Two points should be made:

   o    The descriptions of the relations on the value spaces of Schema
        datatypes are normative for schema processing but are advisory
        for other applications.

I'm not really asking about *processing*.  Schema defines the value
spaces of its primitive datatypes to be sets.  We need to know what are
in those sets.

I guess there is another way to ask the question.  Given:

  S = the value space of xsd:string
  U = the value space of xsd:anyURI
  L = the set of RDF plain literals that have no lang tag, i.e.the set
of sequences of UNICODE characters

Is S intersection U empty?
Is S intersection L empty?
