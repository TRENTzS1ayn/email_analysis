Yes.

I've checked all your changes in software now, I found a couple
of problems:

Jan or you missed one which I've just edited:
rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/Manifest.rdf#test003 is now obsoleted

Jeremy: You obsoleted rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#test001
instead of rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#error001
so I've corrected that.

(plus I changed the wording in the comments on rdfms-xmllang/test002.rdf)

The current state looks good.

Dave
