I would like it to be made VERY EXPLICIT that this is non-normative
advice for those intending to use xml-c14n for something other than its
originally intended purpose.  If the text was more than a paragraph -- or
if it's possible to add more, so it becomes more than a paragraph -- I'd
even rather see it as a separate W3C note.

And, by the way, shouldn't we all be using exc-c14n instead of c14n
whenever possible?
