6. Relationship between xsd:string and plain literals

 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-schema-ig/2003Jul/0043.html

and following

This basically says (if my reading is confirmed by Paul) that the
xsd:string value space is a subset of the set of finite sequences of
UNICODE characters, and that xsd define their own equivalence relation
for comparing pairs (type, value) for use in schema processing.

I don't understand why they need the latter and whether similar
arguments would apply to RDF.

7.qu-03

I coulnd't find a resolution for this, therefore  propose resolve qu-03
per:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0018.html

with the addition of stating that we have created a postponed issue for
consideration by a future WG.
