Aaron,

Since much has passed since we approved this document, I thought it 
appropriate to re-review it.  I have a number of comments, concerning:
   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-02.txt

Section 2, 3:
The citation of the RDF data model is to the formal semantics document:  I 
wonder if citing the abstract syntax wouldn't be more helpful here.

Section 4:
Since this was drafted, we decided to pull the "social context" material 
from Concepts.  I think that it would be appropriate to also pull it from 
the MIME type registration.

Section 5:
Would it be appropriate to cite Concepts here. cf:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-fragID

Author's Address:
Do you really want to publish (what I assume is) your home address and 
phone number in a permanent document?  All that is required is your name 
and email address.  Everything else is optional.  Your call.

Regards,

#g
