This may look odd because you don't have the context.  Four paragraphs 
before, in the prior section (on rdf:value), I describe "the second use" 
of rdf:parseType, rdf:parseType="Resource".  Two sections before that, 
the section on Collections introduces rdf:parseType (and notes that it 
has multiple values), in the process of introducing the first use, 
rdf:parseType="Collection".  Mentioning the third use was just to gently 
point out that this was something the reader had seen variants of before.

I agree;  this is a useful clarification.

On another issue, since we're clarifying things: in the text below, in 
discussing exclusive canonicalization, the text says:

"This causes declarations of used namspaces to be added to the fragment..."

I wonder if this wouldn't be clearer if it said:

"This causes declarations of *namespaces used in the fragment* to be 
added to the fragment..."

to distinguish namespaces used in the RDF/XML in general from those 
explicitly used in the fragment.
