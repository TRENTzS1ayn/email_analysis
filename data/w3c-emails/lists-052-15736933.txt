The July 22 Concepts draft (still) refers to "Figure 5 from the 
[RDF-PRIMER]" (both in the text and the figure caption).

a.  The reference should actually be to Figure 6 in the Primer (it was 
Figure 6 in the LC Primer too).  Alternatively, you could make the 
reference less specific and refer to "the following example from Section 
2.3 of [RDF-PRIMER]".

b.  The figure itself needs to be updated (the Concepts figure, taken 
from an older Primer version, uses the term "zip", while the text below 
it refers to "POSTALCODE".)  Using Figure 6 from the current Primer 
editor's draft would fix this.
