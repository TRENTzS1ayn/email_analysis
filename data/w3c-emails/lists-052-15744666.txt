Brian,

Can I request an AOB concerning the MIME type registration, cf.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0315.html

If the WG agrees with the comments, I'll forward them to the appropriate 
IETF lists for appropriate visibility (except the one about the author's 
address).

With the possible exception of the fragid comment, I think these are all 
directly due to changes the WG have made since the MIME registration 
document was last updated.
