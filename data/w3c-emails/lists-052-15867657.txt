I've just been looking at the specifications of URI references in an RDF 
graph, and it seems that the only part of the Concepts document that says 
that relative forms are not allowed is merely informative:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-URI-Vocabulary
[[
... noting that relative URIs are not used in an RDF graph.
]]

I think this should be stated in the normative section on URI references:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-Graph-URIref

For example, the first paragraph might read:
[[
A URI reference within an RDF graph (an RDF URI reference) is a Unicode 
string [UNICODE] that would produce a valid URI character sequence (per 
RFC2396 [URI], sections 2.1) representing an absolute URI with optional 
fragment identifier when subjected to the encoding described below.
]]
