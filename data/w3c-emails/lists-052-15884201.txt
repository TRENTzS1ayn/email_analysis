Dave, can you answer me a quick question about RDF/XML? Sorry I am 
still so behind the curve on this, but I need to get this exactly 
right given our decision about plain literals and xsd:string.

Consider a plain literal in an RDF graph which uses some characters 
which require escaping in XML, eg say "<br/>".

1. Is it the case that in RDF/XML, this would be rendered using XML 
character escaping? Ie it would look like this
"&gr;br/&lt;"
?

2. If so, would it be correct to say that in spite of this, that the 
literal character string itself was the original 5-character Unicode 
sequence? (Or is the character string of the literal an 11-character 
sequence in RDF/XML but a 5-character sequence in the graph? I hope 
not....)

3. If so, are there any literal character sequences which *cannot* be 
sent through RDF/XML? Or does XML provide an escape for every Unicode 
code point?

Thanks.

Pat
