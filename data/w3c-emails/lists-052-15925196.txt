Acknowledged. It worked well for a long time.

Very nice to hear. Can you give us pointers?

By the way, you may be interested in looking at
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/xml1.1test/Overview.html.

I might also take this opportunity to point out that working
on the basics of the character model (since RFC 2070) and on
normalization go very much in line with the idea to reduce
the number of different constructs representing one and the
same textual artefact.
