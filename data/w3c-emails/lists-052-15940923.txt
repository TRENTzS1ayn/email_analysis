Also I give the HP proxy to Brian just in case there is a CR/PR vote.

My current preference is PR, but I am clearly not sufficiently in touch with 
an "HP" position, given Dave Reynolds implementation report which seemed to 
me at least to be more negative,

i.e. so far

we have no complete RDFS implementation (in terms of inference)

This may be reason to go for a CR, possibly labelling those bits that are not 
yet implemented as at risk.

e.g. two of our RDFS implementors do not appear to buy into an infinity of 
axiomatic triples ...
e.g. maybe we made the wrong call on the xmlsch-02 ...
