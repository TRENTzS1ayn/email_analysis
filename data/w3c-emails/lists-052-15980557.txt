Short answer: Yes.

Did you see this:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0323.html
?

The relevant bit is this:
[[
[[
[66]    CharRef    ::=    '&#' [0-9]+ ';'
| '&#x' [0-9a-fA-F]+ ';' [WFC: Legal Character]

Well-formedness constraint: Legal Character

Characters referred to using character references must match the production
for Char.
]]
-- http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-CharRef

OOPS!  That well-formedness constraint means the awkward characters are not
allowed.  I was wrong, the awkward characters cannot be encoded in XMl.
