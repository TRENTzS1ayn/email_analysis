Thank you for letting us know Patrick.

There is a chance we will have some important decisions to take this
week, e.g. whether the next step is PR.  It would be helpful if you
could let us have your views by email.  I expect there  to be some
traffic on this, summarizing the decision, later in the week.

Brian
