Another case is strings that are not in Unicode Normal Form C.

These can be written in XML 1.0, cannot be written in XML 1.1 and are not 
permitted in an RDF graph.

I don't think Pat can have the elegant identity between xsd:string and RDF 
plain literal. xsd:string is not in practice a fixed point but an evolving 
concept which will, in the fullness of time, adjust to XML 1.1

(Every code point is legal - but strings not in NFC are only permitted in XML 
1.0 not any of the other contexts).
