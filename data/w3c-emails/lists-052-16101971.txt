No.  

>From the semantics doc:

[[
The subset of rdfV consisting of the first 3 items in the above list,
{rdf:type   rdf:Property rdf:XMLLiteral} is called the core RDF
vocabulary, crdfV.
]]

[[
An rdfs-interpretation of V is an rdf-interpretation I of V union crdfV
union rdfsV which satisfies the following semantic conditions and all
the triples in the subsequent table, called the RDFS axiomatic triples,
which contain only names from V union crdfV union rdfsV.
]]

rdf:_1 is not a member of V, crdfV or rdfsV, so the entailment does not
hold - which is cool, cos it keeps things finite.
