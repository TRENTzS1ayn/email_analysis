Well (I do), I have some (additional builtin) code like

  if (goal.verb == RDFtype &&
      goal.obj.deref().verb == RDFSContainerMembershipProperty &&
      goal.subj.deref().verb.startsWith(RDF + "#_")
  // that goal succeeds

to overcome issues with infinity
(math: properties are similar for instance).

Maybe yes; I see that .NET platforms (MS, Mono, ...)
have similar behaviour as xerces (which we also use)
so maybe we should make all 4 of them positive, hm..
