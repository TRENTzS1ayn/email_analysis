That came from Jeremy

The input to canonicalization is either an octet stream (required)
OR an XPath node-set.  We use events equivalent to the latter.
-- http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#DataModel

The output of canonicalization, the canonical form, is an octet sequence
forming the text generated from the canonical form (XPath node-set).
-- http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#ProcessingModel

The XML Canonicalization documents define
not only "canonical form of an XML document" (the octets) but
"canonical XML" which is XML written in the canonical form.
-- http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#Terminology

We use Exclusive XML Canonicalization with comments, which
is XML written in the exclusive canonical form (with comments)
i.e. written into XML's alphabet - Unicode characters - and
encoded as a document into UTF-8 (ibid).  That's what we use.
