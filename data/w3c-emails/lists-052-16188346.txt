No.  The XML parser does that.  RDF/XML parsers are XML applications and
merely get the sequence of Unicode characters for such character data.  At
that point you get '<' (Unicode code point #x3c) and '>' (Unicode code
point #3e)

Yes, reading the specification of canonicalization
clearly tells you that.

I'm at a loss to see your problem.  For < and >, they go to and fro
between XML documents and used in RDF without loss or change.

These special XML entities (and they are special, read the XML
specifications or even the SGML ones) DO get resolved by the XML parsers.

RDF/XML is defined on top of the Infoset - there are no entities infoitems.
