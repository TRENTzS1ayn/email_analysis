I'm not sure.  Eric talked to me at the Tech Symposium about this.  As a
result, he had promised to send me some words that I'd try to stick in,
but he never did, and I forgot to ping him about it.  However, the words
he was supposed to send me were to describe the fact that there was this
*convention* he was referring to in his comment, that URIrefs with
fragment ids referred to abstract (non-retrievable) things like people,
and the other URIrefs referred to retrievable things like Web pages. 
However, RDF doesn't formally recognize that convention (and I'm not
sure I really agree with it), and Eric's probably busy with other stuff,
so I'd just as soon drop it.
