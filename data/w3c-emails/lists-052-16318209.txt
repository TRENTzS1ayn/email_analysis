I'm not seeking the addition of a new definition. I don't think it would
be appropriate to add new definitions without starting a new WD-REC
cycle, and I don't think this is important enough to do this.

I guess it comes sufficiently close, the 'further qualification'
seems quite adequate.

The current text is slightly problematic because it says 'without concern
for its encoding' and then goes straight on to mention UTF-16. UTF-16
indeed does not deal with octets, but it is still an encoding.
Also, this version of the text doesn't mention abstract modeling anymore.
It might also be better to replace 'may require' with 'may be better
served with'.


Regards,    Martin.
