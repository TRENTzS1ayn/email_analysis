OK, for the record. I got rid of the 3rd person stuff, fixed all the 
broken links and references, etc., modified the coloring (blue/yellow 
not red/green), gave titles and links to the tables,  and put a soft, 
gentle background color behind all the link words in the text. (Not 
sure about that last idea, but whaddayathink?) Also added some more 
links as you requested.  Minor changes to wording for clarification 
here and there; and I weakened the dire warning about rdf:value; it 
reads better now in any case.

The definition of graph merge is also re-written; also requested by Peter.

I also discovered that an entire piece of explanation (of vocabulary 
entailment) had somehow gotten lost, so I put it back in (section 
2.1) and put the links to it.

Also this version now says explicitly that XMLLiterals do not denote 
strings, and that xsd:string literals denote the same things as plain 
literals in XSD interpretations.

This is now the version at the usual URL, viz.

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html

It has only the very recent changes done in red.
