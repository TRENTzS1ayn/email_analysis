http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html

now reflects the post-Beckett/PFPS/Carroll editing and all subsequent 
decisions. It has a slightly different look/feel (colors, table 
titles etc) , updated references (though if anyone has any complaints 
about any of those please feel free to correct me) and some more 
anchors and internal links. Ive made the text links slightly visible 
by messing with the background color, but if people don't like this 
its easy to tweak it in some other way.

Text changes since the last version are in red. They include 
rewriting of the definition of 'merge', some minor rewordings to 
clarify meanings more carefully, and putting back the definition of 
'vocabulary entailment' which had gotten lost somewhere (its now 
section 2.1 and has several links to it) and references to blank node 
*identifiers* in the statement of the rules (suggested by Dave). Also 
the dire warning about rdf:value (section 3.2.4) has been made less 
dire, also suggested by Dave.

Significant changes are that XMLiteral values are stated explicitly 
to be distinct from character strings (defn of RDF interpretation, 
section 3), and the equivalence between plain literals and xsd:string 
typed literals is noted explicitly and an inference rule provided 
(end of section 7.4). The wording of the Lbase translation has been 
slightly altered to fit that last change also.

The change list has been rewritten and is at the end.

PS. Peter, I believe this now addresses all your concerns.
