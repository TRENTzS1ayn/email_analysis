It may be that the changes do address all my concerns, I don't have time to
check just now, and may not for at least a week.


However, during the quick check I just made I found some remaining
concerns.  The first thing I checked was the list of post-last-call
changes.  I noticed that several changes that result in changes to RDF(S) 
entailments are not mentioned as substantial changes.

The change making LV = ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) means that
ex:foo ex:rel "a" .
rdfs-entails
ex:foo ex:rel _:x .
_:x rdf:type rdfs:Literal .
whereas it does not in the last call semantics.  This was pointed out in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0085.html. 

The change to datatyping in RDF makes many changes to D-entailments.  In
the last call semantics, there were few D-entailments, as there was no way
to impose connections between typed literals and datatypes.  For example,
ex:foo ex:rel "1"^^xsd:decimal .
did not xsd-entail
ex:foo ex:rel "01"^^xsd:decimal .
in the last call semantics because xsd-interpretations did not require that
I(xsd:decimal) be the xsd:decimal datatype.

The change requiring non-emtpy datatypes, although it technically does not
affect any entailments, changes the permissable set of RDF datatypes, and
thus forms a significant change to the RDF datatyping design.

Without a comprehensive list of such changes, I do not view the RDF
Semantics document as complete.


Problems arise in the description of other changes.  I can't
imagine how the significant changes to the mapping to Lbase can be listed
under ``The following changes do not effect [sic] the technical content.''

The change to lists doesn't affect any entailments that I can see.  In
fact, the it doesn't change anything at all with respect to the semantics,
even the set of RDF graphs that are the result of RDF/XML parsing.

The change to datatypes is not needed for compatability with OWL.  It is
instead needed because the last-call treatment of datatypes didn't work
right.
