Drawing your attention back to the original subject of this thread :-), 
does any of the discussion going on here lead to specific suggested 
changes to the parseType="Literal" text in the Primer (i.e., the most 
recent editor's draft, 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-primer-20030117/ )?
Dave has already mentioned that quotes need to be escaped in the 
resulting triples because N-Triples escapes them [I note that the W3C 
RDF Validator doesn't generate them though], and newlines and spaces 
need to be accounted for.  Anything else?
