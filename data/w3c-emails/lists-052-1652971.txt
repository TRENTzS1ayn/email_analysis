Propose:

That the WG accept this comment and resolve it as in the current
semantics editors WD:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/

[[The changes appear to have fixed the specific issue I raised.]] 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0082.html

but goes on to express some further doubt.

We have a couple of proposals:

  1) straight reject:

Looks like a reject - pick which version.
