Aaron,

Following some informal discussion in the RDFcore working group, I'm 
sending these as personal review comments to you, and to the MIME types 
review list...

Concerning:
[1] 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-02.txt

Broadly, I think this looks fine, but the RDFcore working group has made a 
number of changes to the RDF specifications in response to last call 
comments since the above MIME type registration draft was issued.  The 
following comments would, in my view, help to bring the proposed MIME type 
registration more closely in line with the current RDF specification status.

Section 2, 3:
The citation for the RDF data model is to the RDF Semantics document 
[2]:  the definition of the abstract syntax has now been moved to the RDF 
Concepts [3], and I think that would now be a more helpful citation.

Section 3:
Would it be appropriate to cite the RDF Semantics in the interoperability 
considerations section? E.g.
[[
RDF is intended to allow common information to be exchanged between 
disparate applications.  A basis for building common understanding is 
provided by a formal semantics [2?], and applications that use RDF should 
do so in ways that are consistent with this.
]]

Section 4:
In response to last-call feedback, we decided to pull the "social context" 
material from Concepts.  I think that it would be appropriate to also pull 
it from the MIME type registration;  i.e. remove all of section 4.

Section 5:
Would it be appropriate to cite RDF Concepts here? cf:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-fragID

Regards,
