Sorta - the only thing I was really trying to do was to help create a
notation where we could communicate clearly.  I appreciate the
improvements you have made to it.  Its always such a relief when one
gets to the point of feeling like we can communicate effectively.

Right - another mistake.  Should have been:

  C("&amp;") = ...

This seems like the key notion you are introducing.  That we could have
defined/adopted a different "value space" for XML.  We did, at one point
have something similar on the table; there was a suggestion that
parseType="Literal" should generate an RDF representation of the
infoset.  I can't remember why we dropped it - those brian (sic) cells
have gone.

I think we've got greater clarity now, so I can butt out again.
