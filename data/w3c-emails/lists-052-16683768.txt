Of course not.  However, I believe that they need to be documented as
changes that could be seen by users.

Again, this is a change to the specification that impacts its users.  I
believe that it thus needs to be documented as a change.

I disagree even with this claim.  Before the changes to datatypes, there
were expected D-entailments that just didn't follow.  Perhaps OWL depended
more on these changes being made, but I would hope that the changes were
made to fix the problems with D-entailments, not just to support OWL
identity reasoning.
