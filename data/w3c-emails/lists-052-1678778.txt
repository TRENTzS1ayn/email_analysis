I've just realized that I haven't received any email from the RDFcore list 
since about 10 April... I seem to have been silently dropped from the 
mailing list, so I'm seriously behind on what's been happening.

Is there any way I can have lost mail resent to me?  Not having broadband 
internet access, and because of the way my systems are configured, reading 
and dealing with mail online via a web browser is seriously inconvenient 
for me.
