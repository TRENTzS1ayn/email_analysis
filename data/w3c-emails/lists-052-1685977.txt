Sounds like you may have been a victim of a bug in 'smartlist'.

I have filesystem access to the mail archives, could roll up a tarball of 
April's message. [..]

OK, http://tux.w3.org/~danbri/rdfcore/rdfcore.tar.gz (20 days, 1 msg per file)

hope that helps... Maybe you can cat the files together into an mbox archive
that's locally readable?
