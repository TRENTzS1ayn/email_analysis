Brian,

It may be helpful to think of this as owl:Class being a
proper subclass of rdfs:Class in OWL DL and OWL Lite, and an
"improper" (equivalent) subclass in OWL Full.  Recall that
class equivalance can be expressed by mutual subClassOf
relationships, so OWL DL and OWL Lite assert

  owl:Class rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class

while OWL Full adds

  rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf owl:Class

to make them equivalent.

Mike
