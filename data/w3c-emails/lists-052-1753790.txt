Click, I think.

Its the "in owl lite" and "in owl full" language that confused me I think.

Can I think of this as:

   rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf owl:Class .

is true, but something that OWL DL reasoners don't know.

That fixes my "naive user assumption" problem with the denotation.

But it still leaves me wondering why its needed.  If its ok to feed only 
some of the semantics to a DL reasoner, why not stick to rdfs:Class but let 
it have only a limited understanding of Class?
