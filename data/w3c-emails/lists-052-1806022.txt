I have to say I'm uncomfortable:  if I understand Peter correctly, OWL 
could be reworked to not require the [... rdf:type rdf:List] statements.

In my own work, I've made some quite extensive use of lists.  In the long 
run, requiring to generate the extra triples will, I think, add 
significantly to the number of triples for a typical model.  Would we be 
better serving the future users of RDF if we jointly worked out ways to 
avoid the un-needed generation of triples by RDF parsers?

If this really is a major problem to change, then I'll back down.  But so 
far I haven't heard enough to convince me that it's not worth a little more 
effort now to significantly contain the size of RDF graphs for future 
applications.

...

A question:  suppose that one could infer through (say) rdfs closure rules:
   <a> rdf:first <b>
then one can also infer (though rdfs rules):
   <a> rdf:type rdf:List

The current requirement by OWL that rdf:List be included explicitly seems 
to suggest that an *inferred* rdf:first property is in some respects opaque 
to an OWL DL reasoner.  Is this intended?
