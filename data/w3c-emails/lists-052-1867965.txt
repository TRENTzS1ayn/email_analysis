Pat

I was surprised to see in the IRC log your claim that Peter is happier with 
the treatment of XMLLiteral ...

I had a look at:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117

to try and work out what the document currently says.

As I see it, it says

a) langauge tags are irrelevant for all other datatypes

<eg:a> <eg:p> "foo"@en^^<eg:d> .

 entails

<eg:a> <eg:p> "foo"@fr^^<eg:d> .


b) language tags are not irrelevant for rdf:XMLLiteral i.e.

<eg:a> <eg:p> "foo"@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral .

does not entail

<eg:a> <eg:p> "foo"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral.


Hence I conclude that:


<eg:a> <eg:p> "foo"@en^^<eg:d> .
<eg:d> owl:sameAs rdf:XMLLiteral .
cannot entail in OWL
<eg:a> <eg:p> "foo"@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral .

which I took to be the heart of Peter's comment.

What gives?

Jeremy
