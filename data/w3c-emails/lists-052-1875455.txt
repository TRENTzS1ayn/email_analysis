Re. the following, y'all might want to take a look at the wording in 
the current editor's draft of semantics,  particularly:

  The         datatype map which also contains the set of all pairs of 
the form < http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema# sss ,sss >,       where 
sss is a built-in datatype which has         well-defined lexical and 
value spaces and a lexical-to-value mapping and         is named sss 
in XML         Schema Part 2: Datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2 ],         eg 
decimal ,string ,          is referred to here as XSD.

Note the qualification to 'which has a well-defined...'
