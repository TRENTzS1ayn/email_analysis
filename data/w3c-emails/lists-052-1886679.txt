Thank you for your note. You are quite right: the term 'datatype' is used
in our spec, as in yours, solely in a sense extensionally equivalent
to 'simple type'.  The WG member who drafted our comments has what turned
out to be an isolated minority view of the desirable usage, and the comment
slipped by when the WG reviewed the draft comments without anyone noticing
the problem.

The WG has discussed the issue and confirmed that we do not wish to treat
'datatype' as a synonym for 'type' or as covering both simple types and
complex types.  So we withdraw the comment, with thanks to you for drawing
the problem to our attention.
