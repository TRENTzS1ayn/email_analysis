That is what we have at present, and I think we should leave it at 
that.  If we try to put list-well-formedness into the RDF syntax we 
will never get out of the resulting tar-pit, and Peter himself 
requested that we remove it from the model theory. To resolve the 
issue, do a small editorial tweak to the wording in the document so 
it doesn't make the assumption.

But if you want to explore this, we did the relevant work already in 
an email to Brian a while ago.  I think its in the archives somewhere.

There is a third option, which is to not impose a syntactic 
constraint on RDF graphs, but to impose a semantic constraint that 
all 'list-well-formed' RDF graphs must actually denote proper lists. 
I already floated this idea and did the model theory for it, but the 
WG decided to remove it in part because Peter himself requested that 
we remove it: not because it was harmful to OWL (in fact it would be 
marginally useful to OWL) but on aesthetic grounds of RDF having a 
'minimal' semantics. I still think this was a bad decision, but I 
don't see any point in re-opening it at this stage.

Yes, its the graph that is 'wellformed'; but use this phrase in scare 
quotes in this context, please, since ill-formed-list graphs are 
well-formed RDF. . See
