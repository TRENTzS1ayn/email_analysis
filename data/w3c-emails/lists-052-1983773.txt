I overstated the ease of the replacement, there would be some consequential 
changes needed in the correspondence theorem, for instance.

OWL DL (direct semantics) can quite happily call its universe the universe, or 
the domain of discourse or whatever. owl:Class only appears in the first 
sections of S&AS in the mapping rules. I ask the question, what would have to 
change in the RDFS compatible semantics to accomodate changing the mapping 
rules by replaceing owl:Class with rdfs:Class.

OWL DL (rdfs compatible semantics) does need a concept corresponding to 
owl:Class (i.e. some subclass of rdfs:Class, not including the builtin 
classes), but it does not need to give it a URI. The only possible problems 
with using the uri rdfs:Class for the concept currently called 'owl:Class' in 
OWL DL are eliminated by the syntactic restrictions.

I would like you to exhibit a test case of an entailment that would hold in 
OWL Full, but not in OWL DL, which is not excluded by the preamble to the 
correspondence theorem.

I would agree this is a delicate point, and don't particularly want to press 
it; and I suspect that I would need to do quite a lot of work (more than I am 
prepared to) in order to convince even one WG of the correctness of my 
position.
