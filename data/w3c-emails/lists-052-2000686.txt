Im not sure what this means. If all you want to preserve is 
OWL-DL/RDF, and if you are willing to stay within the -DL fragment 
and never stray outside it, then you may be right. If you want your 
OWL-DL to also be embedded in OWL-Full, however, you need a name for 
the DL universe.

Well, how about the fact that rdfs:Class is in the owl:complementOf 
owl:Class ? That is a logical tautology in OWL-full.
