Thanks for your response, and to the WG for the effort which produced it.

BTW, the text of the relevant section has been rewritten in response 
to other comments. (See 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#dtype_interp 
)
In particular, the 'parameter' D of D-interpretations is now 
considered to be a functional mapping from URIrefs to datatypes, 
rather than a set of datatypes. This is in order to have a clear 
statement of the way that a D-interpretation treats datatypes as 
having 'names' without committing to the 'name' being in any sense a 
component or part of the datatype itself, an issue which arose rather 
acutely in OWL.

I have used the term 'datatype map' for this mapping, and although 
this is not intended to be normative, and is not currently used 
outside the RDF semantics document, I would welcome your opinion of 
whether this term is likely to produce any confusion with any 
terminology in your forthcoming drafts. The shorter word 'map' was 
chosen deliberately in order to be more distinctive, but it would be 
easy to change this terminology at this stage. I would prefer to 
sacrifice elegance to lack of ambiguity rather than the other way 
around, however.

Pat Hayes

PS. We are still discussing your suggestion about 'lexical mapping'. 
The text currently uses the longer term 'lexical-to-value mapping' in 
the interests of being thoroughly unambiguous, but this may be 
changed.
