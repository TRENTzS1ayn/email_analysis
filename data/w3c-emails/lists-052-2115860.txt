Oh dear, I was hoping there was good reason for making the 
distinction.  Can someone confirm Jeremy's view.

If Jeremy is right, I can't avoid suggesting another comment:

RDFCore has been advised that Owl would still work correctly if term 
owl:Class were replaced by rdfs:Class.

RDFCore therefore requests that the term owl:Class be dropped and replaced 
by rdfs:Class as this helps clarify the relationship between OWL and RDF(S) 
and eliminates possible confusion caused by the introduction of unnecessary 
redundant terms.
