> #owlref-rdfcore-rdfs:literal-not-a-datatype


> rdfs:Literal is not a datatype.

comment also applicable about S&AS where the problem is more serious ...
(The grammatical restrictions on rdfs:Literal in OWL DL are that it may appear 
where a datatypeID may appear, except in a typed literal. However, OWL S&AS 
allows 
    "aaa"^^rdfs:Literal
as well as

  eg:p rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty .
  eg:p rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .

The first construction is probably harmless, since it is so obviously 
incorrect.

The comment should be toned down, this is an editorial error. IIRC, the intent 
is not to restrict annotation properties in OWL Full. The text does need 
fixing.


> #owlref-rdfcore-transitive-datatype-properties

eg:lessThan rdf:type   owl:TransitiveProperty .
eg:lessThan rdf:type   owl:DatatypeProperty .
eg:lessThan rdfs:domain xsd:decimal .
eg:lessThan rdfs:range xsd:decimal .
_:sa eg:lessThan _:sb .
_:sb eg:lessThan _:sc .

_:sa owl:sameIndividualAs "9"^^xsd:int.
_:sc owl:sameIndividualAs "3"^^xsd:int .

is inconsistent.
