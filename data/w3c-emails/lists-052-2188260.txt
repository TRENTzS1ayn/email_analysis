postscript: actually, at that point, I fired up larch and
tried to transcribe S&AS. I got as far as updating
my work on the RDF Core MT...

RDFCoreMT sort checks, though I basically started over and it covers
less of the spec


http://www.w3.org/XML/9711theory/RDFCoreMT.lsl


I tried to prove the interpolation lemma with the larch prover,
but it fell over and I (re-)discovered it's not really
maintained any more.
(the larch sort-checker still works; it's written
in C; but the larch prover is written in clu or
something that has gone the way of the dinosaur)

Then I started looking a coq (since it's a
maintained debian package) but I didn't
get that far.

Graham's mention of haskell reminds me that I'd
like to survey the landscape of formal-hacking
tools again, I think.
