I can't. I probably should be able to confirm or deny,
but I can't.

At first I was under the impression that owl:Thing
was disjoint from owl:Class and owl:Property, even
in OWL Full. But somebody told me that wasn't right;
in order to make the layering stuff work out,
owl:Thing is the same as rdfs:Resource in OWL Full;
at that point, I decided I didn't care enough
to count angels on heads of pins further; all the
test cases I'm interested in work the way I expect
them to work, so I'm fat-dumb-and-happy.

If any such motion is put to RDF Core, please record me as abstaining.
