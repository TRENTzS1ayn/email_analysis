My reading of schema datatypes is that with a union type:

   o a lexical form can be ambiguous - i.e. might map to different values 
depending on which component type is used to do the mapping

   o the component types of a union are ordered by the order they are 
declared when defining the union

   o by default the ambiguity is resolved by applying the first type whose 
lex space includes the literal

   o the default can be overridden by using an xsi:type attribute

In RDF we always use the default disambiguation rule.  If you want to 
override, use a more specific datatype in the rdf:datatype attribute.

I guess I'm missing something.
