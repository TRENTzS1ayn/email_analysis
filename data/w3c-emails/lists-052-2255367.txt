I agree that we should reject the comments.

I think we are trying to look at this in too much detail. Insofar
as RDF is concerned, an XSD union datatype is just an rdfs:Datatype,
i.e., RDF doesn't see that it is a union datatype. That's irrelevant.

The behavior of the union datatype is the same as for any rdfs:Datatype.
It has a lexical space, a value space, and an N:1 mapping from lexical
to value space. Period. The fact that the datatype in question is
a union datatype and the ordering of the component datatypes is taken
into account as part of the realization of its L2V mapping is completely
irrelevant to RDF Datatyping.

Given an XSD union datatype, and a lexical form, that lexical form
maps to one and only one value -- insofar as it is used with RDF.

xsi:type has no relevance to RDF and therefore one cannot use it
within RDF/XML to force some other mapping other than defined by
the union datatype definition.
