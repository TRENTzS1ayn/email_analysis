Jeremy,

I think we have consensus, from our email discussions about the Concepts 
document, that the preferred term for the syntactic component is "predicate".

I don't think we've said anything about the term "property" used in 
isolation.  The phrase "Properties of I" that I used was taken directly 
from the semantics document cited, which is why I used that particular form 
of words, and why I introduced the Interpretation (I) to give it context.

I think I was quite careful not to claim more than we've agreed or was 
already stated in the documents.

As it happens, I'm not sure that trying to say that unqualified "property" 
means the semantic member of IP would be particularly helpful.  I've been 
muddled about this in the past, so I tend to think it would be better not 
to create a new "term of art" unless we really have to.
