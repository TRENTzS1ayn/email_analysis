I've had an offlist suggestion that the concepts doc call out specifically 
the xml schema datatypes that shouldn't be used in RDF.  The current text 
gives and example of Qname.  The request is to give a list.  I'm making 
this as a suggestion for the editors to consider as an editorial 
change.  Perhaps the list in the Owl specs could be reused or referenced.
