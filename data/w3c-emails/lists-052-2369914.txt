I proposed to postpone it in this message.

This is recorded as a resolution to reject.

This action hints it must have been a postponement.

The IRC http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-04-25 doesn't
show it as a reject.  So I'm assuming that it is the (unapproved)
minutes that are in error.

PS (I need the postponed issue assigned URI before I can respond to
xmlsch-10 or this)
