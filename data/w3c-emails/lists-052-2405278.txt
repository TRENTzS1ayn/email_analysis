You objected to preserving something you are recorded as
the author of in DAML+OIL, i.e. the
   <node> rdf:type rdf:List .
triples in the DAML collections (now RDF collections) design.

I assume you are representing Tim's original comment and W3C so I
primarily need information from others to get a way to resolve the
for/against/abstain tie in the last teclon or new information from webont.
