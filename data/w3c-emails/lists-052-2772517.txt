This was asked for ages ago and I drafted it but didn't send it out publically.
It's in reply to a comment of Chris Lilley who asked why we didn't point
to SVG's use of RDF metadata.:

>... I request (as an individual commentor) that you do
>explicitly discuss embedding of RDF within SVG in your document. A new
>section 10 "Using RDF/XML with SVG" would seem appropriate. I would be
>happy to help draft such a section.

which Brian forwarded in April
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0020.html

There is always scope to expand the text below futher however my only
real issue is which SVG version(s) to mention.  Should I mention SVG 1.0
and 1.1 since both are recommendations?

Intended to go in current editor's draft of the RDF/XML revised
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/
as a new section 10

<h2>
<a id="section-rdf-in-SVG" name="section-rdf-in-SVG">10 Using RDF/XML with SVG (Informative)</a>
</h2>

<p>There is a standardized approach for associating RDF compatible
metadata with SVG - the metadata element which was explicitly
designed for this purpose as defined in 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/metadata.html">SVG metadata</a> in
the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0 Specification</a>
<a href="#ref-svg">[SVG]</a>.
</p>

<p>This document contains two example graphs in SVG with such
embedded RDF/XML inside the metadata element:
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/figure1.svg">figure 1</a>
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/figure2.svg">figure 2</a>.
</p>
