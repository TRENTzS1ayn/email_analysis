Thanks for the positive reply. I see that
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0020.html
suggested asking me to prepare such a section, but unfortunately did
not copy me, so i was unaware of this discussion until today.

May I assume from todays message that the intention is to add this
section 10?

Sure, point to 1.1 as well, it says the same as 1.0 does. 1.0 was
where the facility was introduced. 1.1 merely modularises 1.0.

The draft text looks good and its inclusion would satisfy my requirements.
