Per http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-11
"Lists are not well formed" the RDFS spec now has reworded text for 
the collections vocab, following Peter's suggestion.

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0277.html
for the discussion that led to this text.

I need some advice:

 - what we agreed w/ Peter was text for 'rdf:first' and the assumption 
   that similar changes would be needed for 'at least' rdf:List,
   rdf:rest.

 - I've tried to make such changes, could do with a sanity check 
   especially rdf:nil seems awkward.


Thanks. Sorry for the delay, am down to the last and vaguest issue now,
ie. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-11
