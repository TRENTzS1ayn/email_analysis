Peter,

re http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-11

I believe the current editors copy of RDF Schema is up to date with all
our Last Call issues and other substantive editorial changes, with the 
exception of this issue, pfps-11 "rdfs:comment implies entailments". We
currently have no proposal on the table for closing this issue; your
editorial suggestions on this matter would be very welcome.

Editor's working copy: 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/

It is a while since this was initially raised, and the Semantics
document has gone through various edits. Is it possible that your
concern has been addressed in that document, and that we could wrap up
pfps-11 through adding an appropriate cross-reference to Semantics?

Regarding the related issue (it was raised in the same thread) "Lists 
are not well formed", the rdf:List and related vocabulary has been 
re-described using a form of words based on our agreement in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0277.html
new text is now in section 5.2 RDF Collections, starting at:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_collectionvocab
If you could take a look at this I'd be grateful.

cheers,

Dan
