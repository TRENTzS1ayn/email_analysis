I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here (if you really mean danc-01). 
  The Primer doesn't discuss graph equality.  It also doesn't say 
anything about literals having language identifiers (and I seem to 
remember the WG taking an explicit decision that that was OK, although 
we can add that material if you want).

done:  see primerLCC-027 in the changes list (although, as Dave has 
noted in his comments, explaining this at the appropriate point in the 
Primer requires eliding what rdf knows vs. what rdfs knows).

One bullet in Section 5.5 was changed where someone had pointed out a 
problem here (although this referred to class itself).  I'm not sure 
what other wording in the Primer might cause someone to think that these 
concepts were being used intensionally .
