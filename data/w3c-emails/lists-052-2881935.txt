Really? The exact nature of integers is not specified;
just various relationships like addition and
multiplication of them.

If it bothers you, then feel free to suggest an alternative.

We could pick any set that's in 1-1 correspondence
with the lexical space; e.g. pairs
(humpty-dumpty, lexical-value)

or perhaps less churlishly...
(http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral, lexical-value)

They don't have to guess; what Pat wrote tells them everything
they need to know.

How to construct an infoset and how to compare them isn't
specified.
