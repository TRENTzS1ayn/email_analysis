Thanks, this was useful. Current status of my actions below. 

Short version: I think I'm finally up to date w/ RDFS edits except some 
minor presentational work. Awaiting feedback from Peter (and WG) 
on pfps-11 / pfps-12; pfps-11 in particular being rather vague and open-ended.

Done (finally). I referenced the issue and the public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf
list as follows:
[[
Note: that this technique creates a mixed-format document which cannot
(as of August 2003) be validated as HTML. The RDFCore Working Group
consequently encourage metadata to be linked from rather than embedded
in your HTML documents. See the RDF Core issue resolution on this topic
for details. The public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf mailing list has been
established to investigate strategies for embedding RDF that support
HTML validation

TODO.

Done. I didn't find any.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_reificationvocab
does that to my satisfaction. I can't think of a concise way of adding a 
bigger health warning for the monster that is reification.

Proposed done.

> ACTION 2003-04-11#6 danbri
>  To propose eight resolutions for the next telecon

Stale. We have resolutions for everything except pfps-11, and closures 
for everything except that and pfps-12.

All done except the re-ordering for presentation purposes, which is a 
minor editorial still on my todo list.
