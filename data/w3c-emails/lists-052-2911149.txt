No, my concerns have not yet been addressed.  

For example, the wording about rdf:Statement indicates that rdf:Statement
is the class of RDF statements, which are made by RDF triples.  This goes
far, far beyond what rdf:Statement actually provides.

Here is some proposed text

5.3.1 rdf:Statement

rdf:Statement is an instance of rdfs:Class.

rdf:Statement is the domain of the properties rdf:predicate, rdf:subject
and rdf:object.  Different individual rdf:Statement instances may have the
same values for their rdf:predicate, rdf:subject and rdf:object properties.

5.3.2 rdf:subject

A triple of the form
S rdf:subject R .
states that the rdf:subject of S is R.

The rdfs:domain of rdf:subject is rdf:Statement.  The rdfs:range of
rdf:subject is rdfs:Resource.

[and so on]

Other changes

5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy

... that may be used to indicate ...

A triple of the form 
S rdfs:isDefinedBy O .
states that the some aspect of the resource O might provide defining
information about S.

This looks much better, except the stuff about L rdf:rest rdf:nil implying
that L ``has one item''.  It would be much better to say that this means
that the rest-of-list of L is empty.
