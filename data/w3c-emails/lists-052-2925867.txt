I will try to get into the telecon near the end but its unlikely. 
SOrry, guys. I think the sematnics is now OK if we can clean up the 
XML literals stuff in concpets.

Patrick, don't WORRY about it. Nobody can say definitely what 
integers really are. If it bothers you extremely, we could say that 
XML values are not specified but can be taken to be items in the 
XPath node-set, with idenitty determined by exclusive 
canonicalization (ref 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#def-exclusive-canonical-XML 
para 6 after the diagram, 'the exclusive can form ...is....of the 
XPath nodeset...prodiced by the method....')
