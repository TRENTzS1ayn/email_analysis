Below a summary of where we're up to with RDFS. Where WG input needed,
I've *flagged* it.


I've done the admin to get 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#danc-04
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#eikon-01 closures
ack'd by the issue raised.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-24 'what is
rdfs', Peter ack'd the edits I made, closing this. Minor followup re 
the intro parag from Appendix A, since it mentions the 'rdf core vocab'
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0165.html

 * review needed on my proposed rewording of that sentence *


http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-11 
ie. "rdfs:comment implies entailments" -- awaiting suggestion from Peter
now that he has a complete RDFS to review.

Ah, as I type his suggestion arrives:
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0014.html

 *can I get some help reviewing this?*
 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-12
wellformed lists -- spec is updated, awaiting review from WG + Peter.


NEW ISSUE: bug in rdfs:member's rdfs:comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0167.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0012.html
proposed change to the rdfs:comment of rdfs:member:

  rdfs:member, "A member of the subject resource."
  *wg review needed*
  
  
Other / admin:

It is soon time to update the RDF schema at 
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# and also I hope
http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

 * schema for schema(s) work * 
 we have nobody lined up to write/update the RDF Schema for the
 latter, and disentangle it from the RDFS currently in the appendix to 
 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/ that 
 will go to the RDFS namespace URI.
 
Note that
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/rdfs-namespace.xml
currently makes assertions about classes and properties from both
namespaces.
