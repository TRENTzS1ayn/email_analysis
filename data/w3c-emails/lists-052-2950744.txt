Pat - I believe I fully agree with you on that 1:1 thing

In a similar sense, one could maybe argue that
" 2 "^^xsd:int is not having an illegal lexical value
but a non-canonical lexical value ;-)

Regarding XML literals, I have one request to make to the WG, in its
deliberations on this topic. Speaking as the semantics editor, I
really do not give a damn what XML literal values are defined to
actually BE. What I do care about, a lot, is this:  whatever they are
defined to be, that the lexical-to-value mapping from the legal
lexical forms is precisely and unambiguously 1:1. We have already
canonicalized the lexical forms about as strongly as the combined
forces of XML and RDF are able to canonicalize them; the operational
point of doing this is so that an RDF engine can compare equality of
literal values by comparing identity of lexical form, and we don't
have to have special inference rules which substitute different but
co-referring XML forms one for another in all possible ways.  If we
lose this 1:1 nature of the mapping, then we might as well not have
bothered to have a canonicalized lexical form. SO please don't do
anything that runs a risk of losing that property. I do not know if
having lexical-to-value be UTF-8 encoding does so or not. I would
rather not have to know, to be honest.

Pat
