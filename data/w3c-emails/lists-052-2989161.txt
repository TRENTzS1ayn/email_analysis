I'm saying we are *defining* it this way. No debate is possible.

Thats exactly what I am doing. Its OUR set, and we are saying that 
its not the same as any Unicode or XML Schema set. However, it seems 
to me that we could say:

..... is not specified, but can  be thought of as the Xpath nodeset 
of the XML literal.

The problem with saying that it IS almost anything defined by someone 
else, is that we get into arcane debates about the exact edges of the 
identity criteria for those things. Peter and Brian and Jeremy and 
Graham can legitimately disagree about issues like whether <br></br> 
and <br /> indicate the same one of these things or not. The only way 
to break out of this tangle is either to re-write the entire XML 
document suite more coherently as though it were written  with a 
single voice (not an option - CMSMcQ just quoted Saussure at me, for 
God's sake; when it gets to Derrida I am out of here) or else to just 
say as clearly as possible what assumptions WE are making about these 
things.  And my suggestion for doing the latter is to make them 
distinct from everything else they can possibly be confused with. 
Then later on, other spec writers are free to say that what they are 
talking about is the same as what we are talking about, if they want 
to do that.

I have no idea.

I am surprised that you would object to the above on the grounds that 
we arent being honest, but you are willing to swallow the idea of an 
infoset. I have read this document more times than I want to admit, 
and I still have absolutely no idea what infosets ARE.   The document 
never tells you : it just says they are an abstract set satisfying 
certain rather complicated conditions. My proposal is to do the same, 
but with much simpler conditions.

My only worry is, how do I tell when two XML literals denote the same 
infoset? And will Peter, you , me and uncle Tom Cobbley come to the 
same conclusions?
