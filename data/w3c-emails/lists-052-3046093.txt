Brian, just to confirm what was said briefly at the telecon.

AFAIK, the semantics document is now finished and ready to go. Qu-03 
and Pan-01 are both OK; pfps-05 is now fixed and Peter has not yet 
objected to it; pfps-04 may still be a problem but I do not think 
that this can be fixed from within semantics, but must be fixed in 
Concepts. The key point to avoid a major rewrite in Semantics is to 
preserve the claim made in the 3rd paragraph in section 3, viz:

"Note that the XML values of well-typed XML literals are in precise 
1:1 correspondence with the XML literal strings of such literals, but 
are not themselves character strings."

As long as this is somehow arranged to be true, the XML literal stuff 
in Semantics will be OK.

Tomorrow I take off for Ca for about 6 weeks. I will be reading email 
and taking part as usual but at a somewhat lower activity level, so 
may not be able to react to urgent stuff within 24 hours. Use the 650 
number or the cell phone to call me (on Pacific time) if you need to 
talk about anything.

Pat
