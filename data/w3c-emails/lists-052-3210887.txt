Well, maybe we have a terminology problem then, because when you said 
"That is not RDF/XML", I thought you meant it wasn't syntactically 
legal, and wouldn't validate.  It seems to me that that if syntax is not 
legal RDF/XML, a correctly-operating RDF/XML parser should say so. 
Generating non-intuitive results from legal RDF/XML syntax is a separate 
issue (people have expressed amazement as what parseType="Collection" 
does, for example!)
