In that case it must be doing you more good than me.

I'm still at the point of looking for a use case to demonstrate that 
markup integrity is a real problem.

You suggested that your issue has to do with multiple users doing the 
same thing differently and I asked you to refine the use case we have 
been discussing to better illustrate your issue.

I don't see how this use case illustrates a problem with markup 
integrity; rather it assumes that problem.
