I'd missed that 1st time around. Nice summary.

I can live with this, something along lines of 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0452.html

Slight nervousness - which version of XPath?
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/ isn't done yet, but when it is, folk might
be dissapointed if RDFCore has just gone to REC with a normative
reference to the ageing 1.0 Xpath.

Some sympathy there.

I have no strong view (except lately I keep running into use cases for 
properties-of-literals, but that I guess is water under the bridge...).
