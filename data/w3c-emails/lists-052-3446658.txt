Thanks Brian, looks good to me.

I'd like to see this installed at the M+S namespace URI asap, with a 
couple days advance warning to www-rdf-interest@w3.org so that we can 
flush out any problems / implementor concerns asap. Having recently done
the RDF Schema namespace upgrade, I'd be happy to do the admin for this
one, once the WG, Eric and Ralph are in agreement.

cheers,

Dan
