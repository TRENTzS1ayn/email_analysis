I think that's a con, not a pro. Currently we have one datatype for
XMLLiteral; preserving the ability to produce subtypes is important.

What Pat said: clearly XMLLiterlas can be lots of different things to
different people. I don't think Pat's idea was "vague". Basically for
testing purposes, we need an equivalence relationship that can tell when
one XMLLiteral is the same as the other. However, u to now many
"concrete" suggestions for the value space have aimed at this
equivalence relationship and provided it by making the value space
"just another lexical form" - ie, just another representation.

There are reasons why you'd want to consider XML as "rich text" - I18N.
There are reasons why you'd want to treat it as something navigable with
the DOM.
There are probably even reasons why you'd want to consider it an octet
sequence, although they escpae me for the moment.
There are bugger-all reasons to exclude two out of three of the use
cases by picking just one of the above. Pat's option makes sense.
