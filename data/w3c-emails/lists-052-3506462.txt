Sorry, if I've not been clear.  With option A, I had in mind something 
close to what Pat suggested.  This includes the notion that the mapping 
from the lex space to the value space of xml literals is 1:1.

Thus it is possible to test whether xml literal values are equal by 
comparing their lexical forms.

Thanks for being brief Patrick, but in this case I could do with a 
reminder.  I have had a search and didn't find the post(s) you refer to. 
  Could you provide a link?

The trouble with that seems to be that it fails to distinguish between 
markup and text, e.g.

   _:a eg:prop "&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;" .

rdf entails

   _:a eg:prop "<br></br>"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .

I think there is general agreement that is a bad thing.
