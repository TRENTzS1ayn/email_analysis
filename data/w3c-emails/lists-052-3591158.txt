xmlsch-02 is about whitespace processing of datatypes.  We previously 
decided that since " 1 "  is not in the lexical space of xsd:decimal, 
" 1 "^^xsd:decimal does not denote a literal and created some test cases 
to illustrate this.

It turns out the many implementations are failing these test cases. 
Some use the Xerces xsd implementation which happily translates " 1 " to 
  1.  Before he went on vacation jjc indicated to me that maybe we 
should think again about this one.

Does anyone know enough about whitespace processing in xml schema 
datatypes to suggest an alternative way to handle this.  I don't know 
enough, so am not qualified.
