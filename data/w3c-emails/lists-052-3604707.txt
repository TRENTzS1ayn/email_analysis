Looks good, Brian.   (I didn't review it for completeness.)

Yes, since you want to keep the original namespace name
I feel that it would be inappropriate to use new syntax in any
RDF content at that namespace URI until at least Proposed Rec.

All good things to have added.  We didn't do it in the original
content as RDFS wasn't available to us at the time.

Thanks very much for doing this task, Brian.
