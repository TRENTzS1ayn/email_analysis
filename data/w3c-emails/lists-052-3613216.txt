Right, I also believe that rdf.rdf is correct.
I checked it with Cwm and Jena and compared it
with what we assumed and found one difference
which is
  rdf:predicate rdfs:range rdf:Property .
where we had
  rdf:predicate rdfs:range rdfs:Resource .
which we took from the "RDFS axiomatic triples" table
in the "RDF Semantics Editors Draft July 31"
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdfs_interp
I propose that the more precise triple is in the MT
(both the table and the LBase translation).

Looks good, Brian.   (I didn't review it for completeness.)

Why not put that text inside a dc:description property?

Ralph considered this important, at least until we get to rec.

Yes, since you want to keep the original namespace name
I feel that it would be inappropriate to use new syntax in any
RDF content at that namespace URI until at least Proposed Rec.

All good things to have added.  We didn't do it in the original
content as RDFS wasn't available to us at the time.

Thanks very much for doing this task, Brian.
