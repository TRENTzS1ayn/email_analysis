  I just sent one: we would need to decide which version of XPath to
  reference, and understand any costs/risks re blessing XPath 1.0 when 2.0
  is looming.

Thanks. 

Can someone more familiar with the W3C process clarify if/how
choosing XPath 2.0 might delay the rec process for RDF?

Isn't it one level of lag allowed for dependent specs? So if XPath 2.0
is at CR, RDF could reference it and still go to PR? But XPath 2.0
would need to go to PR before RDF could go to Rec?
