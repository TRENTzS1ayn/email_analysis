Yeah, sort of.  And the Unicode characters in the lexical form that
can't be written in XML.

Only those that deal with mapping between the abstract syntax and the
XML syntax (either direction).  

The "pure" RDF applications work on graphs and need have no XML-specific
code.  XML Literals just look like any other datatype to RDF graph
applications and should need no extra support in the graph.

Yes, both produce the same literal value, as given above
(well, the " need quoting.  In N-triples:
  "<eg2:br xmlns:eg2=\"http://example.com/\"></eg2:br>"
)
