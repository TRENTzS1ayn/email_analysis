The point is, we do NO checking on the value of the rdf:datatype content.
So you can encode something that might be a non exc-C14N
Unicode string (caveats, after octets->de-utf8ing).  That means you
can introduce ill-formed XML into the graph and if you get into
entailments, these have no literal denotation.

So if this remains this way, applications of RDF that just deal with the
graph need to have XML parsers and exc-C14N checkers, even if they
never used rdf/xml.  Not that it's hard, XML tools are everywhere.
