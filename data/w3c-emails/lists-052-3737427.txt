Brian, (& everyone else),

Did you get a chance to review Peter's proposed closure for pfps-11?

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0014.html

I can live with the specific changes he proposes there, but have had 
difficulty extrapolating from those examples to figure out what
"[and so on]" would amount to. Suggestions?

Dan
