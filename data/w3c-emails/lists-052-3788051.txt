ACTION 2002-02-28#13 frankM
  update primer to reflect disposition of danc-01


I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here (if you really mean danc-01). 
  The Primer doesn't discuss graph equality.  It also doesn't say 
anything about literals having language identifiers (and I seem to 
remember the WG taking an explicit decision that that was OK, although 
we can add that material if you want).
