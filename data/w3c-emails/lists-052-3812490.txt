RDF has a custom solution for plain literals.
The same solution would work for XML Literals,
and was in the last call document. There is a difference
between asking to keep some consistency in the current
(up to Last Call) design, and bringing in new consistency
requirements at this late stage.

I18N doesn't want to require RDF to solve all XML problems.
But we obviously care about a good solution for
language information.

If we had a cure, that would be fine. Currently, we
don't. And we don't want the patient to feel pain
(or loose a limb), so we prefer treating the symptoms
to doing nothing. I'm sure if you were the patient,
you would want to do the same.

We wouldn't mind if that happened. When we met originally
with RDF Core, we were told about the problem that is
now solved by xml:lang=''. We carefully did our homework
and solved this problem. If we had been told 1.5 years
ago that RDF needs a complete solution for XML fragments,
then we could have tried to contribute to that solution.
Now it's too late for this, I guess.

I would definitely like to. Of course, one easy solution
would be to move back to the Last Call stage, or choose
a solution that is closer to Last Call than the one we
currently have.
