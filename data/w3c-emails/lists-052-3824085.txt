ACTION 20030627#4 Frank
  to check primer for intensional use of subClassOf/subPropertyOf.


One bullet in Section 5.5 was changed where someone had pointed out a 
problem here (although this referred to class itself).  I'm not sure 
what other wording in the Primer might cause someone to think that these 
concepts were being used intensionally .
