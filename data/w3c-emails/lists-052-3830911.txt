Peter was right, and I have since changed the translation to avoid 
this mistake. Lbase encloses strings inside single quotes, and 
escapes single-quote characters by prefixing them with backslash, and 
also escapes backslash with itself. In retrospect, this was probably 
a mistake, and (unless Guha objects) we will change it in the next 
version of the Lbase note, avoiding character escaping altogether. 
In the meantime, the Semantics document simply omits all character 
escaping, and has a note in the text that the translation of strings 
is simplified and that any implementation based on this translation 
might need to pay closer attention to the treatment of special 
characters in Lbase strings.

A full fix requires a fix to the Lbase note.  I plan that that 
revision will include a complete Lbase translation of RDF/S/OWL.

PS. Peter's other point is also correct, but that decision was 
deliberate, and the text stated that it was; I have since tweaked the 
text to draw attention to this point more directly, to avoid 
confusion.
