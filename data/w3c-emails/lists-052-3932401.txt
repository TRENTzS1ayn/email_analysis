With big thanks to Max Froumentin and other French W3C team members, 
we now have a fresh translation of the rdfs:label and rdfs:comment 
text for all RDF Core terms, ie. both schemas. Since MaxF is in Bristol 
it seemed a good chance to get this updated, so we've just had the odd 
experience of translating the likes of "the subject of the subject RDF statement."

There were a fair few places where Max said it sounds a bit odd, but I 
believe those are mostly RDF's oddities rather than the translation. I
think it is pretty faithful and literal, rather than attempting any
major rephrasings.

I've commited this into our shadow TR space,
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/combined-ns-translation.rdf.fr

Deployment options: 
Ralph asked that we restore the French additions back into the document
at the namespace URI. We could do this, but I fear it will create
maintainance issues for us in the post-REC future. With the RDFS
namespace doc, we always had an rdfs:seeAlso hypertext pointer to a
'more info' RDF file, I propose that we use that file, either directly
or as a multi-lingual table of contents for this and other translations.
A similar seeAlso pointer could be added to the M+S namespace. I propose
they point to a single common 'French translation' document for now,
rather than partitioning it into 2. I believe this will help establish 
the importance of hypertext linking in RDF documents (the 'Web' in
'Semantic Web') as well as provide a simple model for other translators
to copy. I'm willing to be persuaded of other designs though; there
doesn't seem to me to be an obviously 'right way' to deploy this. Ralph,
do you have a strong preference for embedding the French translation
rather than referencing it?

There are also issues / opportunities w.r.t. use of language negotiation 
of such schemas, but that is too complicated and confusing for me to
have any clear thoughts on right now. Suggestions welcomed...

cheers,

Dan
