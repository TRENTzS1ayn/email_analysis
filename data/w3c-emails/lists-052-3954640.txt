Using the infoset you are supposed to say which bits of it are relevant:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#conformance

since rdf:XMLLiteral depends on exc-c14n which depends on xpath, we depend
on  the same information items (not the document). I suggest it is not our
place to articulate those.

In --
2.2 Element Information Items
2.3 Attribute Information Items
2.4 Processing Instruction Information Items
2.6 Character Information Items
2.7 Comment Information Items
2.11 Namespace Information Items

Out --
2.1 The Document Information Item
2.5 Unexpanded Entity Reference Information Items
2.8 The Document Type Declaration Information Item
2.9 Unparsed Entity Information Items
2.10 Notation Information Items

????

i.e. we can follow the specs from our current design thru to Xpath. While
there is presumably a link between xpath and infoset, that looks more
difficult. So I cautiously favour remaining silent, and leaving XMLers to
fill in the gaps if any.
