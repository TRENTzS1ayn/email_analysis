Thanks, Max and Dan!

I see this has only one language declaration:

  <owl:Ontology xml:lang="fr" rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"   dc:title="Le vocabulaire de RDF et RDF Schema." />

and this surprises me.  None of the strings in this document
are declared to be in 'fr' (hmm.  XML question -- does xml:lang
apply to the values of any attributes, such as the dc:title in the
case above?  I dunno.  But I am certain that there's no way an
RDF processor or an XML processor will know the labels and
comments are intended to be in French.)

yes, this proposal makes sense to me.
