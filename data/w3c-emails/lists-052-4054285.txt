This may raise more questions than it answers, but here's a stab for 
discussion:

[[
Asserts that the object is a member of, or in some sense "belongs to" the 
subject resource.  It is intended to be used as a common relationship 
between containers and all of their members, but is not so restricted and 
may be used with subjects that are not of type rdfrs:Container.
]]

The overall vagueness of this leaves me wondering *why* rdfs:member doesn't 
have a domain of rdfs:Container.

(If this issue is settled by the time this message is received, please 
ignore it.)
