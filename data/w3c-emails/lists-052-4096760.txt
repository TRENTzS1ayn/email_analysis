I agree that the choice of octet sequences is probably confusing.  In that, 
I understood we were simply following an existing spec.

I'm not sure that I follow the concern with (C):  XML is an inherently 
character-sequence-based format, so why not use a form of denotation that 
contains that sequence.  To do that for, say, numbers is unhelpful and 
unnecessary IMO (and I believe has led to some shortcomings in XML schema 
datatype treatment of numbers).

In particular, the form (C) asserts precisely the condition that Pat 
requires for the semantics: a 1:1 correspondence between lexical and 
denoted forms.

Another advantage of (C), it seems to me, is that it may make it easier to 
achieve something approaching the unification between plain literals and 
XML literals that Martin desires:  it would be a relatively easy for an 
application to interpret a sequence of characters S in a context where text 
is expected to be equivalent to (rdf:XMLLiteral,S).
