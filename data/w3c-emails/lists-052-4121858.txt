I noticed when validating the parseType="Collection" example from the 
Primer that the W3C RDF Validator still generates rdf:type rdf:List 
triples for the blank nodes, which I believe we decided was no longer 
supposed to happen in resolving issue tbl-03.  This should probably be 
fixed at some point.  Either that or people will complain that the graph 
  in the Primer (which I changed to take all that stuff out) doesn't 
match the graph generated by the Validator.
