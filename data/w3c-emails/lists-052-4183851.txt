Err... That's right. We changed it.

Perhaps it remains an open question whether we require RDF
parsers to check the validity of lexical forms explicitly
specified with rdf:datatype="&rdf;XMLLiteral". I (perhaps
mistakenly) thought we didn't want to impose such a requirement
on RDF parsers. Perhaps we do.
