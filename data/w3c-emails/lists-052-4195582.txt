I'm not necessarily suggesting that we *ought* to impose such a 
requirement, just pointing out that it seems to break the model that we 
describe for other datatypes.  And I think it'll be natural for people 
to wonder exactly how (or when) the validity of an instance of 
rdf:XMLLiteral gets determined, if RDF software doesn't do it.  If we 
continue our litergy that says we're not defining a processing model, I 
don't see how this can be dependent on whether we imagine an RDF/XML 
parser on top of an XML parser (for example).  Even though we define 
RDF/XML as the standard language for serializing RDF graphs, that 
language is defined in terms of how the RDF/XML generates triples.  It's 
at the level of triples that this validity checking would have to be 
done.  Presumably it's at this level that whether subjects and 
predicates are valid URIrefs is determined, and whether any literals 
specified are valid literals.

I'd note that an alternative would be to treat rdf:XMLLiteral sort of 
like we treat other datatypes, except that we (RDF) have defined a 
built-in name for it.  That is, we don't define XML (any more than we 
define xsd:integer) but we know people are presumably going to want to 
use XML literals, so we provide this datatype, which is likely to be 
widely available (but if it is made available in a particular RDF 
implementation, the implementation has to provide the appropriate 
software to support the RDF-defined datatype model, and the datatype 
semantics).  I don't really care, except if we're going to break the 
model, I think we need to say so.
