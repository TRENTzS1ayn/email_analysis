Just to clarify:  the "model" I'm referring to is that software that 
purports to support a given datatype is responsible for being able to 
determine the validity of lexical forms for the datatype and, given a 
lexical form, determine the proper value according to that datatype (at 
least, that's what I understand the "model" to be).  What I'm suggesting 
breaks the model in the case of rdf:XMLLiteral isn't that RDF parsers 
would "pay it special attention" (the "model" *requires* that it be paid 
special attention), it's that it would be *optional*.  In other words, 
if RDF software works for "its" datatype (rdf:XMLLiteral) the way I 
understand other software is supposed to work for "their" datatypes, RDF 
software ought to check the validity of lexical forms for rdf:XMLLiteral.

Conversely, would we consider it legitimate according to our model for 
RDF datatypes if software that purported to support xsd:integer got the 
typed literal "pumpkin"^^xsd:integer for John Smith's age (to quote an 
example from the Primer) and failed to complain (or even check)?

It *is* a syntax check, but it seems to me there are (at least 
potentially) two syntaxes involved.  One is the lexical form defined for 
rdf:XMLLiteral.  This is the lexical form defined at the graph level 
(whether the original source syntax that produced the graph was RDF/XML 
or not).  The second is what you have to write in RDF/XML (since it's an 
XML markup language) to carry that lexical form through the XML to the 
graph.

I repeat, it's not special attention given to rdf:XMLLiteral by RDF 
parsers that seems to break the model, it's that this attention would be 
optional.
