Hello Jeremy,

As I already said in another context, this looks like a lot of
good work and progress. Some more comments below.

I think you can directly refer to production [43] of the
XML specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-content).
This allows some stuff like CDATA sections that canonical
XML will exclude, but otherwise is exactly what you need.

I think 'when encoded as [UTF-8]' would be slightly easier
to understand than 'under [UTF-8] encoding'.

Some people don't like notes. But they often help understand
a spec better, and we all have made experiences about how not
understanding a spec (or understanding it differently) has hurt us.

I'm confused here. Graham said that RDF allowed control characters,
but XML 1.1 doesn't, and I showed him that it did. But XML 1.0
doesn't.


>If the notes add clarity then it is probably best to keep them.

I think both notes add clarity. From an i18n viewpoint, note (3)
is definitely helpful. For XML people, note (2) will be helpful,
although it may be better to change 'can' to 'may', i.e.
"XML values may be thought of as...". But that's a minor detail.


Regards,    Martin.
