I don't think it makes any difference at all to that issue.

But in any case, we cannot go in two opposite 
directions at the same time.  Datatypes values 
are NOT like text.  We could treat XML literals 
much more like text, but that would require us to 
not treat rdf:XMLliteral as a datatype.  The WG 
seems to be unwilling to go in that direction. As 
long as XML literals are treated as typed 
literals they are not being thought of as text. 
If the result disappoints i18n, and if we feel 
that this is the way RDF should go, then we must 
simply decide to disappoint them. If we wish to 
accede to their demands, then we must choose some 
other way to handle XML literals. I no longer 
greatly care which we choose, but I do care that 
we do not spend the next 20 years vacillating one 
way and then the other, trying to keep everyone 
happy. It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep everyone happy.
