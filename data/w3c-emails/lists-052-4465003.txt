All of this is correct. There have been many 
errors of detail, many of which you have caught, 
and for which detailed checking I am grateful. 
However, the W3C process requires us to identify, 
respond to and gain reactions to particular 
comments, one at a time. The prehistory of these 
comments has to be put aside in order that the 
process may be formally closed; in any case, the 
prehistory seems to me to be irrelevant to the 
current issue. There were many reasons (some of 
them personal, some of them concerned with global 
timeschedules) why we went to LC with errors in 
the document. If you feel personally offended by 
this, I am sorry that you should have felt that 
this action was in any way a personal affront: it 
was not meant or intended to be so.

>In the 31 July 2003 version of RDF Semantics, the RDFS entailment rules are

I do not believe this to be true, and you have 
not provided any evidence for it. Your message 
referring to the 31 July 2003 version complained 
that you "had hoped that the entailment rules 
would finally end up as complete syntactic 
characterizations of entailment." You gave no 
indication what had given rise to this hope, and 
it was not one that you had ever expressed 
before.?? No version of the semantics document 
has ever claimed to offer a set of rules which is 
complete in this strong sense ; strong 
completeness was never the goal of the rule 
systems.  This was perfectly clear in the LC 
version of the documents.

If this is what you now mean by 'incomplete', 
then the sense of this word has changed between 
your previous comments, cited earlier, and your 
recent response.

I believe that the rules are complete in the 
sense stated in the document, a sense which has 
been stable since the very first version of the 
document.

>  I view this as distasteful, even just by itself.

Under the circumstances, I do not feel obliged to 
respond to this. I do not agree with it, 
naturally enough. If this is a comment, then I 
will advise the WG not to accept it. In the 
meantime, however, we still need a response from 
you on substance of the previous comment, to wit, 
the completeness of the entailment rules, in the 
sense stated in the text.

There is a proof sketch in the document which you 
might find useful; and the document has been 
reorganized so as to make the correspondences 
between the semantic conditions and the 
entailment rules more apparent.

>I believe that my messages concerning this issue have not gone beyond the
>incompleteness of the RDF closure (now entailment) rules.

Until recently that was true, and the response to 
which I was referring in my message also referred 
to completeness of the rules in the sense that we 
have been discussing until recently.  But as I 
indicated, the meaning of 'complete' seems to 
have changed, which is why we are having this 
debate.  Your 'dissatisfaction' expressed on the 
3 August seems to refer to a new topic.

I do not accept this. The WG has tried to adhere 
to W3C process rules as far as possible. We 
allowed comments for a considerable period after 
the LC, and followed up with you and other 
commentors to clarify the issues that were 
raised. We have responded as promptly as possible 
to subsequent comments and observations of a 
technical nature; but at some stage this process 
has to stop. I do not accept that your having 
made a detailed technical observation on the LC 
documents gives you an open-ended licence to 
create new objections or raise new 
dissatisfactions.

The W3C process requires us to identify comments, 
respond to them and to seek acceptance of the 
responses, one at a time.

Of course other aspects need not be excluded from 
consideration; however, the W3C process requires 
us to assign discussion to threads rooted in the 
archived comments.

That is true, but that issue has been considered 
on another thread rooted in a LC comment by you, 
archived as pfps-06. I have deliberately 
refrained from asking you to respond on that 
thread until the issue has been settled.

I have made it clear to the WG that the semantics 
requires that XML literals denote literal values 
which are 1:1 with the lexical forms of the 
literals but distinct from them (and from 
xsd:strings). These conditions are stated 
explicitly in the semantics document. Please 
assume that these conditions will be satisfied 
and review the semantics document on that basis. 
I believe that these conditions are sufficient to 
establish the correctness of the lemmas in the 
document.

>My reading of the treatment of RDF XML literals in RDF Concepts is that

That is not my understanding nor Jeremy's. If you 
are right, the wording will be changed to avoid 
the possibility of this interpretation.  It would 
be helpful if you could respond the Semantics 
document on this basis and to the Concepts 
document on the assumption that its definitions 
are intended to provide this structure.

If the comment pfps-05 is concerned with XML 
literals, can we identify pfps-05 and pfps-06 as 
being essentially the same comment?
