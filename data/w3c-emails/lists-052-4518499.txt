> Do we really want this to be SHOULD. MAY seems more appropriate,

I said MAY last time, and others wanted SHOULD - I suggest a straight show of 
hands should decide this word (I would vote for MAY).

I prefer (a variant of) your wording for the output:

[[
  + Software generating RDF data SHOULD produce lexical forms 
    which do not require whitespace processing.
]]

('fully valid' seems to ask more questions than it answers)
