I'm a bit concerned that some people (particularly those not familiar 
with [RDFMS]) reading the above two sentences might get the impression 
that [RDFMS] defined a normative formal semantics which the current RDF 
specification has somehow removed.  I think something along the lines of 
the following might be more accurate:

"The original RDF Model and Syntax Specification [ RDFMS ] defined a 
vocabulary for describing RDF statements without stating them. [ RDFMS ] 
did not provide a formal semantics for this vocabulary, and the informal 
definition that was provided was somewhat inconsistent [***or 
"confused", or insert some other favorite mildly pejorative term 
instead***]. The current RDF specification does not assign a normative 
formal semantics to this vocabulary.  However, an intended meaning of 
this vocabulary (which generally clarifies the intent of the [ RDFMS ] 
definition) is described here."

Pat, are you satisfied that the Primer does a reasonable job of 
informally introducing the reification vocabulary, and is also 
consistent with the text you've provided?
