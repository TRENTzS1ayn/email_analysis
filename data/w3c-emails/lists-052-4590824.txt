Forwarded from Martin Duerst. The I18N group have decided to object

>Short discussion: change would increase stability with respect
>to new combining characters in future versions of Unicode.
>Martin: In my implementation, would not speed up things, because
>        speed up can be achieved by observing the special category
>        of combining characters that don't appear in any precomposed
>        character that appears in NFC, without changing the definition.
