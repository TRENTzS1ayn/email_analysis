11: I18N Update

I18N are objecting to our current (post-LC) design regarding language 
tagging and XML literals.

B/G Reading:

Minutes I18N Core TF telcon, 2003-08-05

12: Process - next step? CR/LC2/PR/etc.

   In light of objection from I18N and associating highlighting of 
   changes in our (unpublished) specs post-LC, where does this leave our 
   'next stop PR' aspirations?
