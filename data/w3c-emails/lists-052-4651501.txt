To repeat, the sense of 'complete' which makes this assertion true 
has never been used in any version of the document.  You have had 
innumerable opportunities to comment on or object to this design 
before and at LC, so I do not consider that to raise this issue now, 
for the first time, is reasonable or acceptable.

>The RDFS entailment lemma has been changed in a manner unacceptable to me.

I presume that you are referring to the restriction to consistent 
antecedents. If so, then I am afraid that you will have remain 
dissatisfied, as the rules were always designed with this condition 
in mind; it was not stated explicitly because I had failed to note 
that a graph could be RDFS-inconsistent, so thought that the 
condition was satisfied vacuously.  Making this assumption explicit 
is not a change, in my view.

I note that one could obtain a complete set of rules which would not 
need this condition, by adding a rule of the form

xxx ppp "sss"^^rdf:XMLliteral .
ppp rdfs:range rdf:XMLLiteral .

|-

yyy qqq zzz .

where sss is any string which is not a well-formed XML literal 
string.  However, this rule would be of no practical use or 
theoretical interest; it is like the rule of contradiction in a 
natural deduction system. I see no purpose in displaying this shallow 
kind of logical erudition in a normative standard document.
