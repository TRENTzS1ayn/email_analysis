I don't understand this proposal, since the WG has already
discussed the definition in 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0452

during last telecon, identified problems with it, and tasked
Jeremy to write up a revised version.

The issues identified during the last telecon are not IMO editorial
issues.
