Integrating text from Martin and Graham
(see particularly second bullet point UTF-8)

[[

The lexical space
   is the set of all strings:
   + which are well-balanced, self-contained
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-content">
XML content</a> [XML];
   + for which encoding as [UTF-8] yields exclusive Canonical
     XML (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces
     PrefixList ) [XML-XC14N];
   + for which embedding between an arbitrary XML start tag
     and an end tag yields a document conforming to XML
     Namespaces [XML-NS]


The value space is a set of entities, called XML values, which is:
   + disjoint from the lexical space
   + disjoint from the value space of any XML schema datatype [XML-SCHEMA2]
   + disjoint from the set of Unicode character strings [Unicode]
   + in 1:1 correspondence with the lexical space.



The lexical-to-value mapping
    is a one-one mapping from the lexical space onto the value space,
    i.e. it is both injective and surjective.



Note: Not all lexical forms of this datatype are compliant with XML 1.1
[XML 1.1]. If compliance with XML 1.1 is desired, then only those that are
fully normalized according to XML 1.1 should be used.

Note: XML values can be thought of as the [XML Infoset] or
the [XPath] nodeset corresponding to the lexical form, with an appropriate
equality function.

Note: RDF applications may use additional equivalence relations, such as
that which relates an xsd:string with an rdf:XMLLiteral corresponding to a
single text node of the same string.

Graham I think the discussion of the 1-1 mapping is sufficient for the 
equality between the XML values.
We could modify last point in value space to
   + in 1:1 correspondence with the lexical space. (This correspondence 
preserves equality).

but I think it is redundant.
