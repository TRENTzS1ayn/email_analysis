Sorry - we seem to be at cross-purposes - are you happy with:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0185

which is a minor edit of

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0153

about which you said:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0160

"I'm satisfied with this definition."


If that's OK let's change to that message being the one quoted in the 
proposal. I don't think we should get into an argument about how big a 
difference is editorial!

vis -

[[
PROPOSE: accept the definition of rdf:XMLLiteral from

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0185

and action concepts editors to integrate it in the
         editors draft, using  editorial discretion.
]]

Obviously, if you at any stage think I have overreached editorial 
discretion then I would welcome correction.
