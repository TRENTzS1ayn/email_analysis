Yes.

I accept this revised proposal.

Certainly. My concern about the scope of editorial discretion
was that there were key technical points that were missing
from Pat's otherwise excellent definition, and the agreement
by the WG about those technical points IMO exceeded the bounds
of editorial discretion.

Thus, your earlier proposal that the definition be based
on Pat's original text suggested that that text included
all significant technical points, which it didn't, and 
simply required word smithing to achieve its final form.

But I think we're back on track. Sorry if folks have found me
troublesome regarding this.

Cheers,

Patrick
