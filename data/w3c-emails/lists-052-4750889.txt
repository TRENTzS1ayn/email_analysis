The process document

http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr.html#cfi

allows for some features to be labelled as 'at risk'.
[[
In the Call for Implementations, the Working Group MAY identify specific 
features of the technical report as being "features at risk." General 
statements such as "We plan to remove any unimplemented feature" are not 
acceptable; the Working Group MUST precisely identify any features at risk. 
Thus, in response to a Call for Implementations, reviewers can indicate 
whether they would formally object to the removal of the identified features.
]]

We could proceed to CR and label the current XMLLiteral design as 'at risk' 
  (because of the xml:lang issue) and specifically indicate one or two 
other designs that we may change to if implementor feedback indicates the 
current design is broken. We could continue to seek feedback on this issue 
within the SOTD - even the design concerns (IMO).

(WebOnt did this - which is a somewhat liberal reading of the above text)

We could specifically request implementations that:
- provide API or query support for accessing language information in both 
plain literals and XMLLiterals


Given satisfactory implementation reports we can then proceed to PR ... maybe.
