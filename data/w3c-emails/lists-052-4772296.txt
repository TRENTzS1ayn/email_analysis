I spent a little time trying to understand what position I18N took on the 
exc-c14n last call draft, which included the design decision to discard 
xml:lang, for which RDF Core is now getting so much grief.


In summary, the dropping of xml:lang when a XML fragment is being carried 
within a larger XML document, does not appear to be a new issue, but one 
that was considered and accepted by I18N two years ago.



Detail:

Misha forward the last call to I18N:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-i18n-ig/2001Nov/0043.html

There was some concern about the xml:lang issue
[[
ACTION: Martin to ask for a health warning re problem with Exclusive
Canonicalization, where xml:lang and perhaps namespaces get ignored when
signing a payload.
]]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-i18n-ig/2002Feb/0020.html
(12th Feb)


This resulted in (as far as I can tell):
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-ietf-xmldsig/2002AprJun/0065.html
(apr 21)

(There seems to have been some off-list traffic just before)

However, as far as I can tell, the end result was acceptable to I18N.

(The minutes of the next I18N telecon record the action as done)
