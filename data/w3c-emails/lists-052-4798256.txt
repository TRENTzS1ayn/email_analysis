Dan--

What you say may be strictly correct as far as procedure goes, but from 
where I sit, many of the problems you describe below have been caused by 
our willingness to "go the extra mile" with people making comments well 
after last call, and making corresponding changes, in a sincere effort 
to address problems people had, rather than our "pushing the boundaries" 
(as if somehow we were thinking up these changes all by ourselves and 
attempting to evade the same last call constraints everyone else is 
bound to).  If, as a result of all this, we're going to have to go to a 
second last call, which will probably result in additional comments 
about all sorts of issues not currently on the table that we have to 
keep track of, formally respond to, etc., then I for one am going to be 
really bloody-minded about formal process as regards to last call dates, 
and rejecting additional comments, and I suggest the WG as a whole will 
have to be too.
