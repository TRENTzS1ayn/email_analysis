After reading Frank's Primer text,  I have changed some text in the 
reification section 3.2.1 of Semantics from this:

"Although RDF applications may use reification to refer to triple 
tokens in RDF documents, the connection between the document and its 
reification must be maintained by some means external to RDF. RDF 
syntax provides no means to 'connect' an RDF triple to its 
reification. "

to this:

"Although RDF applications may use reification to refer to triple 
tokens in RDF documents, the connection between the document and its 
reification must be maintained by some means external to the RDF 
graph syntax. (The RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax 
Specification (Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] provides rdf:Id to attach a URI 
reference to a triple in an RDF/XML document, and create the 
corresponding reification.) "

I hope the WG does not object to this; I think the rather sharp 
negative was misleading.

Pat
