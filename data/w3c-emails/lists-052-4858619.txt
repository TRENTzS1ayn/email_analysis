Argh!  I hope the Primer isn't misleading on this question, because I 
don't think your last sentence is accurate.  What I try to say is that 
rdf:ID provides a way of indicating that, in addition to generating the 
usual triple, a reification of that triple with a specific URIref 
(generated from the rdf:ID value) is to be generated as well.  It 
doesn't (I don't think) "attach a URI reference to a triple in an 
RDF/XML document".
