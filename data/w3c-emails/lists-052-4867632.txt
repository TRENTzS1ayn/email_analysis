Frank, overall the section on reification reads beautifully.  One 
niggle: right after the second table, giving the example reification, 
you say:

"These statements say that the resource identified by the URIref 
exproducts:triple12345 is an RDF statement, that the subject 
of the statement is the resource identified by exproducts:item10245 , 
the predicate of the statement is the resource identified by 
exterms:weight ,         and the object of the statement is the 
decimal value identified by the typed literal "2.4"^^xsd:decimal ."

but in fact this ought, strictly, say that the subject of the 
statement denotes (or refers to) the resource identified by... etc., 
and similarly for the predicate and object. Or, you could say that 
the subject of the statement is the URI reference 
'exproducts:item10245' which (of course) identifies the resource, 
etc..

I am being very picky here, so maybe this is inappropriate for the 
first example in a primer. Your decision.

Pat

P.S. strictly correct wording might be like this:
These statements say that the resource identified by the URIref 
exproducts:triple12345 is an RDF statement, that the subject of the 
statement refers to the resource identified by exproducts:item10245 , 
the predicate of the statement refers to the resource identified by 
exterms:weight , and the object of the statement refers to the 
decimal value identified by the typed literal "2.4"^^xsd:decimal ."
