Pat--

Thanks for the review.  Looking at the alternatives to deal with your 
niggle, I think I prefer your "strictly correct wording";  I'm afraid, 
for example, that saying something like "the subject of the statement is 
the URI reference 'exproducts:item10245'..." might cause someone to 
think we *were* supporting quoting.

Since we're not doing anything silly like publishing new WDs :-) I'll go 
ahead and make this change in a revised editor's draft.
