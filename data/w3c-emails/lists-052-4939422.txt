Patrick,

In today's RDFCore call you asked today about clarity on 'substantive 
changes'. I found the following helpful -

[[
Indicate whether the document has been modified substantively since the 
previous step. A substantive change (whether deletion, inclusion, or 
other modification) is one where someone could reasonably expect that 
making the change would invalidate an individual's review or 
implementation experience. Other changes (e.g., clarifications, bug 
fixes, editorial repairs, and minor error corrections) are minor 
changes. A Working Group MUST document changes (both substantive and 
minor) between steps.
