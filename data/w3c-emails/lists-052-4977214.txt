Well, isn't that attachment done by the fact of the URI appearing in 
the rdf:ID in the document in question? But OK, I could rephrase it 
thus:

(In the RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax Specification 
(Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] the use of rdf:Id with a URI reference as 
value creates a reification of the enclosed triple, with that URI 
reference as the reified triple.)

Would that be better? Its more awkward but maybe more accurate.
