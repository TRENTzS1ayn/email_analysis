These are up until the last meeting, the minutes of which I'm about to
produce.

I'll recreate the test case tables at the end of today.






19: test cases
2002-11-22#2  jang  [test case fix] remove RDFS entailment rules from
                         the language-ignored-for-numeric-types cases.
DONE, although this testis now obsolete due to datatype decisions.

2003-04-04#9  jang  Remove bagId tests from test cases.
done

20030425#2  jang  add test case for pfps-10 (from originating email)
DONE, test is under pfps-10/

20030509#12  jang  Review all tests to make changes concerning typed
                        literals

The following test cases are obsolete:
language-important-for-non-dt-entailment-1
language-important-for-non-dt-entailment-2

These are also similarly out-of-date:
langauge-ignored-for-numeric-types-1
language-ignored-for-numeric-types-2
language-ignored-for-numeric-types-3

And this:
language-and-xml-literal
...since the NTriples are invalid (lang tags on XML Literal)

I no longer believe this test case to be true:
semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes
(that integer 1 = decimal 1.0 in XSD)
... seeking confirmation before I obsolete it.

Other XMLLiteral tests with langauge:
none that were ever approved.


20030509#20  jang  Is inverse of test case 0097 true or not?
Good question. The message in question is
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0097.html
As per last week's telecon, the answer is "false", and we leave test
cases to that effect. However, JJC has a normative implementation
note addressing this.

20030627#6  JanG  add tests for intensional subClassOf semantics.
These are DONe, in horst-01/

20030718#7  JanG  update test case language-and-xml-literal to be
                        positive
This test case is obsolete since NTriples reflects teh abstract syntax;
there are no langauge tags on XMLLiterals. The datatypes/test001 parser
test captures this now.

2003-08-01#4  jang:  respond to daveR on his comments on testcases
DONE, see message [actually I can't find this, will follow up with
message number]
