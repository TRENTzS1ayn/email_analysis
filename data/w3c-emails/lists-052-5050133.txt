  Editor's draft of RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)  18 August 2003
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/

This reflects all changes since the last reviews (by Jeremy, Graham) and
updates for recent WG decisions, the significant ones of which have been
seen and reviewed on the w3c-rdfcore-wg list:
  * XML literals and exc-C14N
  * XSD whitespace normalization
  * Unicode NFC references
  * RDF in SVG section
  * Conformance section

There are other minor word, formatting changes and it was HTML, link and
spell checked.

The only things I omitted doing were:
* Picking one of LC, CR or PR as the document type.
* Writing the status to match that.
* Updating the links to be outside the shadow TR area (an easy global replace)

Apart from those, it's done

Dave
