I have completed the action from Friday to produce a new draft of concepts at:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/

in addition to the changes agreed on Friday, I changed the heading of 
"Substantive Revisions" to "Non-Editorial Revisions".

This is because the definition I have worked to is that:

[[
Editorial changes are those which do not result in any change in the 
meaning of an RDF document or the behaviour of an RDF application.
]]

which is stricter than the criteria that Eric e-mailed out for the defn of 
substantive.
