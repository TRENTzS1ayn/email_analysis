Eric--

Just to be sure I know what you're talking about (e.g., that we're
making the same assumptions):

1.  today is a target date for what, exactly?
2.  what is it you expect the document status to be when Brian returns
(particularly as regards to consistency)?

I've already mentioned the issue of consistent references.  Also, I
notice Concepts editors draft now has a CR format.  Etc.
