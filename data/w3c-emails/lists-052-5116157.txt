I'm waiting on one thing. As I understand it, the value spaces of
xsd:integer and xsd:decimal no longer intersect. If that is correct then
one datatype test case needs changing, since it currently suggests
otherwise.

The test case is
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest.rdf#semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes

which says that

[[
eg:foo eg:bar "10"^^<xsd:integer> .
]]
 rdfs+dt(xsd:integer, xsd:decimal)-entails
[[
eg:foo eg:bar "10.0"^^<xsd:decimal> .
]]

I'm waiting on a confirmation that this is, or is not, actually the
case, in light of recent xsd clarifications.

Cheers,
jan
