Hi Frank,

You're correct in identifying level's of 'done-ness'  :)  A quick 
characterization of this follows:

1) Documents have incorporated the last of editorial fixes discussed by 
the working group
2) All of the outstanding last-call issues have been addressed,  
resolved and accepted
3) The Documents have consistent references, appropriate style-sheets 
and are pub-rules ready

What I believe we discussed Friday were numbers 1 (and possibly 2) for 
today.  There is still a lot of work for 3, but If we get 1&2 done 
before Brian returning I think this would make for a pleasant welcome.
