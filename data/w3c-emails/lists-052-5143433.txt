Eric--

Fine, just wanted to be sure.  I can confirm that, as far as I know, the
Primer is done WRT 1 and 2 (although I think Brian still has to modify
the last call comments page to show pfps-15 as accepted).

PS:  If you haven't done so, you might want to scan the Primer changes
section (without necessarily verifying all the changes actually made) 
and see if there's anything that strikes you as being missing.  BTW,
does this section (and the red "changes" style) get removed when doing
3, or is this done at a later stage?
