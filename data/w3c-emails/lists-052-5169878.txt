I'm also stupified. On the other hand Pat told us about
disjoint value spaces in XSD. So far I assumed that
xsd:integer a rdfs:Datatype; rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal.

In http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/xsd-rules we have
many other similar cases such as eg
{?S a xsd:int, xsd:nonNegativeInteger} => {?S a xsd:unsignedLong}.

Well, for what it counts, this entailment holds
is what I believe (in the form of running code).
