Yes; either way, the test case in question really tests XML schema,
rather than RDF itself. The reason I asked the question is due to recent
statements about the intersection or otherwise of XSD types; I'd kinda
got the impression that that XSD WG had responded with "clarification"
of this.

So either:

xsd:integer is still a subclass of xsd:decimal (which may or may not be
true with intentional semantics, regardless of the datatype L2V
definition); or rather, the value space of one is a subset of the value
space of the other (in which case nothing needs doing), or:

xsd:integer's value space is not a subset of the value space of
xsd:decimal after all, in which case I add another "What?!?" to the
list, but that's a problem to raise with the xml schema people.
