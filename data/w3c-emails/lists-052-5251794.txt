Looks like it is shaping up. One suggestion further below...

I offer the following

I think it would be useful to include some wording along
the line that having individual formalisms which might
encapsulate XML fragments each provide their own
proprietary solution to the fragment context problem
is "bad policy" for the W3C and contrary to the clear
goal of having synergetic/compatible yet cleanly layered
specifications.
