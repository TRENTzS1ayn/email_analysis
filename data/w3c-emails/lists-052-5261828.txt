There is no possible reading of XSD that does not have this.

I will try and clarify:

- XSD has primitive simple types (e.g. decimal) and derived simple types 
(e.g integer).
- one reading of XSD suggests that different primitve types are disjoint.
- a different reading of XSD suggests that different primtiive types may 
share members.
- both readings agree that a derived type has a value space that is a 
subset of its supertype.

- we have recently clairified that rdf:XMLLiteral's value space is disjoint 
from the value space of any XSD simple type. This decision *does not* say 
anything about whether two XSD types intersect or not.


So - knowing that xsd:integer is derived from xsd:decimal, we know that the 
two types are also in rdfs:subClassOf relationship.

The test is unchanged, and I believe Jan had got the wrong end of some 
stick ...
