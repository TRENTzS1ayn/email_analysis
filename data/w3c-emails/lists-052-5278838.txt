Hi Eric

I took an action to start work on an HP endorsement.

I take this to be for the move to PR (whenever that is).

Do you have some boiler plate that I could take and modify to make a draft 
- I think it will take two to three weeks from start to finish, since I 
need to get buy-in at various levels.

Jeremy
