It occurred to me that it might be wise/reasonable
to recommend (or even require) that RDF serializers
include xml:lang="" on the property element for all
statements having a plain literal without lang tag.

This effectively utilizes this new mechanism and
makes the RDF/XML serialization "safer" within a
context where generic XML tools might be used to
operate on RDF/XML instances, or if/when RDF/XML
fragments might be embedded in other serializations,
thereby making the semantics of the plain literal 
less fragile.

Eh?
