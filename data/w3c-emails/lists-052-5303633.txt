Thanks Jermey, its good to have these ready.

I'd suggest saving endorsements / testimonials for PR or Rec.

2-3 weeks is short for most organizations, but again its good to have 
these ready to use.  I don't think there is a specific template per se, 
but the following may be helpful as examples -

Testimonials for W3C's SOAP 1.2 Recommendation
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/soap12-testimonial

Testimonials for VoiceXML 2.0
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/voicexml2-testimonial

Testimonials for W3C's SVG 1.1 W3C Recommendation
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/svg11-testimonial

Please note, I consider this *less* important than getting the 
documents done. If you're struggling with which to do first, please 
choose the documents :)
