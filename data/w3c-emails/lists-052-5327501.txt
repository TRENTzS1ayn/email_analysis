The version now at

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_August.html

dated August 21  is now as ready to go as it will ever be.  The only 
changes are that the the remark in 3.2.1 about rdf:ID has been 
modified to use Frank's suggested wording, and that in section 1.4 
the following has been added:

"In this table, and throughout this document, the equality sign "=" 
indicates identity, i.e. that the terms equated are the same. "

This ought to not need saying, but given the likely future 
distinction between 'equality' and 'identity', I thought it would do 
no harm to nail down the intended meaning beyond any possibility of 
future misunderstanding.

I have turned off the red/brown 'recent change' highlighting.

Of the issues remaining unaccepted, I offer the following comments.

pfps-02 and -03 are concerned with an informative appendix. The 
confusions about strings noted in the final comment on pfps-02 have 
been dealt with. pfps-03 is a difference of opinion.

pfps-04 and -05 amount to a difference of opinion about the proper 
'style' for stating entailment rules. I have noted in email 
discussion that the essential property that the final response 
(expressing 'deeply dissatisfied with') notes has been present since 
the very first draft of the semantics document and have never 
changed, but that no critical comments were made about it previously; 
and that the technical issues and errors noted earlier in these 
threads have all now been dealt with.

The final response to pfps-06 is a critical comment on the change 
list, rather than to the body of the document. The wording of the 
change list has been altered in response to this.
