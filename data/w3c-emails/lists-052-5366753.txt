Yes adding that would improve it.

I believe those two options are adequately ruled out by other rows.
I think arguments could be made for Yes, and prefer to concede those in 
advance rather than be drawn towards a rathole.

The only serious other contender, in my opinion, is the wrapper hack in 
syntax, possibly only when the xml:lang is anything other than "". I think 
we should have that specified as the alternative design and go to CR asking 
for implementor feedback between those two designs, using the 'at risk' 
phaseolgy. While that does not seem to be precisely what the process 
document has in mind, that is what OWL have done.
