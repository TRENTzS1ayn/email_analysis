Richard, Martin,

After some discussion today, whilst no formal decision was taken, the 
RDFCore chairs indicated they "were minded" that there should be a 
second last call on the RDFCore specs.

We are aware that the I18N are unhappy with the current RDFCore design 
for handling lang tags in xml literals.

Are there any other aspects of the current design as expressed in the 
current editors drafts, for example the relationship between plain and 
xml literals, that you would you like RDFCore to address.

It would clearly be helpful to us to be able to address any such 
concerns before publishing new documents.

Brian
