Jan - it is right that in our current implementation

[[
eg:foo eg:bar "10"^^xsd:integer .
]]
rdfs+dt(xsd:integer, xsd:decimal) - entails
[[
eg:foo eg:bar "10.0"^^xsd:decimal .
]]

and also the other way around; we did that in a builtin way

[[
      if (obj != null && verb == "^^" && t.verb == "^^" && subj.bound &&
t.subj.bound &&
          (obj.unify(t.obj, r, s) || Datatype.isNumeric(obj.deref().verb)
&&

Datatype.isNumeric(t.obj.deref().verb)))
        return Datatype.compare(obj.deref().verb, r.getLit(this),
r.getLit(t)) == 0;
]]

and where Datatype.compare is using Xerces or .NET functionality

but maybe we went too far...

Actually, from the sound of PatH's followup, this might not be resolved.
Anyway, currently we have the test case:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest.rdf#semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes


which says that

[[
eg:foo eg:bar "10"^^xsd:integer .
]]
rdfs+dt(xsd:integer, xsd:decimal) - entails
[[
eg:foo eg:bar "10.0"^^xsd:decimal .
]]

The test case is useful in that it illustrates that two members of
different datatypes may indeed denote the same value. It also expresses
our best understanding at the time of the intention of the XSD spec.
Finally, in support of this test case, as I recall WebOnt passed a
resolution to the effect that (amongst other things) xsd:integer was a
subclass of xsd:decimal (wrt value spaces). I don't know if that
resolution is out-of-date.

However:

- the test case actually tests another spec
- while it sounds like XMLSchema are prepping words which will probably
(due to equality/identity distinction) preserve the truth of this test
case by a gnat's whisker,
- ... the truth of this test case is not "obvious" since the XSD WG, if
not the spec itself, seem to be in two minds about it.

Thus there are three options:

1. Preserve the test case as is. In that case, we should probably
communicate to the XML Schema WG asking them to consider it as
identifying a strong use case should they come to revise their decisions
wrt the value sapces of XSD primitive types;

2. Remove it on the grounds that (a) it's not our problem, (b) the truth
of it depends on another WG's decisions

3. Label the test case as being non-normative, whilst approved, since
(a) it illustrates a valid point about the value spaces of datatyped
literals, regardless of the XSD details, (b) we think this is how XSD
primitive types should work in RDF, and again ask the XML Schema WG to
bear it in mind.

In that case the test case document would include some words about this
test case to the effect that the XSD types are used purely to ground in
concrete terms the illustrative test case.

We already have implementations (Jos?) that pass this test case.
