8: Administrivia - emergency mailing list

  http://rdfweb.org/pipermail/rdfcore-in-exile/2003-August/000000.html
  We lost 2+ days of email discussion time this week (no actual messages 
  believed lost). It appears the mail virus problems are under control now, 
  but just in case, we have mailto:rdfcore-in-exile@vapours.rdfweb.org should
  this happen again. Please always copy the main RDF Core list address.

9: OWL is in Candidate Recommendation

   OWL FAQ: http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owlfaq
   http://www.w3.org/News/2003#item138
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-owl-features-20030818/
   [[
This CR period will extend until at least 20 September 2003. After that 
date, when and if the exit criteria are met, the group intends to request 
Proposed Recommendation status.
   ]]

   Exit criteria: 
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/impls#exit
   these include...

"finish resolving dependency on RDF Core specs, esp. RDF Semantics"


9: (CR) request draft - i18n dissenting opinion text

 We have a draft from jjc - does this capture the issue/problem to our 
 satisfaction?

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0244.html
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/att-0244/i18n-part.html
 Dissenting Opinion: xml:lang and rdf:parseType="Literal"

 Jeremy's doc describes current situation and design space the WG explored.

[[
The only serious other contender, in my opinion, is the wrapper hack in 
syntax, possibly only when the xml:lang is anything other than "". I think 
we should have that specified as the alternative design and go to CR asking 
for implementor feedback between those two designs, using the 'at risk' 
phaseolgy. While that does not seem to be precisely what the process 
document has in mind, that is what OWL have done.

Any further comments? Can we endorse this text?

11: French translation - review sought

 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/combined-ns-translation.rdf.fr

 We have RDF schema text for rdf: and rdfs: terms
 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/combined-ns-translation.rdf.fr
 (by Max Froumentin and DanB)

 We could publish this along with docs, could do with review from 
 French-speaking RDFCore member(s).


12: Treatment of XSD types

  thread spun off http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0231.html
  
[[
Hopefully for Pat to just confirm that I didn't imagine it when I
thought I heard him say that this is now the treatment of XSD types: ie,
that their denotation is a pair of (typename, value).
]] --Jan  

[[
xsd:integer is still a subclass of xsd:decimal (which may or may not be
true with intentional semantics, regardless of the datatype L2V
definition); or rather, the value space of one is a subset of the value
space of the other (in which case nothing needs doing), or:

xsd:integer's value space is not a subset of the value space of
xsd:decimal after all, in which case I add another "What?!?" to the
list, but that's a problem to raise with the xml schema people.
]] -- JanG

[[
Yup; when Pat said, "none of the XSD datatypes intersect", he meant,
with the value space for XML Literal, not each other. Sorry if I gave
anyone heartaches over their cornflakes.
]]
JanG, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0241.html

Is this resolved / closed / understood now? Any affect on specs?

13: Publication / next steps?

   Proceed with CR vs LC2 ...

   (perspective from Brian sought...)
