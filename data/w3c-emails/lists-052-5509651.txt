Owl Now CR
==========

Congratulations to the webont folks.


Response to I18N Objection on XMLLiteral
========================================

JJC drafted text:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0244.html

Reviewed closely by PatrickS.  EM considered it helpful.  DaveB suggests 
adding that we got negative feedback on the use of a wrapper.  bwm 
concerned that claims about limitations imposed by ex-c18n were 
overstated.  EM stated that the chairs must be comfortable with the 
rebuttal.

ACTION: bwm email comment about ex-c18N claim

ACTION: danbri to review the proposed rebuttal

Docment Status
==============

primer - ready to go
concepts - chair beleives it is ready to go
syntax - ready to go
semantics - ready to go
schema - uptodate on technical content
        - process for handling last call comments to be completed
testcases - done except for test concerning equivalence
             between datatypes

The test case issue was discussed in

   http://rdfweb.org/pipermail/rdfcore-in-exile/2003-August/000007.html

After discussion it was decided that no change was needed for the test 
in question.

ACTION PatH check whether pfps is now satisfied on pfps-06.

(scribe note - in light of later decisions, this might be premature).

French Translation Review
=========================

Danbri asked for competent French speakers to check the French 
translation of RDF Schema comments.  None forthcoming, will ask on RDF 
interest.

Publication: Next Steps
=======================

EM has written a draft request to advance to CR.  However, he raised a 
number of concerns about whether this was the appropriate next step:

   - the WG agrees it has made substantive changes to the documents
   - the Director may choose to ask that they be given a second last call
   - the Director is now on holiday and progress is likely to require his
     participation
   - the documents could advance directly from a second last call to PR

In particular, EM referred to

http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr#last-call
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr#return-to-wg

It was noted that a second last call could generate new issues, e.g. 
from I18N.

bwm noted that there seemed to be some wiggle room in the process 
document.  The WG could request advancement to CR despite the 
substantive changes.  The director then decides whether to advance the 
documents or send them back to the WG.  EM was unsure what criteria the 
Director applied in making such a decision.

Arguments that could be made to support advancement include:

   - the WG has done due dilligence in getting review from the developer 
community

It was noted that since it has not gone through a TR process, it may not 
have reached all the community, especially those who might be most 
concerned about I18N issues.

BWM noted that pfps has requested a complete review the modified documents.

EM suggested the question is where to put our effort.  Is it better to 
put effort into creating a case for moving forward without another last 
call, or to just do another last call.

BWM noted that jjc was not present and was known to have strong views 
that the next step should be CR.

EM noted that if there are unresolved issues, they can still appear at 
CR or even PR, and it is better to get them in a LC.

Danbri asked if the editors had the energy for another last call:

DaveB:  yes
Frank:  yes
JanG:   yes
Danbri: yes

bwm's employer wishes him to spend less time on RDFCore.

The chairs indicated they "are minded" that the next step should be a 
second last call.  The late agenda and the absence of jjc prevented a 
formal decision.

ACTION: bwm contact I18N to ask whether they have other issues we \
should deal with before a second last call

ACTION: bwm send email about xmlsch-03

ACTION: em circulate a target publication date
