a slight correction:

While this was (in my recollection) the clear mood of the call, the WG 
didn't formally resolve anything. I tried to sketch something we could 
have all approved/resolved, which you capture above, but we didn't
formally resolve this before running out of call time.

Lots of 'ayes' though...
