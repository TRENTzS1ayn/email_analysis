As you may know or have guessed, the recent mail virus and 
related spamstorm has played havoc with W3C's mail server.

Very little mail has got through since monday, lists.w3.org is 
currently awaiting a reboot when the MIT folks get to work, and 
there is a bunch of backed up mail.

More details at http://www.w3.org/2003/08/mail-status

Meanwhile, we need to get some work done. I have reconstructed 
from memory and Google (apologies if I missed anyone) a temporary 
list of recently active RDFCore members and made a temporary list on 
my local server, allowing us to temporarily bypass the blockage. Please 
keep w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org cc:'d so that this traffic gets properly 
archived.

So, we have tuesday and wednesday to catch up on.

Brian is back and catching up. I shall be chairing friday's call.

Agenda item suggestions to both lists please. Agenda *will* be late, 
I'll send something last thing this pm.

cheers,

Dan
