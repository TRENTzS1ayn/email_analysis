There are currently no plans to change this.

That is helpful.  Thank you for the link.

This is the one that I particularly had in mind when I asked the 
question.  Addressing it would require some change to the current design.

Ok.  That's a new one on my mental list.

Very much so.  My concern is to determine whether RDFCore can move to a 
second last call immediately.  It doesn't seem like a good idea to do a 
second last call with the current ed's drafts then make substantive 
changes as the result of last call comments on that and then have to do 
a third last call.  Before doing a second last call we should ensure 
that RDFCore have considered all the comments I18N would like to make.
