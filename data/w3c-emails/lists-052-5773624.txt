I haven't checked the facts, but I recall it being suggested that we had 
a number (don't know how many) of implementation reports saying they 
failed the corresponding test case and they were using Xerces.  I was 
under the impression there is also a C version of Xerces.  Hmm. Easy to 
check:

   http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html

Well its c++, but close.

You have a point though.  I don't have numbers to back up any impression 
of popularity.  I'm pretty sure its the most common in the java world. 
I'm not sure about elsewhere.
