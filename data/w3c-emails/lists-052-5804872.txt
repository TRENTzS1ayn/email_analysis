Actually in response to Patrick's latest on "pfps-06 on hold"


Choices may be:

1) Fudge - peter unhappy, can probably persuade WebOnt to be unhappy, 
difficult to defend WG decision

2) LC design - Xerces implementors have difficulty in passing tests

3) LC design, remove test cases
      Xerces implementors can pass all the tests may potential 
interoperability issues swept under carpet

4) change design - Patrick unhappy, increased distance between RDF 
datatyping and XML Schema Datatypes

5) Variant of Fudge - e.g. make it clear in the implemenation note that 
additional whitespace is an error, make producing a warning a SHOULD rather 
than a MAY. (Probably not enough to appease Peter, may head off others), 
could even make the implementation note informative and down case the MAYs 
and SHOULDs.
