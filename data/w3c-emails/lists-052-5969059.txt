I subscribe to their mailing list.

Bug reports do get seen too.
If this is perceived by them as a failure to implement the spec correctly 
then I would imagine that they treat it seriously.
However, not being able to point to an XML document and an XML Schema 
validation that is incorrectly processed we may find this gets ignored.

Moreover the parts of Xerces that do this are not part of their main APIs 
which are things like SAX and the DOM which do not separate out XML Schema 
datatypes
