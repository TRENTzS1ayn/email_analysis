From the editor's draft:

[[
Suppose that it is known that the value space of the datatype denoted by
ddd is a subset of that of the datatype denoted by eee. Then the
following rule applies:

rdfD 4

when:
 ddd rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
 eee rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .

then:
 ddd rdfs:subClassOf eee .
]]

Just clarifying for myself: we keep this extensional behaviour despite
the change to "intensional semantics" elsewhere? (Actually, it's hard to
think of a case where you wouldn't want this to be true.)
