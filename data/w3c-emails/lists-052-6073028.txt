That's at least a little encouraging.

Yes, of course not insofar as *we* understand, but that
doesn't mean that some scanner in some API is happy
to take a string and coerce it to an integer, disregarding
characters not relevant to the lexical space.

I'm encouraged that neither Xerces or .NET do this, but
I wouldn't have been very surprised if they had.

Thanks for taking the time to test it, though.
