Fair enough, though I think it would be a valid argument that your
implementation is erroneous for making entailments that are clearly
in conflict with the XML Schema specs (even if it's useful and possible
to perform coercions to get those entailments) as "10.0" is most
definitely not a valid lexical form for xsd:integer.

It's not a very large step from there to accepting "10abc"^^xsd:integer
if you have a scanner that is happy to scan up to but not beyond
relevant characters... e.g.

   sscanf ("10abc", "%i", &myInteger);

You're coercion based entailments seem to overhang a pretty steep
and slippery slope as far as design rational goes...

IMO, if an application "supports" XML Schema datatypes, it will
do so responsibly, complaining about invalid lexical forms (even
if it can do something useful with them) since RDF is after all 
meant to provide a foundation for precise and reliable reasoning.

No?
