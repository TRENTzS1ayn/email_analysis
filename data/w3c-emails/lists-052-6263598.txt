In last weeks teleconference [1] the editors discussed and agreed (at 
least all present) that they had the energy for another last call. I'd 
like to propose that we discuss during this agenda item voting as a 
group on moving forward on a second last call.

If the chairs are receptive to this agenda suggestion, I'd like 
everyone to think about this and be prepared to vote.

That being said, it may be that we still have outstanding actions that 
might prevent us from proceeding. Today's agenda [2] seem to have far 
more open action items in it than we discussed last week.
