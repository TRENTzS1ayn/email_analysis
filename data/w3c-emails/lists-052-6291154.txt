The Editor's draft at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/
has been updated to reword the RDF reification vocab section, based on a
combination of your suggestions with text from Pat and Frank. We propose 
to close this LC issue with this rewording. Could you reply to this
message letting us know whether your concerns are now addressed.

Many thanks,

Dan
