Because our task is to write a standard which conforms to some other 
standards, in particular XSD (charter). If the world in general 
chooses to mis-use these standards, it isn't our job to track their 
mis-use. That's the Microsoft way; we are obliged (and IMO, morally 
obliged) to follow the Godzilla way. If we write a standard which 
assumes that people are mis-using the XSD spec, then it will be 
impossible for *anyone* to conform to RDF +XSD.
