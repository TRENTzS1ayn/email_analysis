The version at this URL:

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_2LC.html

is ready to publish on 0905, with one small caveat: in the status 
section para 4 there is no last call ending date specified. It uses 
the LC boilerplate provided by Eric. All the links and references are 
to versions with this date. (It refers to a nonexistent version of 
the Lbase note dated 0905 which will be in existence shortly.)

This has some corrections and improvements in the proofs following 
Peter's recent email; in particular there is a precise definition of 
the subinterpretation << relation, which was very sloppily worded 
previously.

It passes all the W3C filters except that the pubrules filter 
complained that a paragraph was missing from the boilerplate (and the 
date was missing, of course). (The last time I tried to use the 
pubrules checker it seemed to be broken, so I have only checked the 
immediate previous edit on pubrules.)
