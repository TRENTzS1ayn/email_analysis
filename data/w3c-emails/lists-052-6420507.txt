There is an updated version of the Lbase note at

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/Lbase_September.html

which passes all the W3C filters (except the pubrules seems unable to 
find pieces of boilerplate which are definitely there. )

This version has all the links and references updated to 0905 , uses 
the same RDF/S translation as the semantics doc, has a little extra 
discussion of different translation styles, and has a bug in the 
description of strings fixed. Changes noted in a change log at the 
end.
