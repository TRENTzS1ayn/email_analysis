I wasn't aware of that document, but it looks plausible.  From 
recollection, the requirement of IETF tree registration, per RFC2048, is 
publication in an IESG-approved RFC (doesn't have to be 
standards-track).  My approach would have been to request IESG approval for 
publication, rather than simply copying them on a request to 
rfc-editor.  In practice, the latter (per Reagle's note) is probably more 
efficient.

The other point I would question is waiting until the W3C spec becomes a 
REC before requesting registration.  That adds further delay, and in the 
meantime the registration template exists in an Internet-draft form that 
folks can't be expected to find or take seriously.  I think that as soon as 
there is a stable and credible specification to point at then it's 
appropriate to request registration.

I'm not sure if we're confused, or just unfocused on this issue.  So far, 
as I see it, we've been treating the application/rdf+xml as a document to 
be progressed on a track roughly in step with the W3C documents.  The 
document  has been prepared, and updated in response to comments, by Aaron 
and IMO is ready to request publication when we are ready to request it.

I was aware of the existence of this new draft, but until it is actually 
approved I would stick with what is already published.
