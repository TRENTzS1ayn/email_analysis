I have reviewed an html diff of the differences between the 10 Oct last 
call WD of the primer

  and the current editors draft:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-primer-20030117/Overview.html
W3C Editor's Draft 05 December 2003
MD5(Overview.html)= 4dbbcda218372230832e949ea8680f58

and am satisfied with the changes.  This doc is ready to go.

Brian
