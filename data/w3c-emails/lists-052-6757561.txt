Hi Folks,

I would very much like to say yes to this.  Can I have volunteers to 
draft review comments on behalf of rdfcore please.

Brian

Brian, Dan,

The TAG is working toward publishing a Last Call working draft of
"Architecture of the World Wide Web" [1], editors copy at [2]. I'd like
to solict a commitment from the RDF Core WG to review our LC draft once
published. We expect to announce a 3 month LC which we anticipate ending
around the time of the Tech Plenary in Cannes (or later if we fail to
meet our publication goals). Please could you let me know whether RDF
Core would be able to undertake a review within such a 3 month window.

Best regards

Stuart Williams
