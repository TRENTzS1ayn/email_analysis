+          <td>'"' <a href="#string">string</a> '"' '^^' <a

There were no changes to the test cases themselves.


RDF/XML Syntax
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/
Last-Modified: Wed, 10 Dec 2003 12:13:14 GMT
Content-Length: 195596
CVS 1.53

Plus the associated modifications to example08.rdf and example08.nt

The changes are recorded in the changelog

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/#section-Changes
The updates I made for "URI Encoding" were solely in the changelogs
section. The other two were in sections 2.5, 2.7 as recorded.

Both will still need appropriate status sections (title, dates),
pubrules and link checking but the latter two should be fine.

Cheers

Dave
