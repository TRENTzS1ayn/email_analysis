Looking at the QA matrix

http://www.w3.org/QA/TheMatrix.html

I note the following aspects concerning the RDF PR documents

1) RDF Schema does not have conformance clauses

2) The test suite covers aspects of RDF Syntax, RDF Semantics, RDF Schema and 
RDF Concepts (although it is not a conformance test suite for any of these)

3) there is an RDF validator hosted at www.w3.org/RDF/Validator that checks 
syntax against RDF Syntax, and also some constraints from the abstract 
syntax, in RDF Concepts

Jeremy

PS for OWL there is more than one validator, none of which are hosted at the 
W3C - typically they validate the syntax only
