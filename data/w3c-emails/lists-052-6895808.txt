The QA Matrix doesn't claim that it does. Or did I misunderstand what
you meant?

OK, I've added Test Suites entries for these various specs.

The RDF Validator is now bound to both of these specs.

Could you send us the URLs of these services, so that we can link to
them from the matrix?

Thanks for the updates,

Dom
