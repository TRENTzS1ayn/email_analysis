OK. I can send immediate responses to the following, with your go-ahead:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0179.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0159.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0125.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0138.html

OK, I will respond to the WG with suggested responses to the things 
in my editorial baliwick.
