Peter was right. I can make this change if y'all prefer but it will 
have other consequences throughout the document where I use this 
assumed identity. I will have to re-state and re-prove several of the 
lemmas. I honestly think this would be a mistake. Still, if it helps 
to keep things straight then I am willing to do this. Expect it to 
add about a week to the time to a final version of the semantics doc.

BTW, if we make this change then we will effectively have restored 
the 'problem' which gave us such trouble at the California F2F about 
18 months ago, and which we solved by adopting the graph syntax as 
definitive. In effect, we will have tossed away the graph syntax and 
replaced it with the N-triples syntax, thereby re-introducing bound 
variables and the need to refer to re-naming operations on merging. 
We then ought to go back through all the documents and purge all 
references to blank nodes as having no names, since they will have 
names.

There are really two ways to go. We can say that RDF syntax (I'll 
avoid the G-word for now) uses identifiers for blank nodes somehow; 
or not, ie blank nodes are blank. If we go the first way, then the 
concept of 'same graph' is effectively useless, since a graph with a 
systematic change to its bound variables is semantically 
indistinguishable from the original; and we have to talk everywhere 
about equivalence classes of graphs, in effect, or isomorphism 
between graphs. Also there are issues about scopes of these bound 
variables, which we put to bed 18 months ago and which it would be a 
chore, to put it mildly, to re-open at this stage. We decided in 
Sebastopol to go the second route, ie to identify graphs with 
indistinguishable blank nodes and to therefore not bother with 
notions of renaming, bound variable and so on.

My own preference is that we retain the advantages of this second way 
of doing things and re-write the concepts document wording to reflect 
the decisions we made in Sebastopol and which we have been using as a 
basis for our discussions ever since.

I am willing to do this IF the concepts doc is rewritten to say 
clearly and unambiguously that an RDF graph *is* a set of RDF 
triples, rather than any kind of 'graph' in any sense from 
mathematical graph theory. Otherwise I would prefer that the 
definition in the concepts document be replaced with a reference to 
the semantics document.

>Graph Equivalence for the RDF Concepts heading.

I disagree. If we stick to our guns here, we really do mean graph 
equality. It is up to us to define 'graph' so that equality comes out 
right, and we know how to do that.

We have had this worked out now for a very long time. Why screw it up 
at this stage?
