You and me both.  My relief's bigger than yours :)

You don't need my goahead.  But remember the goal on rdf comments is not to 
have a technical argument.  Its to clarify whether there is an issue, what 
it is and how significant it is.  We've got two folks saying "I don't like 
what you've done with the semantics of rdf:Bag."

Do we think they have misunderstood what we have done?  In this case, I 
don't think so.  We can explain the reasons for the choice we made and they 
may accept them, or not be convinced.  What is perhaps most important here 
is to understand the significance of the issue to Ossi and Massimo.  Why do 
they care?  What breaks for them?  Is this a comment along the lines of "I 
would do it differently" or do they have a billion dollar software business 
that will go down the tubes as a result of this decision.

Yup

Those are comments primer and concepts, though with some quotes from 
*emails* of yours.  Do those editors need help with these comments.  I 
think its a bit out of line for there to be last call comments about your 
emails.  Maybe I should make a process about to Bob about reviewing the 
docs, not anything else?  Pat, Frank - is that necessary/helpful/idiotic/...?
