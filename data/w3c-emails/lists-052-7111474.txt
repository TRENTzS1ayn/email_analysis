The closure rules for RDF are incomplete.  There are XML documents
without an enclosing language tag that have the same canonical form as
XML documents with and enclosing language tag.  This means that the
RDF entailment lemma is false.

----
This comment is correct and the error will be corrected.

The new closure rule will simply state
FROM
xxx aaa lll .         where lll is a well-formed XML typed literal .

INFER
xxx aaa mmm .       where mmm is a well-formed XML typed literal with 
the same canonical form as lll.

where 'canonical form' is defined explicitly using the construction 
in the Concepts document.   I would also like to add prose like this:

"In rule rdf2, 'same canonical form' should be interpreted so as to 
take into account any language tags which may be present. For 
example, this rule will sanction the following inference:

<ex:sub> <ex:prop> "<rdf lang="fr"><word>chat</word></rdf>"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .
->
<ex:sub> <ex:prop> "<word>chat</word>"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral .

."
Any objections/ comments?

Pat
