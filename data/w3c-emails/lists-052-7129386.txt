The datatyping rules for XML Literals are incomplete.  For example,
malformed typed literals with type rdf:XMLLiteral are not excluded
from LV.

True, and this will be corrected. More generally, the treatment of 
XML literals in the semantics document is rather scruffy and will be 
cleaned up in several places, made more coherent with the other 
datatype sections and more adequately linked to the other documents. 
I apologize for not having this fully fixed for final call. I should 
have a draft version for inspection ready by EOW Wednesday at the 
latest.
