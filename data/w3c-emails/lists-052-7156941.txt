I think they do to some extent. I can explain why in a longer message 
which might be generally helpful in any case, as this issue has come 
up before in other emails, eg from that lady (forget her name) who 
was writing an RDF book,and probably will again.

The trouble is that Bob cites emails from me to make his case against 
the Primer text, but he misunderstands the point I was making. I was 
going to point this out to him, but I can do it off-list if you 
prefer.
