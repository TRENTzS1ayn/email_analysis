RE: RDF Semantics: Interpretations and ModellingPat, this reply brought to
my mind a lovely Sidney Harris' t-shirt that Leslie Lamport showed me for
the first time ten years ago or so (wow, time flies....):

Can you please give a proof of your entailment? ;)
Thanks,

    Ossi, this is the Bag/Alt issue, raised in May 2002:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002AprJun/0112.html
    AFAIK never replied yet.
    Incidentally, the same wrong argument pointed therein appears again in
the current last call draft.


  Im not sure which 'wrong argument' you are referring to. I stand by
everything I said that is  included in the above-referenced message. In
particular,


  " If
  _:xxx [rdf:type] [rdf:Bag] .
  > _:xxx [rdf:_1] <ex:a> .
  > _:xxx [rdf:_2] <ex:b> .
  >
  > entails
  >
  > _:xxx [rdf:_1] <ex:b> .
  > _:xxx [rdf:_2] <ex:a> .

  > _:xxx [rdf:_2] <ex:b> .
  > _:xxx [rdf:_1] <ex:b> .
  > _:xxx [rdf:_2] <ex:a> .

  is a correct argument, and your response to it is incorrect.
