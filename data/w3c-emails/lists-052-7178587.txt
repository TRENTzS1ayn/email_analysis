I say, there are a bunch of equivalent representations of the same
thing: whether you consider "a graph" to _be_ or just to be _represented
by_ a set of triples, or an ntriples document, doesn't really make a
huge difference, except that if you start getting really pedantic about
it then you have to over-qualify the language in the statements and
proofs of all your lemmas.

In other words: avoid extra effort which provides no real benefit.
