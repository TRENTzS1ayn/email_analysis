As Pat noted, Bob's comments aren't about Pat's emails;  Bob cites Pat's 
emails to contradict what he thinks the Primer is saying.  So I don't 
think a process message would help.  Yes, I would like Pat's help with 
the Primer comment (on-list would be appropriate, it seems to me). 
Specifically, you might look at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0138.html

which is Bob's reply to my reply to him asking for some clarification.
Pat, what would you suggest I should do to the Primer to make things 
clearer?  Thanks.
