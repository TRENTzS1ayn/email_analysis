Dear Patrick Hayes,

Thank you for the clarification.

This is my opinion only but if RDF Semantics (note: as a design choice) is
not willing to differentiate, e.g., bags and alts in entailments, then
perhaps the model-theoretic approach isn't suitable for the purpose.

My comment is purely practical. If differentiating bags and alts is
considered important in RDF, this makes you wonder the role of RDF
Semantics in applications of RDF (*). In practice, it would seem to be
safer to use, e.g., (now imaginary) ibm-glossary:Bag and ibm-glossay:Alt
with (perhaps rather restricting but) fixed entailment semantics  given by
IBM than rdf:Bag and rdf:Alt, if each time people used, e.g., rdf:Alt they
would have to (in addition) state (somehow): "My interpretation is that
rdf:Alt does not entail all its members but rdf:Bag does!"

(*) This is the work and effort and definition: the work of coming up the
concept rdf:Bag and saying that it is different from rdf:Alt. My opinion
is that semantics should say exactly how they are or could be different,
at least in an informative subsection (when, e.g., associated with a foo
predicate). If not, people make their own bags and alts and the W3C name
for the concepts is informative only (perhaps it should be?).

Very best regards,

--Ossi
