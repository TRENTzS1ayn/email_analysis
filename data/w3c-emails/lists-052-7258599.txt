Sure. Its kind of trivial, though. The basic RDF semantic rules for 
simple entailment (in fact for any kind of entailment except linear 
logics) support the rule that if A entails B then A entails (A and 
B), since A entails A trivially. The inference cited is simply a 
special case of that.

Can you, in turn, say why you think this is wrong?
