Yes, it is, since RDF *is* a logic in the required sense.

>Because, what is the "and" you are referring to?

In RDF, it amounts to the operation of forming a union of some sets 
of triples from those sets.

>More specifically, as said in the Bag/Alt issue text, I think you

I identified them, but that is not a confusion. They are the same.

It is always valid to take the union of two sets of triples, and the 
operation corresponds to simple propositional conjunction.

>Theory of a wrong definition of merge and blank node renaming?

I remember the discussion, but it is not relevant to this point. 
Renaming bound variables is an issue that comes up in conventional 
logical notations when conjoining two expressions which implicitly 
come from different quantifier scopes. The entailments in question 
here all are *inside* the quantifier scopes; that is why the same 
bnode ID is used in the Ntriples notation. So renaming is irrelevant 
here.

Here is a formal proof, if you really want to see it. Let us suppose 
that some valid process of inference is given the graph

_:xxx rdf:type rdf:Bag .
_:xxx rdf:_1 <ex:a> .
_:xxx rdf:_2 <ex:b> .

and infers the conclusion

_:xxx rdf:_1 <ex:b> .

where that nodeID indicates the *same* bnode, notice. (That is, 
intuitively, the conclusion is not merely that something exists which 
has the first element ex:b, but that the thing that has the first 
element ex:a also has the first element ex:b.) Then the graph (set of 
triples, recall) which contains all four triples is entailed by the 
first graph. Clearly, adding a triple which is validly entailed by a 
graph to that graph preserves the truth of the graph; that is how the 
closure rules work, for example. Similarly, if the first graph also 
entails

_:xxx rdf:_2 <ex:a> .

then the graph containing all five triples is entailed by the first 
graph (in fact, it is equivalent to it.)

I am not sure how much more detail you need. I cannot give you a 
fully formal line-by-line proof since we have never defined a formal 
proof theory for RDF, but the above argument uses the concepts and 
results from the RDF semantics document rigorously. If we had a 
formal natural-deduction style proof theory, the point could be made 
as follows: renaming is a mechanism for handling the requirement that 
existential elimination always uses a new name. The 
conjunction-introduction rule has got nothing to do with existential 
elimination, however, and we are only talking about purely 
propositional inferences here.

The point is so obvious that I am rather at a loss to explain it 
further, to be honest. If you feel it is in any way faulty, please 
explain why.
