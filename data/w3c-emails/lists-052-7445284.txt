The MT provides mechanisms for communicating the lexical space, value
space, and L2V map of these externally defined datatypes to datatyped
interpretations.  However, it is lacking a mechanism for communicating the
RDF ``name'' of the datatype to datatyped interpretations.

I disagree.  Datatyped interpretations need to know which uriref denotes a
datatype.  

In the absence of this connection in a datatyped interpretation, the only
way to make datatyped interpretations useful in the model theory is to
create semantic extensions that provide for the connection.  Thus any
useful theory of datatypes will be a semantic extension of datatyped
interpretations, just as RDFS is a semantic extension of RDF (but on a
considerably smaller scale).

Sure, if I want to create a datatyped version of RDF, I know how to
proceed.  I define my datatype, say octal integers <O,V,L2VO>, and say that my
datatyped version of RDF has this datatype.  I also need a semantic
constraint that says something like
IS(my:octal) = <O,V,L2VO>
I thus have created not a form of D-interpretation, but a semantic
extension of a D-interpretation.  Without this semantic extension, my
datatype is useless, as there is no way of determining that 
I("10"^^my:octal) = 8

However, if RDF datatypes included information about their ``name'', and
this was made part of D-interpretations, then I could just say that my
datatype was <my:octal,O,V,L2VO> and then D-interpretations that included
this datatype would have
I("10"^^my:octal) = 8
without the need for any semantic extension.

I would view this as a failure of the WG to provide usable datatypes.
