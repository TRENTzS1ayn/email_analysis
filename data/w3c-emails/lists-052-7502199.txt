I didnt intend that any of these were at the disposition stage; the 
intent was to get a reasonably quick feedback from Peter in case 
there was some issue that I hadnt fully grokked. There often is, I 
find, in his messages. I take his 'need to see the full document' 
response as a go-ahead to move to a reviewable disposition, and the 
more technical objections as indications that I have more work to do 
before even asking the WG to consider the change. For example, it 
seems I had been using an old version of Concepts to refer to for the 
XML literal rules, which Peter caught.

I feel in a bind here. Brian asked me not to CC to rdf-comments, so I 
can't use the original thread.

That is what I have been doing, albeit rather briefly in some cases, 
and Ive been CCing Peter to increase the bandwidth.

Right, I understand. I was just trying to increase the bandwidth 
between Peter and myself in order to get the issues sorted out as 
fast as possible. I didnt expect that the, er, conversation between 
Peter and me would be part of the record at this stage.
