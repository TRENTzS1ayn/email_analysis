Can you elaborate on your response? In what way does this make the 
language tag 'significant'?

I fail to see how it does. It explicitly and directly ignores the 
language tag, by treating any typed literal with a language tag in 
exactly the same way as the similar literal without the language tag.

Maybe we have failed to communicate somewhere?

Perhaps the following way of expressing the conditions would be clearer(?):

1.
  For any typed literal "sss"[@ttt]^^ddd in G, if I(ddd) is in D and
  'sss' is a valid lexical form for I(ddd) then
IL("sss"@ttt^^ddd) = IL("sss"^^ddd) = L2V(I(ddd))(sss)

  2.
  For any typed literal "sss"[@ttt]^^ddd in G, if I(ddd) is in D and
  'sss' is not a valid lexical form for I(ddd) then
IL("sss"@ttt^^ddd)  is not in LV and IL("sss"^^ddd) is not in LV.

Well, they clearly have the same denotation, so why is this incorrect?

Er...yes they are.

The term 'identifier' was taken from the Concepts document, where it 
refers to RFC-3066

Well, I copied it from there. But I see that I was referring to an 
older draft, sorry. That should be <rdf-wrapper 
lang="ttt">sss</rdf-wrapper>.  Also, if I follow the text of the 
Concepts document correctly then the case without the language tag 
also needs to be rewritten.

What I should do, obviously, is simply refer to the Concepts doc and 
use the terminology there. Then the statement of the condition would 
be as follows:

if sss is well-balanced, self-contained XML element content and ttt 
is a language identifier [RFC-3066] then 
IL("sss"[@ttt]^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is the canonical form of the XML 
document corresponding to the pair <sss, ttt>, as defined in [RDF 
Concepts]; and otherwise,  IL("sss"[@ttt]^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is not in 
LV.

I'll give the full translation in the Lbase table, though, with all 
the distinct cases written out in full (that is, six distinct cases 
for RDF literals).
