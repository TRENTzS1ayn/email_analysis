I think there are two issues here that I (we?) have been getting confused.

1. A D-interpretation should require that the denotation of a 
recognized datatype uriref is a particular datatype, as a semantic 
condition.

2. Some *mechanism* should be provided in the semantics document for 
assigning or attaching the denoted datatype to the datatype uriref.

I agree with 1, but have been arguing against 2. I thought you were 
arguing for 2, but I now suspect that you are in fact arguing for 1. 
It was my understanding that the current document actually specified 
1.  already, but on reading it carefully I see that it is implicit
(in the text: "Urirefs which denote recognized datatypes are required 
to have the same denotation in all D-interpretations, so recognizing 
a datatype amounts to fixing the meaning of a uriref. ") rather than 
explicit (in some equations), so I propose as a purely editorial 
change to make it explicit. To emphasize, this is not a change to the 
intended MT, only an editorial (expository) change to make the 
intended meaning clearer.

So if you were arguing for 1., then yes, and moreover that was always 
the intention, so I will try make this clearer, see below.  If 
however you wish to argue for 2 above, then we are in for a longer 
argument.

Right, this was always the intention, that if ex:foo is a recognized 
datatype uriref, then there is some datatype x such that in any 
D-interpretation I , I(ex:foo) = x. I should make that more explicit, 
clearly.
