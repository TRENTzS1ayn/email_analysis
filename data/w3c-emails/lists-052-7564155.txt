Oh, I see. It is significant for *ill-formed* typed literals. OK, I 
can tweak that easily enough. Will do.

Take that up with the relevant editors. At this stage I just want to 
get the documents consistent. I am not the XML guy on the WG, I defer 
to others when it comes to the 'best' way to use such a ridiculous 
and barbaric notation; its like asking what is the best kind of wood 
to use to build a suspension bridge.

But obviously I do not speak for the WG here.
