I wasn't clear.  Clarifying the comment is part of the process and should 
go on rdf comments so that we actually have a clarified comment 
there.  Hopefully that will take 0-2 exchanges of messages - what I'm keen 
to avoid are big sprawling discussion threads that will make it hard to 
track what's happening.

The thread on pfps-07 ending in:

[[Oh, I see. It is significant for *ill-formed* typed literals.
]]

But I don't want to see "that will be fixed" without a change id.

As it stands that thread proposes two changes - I'd prefer the thread ended 
with a summary of all the changes proposed in the thread.

I'm micromanaging here.  Sorry.

Brian
