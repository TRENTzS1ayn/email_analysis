Brian--

In your review of the Primer LCC, you'd noted something about the 
subject of a statement that need to be fixed "after last call" (copied 
below).  Now that we're in the last call period, I want to make sure 
this doesn't get lost, particularly since it seems to involve a question 
of consistency among Primer, Schema, and Concepts.  Does this need an issue?
