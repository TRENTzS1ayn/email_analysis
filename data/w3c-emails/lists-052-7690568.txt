Folks, I'm about to start putting the agenda for the telecon 
together.  This call is late, (I've been buried in meetings all week) but 
if you've got suggestions for items, please let me know.

If you've got proposals for issues we should discuss, those would be most 
welcome, as I didn't do too well last week at picking those we could 
usefully progress.

Brian
