Well, if you can suggest a way to word things so that the proofs can 
be written without being  precise about this one way or the other, 
I'd be grateful for any suggestions. Compared to the almost exquisite 
detail we are getting into over the minutae of the syntax of XML 
literals, this seems like a pretty important issue.

Its not that simple. The issue is whether or not we have to 
distinguish two pieces of RDF which differ only by renaming their 
bnodes. In one definition of graph we do, in the other we do not. 
This makes a substantial difference to a lot of places in the 
semantics document. It is also a pedagogic issue: the WG spent a lot 
of time arguing in confusion about whether or not bnodes were the 
same as anonymous urirefs, for example. We got this cleared up, but 
it can easily re-open again if we are careless about it. And what is 
the problem, in any case? Defining a graph to be a set of triples is 
about the simplest definition imaginable.
