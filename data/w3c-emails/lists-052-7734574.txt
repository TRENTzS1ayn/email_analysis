7: Handling last call comments.
see:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0198.html

Any comments, patricularly on the use of change ID's.

bwm has been wondering whether it would be most effective to wait till
we have all the comments in, before deciding dispositions.
  
             


8: Subject/Predicate/Object terminology
see:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Feb/0066.html

Concepts defines the subject and predicate of a triple to be URIs and
the object to be a URI or a literal.  Schema conforms with this and
also states that the subject of a statement is the resource denoted by
the subject of the corresponding triple, etc, to be consistent with
m&s reification vocabulary.

We need to have consistent usage across the docs.  Propose adopt above
usage and action editors to check their docs for consistency.
