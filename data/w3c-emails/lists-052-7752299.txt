Hi all

Per http://www.w3.org/2002/05/html/charter#list I understand this to 
be an appropriate list for getting the HTML WG's attention. Please 
pass this on to the WG member list if deemed appropriate.

This is just a quick note to remind HTML folks that the 
RDF Core specs are in Last Call (for details see Brian McBride's 
message to the chairs list, copied into public space at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Jan/0161.html ).

We would be particularly interested in feedback from the HTML WG on 
the RDF syntax specification, and in particular draw attention to 
section 9 where we touch on the issue of embedding RDF within HTML 
documents (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-rdf-in-HTML).
Our Last Call period ends on 21st February 2003. Any feedback the 
HTML WG could provide on this issue in particular would be greatly 
appreciated.

cheers,

Dan (for RDFCore WG)
