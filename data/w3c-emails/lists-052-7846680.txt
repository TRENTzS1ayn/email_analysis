I've had this conversation with Danbri before. The owl reasoner you
posit has superman and clarkkent denoting the same thing (ie, it applies
an interpretation that a comic reader would agree with). Strictly
speaking, from the comic reader's point of view (ie, in that
interpretation) the conclusion is correct: Lois thinks that the person
denoted by "Clark Kent" can fly, which he can, 'cause he's super.

Lois wouldn't reason using the same interpretation, so her conclusions
would be different.
