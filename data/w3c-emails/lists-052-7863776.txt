No, she doesn't know that.   She doesn't know that "Clark Kent"
denotes Superman. She doesn't think Clark Kent can fly.

However, I thought that the idea of the [bag]id was to show the 
attribution
of the information.  The semantics were that Lois think that clarkkent
can fly, or we believe the information because we got it from Lois.
This is misrepresenting the situation.  Either that, or the [bag]id
has some semantics I have misunderstood.  But i had assumed the attempt
was to say (in N3)

:lois :thinks { :superman :can :fly }.
:superman = :clakkent.

which does NOT permit one to conclude
:lois :thinks { : clakkent :can :fly }.
