>Dear Chairs (and please pass this to your Group members),
>
>The Program Committee (TPPC) has finalized the Agenda topics for the 
>Technical Plenary on 5 March in Cambridge...
>     http://www.w3.org/2003/03/TechPlenAgenda.html
>
>Based in part on your input, the TPPC has built an Agenda that we hope 
>will be interesting, educational, unifying and inspiring to the broad 
>range of interests that will be represented in the audience.  Topics include:
>
>* Why Are We Here?
>* The Impact of Modality Diversity: What does Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime, 
>Any Device Access to the Web Really Mean?
>* W3C Glossary: Schema and Tools for Interoperability and Common Understanding
>* Integrating our Products
>* The Evolving Web Architecture
>* One Web or Four?
>* Tech Town Hall
>
>Please return to the Agenda page in a week, when it will be updated to 
>include descriptions, participants and moderators for each Session.
>
>The 2003 Tech Plenary meetings week is shaping up to be the biggest (and 
>best, we hope) ever.  Already, we have a record number of Groups booked to 
>meet, and a record number of people registered to attend.  Please remember 
>that attendance registration closed on 26 February.  For further 
>information on the week's activities, please see the main meetings week page...
