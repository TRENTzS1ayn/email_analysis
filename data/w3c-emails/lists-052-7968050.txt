I'm sympathetic to that idea, but I think that is just a cosmetic 
change to the wording. The semantics has to treat the built-in 
datatype as a special syntactic case already. The real issue remains: 
lang tags in typed literals are allowed by the syntax, but required 
to be meaningless by the semantics, which seems dumb.  Either we 
should get rid of them in the syntax, or we should let them be at 
least potentially meaningful in the semantics.
