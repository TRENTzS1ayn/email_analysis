We discussed this at a telcon, but in case anyone missed it:

The slot we tentatively requested for a WG meeting at the tech plenary is 
being used for an open semantic web architecture meeting.  This is on the 
Thursday and Friday.  I think I recall hearing that it is already well 
subscribed.

I'm not sure where the agenda is. Eric?
