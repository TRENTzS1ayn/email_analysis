There is also a new accepted TAG issue on RDF in XHTML:

  RDFinXHTML-35 : Syntax and semantics for embedding RDF in XHTML
  http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#RDFinXHTML-35

I guess we should tell the TAG about the various pointers/ideas
discussed here.

I'm sure I've seen that idea before and it looked interesting,
although requires qnames which is a bit nasty - a new area for
(X)HTML? 

Immediate thought - when the object of a triple is a URL, how can you
distinguish that from a string that looks like a URL?

i.e. a triple with a URL object (in this rdf/xml)
   <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar> ex:homePage <http://purl.org/net/dajobe/> .
versus triple with a string object
   <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar> ex:homePage "http://purl.org/net/dajobe/" .

how about:
  <meta name="ex:homePage">
    <meta rdf:about="http://purl.org/net/dajobe/"/>
  </meta>

   <meta name="ex:homePage">http://purl.org/net/dajobe/</meta>

and the former is needed in this example.

Sorry, I'm unlikely to be there.


A further issue related to our use of <link> has been raised as a
last call comment:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0221.html

with discussion of the link types.  Can the HTML WG accept/check that
the ones in
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#section-rdf-in-HTML
are appropriate to recommend? We mention meta, alternative.

Thanks

Dave
