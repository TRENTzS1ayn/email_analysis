Excellent.

Interesting

Depends on what time frame you are thinking of.  We need to get done so a 
new syntax between now and  REC isn't on (precluded by charter).  But that 
doesn't mean we wouldn't encourage getting started.

:)  There have also been thoughts of a general mechanism which would allow 
folks to say "here's how to map my xml to rdf".

Its a great shame Dave won't be there, but I'm strongly in favour of at 
least an informal meeting.  There isn't an RDFCore meeting - its turned 
into an semantic web architecture meeting.

I'll put this on our telecon agenda for Friday.

I'd rather see this as future work than part of our current set of 
deliverables, so I don't think this need affect our last call schedule.
