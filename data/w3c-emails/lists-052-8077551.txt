I'm in process of putting together the agenda for tomorrow's 
telecon.  Please let me know if there is anything you want on it as soon as 
you can.  It currently contains:

   RDF in HTML
   XML Schema datatypes requirements
   subject/predicate/object terminology
   format of references in docs
   timeliness of responding to comments
   schedule for processing last call comments

Brian
