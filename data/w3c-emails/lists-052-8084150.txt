This is a reminder that the last call process calls for folks to respond to 
comments, make sure they are clear and preferably reflect them back in your 
own words.  Comments on some documents are getting good responses, but I'm 
not sure that is working across the board.

If you have comments languishing, please catch up.

Brian
