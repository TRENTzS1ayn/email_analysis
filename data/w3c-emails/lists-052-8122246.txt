Sometimes lots of comments raise the same issue, so
it can be efficient to let some things queue up.

I just browsed thr archive...
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/thread.html

and I think anybody who looked at it would agree we're
spending considerable effort to be resonsive.

I'm particularly curious to hear from Jan in regard
to his weekly audit.
