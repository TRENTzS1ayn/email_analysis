It looks like that has already happened.

It seems to me that the qnames ship has already sailed, and there is no
going back. The next version of XML Events will probably feature qnames, and
the meta element has always had a qnamish aspect to it.

Do you mean, how do you distinguish between a URL and the resource it
denotes?

I am personally not yet convinced that this is the correct use of rdf:about.
It looks like a kludge to me.

Indeed, it should be 'alternate' not 'alternative'. 'Meta' is fine.
