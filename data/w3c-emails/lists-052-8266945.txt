Well held that Man!  (English for "good catch")

The comment below on the vocab doc doesn't just apply to the reification 
section, there are many such instances, e.g.:

[[The triple

P rdfs:range C

states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is an 
instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the resources denoted by the 
objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.]

That one should go to comments.
