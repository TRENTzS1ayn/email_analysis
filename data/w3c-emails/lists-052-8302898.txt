As a guilty party here, I must assert this is not a Good Thing.

The last couple of weeks have been full of distractions, and my first 
priority has been to keep track of the things that require attention.  I 
find that the messages to which I must respond need rather more than a 
response dashed off in 5-10 minutes.

I shall try to find time to provide some response soon, preferably this week.
