There's been some discussion on WebOnt, starting here:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003Jan/0280.html

Also, it doesn't count as discussion, but I indicated a position here:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0228.html

But I'll agree with you that there's not yet been sufficient discussion to 
see where this is going.
