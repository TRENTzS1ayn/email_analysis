With reference to this comment:

[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0166.html

What do we consider to be the scope of "RDF core"?

I think that RDF core consists of the bare RDF language, RDF vocabulary and 
RDFS vocabulary, with corresponding entailments and intended 
interpretations.  I.e. the scope of this working group.

Any dissent?
