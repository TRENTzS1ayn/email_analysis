Thanks for letting me know Graham.  Looks like we should try to take 
comments concepts early.  Will you be able to work on the doc whilst 
travelling, i.e. if we got most of the concepts doc comments disposed of 
byt 14/Mar, do you think you could hope to have the concepts doc updated 
and pub ready by 04 Apr?

Brian
