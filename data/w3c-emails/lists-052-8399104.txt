Thanks Graham, the pointers were very useful.

Jeremy is suggesting - lets see if we can find a form of words that 
satisfies everyone.  I'm hoping that doesn't mean fudging the issue.  I'm 
also very concerned that you won't be present if there is a f2f discussion 
at the tech plenary.  Maybe we should be thinking about dialing you in?

I'm also wondering about laying some of the groundwork.  I'm seeing a lot 
of very unstructured discussion, and I fear there is great risk of 
confusion clouding the discussion.

Do you and Jeremy have any ideas on how we might best prepare/clarify the 
question.

Brian
