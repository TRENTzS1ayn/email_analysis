I'm not sure why you are asking this question?  If you you need to take 
this to the WG it should go on the comments list.

FWIW, I'm not sure why we need this term.  I've looked at a few cases where 
its been used in comments and it seemed one could avoid using it 
entirely.  I wonder also whether we need to check for consistent use across 
documents.  Which documents contain the term, other than to refer to the WG?
