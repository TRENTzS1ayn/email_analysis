Realistically, probably not *while* I'm travelling, but I'd reckon to put 
in a concentrated burst of effort soon after returning.  And I'd hoped to 
be able to do most of the work beforehand.  So I'd hope that 4Apr is 
achievable;  I don't seem to be able to master pubrules, so it would 
probably need someone available to look after that angle.

I should also be able to deal with point issues while travelling (I just 
don't expect to have the mental "space" to handle the big picture at that 
time).
