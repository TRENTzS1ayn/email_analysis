I don't think we need to compromise anything here -- I think most of the 
concerns expressed have been concerns of the WG, and the problem has been 
in the explanation.  In hindsight, I think the example we used has not been 
helpful, and I'd like to drop it.

Here are some thoughts I have:

[[
I think the issue of social meaning is poorly handled, and needs to be 
improved.  I think the main point we need to convey here is that there may 
be social meaning associated with some RDF that is opaque to automated 
reasoning processes.  The secondary point is that such meaning may be 
embodied in some collection of RDF statements, and those statements may be 
obtained by application of a logically valid reasoning process.  But there 
is no intent that RDF agents somehow need to be aware of the social meaning.
]]

There is a separate issue of how a URI gains its meaning, which I think 
should be handled separately.
