[just to make sure w.r.t. rdf comments]


We currently have (in our test code) that

  <test#x> <test#y> "10"@en^^xsd:int.

rdfs xsd entails

  <test#x> <test#y> "10"@fr^^xsd:int.

(i.e. ignoring the lang tag)


and that

  <test#x> <test#y> "chat"@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral.

does not rdf entail

  <test#x> <test#y> "chat"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral.

(which is straightforward as a builtin)

As I recall:

   - the WG has considered this.  At the time it made its decision, Pat
advocated accepting that lang tags be allowed in the syntax, that it was
harmless and seemed at the time to be important to Patrick who stated that
Nokia felt strongly about the issue.

   - later Patrick reported that after further thought, that whilst Nokia
still preferred the lang tag to be allowed in a datatyped literal, they
could live without it.

Before last call, this is perhaps something we could have considered.  Now
its a  change.  Might anyone change their review based on it?  Well, yes,
it seemed important to Nokia.

How important is this Pat.  Is it worth a second last call?  If its just a
case of extra work in writing the semantics - then I think you've made your

bed.  If it has undesirable externally visible consequences, that might be
different.
