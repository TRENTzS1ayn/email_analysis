Shelley's draft of her book on RDF (http://rdf.burningbird.net/ ) has 
this at the beginning of chapter 2, which seems to me to get right to 
the heart of the 'can say anything' discussion:

"RDF is a technique to record statements about resources so that 
machines can easily pick up the statements. Not only that, but RDF is 
based on a domain-neutral model that allows one set of statements to 
be merged with another set of statements, even though the information 
contained in each set of statements may differ dramatically."

Couldn't we use some similar form of words to convey the point, and 
thereby avoid the misunderstandings about expressiveness?
