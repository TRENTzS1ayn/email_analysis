I'm afraid I was only partially successful re this action item. 

Organizing an informal discussion in place of Friday's teleconference
was not possible. As such I suggest that we (the small few that were
able to make it) cancel this teleconference.

It does look, however, like we'll be able to allocate some collective
time at the tech plenary.  The current plan is to identify a time that
is conducive to both the HTML and Semantic Web meetings,  open up the
wall partition separating the two meetings and have a structured
discussion on the issues.

I'll post the details of this time and discussion as soon as they are
locked down.
