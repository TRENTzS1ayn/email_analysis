Let me make the following suggestions for a uniform way to approach 
and present our terminology.

1. A triple *is* a 3-tuple which is made up of a subject, predicate 
and object which are respectively a uriref or bnode; uriref; uriref, 
bnode or literal.

2. An RDF graph *is* a set of triples.

Note that so far there is nothing even remotely graph-theoretic - 
nodes, arcs, etc. - mentioned. This is important for the formal 
documents, so it would be helpful for readers if the less formal 
documents at least didn't give the impression of saying something 
different..

3. One can draw a *picture* of an RDF graph as a node-arc diagram 
(which is why we call them "graphs") using the conventions we all 
know and love. Notice that the labels of the directed arcs *in the 
picture* are always the predicates, and that the bnodes *in the 
picture* really are blank, etc.. Also in this picture one can see a 
distinction between nodes and node labels, and arcs and arc labels. 
But that's all just *pictorial*.

3a.  Maybe, when we are being careless, we might use the 'picture' 
terminology when talking about triples and RDF graphs. But that's 
just being careless and intuitive.

4.  RDF graphs are typically used to make assertions, by being 
published on the Web, and when so used they can be seen as 
*statements*; in effect, they *state* that some condition is true.

4a. When being careless, we might use the 'statement' terminology 
when referring to triples or RDF graphs. But that's just being 
careless and intuitive.

If we all stick to this discipline, then it suggests rewrites similar 
to the following in the places noted:

Change to:

"The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a collection of 
triples, each consisting of a subject, a predicate and an object. A 
set of such triples is called an RDF graph (defined more formally in 
section 6.) The structure can be illustrated by a directed node-arc 
diagram in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link 
(hence the term "graph".)

>[image of the RDF triple comprising (subject, predicate, object)]

When some RDF is published or claimed to be true, the triples in the 
graph are treated as assertions or statements. The assertion of an 
RDF triple says that some relationship, indicated by the predicate 
labelling the directed arc in a diagram, holds between the subject 
and object of the triple, indicated by the nodes linked by the arc in 
the diagram.  The assertion of an RDF graph amounts to asserting all 
the triples in it, so the meaning of an RDF graph is the conjunction 
(logical AND) of all the statements it contains. A formal account of 
the  meaning of RDF graphs is given in [RDF Semantics].

Right. I suggest we all do an edit pass to make sure that the words 
subject/predicate/object are used consistently to refer to the 
syntactic parts of a triple, and not to anything else.

Right, I think it is confusing. Better to say 'predicate'

Right. Suggested rewording might be:

"Some simple facts can be phrased in terms of a relationship holding 
between two things. Such a fact can be expressed by an RDF triple in 
which the predicate names the relationship and the subject and object 
name the things. "

Right, I have used this form of words in the semantics doc a lot, and 
it caused some confusion. But it is hard to see how else to say it, 
other than by being incredibly long-winded and making the text 
unreadable. Talking about the reification vocabulary is particularly 
awkward, of course.

I'm not sure what else we can do, except maybe add some emphasis 
prose to clarify things at particularly tricky moments, eg:

"...
S rdf:subject R

is used when referring to another triple S. It states that S is an 
instance of rdf:Statement and the the subject of the triple S is R."

But Im not sure that helps very much.

BTW, the above is not strictly true: it asserts that the subject of 
the triple S *denotes* R, not *is* R.
