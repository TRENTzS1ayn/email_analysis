I would support such a change (indeed, I thought this was our intent?).

Aha!  The rdfs:comment rubber hits the road!   To my view, having G1 entail 
G2, where G1 and G2 vary only in the [content of] rdfs:comment statements 
would be a significant shift in my understanding of the intent of 
rdfs:comment.  But I also think that rdf:comment may be unfortunately 
named, since I could imagine a view of rdfs:comment that is, by fiat, true 
in all interpretations.

As specified, rdfs:comment might be understood as "informal definition" 
rather than "something that might be said about".  But the name suggests 
the latter.

ALthough this impacts the definition of RDF, it does not do so in a way 
that changes any existing software, so this might be a good time to 
contemplate renaming rdfs:comment to (say) rdfs:intent, and changing the 
semantics so that:
   x rdfs:comment "some text"
is true in all RDFS-interpetations.
