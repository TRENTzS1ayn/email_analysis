Dave, you might be interested in a change Im proposing to the 
datatypes section in the semantics document, as follows, in response 
to a comment by Peter. It introduces the 'name' as an integral part 
of a datatype. This is a patch and if you can think of a better 
terminology and a pointer to a suitable spec I  would be delighted.

3.4 Dattayped interpretations

A datatype is an entity named by a uriref and characterized by a set 
of character strings called lexical forms and a mapping from that set 
to a set of values. (The built-in datatype rdf:XMLLiteral, 
exceptionally, allows pairs in its lexical space.) Exactly how these 
sets and mapping are defined is a matter external to RDF.

Formally, we will describe a datatype d as a 4-tuple consisting of

1. A uriref called the name of d

2. A set of character strings called the lexical space of d

3. A set called the value space of d

4. A mapping L2V(d) from the lexical space of d to the value space of 
d, called the lexical-to-value mapping of d
