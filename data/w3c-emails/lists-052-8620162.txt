As originator of the example, I agree. It was invented for use in a 
talk, where its shock value had some rhetorical purpose. As part of a 
spec document it probably raises way too many dangerous-seeming 
issues. We can make the essential point with a much blander (and 
simpler) example if necessary, eg A defines a class name and says 
something informal but significant about it (such as : Frobs; we can 
deliver these in one working day) , B uses it to assign a type, 
(#g000345 rdf:type A#Frob) then if the informal meaning applies to 
the class name (we assume A is telling the truth) then it has to be 
understood as applying to the instance name (A said he could deliver 
#g000345 in one working day). In other words, doing a formal 
inference doesn't break any social meaning. Kind of obvious, right?
