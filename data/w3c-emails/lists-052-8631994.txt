Meanwhile, a volunteer to run the session has emerged...

We're not planning any break-outs at this time; Jeremy's running
the session on social meaning:

[[

16:00 - 18:00 Second afternoon session 
        formal meaning meets social context
        
        J. Carroll, RDF Concepts co-editor, has volunteered to lead a
        discussion; see the call for position statements of 13Feb.

It's still possible we'll rearrange the times, but things
are generally converging/stabilizing.
