So you're telling me that

   ex:foo daml:equivalentTo xsd:integer .

is then semantically invalid, since the "name" in the formal 
definition of xsd:integer is *xsd:integer* and I can't say
"10"^^ex:foo and given the above statement mean the same
thing as "10"^^xsd:integer?!!!

If so, then I am adamantly opposed to this change.

I've yet to understand Peter's need for this change, even after
a good deal of private interchange with him, and remain completely
unconvinced that this is necessary.

It seems to me to be in direct conflict with the very core of RDF,
that URIs denote resources without any requirement that the URI
be an inherent part of those resources in any way.

Pat, if you can, please justify this change to the WG (or at
least me).

Thanks,

Patrick
