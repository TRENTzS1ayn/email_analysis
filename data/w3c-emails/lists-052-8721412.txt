Jeremy--

I don't think any real "fudge" is needed.  It seems to me simply that 
(c) needs to clearly convey the idea that it is not the RDF Core WG that 
is mandating social enforceability, or that there are legal 
ramifications.  Aren't we saying something roughly like this:

1.  People use RDF statements to convey meaning related to the real 
world (just as they use natural languages)
2.  That being the case, the social environment in which those 
statements are used may associate various additional meanings (and, in 
some cases, consequences) with them, just as they would if the same 
statements were made in English.
3.  What the social environment does along these lines is determined, 
not by the RDF specifications, but by conventions, laws, etc.

A simple example would be to compare something like:

"This product contains 100% orange joice"

with somethihg like:

ex:product ex:contains _:foo
_:foo ex:ingredient ex:orange_juice
_:foo ex:percentage ex:100

If the English appears in the description of a product, the maker of the 
product will be held to the truth of that statement (and that's probably 
true whether the English appears on a paper label, or in an HTML 
description of the product on the Web).  Society (by passing appropriate 
laws on the subject, assuming the existing laws don't apply already) may 
determine that the corresponding RDF statements have the same legal 
force.  This is a consequence, not of the RDF specifications per se, but 
of the fact that RDF can be used to convey statements about the real 
world, and such statements, in whatever form, may have consequences 
determined by the social context in which they are made.  We're simply 
pointing out to people some of the potential issues raised by this 
aspect of RDF.
