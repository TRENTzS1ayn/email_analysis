As long as canonicalisation is expensive and/or difficult to get right,
too large for embedded work (? - really the case these days), and
there's a lack of decent libraries to perform this, I think the "cheap
and cheerful" approach makes a lot of sense.

Is this a problem with XSLT? That is, does the dropping of unused
namespaces in a canonicalisation mean that xslt is lacking a "dummy"
construct to utilise otherwise unused namespaces?

If so, is there an XSLT feedback avenue?
