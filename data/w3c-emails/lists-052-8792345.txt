The last call comments period has closed.

However, some of you may have noticed that we have not yet received 
comments from XML Core, the URI folks, I18N, XML Schema or SVG.

I suggest:

   - we proceed according to a previously agreed schedule
   - we make best efforts to deal with late arriving comments
     but set an expectation that comments arriving after this
     week are less likely to get attention
   - Eric has agreed to chase the other WG's and encourage them
     to get their comments in this week

This means that editors may begin discuss editors drafts in public, but 
please keep this lo key for now (RDFCore and Webont lists only) as we 
clearly don't have all the comments in yet.

This week we need to be dealing with the incoming comments on the mailing list.

Please can we get these either closed or on the main comments list.

Brian
