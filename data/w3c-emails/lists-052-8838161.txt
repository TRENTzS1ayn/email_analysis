No, its fine. The conditions don't say that you HAVE to use the name, 
only that it is there to be used if you want to be sure of getting 
that very datatype.

No, you can say that. And then normal DAML reasoning ought to let you 
come to that conclusion, since it presumably should allow a reasoner 
to substitute names known to be 'equal'. But it is asking rather a 
lot of a DAML (or OWL) reasoner, to get inside RDF literal syntax, 
and I bet that some of them wouldn't be able to handle it, in fact.

Well, I tend to agree, but he is most adamant that he wants it, and 
it seems harmless to let him have what he wants. Nothing else breaks, 
as far as I can see.

The trouble is that datatyping uses the datatype URIs in a special 
way: it needs them to be proper names, not just symbols that denote, 
like logical constants. Logical names can be reinterpreted 
differently, but proper names refer 'rigidly'. They need to have the 
same denotation in ALL D-interpretations. (What these conditions do 
is make this 'same in all D-interps' condition absolutely explicit 
instead of its being implicit in the statement of the interpretation 
mapping.)  And that does raise a legitimate concern about how one 
gets a particular thing (a dataytpe in this case) so firmly attached 
to a URI.  Ultimately I agree with you that this goes beyond our 
remit to solve, but having the thing say what it's 'official'  URI 
is, is just a kind of semantic handle for doing this. It doesn't stop 
you or anyone else using another URI to refer to the thing, just like 
you all call me "Pat" even though it says "Patrick John" on my birth 
certificate.

So is that OK, with that understanding that allowing an 'official' 
name does not exclude the use of other names?
