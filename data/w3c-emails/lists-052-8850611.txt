Speaking for semantics, there is an editorial impact whatever we do, 
even stick to the status quo, since the LC version didn't handle lang 
tags in typed literals (mia culpa) and trying to fix it is what led 
me to make the suggestion.

On balance the entire semantic framework would be simpler, and the 
'correct' text easier to write, if
1. we ban lang tags from all non-XML typed literals (change the 
syntax, that is)
and
2. make the XML case syntactically special.

Exactly how it is made special I really don't care, but I have to 
treat it specially in any case since it has to be incorporated into 
the RDF semantics early on in the document before I refer to the 
datatyping stuff, so having it be a datatype doesn't really help the 
Semantics editor at all.  The XML bit would be easier to talk about.

On the other hand, I have no real objection to handling it as a 
datatype if people feel this is useful. But I do NEED some input from 
the Concepts editors on some terminology I can use to refer to the 
things in the lexical and value spaces of this datatype.

Yes, he does.

Yes, the current position is that untyped literals can be seen as 
typed with the 'invisible' datatype whose lexical and value spaces 
are identical and whose L2V map is the identity. You could think of 
this as a default datatype, in fact: unless some other is mentioned, 
this is the one you get.
