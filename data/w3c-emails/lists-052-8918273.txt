The term is used there only when referring to QName syntax, as in:

"....semantic conditions reflecting the intended meanings of the rdf: 
and rdfs: namespaces."

It would be easy to rewrite this using the term 'vocabulary', which I 
will do as an editorial change, so as to eliminate the term 
completely from Semantics.
