It's also worthwhile noting that a number of existing applications are
happily using these "underspecified" bits of vocabulary, such as
containers, based on their informal meanings, to do useful work.  We
have at least one app in-house that is happily using reification in the
same way.  Without meaning to diminish the importance of formal
semantics for things, people do manage to successfully communicate
meanings in English sometimes (and incorporate it into their software).
