Since LC is now officially over, I can go public with the fact that 
you can take a peek at the ongoing changes to the editor's draft of 
the Semantics at

http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_Editors.html

This will get changed without warning at random times. I'll change 
the date every time and use 25a, 25b style dating for frequent 
changes.

Right now Im about 3/4 through the post-Lech edits, and have made 
several changes based on Peter's and Herman's extensive comments. 
Some of these have consequences scattered around the document, but 
Ive used styles and links to help y'all keep track.

Places marked with @@ still need work., or else mark editorial 
comments in the text.

The appendices are still not updated, Im leaving those changes until last.

Patrick and Jeremy, see if you can live with
