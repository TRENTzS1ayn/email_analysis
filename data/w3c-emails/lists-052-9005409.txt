Graham, I am also rather worried about this, which I simply didnt 
notice before (mia culpa). Can we at least have some discussion? I 
mean, surely we cannot go on record as saying that any URIref with a 
fragID in RDF *denotes* whatever that fragID would mean to any 
application. That would make "rdf:type" for example refer to a place 
in a web page, or to whatever an HTML browser would interpret it to 
mean. So what did you mean here by 'identifies' ?

Or am I not following you at all here??
