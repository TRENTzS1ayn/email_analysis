This topic is beginning to generate long emails which may be redundant if 
the cause is a minor confusion.  If so maybe we can save a little effort.

I think that's the term that caused the problem, and that Pat just withdrew it.

The cause of the problem is that folks (including me) are worried that Pat 
is proposing a change to what a datatype is, and since we are using the XML 
Schema datatype model, that could be a problem.

Having read the latest MT doc:

   http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_Editors.html#dtype_interp

I don't think that is what is happening, but I'm not sure.  I think the new 
semantics doc hasn't changed what a datatypes is, but has introduced the 
URIREF of the datatype into the *formal machinery* describing the semantics 
of the datatype, which is probably ok.

Lets try a test case.  From

   http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#datatype

[[
[Definition:]  In this specification, a datatype is a 3-tuple, consisting 
of a) a set of distinct values, called its ?value space?, b) a set of 
lexical representations, called its ?lexical space?, and c) a set of 
?facet?s that characterize properties of the ?value space?, individual 
values or lexical items.
]]

So xsd:decimal denotes a 3-tuple, and the URIREF of the datatype is not a 
component of the 3-tuple, nor is it 'part-of' any component of the 3-tuple.

Pat, does the semantics document say anything that conflicts with this 
statement?
