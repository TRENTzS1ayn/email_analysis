Right, nice way to put it.

No, that is fine. (Well, the XML text omits the L2V mapping, but 
that's their problem...) I'm happy to say that a datatype IS whatever 
it always has been, but I also want to say that it HAS a name 
(provided by its external maker) and that we are obliged to treat 
that name as denoting that triple-thingie.

I really don't see this as a change to anything other than the way 
that the MT expresses itself; but Peter was right to point out that 
there was a lacuna in the LC version, since it didn't make this 'use 
the given name properly' specification clear. We have consistently 
obeyed this convention ourselves, of course, from day one: there's 
never been any doubt that the URIref 'xsd:integer' really does refer 
to the datatype xsd:integer, right?
