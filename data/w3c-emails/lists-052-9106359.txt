This is the usual weekly call for items for this weeks telecon.  Items on 
my probables list include:

- status of capturing last call comments
- scheduling processing them
- processing some of them

The last of these requires that we have some proposed dispositions, so I'm 
looking for suggestions.  I suggest we try to pick some 'easy' (is anything 
ever easy?) ones so we can start to work up a rhythm.
