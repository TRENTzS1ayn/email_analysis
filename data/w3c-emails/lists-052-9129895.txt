BCC-ed to three groups, sorry for duplicates.

I have put together a preliminary agenda for this session to be found at:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/meetings/tech-200303/social-meaning

Note I suggest reading the relevant text and Bijan's comments on it as 
prework.

I would particularly welcome feedback if the list of issuettes is incomplete.
(I have tried to include substantial concerns rather than ones that could be 
addressed by editorial changes).
