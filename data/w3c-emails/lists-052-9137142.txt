Agenda request for tomorrows telecon.


The current AS&S WD of WebOnt
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics

permits the following in OWL Lite:

<owl:Class rdf:about="&eg;Bag"/>
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="&eg:_1"/>
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="&eg:_2"/>
<eg:Bag>
  <eg:1>
    <owl:Thing/>
  </eg:1>
</eg:Bag>

but prohibits from OWL Lite:

<owl:Class rdf:about="&rdf;Bag"/>
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="&rdf:_1"/>
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="&rdf:_2"/>
<rdf:Bag>
  <rdf:1>
    <owl:Thing/>
  </rdf:1>
</rdf:Bag>


(Both examples may include rdfs:comments indicating that the informal
semantics intended is that of an rdf:Bag - an informal semantics that is not
formally supported either in OWL Lite or RDF).

Both examples are in OWL Full and have identical semantics in OWL Full
(except that the URIs of the classes and properties differ).

This appears to be an unmotivated failure of interoperability between OWL
Lite and RDF.

I suggest that this WG may like to either:
- make a comment asking for a rationale on public-webont-comments
or
- ask Brian to raise this at the coordination group.
