This talk sets the scene for our work on semantic web architecture.  It 
presents a high level overview of semantic web architecture and indicates 
those areas in which we are contributing.  It describes our work updating 
the RDF specifications, identifying the issues that needed to be addressed 
and describing the techniques that have been used to address them.
