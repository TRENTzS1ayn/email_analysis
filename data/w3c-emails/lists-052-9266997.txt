9: Status on Last Call Comments
A co-chair would like to email a sweeper message to all contributers to rdf comments in the last n time periods saying - 

[[we think we have all comments either dealt with as editorial or captured 
in the lcc comments doc.  please check and make sure any comments you have
 are properly recorded.]]

I don't think we are ready to do this yet.  When can we?

Comments solicited from specific WG's: only XMLP seems to have responded yet.


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#microschedule


10: Handling last call comments
What order do we want to do these in?


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/


11: Issue pfps-17,18,19,20,21
Proposal, (after a suggestion by Patrick, incorporating comment by Frank)

That the term 'namespace' be used when referring specifically to an XML 
namespace, and that the term 'vocabulary' be used when referring to a set 
of URIREF's such as defined by RDF and RDFS.


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-17


12: Social Meaning
The social meaning issue is on the agenda to be discussed at the tech plenary.

From a process point of view, such discussion is informal and may or may not
result in a suggestion being brought back to the WG for formal consideration.

This agenda item is specifically

  - to allow time for those who will not be present to comment prior to
    the tech plenary discussion


See:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/
