One easy one is getting some nomenclature consistent.

1.  What is correct: uriref, URIref, URI Reference ? Which document 
or source defines it?
2.   Please can someone provide terminology for 'a well-formed XML 
literal' (one that covers the cases with and without lang tags) and 
also for whatever the value space of rdf:XMLLiteral is supposed to 
contain.
3.  Please can we agree that an RDF graph is a set of triples and 
decide which document is going to give the definition others can link 
to.
