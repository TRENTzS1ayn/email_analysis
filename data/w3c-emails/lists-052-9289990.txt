The intent is OK, but the words are still giving trouble.

>a) RDF has meaning that relates to the relate world.

Obviously that is our *intent*, but it smacks of hubris (to put it 
mildly) to come across as asserting this as though our asserting it 
made it so. Lets be very careful, when saying things like this, to 
emphasis that this is an expression of our *intent* for how RDF will 
be used.

>b) This meaning is preserved under formal entailments.

This I think we can say pretty strongly, in a form that nobody can 
complain about, by saying that if any kind of meaning which extends 
the formal meaning is attributed to RDF, then we can guarantee that 
no valid RDF reasoner will do anything to the RDF which would alter 
or change that attribution of meaning. From which it follows that if 
anyone uses a notion of meaning which can be altered by a valid RDF 
reasoner, then they are going outside the normative spec.

>c) This meaning should be socially enforceable in the same way as the
>meaning of other languages that relate to the real world (e.g. English).

Who are we to say this? Even as a statement of intent? I think this 
is what Peter and others are complaining about, it sounds like we are 
expressing a view here about the way that the world should be 
organized. Its none of our business.

>d) The document section should be normative.
>e) The use of a word like "legal" is strongly preferred.

I would disagree, I think that this is what has cased all the 
trouble, and we don't need to get into legal issues. And we aren't 
competent to get into them, either.

I think that it is ridiculous to even set out to assert things like 
(c). Is deletion a kind of fudging?

Never mind closure, I don't think we have even started to tackle this issue.
