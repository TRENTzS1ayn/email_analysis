RDF URI reference

[[[
A URI reference within an RDF graph (an RDF URI reference) is a Unicode
string [UNICODE] that:

      * is in Normal Form C [NFC] and
      * would produce a valid URI character sequence (per RFC2396 [URI],
        sections 2.1) when subjected to the encoding described below. 
]]]
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#dfn-URI-reference

It seems to go by a number of synonyms...

"... URIs with optional fragment identifiers
(URI references, or URIrefs) ..."
 -- 3.2 URI-based Vocabulary and Node Identification

... but the definition above is what the WG agreed
26th April 2002 regarding
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-charmod-uris


Bummer... the syntax spec seems to import using a different
link:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Graph-URIref
from
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20021108/#section-Identifiers
ah.. #section-Graph-URIref is the section that dominates
#dfn-URI-reference. So that's clearly the same thing,
technically. Seems worth fixing for editorial
consistency.


Now for a bit of elaboration that goes beyond what you
asked for; perhaps fodder for the issues list, if Brian
or DanBri is so inclined...

The WG has chosen a concept/design which isn't yet available
from mature/ratified specs.

It's not exactly RFC2396's URI reference; that notion
includes "../foo" but that's not a name that RDF interpretations
may give a denotation.

It's not exactly RFC2396's absolute URI; that
doesn't include http://example/foo#bar , which RDF
interpretations *may* give a denotation to.

It's not exactly RFC2396's absolute URI plus optional fragment;
that doesn't include http://example/Andr&#567; ,
which may be in the vocab of an RDF interpretation.
This non-ascii stuff is the bit that's too new to
import from any ratified spec.
cf. TAG issue IRIEverywhere-27, cited from concepts section
6.4 RDF URI References).

While we weren't maximally conservative on this issue,
I think we made the right decision. I have already
seen non-trivial deployment[*] of non-ascii characters
in RDF URI references; i.e. I think our decision
minimizes cost over the long term.

  relevant standards (eikeon: thanks for the pointer) and may
  even help test out some implementations here and there..."

Editorially, I wish we hadn't settled on something with
"reference" in it. I use 'symbol' in my code. Dunno
if that's really best... maybe 'RDF identifier'?
As in 'resource description framework identifier';
almost exactly the same as 'uniform resouce identifier'
except that the latter is us-ascii only to date.

Maybe not sufficiently better to bother... but
here's why I don't like "RDF URI reference"

TimBL has suggested that "URI reference" is
one of the syntactic short-hands for a URI, e.g. "../foo". i.e.
it's a handy piece of local syntax, not the global identifier.

Hmm... I don't see the Andre' test cited from the syntax
spec. But it's in the test collection somewhere, no?
Hmm... I can't find it. Jeremy? Jan? Where did
the test cases for rdf-charmod-uris go?

Am I imagining them? no... I remeber this...

  Jeremy to the XML namespace folks...14 May 2002
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-names-editor/2002May/0003.html

and it leads me to the Apr 26 2002 approval of the tests...
but I don't see them in the test spec.

seems to be 'XML document corresponding to a pair ( str, lang )'
from section 5. XML Content within an RDF Graph.
hmm... no hypertext anchor. It's only marked up
with <em> and <var>.

Yes; that would resolve danc-01 nicely.

Concepts is already that way...
