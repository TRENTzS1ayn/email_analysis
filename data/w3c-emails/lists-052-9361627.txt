Looking at my msg which Pat is replying to, I think I had better disown it!

I have found Bijan's comment a fairly thorough demolition job - and the 
question is: Is there anything worth salvaging from the rubble?

Bijan even makes good arguments against the formal entailments being 
somehow mandatory. (c) below.
