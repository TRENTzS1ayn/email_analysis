Dan, I'm not understanding you here:

As far as I can tell, "http://example/Andr&#567", or even 
"http://example/Andr&#567;", *is* allowed by RFC2396, and consists of an 
absolute URI + fragment [**].

I don't think that's what you meant, but I'm having difficulty figuring 
precisely what your actual concern is here.

[**] My test case:

     "http://example/Andr&#567;"

parses as:

     [ ( URI "http:" "//example" ["/","Andr&"] "" "#567;", "" ) ]
