No it isn't.  The requirements there allow a datatype to have two 
names. What is required is only that the 'official' name really does 
name the datatype,

I(name(d)) = d

that doesn't stop I(<someothernamefor:d>) = d

But maybe this needs to be stated more carefully to make this clear.

I could do that but I don't think it would be a good idea, that 
really would break that OWL identity once and for all, and it would 
trigger Patrick's objections.
