The williams issues are relevant here.

He doesn't like the term RDF URI Reference because:
1: it looks like RDF doing its own thing rather than following other 
peoples' leads (despite the fact we were trying to follow charmod)
2: an HTTP URI reference starts http: ...

He likes the term IRI, we could import this term from XML Namespaces 1.1;
and it does not have "reference" in it but is very nearly what we use 
except for the NFC stuff.

I think we should await input from I18N before nailing this one down.
