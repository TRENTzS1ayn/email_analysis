I am concerned that you have thrown out the baby with the bathwater.
And still left some bathwater. ;-)
Our views do seem rather different

What is required, and easy, is to say what an RDF document means.

What is not required and a bad idea is to explain how to use it.

1. The meaning of an RDF document is that of the statements.
2. The meaning of the statement is defined by the definition
 of the predicate, as applying to the subject and object identified by the
  definition of the subject and object terms.

That then hands off to the relevant specs the right and the duty to
define their bit.

There we differ.  For me, the meaning of a bit-field or a docuemnt or a 
packet
or a message is what specs are for.

That is where you start getting into questionable stuff, necessarily
slanting the use of RDF some way.

If  my:car :color :blue means that my car is colored blue, that
is what it means, quite independent of context.
The concept of  something having a given color is
defined (and only defined) by the definition of color
and my:car only serves to idetify the car and  :blue only
serves to identify the color.  Documents defiing
my:car and :blue may contain all kinds of other info but they
have nothing which related to the statement at hand apart to
identify the subject and object.  (You can't for example
define ":blue" to mean "A color which which  things have it
they are rough to touch".)  So this is an important distintion.
It is in the MT as the extension of p being a  the  THINGS x THINGS
or words to that effect.

The statement  doesn't mean that I am promising anything,
or selling anything etc.   It says and should say nothing about the 
context in
which it is used - that is Somebody Else's Problem.
RDF has nothing to say about lying or cheating or repainting cars,
about quoting statements or sending them as attachments and so on.
It only says what they mean per se.

I have no idea what that gives me.

strike "is indended to be used"  which just seems to add fuzziness.

This is muddled and ignored the fundamental case that we are talking 
about p(s,o)
and not s(p,o).

Nor should one cross the road without looking, or take wooden nickels.
