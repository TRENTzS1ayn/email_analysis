This for me is the crux: do we mean the machine oriented 'definition'
in RDFS or OWL or N3, or some more rounded/scruffy/social notion of 
definition.

Use case: I want to add 'foaf:uncle' to my FOAF vocabulary at 
http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ and intend to express as much of the conventional
meaning of 'uncle' as I can with the technology available, ie. RDFS + 
OWL + N3 + HTML/prose. In the case of 'uncle', most of the meaning is invisible
to RDF/S and OWL. But most of it could be handled by N3 rules, assuming 
we had foaf:parent, foaf:sibling, gender vocab etc.

So when you say 'the definition of the predicate', that to me is where 
our problem lies. (I'm happy btw having predicates drive the meaning 
of statements, though I think this is something we stipulate rather than 
show). Which 'definition' of the predicate sets the meaning?
