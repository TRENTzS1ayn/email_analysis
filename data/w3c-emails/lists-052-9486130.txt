Whatever is available.  It tends to depend on the term.

Well, that is a big assumption.    So let's be sepcific

{ ?x :uncle ?y } log:iff  {  ?x   :parent  [  :brother ?y ] }.

is a precise definition of the term for someone for whom parent and brother
are defined.  But this of course doesn't really help us as somewhere the
thing has to be grounded in english.

'"?x :uncle ?y" indicates that y is the uncle of x'

is an english definitoin which will do for a lot of people.
I would expect a good spec to have both.
The formal  information is a useful axiom.

One would expect that any maths given with an english definition would be
consistent with it.
