However this is ultimately resolved, I want to note that the Primer 
initially says that RDF uses URI references, and henceforth abbreviates 
the term (where possible) as "URIrefs".  I would object on behalf of 
ordinary readers of English to replacing each occurrence in the Primer 
with "RDF URI Reference" (if that's the final terminology);  Dan's 
"bletch" would be a mild reaction if I had to do that (not by me, by the 
readers;  I can operate a "global replace").

I'd also note that the Concepts text that's being cited here

"A URI reference within an RDF graph (an RDF URI reference)..."

seems to effectively equate "RDF URI Reference" with "a URI reference 
within an RDF graph".  So is it a URI Reference or not?  Note that we're 
talking about *syntax* here (this is the abstract syntax section), 
rather than differences about what RDF chooses to use these things for 
(which seems to me a separate issue).  So are RDF URI references 
*syntactically* URI references or not? (I understand that not all URI 
references, e.g. relative URIs, are legit as RDF URI references;  but I 
think we cover that)

[BTW:  If we were going to make a major change here, I'd opt for 
something along the lines of Dan's "RDF identifier";  but then the 
Primer would have to change the whole discussion of how URLs generalize 
to URIs, and how this lets RDF do all sorts of wonderful things, and... 
I sure wouldn't like to have to do that!]
