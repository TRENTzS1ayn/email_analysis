I find Bijan's observation compelling
[[
But there's no vague, much less precise, definition of "defining 
information". And I'm a logical reasoner, will this information be opaque 
to me? (Well, if in German, yes, but *all* human reasoners?)
[...]
So it's formal meaning isn't fixed IN ANY WAY by the "authority"? And the 
social meaning?
]]

Two points:
- "whatevers available" is simply not clear enough.
- RDF has decided to avoid the notion of definition for the formal 
semantics, we shouldn't then have it in the informal semantics.

For me, either of these is fatal. This cat has had its nine lives.
