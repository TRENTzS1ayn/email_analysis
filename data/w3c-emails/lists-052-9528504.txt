Yes, there are a variety of strategies for representing the meaning of a 
term. The RDFS spec tries to acknowledge this in 
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_comment where we say:
"""A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate 
the intended meaning of the classes and properties described 
in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed 
as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces 
may be used to provide richer documentation."""
(I suspect we could usefully lose the word 'intended' there; 
 and I certainly wouldn't replace it with 'social'!)

Yes, though I do hope at some point a WG offers some best practice 
guidelines to authors of rdfs:comment or owl2:comment properties to 
help them write their comments in such a way. Imagine if they wrote
"'xyz(?x,?y)' indicates that there is an xyz relation between ?x and ?y".
Or variations on that theme. We can I think do an incrementally better 
job of helping people be clear about the meaning of the terms they create.

This view requires that we conceive of the possibility of there being a 
gap between term meaning and what definition_s_ of the term say, especially
as there may be various definitions, and these may be refined and 
improved over time. The convenient idealisation is that there is a 
single meaning towards which all these definitions are fumbling...

I very much agree. Belt and braces. HTML, RDFS, OWL, (rules, ..., ...).

Yes. And I believe many of us anticipate there being languages in 2-3 
years time that will make such formal information more widely accessible
within RDFS/OWL/+++ vocabulary descriptions.

A reasonable expectation, and one that indicates something we've not 
really explicitly articulated: that we (well, maybe 'we') believe 
as our guiding fiction that class and property terms have a meaning 
that is independent of the languages (html, rdfs, owl, n3, ...) that 
we use to try to characterise that meaning. When all goes well, 
those varying characterisations are in sync. When things go badly (discuss...:)


This is somewhat related to RDF's practice of treating properties 
and classes as just more entities from the domain of discourse: they have a 
life beyond the RDFS assertions that describe them, or the OWL-encoded 
rules that describe them slightly better. There are, to stick with 
my use case above, facts of the matter about the proper use of 
the 'foaf:uncle' which we attempt to capture using whatever tools are 
within our grasp. Meanwhile, the property gets deployed and used. This 
division of labour allows people to get out there and _use_ RDF 
while W3C WGs work on better ways (OWL being the latest but I doubt 
the final) of characterising the meaning of these terms.
