...while discussion the presentation of RDF reification vocab in RDFS with Brian, we 
noticed:

"Each property arc represents a statement of a 
relationship between the nodes that it links, having three parts:"

I think this should be "...represents a statement of a relationship between 
the things denoted by the nodes that it links", or similar; the statement is 
about the world, not the syntactic structures used to model it.
