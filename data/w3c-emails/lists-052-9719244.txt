...many thanks to our series Editor, Brian, who gave the doc a lot of 
attention over the last couple of weeks. It's imho in pretty good shape now,
thanks to Brian.

So, we need WG review, and specifically some named reviewers (although 
everyone should be reading everything at this stage). Does anyone 
want to volunteer to review the RDFS LC candidate?
