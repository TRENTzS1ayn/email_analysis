I got a lawyer (Danny W.) to look at the concepts stuff a while
back; he was OK with the legal stuff there.

I'm pretty sure I sent mail to the WG saying so...
darn; searching for the keywords I think I would have
used (Weitzner, rdfms-assertion) suggests I didn't.

I haven't seen any changes that suggest he should look at
it again, though I haven't been following very closely.

But I'm fairly confident we're OK here.

EricM, if you're not, please get Danny to review it
again after last call.
