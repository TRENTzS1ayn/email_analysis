A happy and prosperous new year to everyone.

As you may recall from the last year, the plan was to review

   primer
   concepts
   syntax
   semantics
   test cases

and attempt to agree to last call publication on 10 Jan 2003.

And to publish a last call candidate for schema on 03 Jan 2003 and decide 
to publish that on 17 Jan 2003.  We have our schema last call 
candidate.  All docs are linked from the WG overview page.

Reviewing where we are at, we have:

   Concepts  - 2 reviews
   Syntax    - 1 review
   Semantics - 3 reviews

I am hopeful that we can approve concepts and syntax this Friday based on 
those reviews.  Semantics may be a little trickier as I'm not sure whether 
Pat will be around to discuss it given the webont face to face.

I believe we have the following outstanding actions:

2002-12-13#11  DaveB  review all unapproved test cases before 10 Jan
2002-12-13#12  JanG  identify specific reviewers for unapproved test cases

We seem not to have named reviewers for all the documents.  I thought we 
had volunteers for all except schema already assigned, but these are not 
shown in the record.  If you did volunteer to review a document and have 
not yet done so please speak up soon.

As things stand, we need reviewers for:

   Primer
   Schema
   Test Cases

I volunteer to review Primer and Test Cases and unapproved test cases by 
Friday.  I can't do schema I'm too close to it.  Please can I have at least 
one more volunteer to review primer and test cases and two for 
schema.  Ideally the primer and test cases review should be done by this 
Friday.

Brian
