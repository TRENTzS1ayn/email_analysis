I just re-ran my Raptor parser against the latest versions of the
testcases in the CVS repository/on the live web site (not in the
zips).

With the following patch for rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/test003.nt
just reported to Jan today.

These still need to be obsoleted (they allow aboutEach or aboutEachPrefix)
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#test0007
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#test0008

This one not contain rdf:RDF as the outermost element; it is a test
of another XML format with embedded RDF/XML.  If we want to allow
this, then the manifest must indicate it with either a flag or a
different type of input source and the parsers can then scan for
rdf:RDF (you can't both scan for rdf:RDF AND assume the file is rdf/xml)
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/xmlbase/test005.rdf


These are no longer errors; bare attributes ID, bagID, about,
resource, parseType or type are OK:

bagID: 
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0002
resource:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0003
ID:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0004
parseType:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0005
type:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0006


Seem to me to be implementing a check on the syntax of mailto: URIs.

The other things I've still got to work on (bugs in Raptor)

* I'm still fighting XML Canonicalization rules to get these to work:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces/Manifest.rdf#test001
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces/Manifest.rdf#test002

* The very expensive checks for rdf-charmod-literal and rdf-charmod-uri tests.
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#error001
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#error002
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-uris/Manifest.rdf#error001

* A few other error cases I haven't added checks for:
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/Manifest.rdf#error001
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0002
