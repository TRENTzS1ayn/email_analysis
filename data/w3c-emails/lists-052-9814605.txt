It turns out there was a typo in one of the manifest (test:status
OBSOLETED not OBSOLETE), and Jan has already obsoleted several of the
tests I asked for:

 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0001
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0002
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0003
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0004
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0005
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0006
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0007
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0008
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0009
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#test0007
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#test0008
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/xmlbase/Manifest.rdf#test005

So the updated update is that Raptor passes all APPROVED tests but
the following; which are problems with Raptor not the tests.

 * XML Canonicalization rules:
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces/Manifest.rdf#test001
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces/Manifest.rdf#test002
 
 * The very expensive checks for rdf-charmod-literal and rdf-charmod-uri tests.
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#error001
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#error002
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-uris/Manifest.rdf#error001

 * A few other error cases I haven't added checks for:
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/Manifest.rdf#error001
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#error0002
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-elements/Manifest.rdf#error003
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfms-syntax-incomplete/Manifest.rdf#error006

The only remaining one I don't like is 
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/xmlbase/Manifest.rdf#error001

which is the mailto: validation check.


I'll look at how the other tests work (the not APPROVED ones).
