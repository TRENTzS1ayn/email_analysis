    This is a negative entailment test that concludes a "false
    document" which is a bit wierd!

    These three have no description; I suggest something like,
      "language is not involved in entailment"

    I assumed this is from the RDF Semantics 1.2:
    [[The meaning of a literal is principally determined by its
      character string]].
    however later in 1.3 it says:
    [[ Simple literals, without embedded datatypes, are always
    interpreted as referring to themselves: either a character string
    or a pair consisting of two character strings, the second of
    which is a language tag.]]

    Can somebody point to me the rule that says these entailments are
    valid?

  Negative rdfs-container-membership-superProperty/Manifest.rdf#test001
    Might be a typo?  not1P.rdf has:
       <rdfs:contains rdf:resource="http://example/stuff#somethingElse"/>
    and there is no such term.

    Maybe this should be rdfs:member ?  If so then it seems plausible
    but is there a rule that forbids it, or is it done by omission of
    this entailment in the "If E contains" rules sections.


Suggest obsolete
  Miscellaneous Test rdfms-uri-substructure/Manifest.rdf#error001
    Although we suggest that you produce exception if something
    cannot be serialized, I don't think this is very useful as a
    test.
 
    Otherwise, it is approved.
