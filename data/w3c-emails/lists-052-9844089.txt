Attention editors.

>Hello, Chairs.
>
>This is a notification of a pubrules change, effective immediately. It is 
>a change in Rule 1.7 [0], item 10:
>
>"The copyright must use the following markup."
>
>With the change of European host and the change of Gregorian Calendar 
>year, the copyright notice for all technical reports has changed. The new 
>markup includes the correct year, the correct markup for ERCIM, and short 
>name links for the various W3C Policy documents. You'll find the new 
>markup included in Publication Rules itself, as well as in the TR template [1].
>
>The pubrules checker is also being updated at this time. Unlike other 
>pubrules changes, we do need to implement this immediately, as it is 
>related to copyright. Both Henri, our Webmaster, and I are here to help 
>you with any questions you may have on this change.
>
>Thank you for your attention, and best wishes for a productive 2003.
