I have reviewed the LCC test cases doc at:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-testcases-20030117/

Summary:

thumbs up.  A few must fixes.

Must Fixes:

1.  delete from introduction

   (when the test cases are completed)

2. Negative entailment tests

   [[These tests are specified in exactly the same fashion as positive 
entailment tests...]]

They aren't *exactly* the same, or we couldn't tell which is which.  Suggest:

[[
Negative Entailment Tests are specified with the same structure as positive 
entailment tests except that a <test:negativeEntailmentTest> element is 
used instead of a <test:postiveEntailmentTest> element.
]]

Editorial:

I'd prefer that the examples were labelled as such, but this is not critical.
