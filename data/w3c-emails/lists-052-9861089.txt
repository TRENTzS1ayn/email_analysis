One correction needed, but basically fine.


I've ignored all the parser tests as they have been covered by the machine

Issues

xmlbase/Manifest.rdf#error001

This is the xml:base with a mailto: uri.  Clearly the answer to this must 
come from the xml:base chaps.  I suggest we leave the test unapproved and 
seek feedback from the xml:base folks.


rdfs-container-membership-superProperty/Manifest.rdf#test001

rdfs:contains should be rdfs:member.

entailing a false doc.  I might have expressed it as a positive entailment 
entailing that the prop is also a class.]]

[[I would prefer the statement that bar is a property be removed from the
