Danbri, Frank,

summary: I would assert that these 2 documents are in sync with the
(intentionally sparse) definition of isDefinedBy. I suggest a
non-critical editorial change to the primer in the addition of an
example included at the end of this message.

5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy

rdfs:isDefinedBy is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to indicate
a resource defining the subject resource. This property may be used to
indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described.

A triple of the form:

S rdfs:isDefinedBy O

states that the resource O defines S. It may be possible to retrieve
representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such
representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the
format of those representations. rdfs:isDefinedBy is a subproperty of
rdfs:seeAlso.

5.4. Other Schema Information

RDF Schema also provides a number of other properties, which can be used
to provide documentation and other information about an RDF schema or
about instances. For example the rdfs:comment property can be used to
provide a human-readable description of a resource. The rdfs:label
property can be used to provide a more human-readable version of a
resource's name. The rdfs:seeAlso property can be used to indicate a
resource that might provide additional information about the subject
resource. The rdfs:isDefinedBy property is a subproperty of
rdfs:seeAlso, and can be used to indicate a resource that (in a sense
not specified by RDF; e.g., the resource may not be an RDF schema)
"defines" the subject resource. For further discussion of these
properties, you should consult RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0:
RDF Schema [RDF-VOCABULARY].

I would assert that these 2 documents are in sync with the
(intentionally sparse) definition of isDefinedBy.

Editorial suggestion (not critical): 

I suggest we include an example illustrating a potential use of this
property in the primer. Frank, if think this is a good idea and are
willing to release write-lock, i can add this and renumber the examples
accordingly.
