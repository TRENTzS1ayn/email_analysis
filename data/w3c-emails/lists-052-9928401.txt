Eric,

Thanks for this. A brief nitpic:
in your example,  you might consider adding '#' to the end of the URI(ref), 
so that it matches the uriref that'd be used to deploy the vocab as a 
namespace.

other than that, seems fine. I was in a minority with isDefinedBy in that 
I wanted it to have at most one value for any given resource/property, and 
without that I find it of less use / interest. Your account below seems 
self-consistent though.

Dan
