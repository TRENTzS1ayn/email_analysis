Item 6: Confirm status of completed actions

ALL DONE

Item 7: Confirm status of withdrawn actions.

DaveB commented that there were a large number of these.

ACTION 2003-01-10#1 (jang) chase down the test case actions marked
"withdrawn" in today's agenda and check/complete if they are
still pertinent.

Item 8: Format for the telecon

  All editors to check pubrules compliance, to approach readiness to
  publish as much as possible.

  Fixes should be made to the documents in the rdfcore TR directory -
  coordinate with Brian or Eric if you need to get documents into that
  space

  Fixes that should be done now are CRITICAL ones (bugfixing) and
  TRIVIAL ones (typos, missing links, etc). The Series Editor urged
  people to resist wordsmithing for its own sake, as document stability
  at this time is important.


Item 9: Primer

Item 11: Concepts

  [JJC made time to join the call at this point]

ACTION 2003-01-10#8 (gk) supply words for concepts section 3.3 to
address PatS' concerns that we stress DTing is not XSD-only.

  We also discussed the requirements the document made concerning
  XML 1.1 compliance. JJC felt that the document represented a
  practical and reasonable compromise.

ACTION 2003-01-10#9 (gk) correct concepts doc in line with danbri's
comment in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0001.html

  PFPS also raised a substantial issue on concepts; GK felt it was
  best addressed by letting the matter be discussed during the LC
  process. PFPS' review of all documents is here:
