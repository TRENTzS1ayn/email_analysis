Hi Folks,

I just chatted with Pat about moving to closure on the semantics doc.  He 
is going to be travelling and is somewhat connectivity challenged, so I'd 
like to see if we can agree what changes need to be made by close of 
business Monday.

Looking at the reviews we have had:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0306.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0324.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0000.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0003.html

Jos and Jan report no show stoppers, and Graham raises:

   1. some instances of rdfs:XMLLiteral

   2.
Section 4.3, rule rdfD4 has a conclusion:
    aaa rdfs:subClassOf eee .
that I think should read:
    ddd rdfs:subClassOf eee .

I believe I also spotted another typo:

   rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Property .

where the rdfs:Property should be rdf:Property.

I believe all of these fall into the category of trivial fixes:

   typos, links and formatting errors.

and propose that Pat feel empowered to fix such errors at his discretion.

Then just remains the issue that Peter has raised about rdfs:Literal

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0014.html

about which we await a response from Pat.

Graham, if there are any of the discussion issues you raised that you think 
are potential showstoppers, please could you identify them asap.

Subject to a satisfactory resolution of the issue raised by Peter, I hope 
that this will enable us to make a last call decision on the 17th.

Brian
