1. FIX: subject of a statement (after last call)

In

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#dfn-subject

concepts defines the subject of a *triple* to be an RDF URI Reference.


In

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_statement

Schema defines the subject of a *statement* to be the resource named by the 
URI that is the subject of the triple.

Primer describes the subject of a *statement* to be a URI reference.  This 
mixes the two definitions.

I suggest the text in section 4.3 on Reification needs to be reviewed 
against the text in the schema doc to ensure consistency.

2. Amused

[[ ex:fred is an ex:primaryDriver of the instance ex:companyVan  ]]

If you read that aloud, it sounds like there has been a serious accident :)

3. remove changes section at the end
