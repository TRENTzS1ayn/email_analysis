Right, we need to fix this (both "triple" vs. "statement" and "URIref" 
vs. "resource named by URIref") There are other places that may need 
fixing as well.  Concepts section 3.1 starts off saying "The RDF graph 
is a set of *triples*", but goes on to talk about "a value that is the 
subject of *the statement*".  Perhaps there should be some text at this 
point that more explicitly defines the connection between "triple" and 
"statement" (since there are a number of other places in Concepts where 
"statement" rather than "triple" is used).

Good point.  This is what comes from my too-uncritically following 
suggestions from the Series Editor in his last review :-) (the prefix 
was xyz: before;  should we change it back?  Or perhaps we should 
actually use your comment in the Primer as an illustration that you 
shouldn't try to read English meanings too literally into RDF statements!)
