Just replying to the problematic bits (and asking for comments from the
WG, not just replying to Dave):

Brian said it (he did it! he did it!).  It was in the LC version and no
one complained.  If it's inappropriate to say it this way, we need to
find some other words to explain why we talk explicitly about the XML
Schema datatypes (in Primer, Concepts, Semantics, ...) and no others. 
But I think "first among equals" captures it pretty well.

My choice is to leave it alone!

I'm basically following the model of the OWL specs here (DOCTYPE and
all).

"ill-formed" was intended to be equivalent to "not-well-formed".  Do you
think the latter is better?

Yeah, but I don't see how this distinction can be made very well here.

yes!

If you could suggest some alternatives, that would be even better.  DanC
wants to talk only about "languages", which is fine in principle, and I
appreciate that we are not "defining a processing model" (as this is
generally put).  The problem is that we don't really have distinct
languages in the sense lots of people think of languages being
distinct.  Given an RDF schema, this is *both* RDF and RDFS.  The
difference between the "languages" is whether particular conclusions can
be drawn from particular pieces of reserved vocabulary or not.  Pat
describes this in terms of different kinds of entailments, but that
doesn't seem appropriate in the Primer, and saying "conclusions can be
drawn", being passive voice, elides the issue of who or what does the
conclusion-drawing.  I think characterizing this difference in the
Primer as one between different kinds of software (or software written
to understand different stuff) is reasonably clear, and it's not clear
to me what the problem is in saying that way in a non-normative document
(e.g., what inappropriate entailments are introduced?).  But I'll be
happy to entertain alternative ways of saying the same thing.

Why?  rdf:IDs work relative to the document don't they?

What kind of thing?  If you mean not using an xml:base, the text says
they ought to use one.

How important is this;  like, how many sentences is it worth?  :-)

I'll have to look at the xpackage spec itself to check this out.

To illustrate a use of RDF in the field.

The text says so, but OK.

I'm not sure I understand.  The whole Primer is informative, so
obviously the Appendices are.  I can emphasize that the defining spec is
RFC2396 in the text.

If this is also what you meant for URIs, that's fine.

Could you translate this? :-)

I don't think I explicitly mention external DTDs, but maybe it's
implicit from the syntax.  I'll see if I can tighten this up.

Do you think it's equally readable having done that (I'm more worried
about human readers than XML parsers!)?
