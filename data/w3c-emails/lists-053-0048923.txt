Sorry this got lost. Draft response follows:

Dear Qu

In
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0267.html
you made a comment which was subsequently clarified in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0318.html
and archived as a formal comment Qu-03:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#qu-03

We have been treating this issue as similar to the one raised by Jeff 
Pan, archived as pan-01:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pan-01

since they both requested that RDF be described in terms of a layered 
sublanguage.

After discussion, the WG has resolved that to attempt
to define such a proper sub-language is beyond our charter and our
timescale. However, we have resolved

http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-layered-subset

that this issue should be classified as postponed, meaning that it
will be on the agenda of any WG which considers RDF in the future. 
This recognizes that the issue needs to be addressed eventually.

Please let us know if this response is acceptable, CCing
www-rdf-comments@w3.org.

Thanks.
