This assertion comes as a considerable relief to me.  I confess I did
not read the text of that paragraph, I just looked at the math and it
was not obvious to me that IP must be a subset of IR.

I then checked the now complete (?) closure rules in 7.2 and couldn't
see how to get the required entailment.  The required entailment seems
to require rule RDFS4a - thus its an RDFS entailment, not an RDF
entailment.

I know better than to argue mathematics with you, but maybe you could
reassure me by spelling out what I'm missing.

I don't want you to have to change anything.  Please just talk me out of
my concerns.
