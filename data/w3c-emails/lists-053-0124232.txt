Hi Pat,

Sorry if you get this twice - having email trouble again.

I am greatly relieved to hear that.  I didn't read the para you quote. 
I just checked the maths of the semantic conditions and they didn't seem
to require that properties are resources.  I then checked the (now
complete?) closure rules in 7.2 and couldn't see how the desired
entailment could be attained from them either.

I know better than to argue mathematics with you, but maybe you could
point out what I'm missing?

Could someone please spell it out for me, cos I can't see the
derivation.

I don't want any changes either, at this stage.  I'd much prefer to be
assured that I'm wrong.  In RDF, properties are resources, and if the
semantics ain't saying that, I do think that's a problem.
