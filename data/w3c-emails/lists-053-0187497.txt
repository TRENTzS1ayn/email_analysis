Well, that's been something I've wondered about myself, but it be a change 
from the original spec without any compelling justification that I could see.

I think so, since the proof I offered used other aspects of RDFS entailment 
(axiomatic triple, rdfs:domain and ICEXT conditions).  If the entailment 
were true in RDF without the other RDFS semantic constraints, I would fear 
a new possibility of corner-case contradictions.
