Dave--

I understand that it's the pair (rdf:ID value, in-scope base URI) that 
must be unique.  The question is, within what scope must it be unique? 
That is, a uniqueness check involves checking all the values (the above 
pairs in this case) within some scope to see that there aren't 
duplicates.  What is that scope?
