How about:

  NOTE: N-Triples is an RDF syntax intended for RDF Core WG testing
  purposes, checking RDF applications for conformance with the
  specifications and as a document notation in the definition of the
  recommended RDF exchange syntax RDF/XML as defined in [RDF-SYNTAX].

It's a bit long (1 sentence) maybe.

  NOTE: N-Triples is an RDF syntax intended for RDF Core WG testing
  purposes, checking RDF applications for conformance with the
  specifications and as a document notation for the abstract graph.
  The recommended RDF exchange syntax is  RDF/XML as defined in
  [RDF-SYNTAX].
