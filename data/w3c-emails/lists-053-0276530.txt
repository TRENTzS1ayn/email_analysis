I prefer the first, and maybe it can be trimmed a little:

[[
   NOTE: N-Triples is graph description syntax for expressing
   RDF test cases and defining the correspondence between RDF/XML
   and the RDF abstract syntax.  RDF/XML [RDF-SYNTAX] is recommended
   for use by applications to exchange RDF information.
]]

OK, so that's more of a hybrid.  Take your pick.
