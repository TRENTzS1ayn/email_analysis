[This message rambles a bit... for my final suggestion, skip to ****]

I agree, and suggest:

[[
The lexical space
     is the set of all Unicode strings which:

         * are well-balanced, self-contained XML data [XML];
         * when encoded using UTF-8 yield exclusive Canonical XML
           (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList )
           [XML-XC14N];
]]

It occurs to me that the source of confusion may be:
[[
The lexical-to-value mapping
     maps a string to the corresponding exclusive Canonical XML (with 
comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ).
]]
-- 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-XMLLiteral

when, now that the canonicalization is handled by the parser, all we really 
need to say is:
[[
The lexical-to-value mapping
     is UTF-8 encoding of the lexical form (yielding an octet sequence)
]]

It which case, the lexical space description might be:
[[
The lexical space
     is the set of all Unicode strings which are mapped by the
     lexical-to-value mapping to exclusive canonical XML
     (with comments, with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList )
     [XML-XC14N];
]]

But hang on, we already have:
[[
The value space
     is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty 
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ), which when embedded within an arbitrary 
XML start tag and an end tag form a document conforming to XML Namespaces 
[XML-NS].
]]

So even that is redundant.  Maybe:

[[
The lexical space
     is the set of Unicode strings which are mapped by
     UTF-8 encoding to valid XMNL literal values (see below)
]]

****

Putting it all together, and polishing a little, my suggestion is:

[[
The lexical space
     is the set of Unicode strings which are mapped by
     UTF-8 encoding to valid XML literal values (see below)

The lexical-to-value mapping
     is UTF-8 encoding (yielding an octet sequence, where octets are
     distinct from characters)

The value space
     is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments,
     with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ), which when embedded
     within an arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag form a document
     conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS].
]]
