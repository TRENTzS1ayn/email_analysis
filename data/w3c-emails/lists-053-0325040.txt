Er, oh yes.  That's existing text:  I just copied it from:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-XMLLiteral
so I suppose that will need changing as well.

[[
The value space
     is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments,
     with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList), which when the
     character sequence they represent is embedded within an
     arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag form a document
     conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS].
]]

(This use of octet sequence from C14N gets uglier and uglier... oh well.)
