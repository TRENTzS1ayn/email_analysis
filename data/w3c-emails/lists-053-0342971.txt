Gentlemen:

I am completely sick of all these debates about XML literals. Allow 
me to suggest a possible solution, along the lines suggested by 
Peter, which will serve to resolve them without making any 
substantial changes to the current RDF design and to everyone's 
general satisfaction.  This is a wording change to the Concepts 
document; I do not believe it amounts to any real change in our 
current design, and may be easier to follow.

1. Concepts section 5.1 modified as follows (change starts at ***)
.....

Such content is indicated in an RDF graph using a typed literal 
whose datatype is a special built-in datatype rdf:XMLLiteral , 
defined as follows.
A URI reference for identifying this datatype
is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral .
The lexical space is the set of all strings which:
are well-balanced, self-contained XML data [ XML ];
correspond to exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty 
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList )[XML-XC14N] ;
when embedded between an arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag form 
a document conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS]
***
The value space is some set of entities, called XML values, which is:
disjoint from the lexical space
disjoint from the value space of any XML schema datatype (refer XSD)
disjoint from the set of Unicode character strings (refer Unicode)
in 1:1 correspondence with the lexical space.

The exact nature of XML values is not specified.

The lexical-to-value mapping is a 1:1 mapping from the lexical space 
onto the value space. The value of the lexical-to-value mapping

----------

The only change to the semantics document then needed is to change 
'XML data' --> 'XML value' in the second RDF condition, which I have 
now done as an editorial change in any case..

Pat

PS. Peter, I have also fixed the XML range inconsistency bug, noted 
in the change log, and updated the links to refer to the latest 
archived editor's draft of Concepts 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117 , dated 
28 July
