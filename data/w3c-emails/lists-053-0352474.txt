I have put in protective text after Peter noticed that it is possible 
to have an inconsistency in RDFS (using range and XMLliteral). This 
is noted in section 4 (end), with the example; the possibility of a 
trivial entailment is noted in 4.3, a clause noting this case is 
added to section 5; and the statement of the rdfs entailment lemma in 
7.3 is now restricted to the consistent case.

New version with these changes, dated 31 July, now at

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html

In another thread I have made a suggestion for terminating the XML 
literal identity debates.
