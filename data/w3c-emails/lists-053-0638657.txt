I do not want a blank cheque, as you put it, but we are obliged by 
W3C protocols to deal with comments in isolation to some extent, so 
if you are unable to sign off on any comment until you are satisfied 
on everything, then we probably never will reach sign-off by you. 
Brian is anxious for us to get the issues dealt with, and we seem to 
have to do this by a piecemeal process. I was not asking you to 
approve the entire document, only the part of it which addressed your 
comment.

Le me suggest that we compromise. The only parts of the document 
which affect OWL are the normative parts.  None of the rules tables 
or appendices are normative. (I note that if the OWL documents were 
held to the same standard that you are holding me to, then AS&S ought 
to include complete and correct systems of inference rules for all 
three versions of OWL together with completeness proofs. ) So let me 
suggest that we agree that you will accept a piecemeal approach to 
settling issues which arise from parts of the document which are 
informative, and I will agree to a somewhat higher standards of 
finish before asking you to approve any repairs done to the normative 
parts of the document. Would that be acceptable?

Pat
