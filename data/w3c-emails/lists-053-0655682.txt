There has been an initial response to the WebOnt S+AS comments I
submitted.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003May/0121.html

These look OK thus far (one issue awaiting WebOnt discussion); if other
members of the WG are happy I'll indicate so to PFPS. Brian, do you want
me to respond immediately or wait until this week's telecon?
