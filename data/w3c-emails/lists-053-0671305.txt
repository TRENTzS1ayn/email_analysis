My comment was that the RDFS closure rules are incomplete.  There is no way
that I can sign off on this until I see a finished version of the model
theory and the closure rules, which I have not yet seen.  From my end it
looks exactly like you are asking for a blank cheque.

If the process is getting in the way of doing the right thing, then I
suggest that you get the process changed.

This is a false and misleading statement.  If S&AS contained inference
rules that it claimed to be complete and correct, then yes, they had better
be complete and correct and there had better be something to back up the
claim.  However, S&AS has no such inference rules.

This, of course, gives rise to a simple solution to the ongoing problems
with the closure rules - just remove them.

This would not be acceptable.  There is no way that I can sign off on the
correctness of the RDFS closure rules until I see a finished version of the
model theory.
