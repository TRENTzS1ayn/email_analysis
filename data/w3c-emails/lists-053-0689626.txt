OK, then I misunderstood the point of your comment. I agree, you 
cannot sign off on completeness until you see the whole thing. 
However, I might as well tell you right now that I  do not plan to 
offer a completely written out proof of the RDFS closure lemma, so 
you may never feel able to sign off on this. I think that you are 
being unreasonable, given that the entire comment refers to a 
non-normative section of the document.

That would provide no extra utility and serve no purpose. I might 
remove the claim that they are complete, if I am unable to prove it 
to my satisfaction.
