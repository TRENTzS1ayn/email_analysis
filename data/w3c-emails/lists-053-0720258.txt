Er... we don't currently say nothing; we currently have
wording from 6.1.2 in  RDF/XML Syntax and 
rdf-tests/rdfcore/unrecognised-xml-attributes/test002.rdf

If it's a bug, it's evidence that the XML spec is
*not* sufficient to make it clear to implementors
how this works. Let's please add the
this <xml:lang>en</xml:lang> example to the test
suite, regardless of what the disposition is.

How do you come to conlude that it's a bug, Jeremy?
The text in 6.1.2
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Nodes
is about attributes, not element names.
