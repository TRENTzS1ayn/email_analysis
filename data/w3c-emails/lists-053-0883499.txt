I think you can probably get away without defining "arc" any further 
than it already is (where it's used in describing the diagrams), if you 
eliminate its use in the third sentence of Section 3.4:

"A literal may be the object of an RDF statement, but not the subject or 
the arc."

Here, "property" or "predicate" should be substituted for "arc" anyway, 
to be consistent with the terms used for the other components of the 
statement.
