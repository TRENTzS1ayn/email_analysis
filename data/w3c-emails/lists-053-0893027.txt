Martin,

I'm not sure whether it matters, but with all due respect, this is not 
even partially a last call comment.  The window for submitting last call 
comments to RDFCore closed some time ago.  This is thus a post last call 
comment.

RDFCore is reviewing post last call comments and considering how to 
respond to them, so you can be assured that this comment will go through 
that process.
