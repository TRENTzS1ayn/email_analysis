This is a complicated issue, and I may have overlooked some of the reasons 
we are where we are, but I think Martin's description [1], second part 
(starting with "The orgininal RDF spec 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222)had very few variation 
for literals."), is useful and well-presented background.

I think the arguments made reinforce the idea of losing XMLLiteral as a 
datatype, which I previously [2] argued in favour of in response to 
Martin's earlier comments [5], which were themselves in response to the 
decision [3] [4] to drop language tags and <rdf-wrapper> stuff from XML 
literals.

So, along the line, it seems we decided:
(a) that XML C14N was a parser issue, and the abstract graph syntax is 
presumed to contain only canonical XML literal data,
(b) to drop the language tag from XML literals, hence the need for 
<rdf-wrapper> in the abstract syntax.

Martin argues that (1) XML literals shouldn't be gratuitously different 
than plain literals, and (2) XML literals really need to have language tags.

Thus, I propose that parsetype='Literal' values be treated as plain 
literals, and that the parsetype='Literal' is simply a flag to the parset 
to not try to interpret the contained XML data as any form of RDF 
description.  The value of a literal thus described is simply the sequence 
of characters (after C14N applied to the RDF/XML) contained within the 
corresponding element, together with the in-scope XML language tag (if any).

The current approved definitions, per [6] [7] make it clear that a plain 
literal denotes either a string or a pair of two strings, one of which is a 
language tags.

After that, there's one final wrinkle raised by Martin's last message, 
namely the status of xsd:string datatyped literal values.  My view on these 
is that they are syntactically distinct values in the RDF graph, but under 
a suitable datatyped interpretation will denote the same thing as a 
corresponding plain literal without language tag.
