I'm circulating this comment as folks in the telecon said they would be 
interested to see it...

 From Martin Duerst:
[[
Please note that according to Ralph, parseType='Literal' was only
an indication of how to parse the element content, and didn't
indicate a difference in underlying nature. I.e. changing
      <dc:title>A Midsummer Night's Dream</dc:title>
to
      <dc:title rdf:parseType='Literal'>A Midsummer Night's Dream</dc:title>
would still result in the same text string.
