We seem to have consensus on weakening MUST to SHOULD.

Maybe we can remain silent about the areas we still disagree on. In 
general, the RDF specs do not specify behaviour on ill-formed input.

I note that the only explanatory text offered anywhere is a pointer to 
charmod, so that implementors chosing to permit non-NFC, can only honour 
the RFC 2119 requrement to understand the full implications of not 
implementing SHOULDs by first reading CHARMOD.



Possible edits:

Syntax:
(latest editors draft

)

(IN order searching for "NFC" through the document - all these changes 
might benefit from further polish).

change
[[
MUST be a Unicode[UNICODE] string in Normal Form C[NFC]
]]
to
[[
MUST be a Unicode[UNICODE] string and SHOULD be in Normal Form C[NFC]
]]

change
[[
MUST be in Normal Form C[NFC].

change
[[
This string x MUST be in Unicode[UNICODE] NFC Normal Form C[NFC]
]]
to

In concepts
(editors' draft)

[[
The string in both plain and typed literals is required to be in Unicode 
Normal Form C [NFC]. This requirement is motivated by [CHARMOD] 
particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization.
]]
to
[[
The string in both plain and typed literals is recommended to be in Unicode 
Normal Form C [NFC]. This is motivated by [CHARMOD] particularly section 4 
Early Uniform Normalization.

Section 5 datatypes

change
[[
The lexical space of a datatype is a set of Unicode [UNICODE] strings in 
Normal Form C [NFC].
]]
to
[[
The lexical space of a datatype is a set of Unicode [UNICODE] strings.

Section 5.1 XML Content within an RDF Graph

change

The lexical space
is the set of all strings:
- in Normal Form C [NFC];
- which are well-balanced, self-contained XML content [XML];
]]
to
[[

is the set of all strings:
- which are well-balanced, self-contained XML content [XML];

6.5 RDF Literals

change:
[[
All literals have a lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string in Normal 
Form C [NFC].
]]
to
[[
All literals have a lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string, which 
SHOULD be in Normal Form C [NFC].
]]
