I apologize if "evil" is seen as too strong a wording.  Obviously the mere
fact of producing a non-NFC string is not evil.

NFC was designed especially so that it matches the huge majority of current
and predictable usage.  Almost any string you can type with most keyboard
drivers or transcode from most legacy encodings is automatically NFC.  You
will not find a substantial fraction of people doing non-NFC as a matter of
fact.

What you may find is a small but scary minority who will intentionnally do
non-NFC to take advantage of holes in software that doesn't pay attention to
the issue.  Worm, visuses, forgeries, that kind of things.
