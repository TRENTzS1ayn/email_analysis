Gentlemen:

Many thanks for your intensive and persistent work in rooting out 
errors, unclarities and general lacks of perfection in the RDF 
Semantics document.

This is just a heads-up to let you know that the documents will soon 
be moving to second last call, so that if you wish to make any 
further comments on the text it might be worth waiting until the LC2 
versions are published on the 10 October.  In the meantime, the best 
text to look at would be the latest editor's draft (which as far I 
now know, will be, apart from changes to the boilerplate, the text of 
the final LC2 version) which can be viewed at

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_LC2.1_NFC.html

This has changes made in response to all the comments I have seen up 
to this morning (Friday 1100 CST) and also reflects some last-minute 
WG decisions, notably on NormalFormC.  The change log summarizes 
them, but I can provide more details if you want.

Be warned that the links to other RDF documents in this version now 
point to the as-yet-to-be-created 10 October drafts, so may not work 
until that date.

Thanks again

Pat
