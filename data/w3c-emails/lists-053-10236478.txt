Not quite.  I accepted an action to reflect the optionality of rdf:RDF 
in the Primer.  It seems silly, given all the examples currently in the 
Primer, to have yet another example just to omit the rdf:RDF.  What I 
propose to do is to comment, at the point where rdf:RDF is introduced, 
that the enclosing rdf:RDF element is optional in situations where the 
XML can be identified as RDF/XML by context (but it doesn't hurt to 
provide it anyway), and to see the Syntax document for further details.
