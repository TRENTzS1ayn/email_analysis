This 'formal dissent' from the XML Schema WG amounts to objecting to RDF
Core's charter which is a document from March 2001 and we didn't ask
them for a review of it.

I think that this thus makes their original comment (xmlsch-10) and
reply out of scope and not thus this isn't a last call issue.  Or if it
is, our response to the director is "out of scope, objects to the WG charter"

Either way, I can't see what to say to them now.

Dave

We realize that this is a difficult area, but we believe that it would
be  a  mistake  for  W3C to move forward with a new version of the RDF
specifications  without  undertaking  the  work  of  a revision of the
syntax.

We  regret  that we must dissent formally from your resolution of this
issue.  The  current mismatch between RDF syntax and off-the-shelf XML
tools  has  not  become  easier to bear as time goes on; we believe it
must be addressed.
