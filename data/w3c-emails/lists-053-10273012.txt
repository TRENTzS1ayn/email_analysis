A similar response here; where the XML Schema WG's response is that
RDF's XML syntax should change despite our charter explicitly not
allowing that.

Since our reply to their mail 6 months ago, more people have implemented
RDF/XML parsing on top of SAX2 (python, perl), DOM (C#) and XPath/Xquery
(Java) and linked RDF on top of SAX events and XSLT so it's hardly been
hard or disconnected with XML.

Any suggestions for how we record this?  A last call issue that amounted to
requiring us go outside the WG charter to resolve to their satisfaction.

Thank you.

We realize that this is a difficult area, but we believe that it would
be  a  mistake  for  W3C to move forward with a new version of the RDF
specifications  without  undertaking  the  work  of  a revision of the
syntax.

We  regret  that we must dissent formally from your resolution of this
issue.  The  current mismatch between RDF syntax and off-the-shelf XML
tools  has  not  become  easier to bear as time goes on; we believe it
must be addressed.
