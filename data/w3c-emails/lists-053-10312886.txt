has all the links and references updated to the 10/10 dating and a 
few little internal link buglets fixed.

I noticed it still had an obsolete reference to XML content referring 
to C14-N whichI have purged; also the XML references (which were 
redundant in this document.) As far as I can tell, all the links to 
Concepts are now accurate.

I suspect that the boilerplate still needs to be fixed up to be 
suitable for LC, but I await instructions.
