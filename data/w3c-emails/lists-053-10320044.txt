Lacking alternative instructions, I've uploaded the Primer LC working 
draft to shadow TR space in the usual location, 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-primer-20030117/Overview.html, 
primarily for checking purposes.

I can upload it to the incoming directory if/when that becomes 
appropriate.
