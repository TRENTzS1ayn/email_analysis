If this was indeed the case then I would not be worrying so much about the
situation.  It appears to be the case for RDF entailment, but the RDFS
entailment rules are still incomplete.  The RDFS entailment rules fail to
reduce RDFS entailment to simple entailment.  As of the last version of the
RDF Semantics document that I reviewed there was no operational
specification for RDFS entailment.
