I was checking out Peter's proposed entailment and noticed something in the 
semantics document that I don't understand...

From:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdfs_interp

[[
LV = ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal))
]]
and
[[
If x is in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Datatype)) and y is in ICEXT(x) then <y, LV> is in 
IEXT(I(rdf:type))
]]

This looks a bit like a "type error" to me:

I understand IEXT(I(rdf:type)) to be a set of pairs <v,c>, where v is some 
value and c is an individual class value (not a set of values)

But I also understand ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) to be a *set* of values.

...

Did you mean for the final semantic condition to read:
[[
If x is in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Datatype)) and y is in ICEXT(x)
then <y, I(rdfs:Literal)> is in IEXT(I(rdf:type))
]]

which by the first rdfs semantic condition is equivalent to saying:
[[
If x is in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Datatype)) and y is in ICEXT(x) then y is in LV.
]]
