As of now
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-testcases-20030117/
is updated and ready to go (including new rdf:RDF test, fixed entailment wording)

It is html and css, pubrules ready.

The W3C link validator is incredibly slow today.  After 45 minutes
running a check over the test cases, I got some errors (to test cases
issues, as reported) and fixed the other 1 broken link.  I'm not
repeating that today.

Dave and Jan
