Dave Reynolds was asking me about the relationship between plain 
literals and xsd:string, i.e is a plain literal without a lang tag 
(modulo some funny characters) an xsd:string.

I adopted the policy of referring him to the spec and indeed he came 
back and said "found it, its in the bit about entailment rules."

"Bu**er", I said, that section is now informative!

I just wanted to check whether we have a normative statement in the 
specs that

_:a eg:prop "aaa" .

xsd:string entails

_:a eg:prop "aaa"^^xsd:string .

for suitable values of "aaa".  I should check this myself, but I'm 
burned this morning and don't want to forget ...

Anyone know?  Does it matter?  Is there anything else we might have lost 
by making that section informative?

Brian
