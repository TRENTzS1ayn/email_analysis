I think it's not entirely up to us to make this statement normatively, as 
it depends upon the definition of xsd:string which is not in our 
remit.  There was also a small matter (I think) that some valid plain 
literals were not valid xsd:string, or vice versa, which would kill the 
entailment as simply stated (or is that now behind us with the NFC 
revision?) -- as hinted at by 'for suitable values of "aaa"'.

I suggest the entailment should follow logically from, rather than be 
asserted by, our specification together with the xsd specification, which I 
think it does.  And maybe reinforced by a suitable test case.
