I agree with Graham and would prefer we not make normative statements
that depend on interpretation of the XML Schema spec, which recent
history shows to be a (potential) rat hole.

I'm OK with an informative "this is what we think" and a non-normative
test case. But let's leave this issue in the informative section and
not re-promote it to normative.

Cheers,

Patrick
