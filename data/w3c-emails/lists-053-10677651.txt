Consider the RDF graph

ex:foo rdf:type rdf:Property .

The Herbrand interpretation, H, for this is then

IRH = { ex:foo, rdf:Property } u LVH
IPH = { ex:foo, rdf:type }
IEXTH(rdf:type) = { <ex:foo,rdf:Property> }
IEXTH{x) = {} otherwise
ISH = id
ILH = id
LVH = strings u pairs

What I would consider to be the minimal interpretation, M, is

IRM = { ex:foo, rdf:Property } u LVM
IPM = { rdf:type }
IEXTM(rdf:type) = { <ex:foo,rdf:Property> }
IEXTM{x) = {} otherwise
ISM = id
ILM = id
LVM = strings u pairs

I do not believe that H << M.

Ignoring strings and pairs (where the mapping is identity) the projection
mapping is going to have to look like

k(rdf:Property) = rdf:Propertybecause ex:foo is the only object
k(rdf:type)= rdf:typebecause rdf:type is the only predicate
k(ex:foo)= ex:foobecause ex:foo is the only subject

but then ex:foo is in IPH and k(ex:foo) is not in IPM.
   
By the way, the IL mapping of typed literals in Herbrand interpretations is
broken.  It is defined to be the identity mapping but LV only contains
string, pairs of strings and language tags, and well-formed XML literals in
G.  What then is IL("foo"^ex:bar)?
