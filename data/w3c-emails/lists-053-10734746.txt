The decision to advance these documents to last call is minuted at:
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Oct/0071.html

The RDFCore WG seeks feedback from all, but in particular requests
feedback from:

XML Core   (handling of xml:base)
XML Schema (datatypes solution)
URI        (handling of xml:base)
i18n
i14n
XHTML      (relating RDF meta data to XHMTL web pages)
SVG        (relating RDF meta data to SVG web pages)
XMLP       (Carrying RDF over XMLP)
P3P
WAI
WEBONT
RDFIG

As per W3C process the RDFCore WG would like to draw attention to the
formal objections against these WD's listed at:

    http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#Objections

The RDFCore WG would also like to draw attention to one aspect of these
specifications about which there has not been universal consensus,
though no formal objection has been received.  The WG seeks particular
feedback on the handling of whitespace processing of datatype values.

Brian McBride
RDFCore co-chair
