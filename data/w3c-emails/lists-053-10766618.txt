The XML Core WG requests publication of the following document as a W3C
Proposed Recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/10/PR-xml11-20031010/Overview.html

A review version with diffs noted is at
http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/10/PR-xml11-20031010/PR-xml11-20031010-review.html

The URL cited above is for the most recent Member-only version of the
specification, dated 10 October 2003.

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 specification was published as a
Candidate Recommendation on 10 October 2002. The list of issues that were
raised and discussed can be found at (member-only):
http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/03/xml11-doc/xml11-cr-comments.html

And a document containing the comments received from other WGs and the
public as well as the WG's final disposition of those comments may be found
at:
http://www.w3.org/XML/2003/06/xml11-cr-doc.html

In general, the XML Core WG has not received any replies from commenters
saying that our responses were inadequate. We did receive several replies
saying our answers were fine. And the document being sent to PR contains the
changes that were made to accommodate these comments.

However, the XML Core WG wants to highlight the fact that our CR request at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2002JulSep/0128.html said:

<quote>
The removal of direct representation of control characters in the range
#x7F-#x9F represents a change in well-formedness. That is, well-formed
XML 1.0 documents which contain these characters do not become
well-formed XML 1.1 documents simply by changing their version number.
Occurrences of control characters must also be converted to numeric
character references.

As a criterion for exiting CR, the XML Core WG will collect evidence
substantiating (or contradicting) our opinion that:

1) converting characters in the #x7F-#x9F range to numeric
    character references while updating XML 1.0 documents to XML 1.1 does
    not represent a significant obstacle to adoption of XML 1.1;
2) there are no significant scenarios where converting characters
    in the #x7F-#x9F range to numeric character references is impractical or
    impossible;
3) that the benefits of this change to the proper detection of
    character encoding represent a significant improvement in
    interoperability.

This is reflected by Issue Tobin-01 in our Issues doc at

Summary: Is requiring the escaping of C1 control characters worth it?

After much discussion spanning many telcons, we continue to have WG members
with strong views on both sides of the issue. During our May 28
telcon[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003AprJun/0182.h
tml] (member only), we took a vote in which we had 4 members for, 4 against,
and 4 abstentions.
The chair declared UNRESOLVABLE LACK of CONSENSUS. We therefore close the
issue in favor of the status quo, but will highlight this issue in our PR
request.

Resolution:

After much discussion spanning many telcons, we continue to have WG members
with strong views on both sides of the issue. During our May 28 telcon, we
took a vote in which we had 4 members for, 4 against, and 4 abstentions. The
chair declared UNRESOLVABLE LACK of CONSENSUS. We therefore close the issue
in favor of the status quo, but will highlight this issue in our PR request.

The WG's decision to request publication as a Proposed Recommendation
was taken during a teleconference on 8 October 2003, minutes may be
found at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003OctDec/0034


EXITING CR

The main purposes of the CR period was to gain feedback based on
implementation experience. The XML Core WG set a goal of having at least 2
successful implementations of the specification. As of today, we know of at
least 4 implementations.

However, the XML Core WG wants to highlight the lack of support for the
character normalization checking feature. Only one non-commercial
implementation of this feature has been developed and, while it demonstrates
the feasibility of the implementation, it does not demonstrate support from
vendors and does not satisfy our CR exit criteria. The XML Core WG however
decided to leave it in the specification because it is an optional feature
and was included at the request of the I18N WG.

See the implementation report at:
http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/09/xml11-implementation


SCHEDULE

We propose that the PR period for XML 1.1 to last for eight weeks from
publication.


REQUIREMENTS OF TRANSITION

The XML Core WG approved publication during our telcon of 2003 Oct 8:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003OctDec/0034

Changes to the document are highlighted by the review version at
http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/10/PR-xml11-20031010/PR-xml11-20031010-review.html

PROPOSED PR ABSTRACT AND STATUS SECTIONS

Abstract
--------
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is completely
described in this document. Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be 
served,
received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with
HTML. XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for
interoperability with both SGML and HTML.

Status of this document
-----------------------
This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current
W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be
found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.

This document is a Proposed Recommendation of the W3C. This document is
based on the feedback from implementers on the XML 1.0 Candidate
Recommendation dated 15 October 2002, and the XML Core Working Group
believes that the specification is now stable and ready for the Advisory
Committee review.

Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the
W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or
obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this
document as other than work in progress.

Please send comments on this Proposed Recommendation to
www-xml-blueberry-comments@w3.org (public archives  are available). W3C
Advisory Committee Representatives may also send comments, visible only to
the Team or to the Membership, through the form available in the Call for
Review. The review period extends to four weeks after the approval of PR.
[Publication Team: please change this to a hard date before final
publication.] Reviewers are encouraged to read the XHTML with color-coded
revision indicators; this version highlights each substantive change
separating XML 1.1 from XML 1.0.

This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing, widely
used international text processing standard (Standard Generalized Markup
Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and corrected) for use on the World
Wide Web. It is a product of the W3C XML Activity, details of which can be
found at http://www.w3.org/XML. The English version of this 
specification is
the only normative version. However, for translations of this document, see
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=xml11. A 
list
of current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be 
found at
http://www.w3.org/TR.

Documentation of intellectual property possibly relevant to this
recommendation may be found at the Working Group's public IPR disclosure 
page.

An implementation report for XML 1.1 is available at
http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/09/xml11-implementation.html.

Please report errors in this document to xml-editor@w3.org; archives are
available. The errata list for this third edition is available at
http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V11-1e-errata.

A Test Suite is maintained to help assessing conformance to this 
specification.
