The XML Core WG requests publication of the following document as a W3C
Proposed Recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/05/PR-xml-names11/

The URL cited above is for the most recent Member-only version of the
specification, dated 10 October 2003.

The Namespaces in XML 1.1 specification was published as a Candidate
Recommendation on 18 December 2002. A document containing the comments
received from other WGs and the public as well as the WG's final disposition
of those comments may be found at:
http://www.w3.org/XML/2003/06/ns11-cr-doc.html

The XML Core WG has not received any replies from commenters saying that our
responses were inadequate. We did receive several replies saying our answers
were fine.

The document being sent to PR contains the changes that were made to
accommodate these comments.

The WG's decision to request publication as a Proposed Recommendation
was taken during a teleconference on 8 October 2003, minutes may be
found at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003OctDec/0034


EXITING CR

The main purposes of the CR period was to gain feedback based on
implementation experience. The XML Core WG set a goal of having at least 2
successful implementations of the specification. As of today, we know of at
least 3 implementations. See the implementation report at:

http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/12/xml-names11-implementation


SCHEDULE

We propose that the PR period for Namespaces in XML 1.1 to last for
eight weeks from publication.


REQUIREMENTS OF TRANSITION

The XML Core WG approved publication during our telcon of 2003 Oct 8:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003OctDec/0034

Changes to the document are outlined in Appendices C and D of the document.

The WG believes it has addressed all of the requirements in the RD at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xml-names11-req-20020403/

PROPOSED PR ABSTRACT AND STATUS SECTIONS

Abstract
--------
XML namespaces provide a simple method for qualifying element and attribute
names used in Extensible Markup Language documents by associating them with
namespaces identified by IRI references.

Status of this document
-----------------------
This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current
W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be
found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.

This document, Namespaces in XML 1.1, is a Proposed Recommendation of the
W3C. This document has been produced by the W3C XML Core Working Group as
part of the XML Activity.

W3C Advisory Committee Representatives are invited to send formal review
comments by following the instructions in the Call for Review. Through a
form available from the Call for Review, Advisory Committee representatives
should send comments to the Team-only list xml-namespaces11-review@w3.org
until 30 November 2003. Through the form, Advisory Committee 
representatives
may also make their comments visible to the Membership (on
w3c-ac-forum@w3.org for discussion or w3c-archive@w3.org). The public is
invited to send comments to the public mailing list xml-names-editor@w3.org
(archived at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-names-editor/). After
the review the Director will announce the document's disposition. This
announcement should not be expected sooner than 14 days after the end of 
the
review.

This document is based upon the Namespaces in XML 1.1 Candidate
Recommendation of 18 December 2002 and feedback received during the review
period (see the Disposition of Comments document). The XML Core Working
Group believes that this specification addresses its Requirements and all
Last Call and Candidate Recommendation issues. Known implementations are
documented in the Namespaces 1.1 implementation report. A test suite is 
also
available.

Documentation of intellectual property possibly relevant to this
Recommendation may be found at the Working Group's public IPR disclosure 
page.

Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the
W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or
obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this
document as other than work in progress.


Paul Grosso and Arnaud Le Hors, chairs of the XML Core WG.
