We have a request to add a new test case:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20031010-comments/#entailment-from-inconsistent-graph

essentially a gigo test case.

Do the test case editors propose to add this test case?   How many 
implementations will pass it?  If not enough, what do was say at request 
  to advance to PR?

Brian
