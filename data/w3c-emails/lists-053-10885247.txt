APPROVED.


Item 6: Confirm status of completed actions.
No comments, all DONE.


Item 7: Miscellaneous actions:
All continued; JJC noted he wouldn't be able to address 2003-10-03#5 for
about three weeks.


Item 8: Publication status.

ACTION: 2003-10-10#1 em write up publication "lessons learned"

A late bug in the informative proof section of semantics had just
arisen. Various options for the publication of semantics and the other
drafts as last call (or othewise) were considered.

The WG decided to leave the exact details of semantics publication to
the discretion of Eric and Pat; they left the telecon to continue
discussion off-line.

ACTION: 2003-10-10#2 bwm htmldiffs for the documents
ACTION: 2003-10-10#3 bwm last call announcement


Item 9: Handling LC2 comments

It was felt that strictly editorial fixups of typos should be left to
editorial discretion. Any other changes to the documents post last call
should be raised on the rdfcore-wg list first.

The WebOnt WG's practice of "no extended discussions on the comments
list" was felt to be useful. Any discussion arising out of a LC2 comment
should take place off the -comments list; a summary of status should be
sent to the -comments list.

Ever see something and think, "I've gotta leverage me some of that?"
Odds are, you were looking at a synergy and didn't even know it.
