We have had quite a few regrets and no suggestions for the agenda so I 
am cancelling this Friday's telecon.

The following Friday, 24 Nov is the day after ISWC.  I will be 
travelling that day, and in the conference the three days before, so 
regrets from me.

I suggest we consider that telecon at risk for now.  We can see if next 
week if a possible agenda is shaping up.  Early indications of any 
regrets would be helpful.

Brian
