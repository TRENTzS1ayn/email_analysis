I'd support cancelling, or having WG members make informal use of the
telecon time. Am since monday back in Bristol (though still on west
coast timezone it seems), and would be free to chair friday's call if
topics appear. Let's see if topics emerge by midday UK time thurs, if
not then cancel or use the slot for 'bar talk'.

How many regrets do we have?
