True. I think that the best way to handle this is to just remove the 
word 'finite' from the statement of the lemmas, and add a remark in 
the appendix pointing out that if E is finite then the intermediate 
derived graph can also be taken to be finite. This restores the 
statements of the lemmas to their previous form without cluttering up 
the proofs. I will make this change.

Yes, of course (now you have pointed it out :-). I will make this 
change. Peter has previously expressed a dislike for the 'crdV' 
construction, which was introduced only to keep the closures finite 
in any case and is therefore now irrelevant.

Indeed. After some soul-searching, subsequent to our conversation, I 
have reformulated this in terms of a mapping from XML values to 
surrogate nodes rather than the reverse. This makes the conclusion 
easier to state and more uniform with the RDFS case.  (It establishes 
a slightly weaker result than the earlier argument form does, but 
nobody except you and I seems to care and I am too tired to write out 
the rather elaborate argument needed to cover the case where 
surrogates are used in the subject position but literals in the 
object position. )

I have added the comment in the text of the proof, just after 
defining the closure:

"Note also that the proof only requires that rule lg is used on 
well-typed XML literals, so that it actually establishes a slightly 
tighter result."


>For example, Section 7 contains the following sentence (my emphasis):

I have replaced this with the non-modal wording:

"Subsequent rule sets for detecting RDF and RDFS entailment use a 
special case of rule se1 which applies only to literals:"
