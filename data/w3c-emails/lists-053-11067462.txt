 From RDF-comments [1]:

Maybe it would be convenient, but I think any response should point out 
(and Concepts is quite clear about this [2]) that any particular 
representation of bnodes is always an artefact of the particular syntax 
used.  When reading any syntax that uses bnode identifiers, applications 
must always be prepared to re-allocate the identifiers.

I might even argue that having different syntax for N-triples and RDF/XML 
is (almost) a Good Thing, since it reinforces this point.
