I've not read the comment yet, going on Graham's quote.

Suggested response is:

[[
In RDF/XML it would be unnatural to restrict bnode identifiers to US ASCII.
This would prevent document authors from using bnode IDs with mnemonic
identifiers in Thai for example.
Given the goals of N-triple - a testing language, the restriction to
US-ASCII is well-motivated.

Thus it is not possible to align the two concepts while being faithful to
the design goals of the two languages.
]]

It would be better to quote from the docs - I suspect there's a suitable
piece about Ntriple being in US ASCII.
