I suggest we modify the comment in the test case as follows:

See

[[
  Description: Example of relative uri with too many ..'s in path.
  Note: RFC 2396 appears to permit implementations that discard
        excess .. components, "compensating for obvious author
        errors".
        Such behaviour is not correct for RDF/XML.

[[
  Description: Example of relative uri with too many ..'s in path.
  Note: The behavior recommended in the forthcoming revision 
    of RFC 2396 may be different from in RFC 2396, hence  
    document authors are advised to avoid such relative URIs.

        To avoid ambiguity RDF/XML requires that no such compensation
        is performed.

And then the following response ...

<<<
Thank you for your comment.

We were unaware of this planned changes to RFC 2396.
We have modified the comment in the test case to read:
[[
  ..
]]

In answer to your question: RDF/XML and RDF Concepts depend normatively on RFC 
2396. RFC 2396bis has not yet completed its standardization.
Thus the test case is correct.
