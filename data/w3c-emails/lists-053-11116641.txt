I find the argument underwhelming.

The current situation is that the possible identifiers in Ntriple are a proper 
subset of those in RDF/XML.

The proposed new situation is that the possible identifiers in Ntriple are a 
proper subset of those in RDF/XML.

If you are generating identifiers and wish them to be interoperable between 
RDF/XML and NTriple it can be done in either case (generate Ntriple ids)

If you are reading in RDF/XML and wisht to use the identifiers in Ntriple it 
can't be done in either case. (You need to do some work).

We should only change things that are broken - I am not even convinced this is 
an improvement.
