This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.

Suggestions asap please.

I'm chairing on friday. The UK is now off of summertime,
my working assumption is that our telecon booking is 
in Boston time (10am ET) and that the time elsewhere will
be derrived from that. Eric, Brian is that correct?

Also, can spec editors take a look through www-rdf-comments and 
report on where they're up to with dealing with incoming 
feedback.

thanks,

Dan
