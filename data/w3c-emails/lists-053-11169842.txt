I was sure there was a reason and was waiting for it to appear.  I 
expect a response, probably from Dave, along the lines of:

- lunch ain't free - because RDF/XML is not restricted to US ascii, but 
permits international characters, an implementation must do some 
processing to translate RDF/XML bnode ID's to b-triples bnode IDs

- the n-triple b-node id's are designed to be compatible with N3 as some 
implementations use N3 processors

should put this one to bed.
