Attached, agenda for friday's call. Basically it is a catchup on doc
status w.r.t. incoming comments from LC2. 

Document editors, please be in a position to summarise where your spec
is up to. If there are any major issues, let the WG know by email asap.

May I have a scribe volunteer please.

Thanks,

Dan
