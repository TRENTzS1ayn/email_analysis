I've just updated the lc2 comments status doc

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20031010-comments/#ntriples-nbode-ids

It would be good to try and get caught up on the outstanding ones where 
possible, which is I think all except Herman's review of semantics. 
Herman is sending us partial reviews as he makes progress - I plan to 
treat these largely as a single comment, hoping for a final OK at the 
end of the review process.

LC2 closes in a weeks time (07 Nov).  Whilst we can expect a bulge of 
comments at the end, it would be good to be in a position to produce a 
request to advance very soon after that.

LC2 does not close till midnight zulu on the 07 Nov.  The very best we 
could hope for would be to have all comments received before the telecon 
disposed, editors to have discretion to update docs as necessary and a 
decision to request advancement unless we get further comments that in 
the opinion of the chairs require WG discussion.

I suspect that's a tad optimistic, but why not plan for success.
