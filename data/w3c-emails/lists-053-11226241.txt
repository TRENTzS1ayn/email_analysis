?? I fail to follow this. The XML spec is rather 
wide, we have to follow it, so we have to be 
rather narrow? What??

I hope it isn't considered acceptable. Our syntax 
is constrained by N3??? That is news to me and I 
think it is ridiculous. N3 isnt even properly 
defined anywhere, it is not a standard and it has 
virtually a nonexistent user community outside 
the W3C itself. I bear the N3 developers no 
ill-will, but it is insane for us to be 
constraining our syntax (and inconveniencing our 
potential users) because of undocumented 
syntactic vagaries of a few hackers.
