I'm not that good at doing the Ra! Ra! thing, but, for folks who were 
not there, and may be feeling a little jaded, the Florida semantic web 
conference was very well attended and folks I have talked to have 
generally considered to have been worthwhile and a success.  An 
interesting point to note is that the industrial track was better 
attended than expected and had to move to a larger room.
