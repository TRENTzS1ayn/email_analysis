A nit re. section 4.1 -- you say:
[[
1. Add all of the following triples *which contain a name in V*. These are 
true in any rdf-interpretation.
]]

Should that be more like:
[[
1. Add all of the following triples *which contain only names in V*. These 
are true in any rdf-interpretation.
]]

Otherwise you'd potentially end up introducing new names into the graph 
that are not in V?
