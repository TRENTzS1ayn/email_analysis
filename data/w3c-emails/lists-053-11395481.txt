What I remember from the last round of discussing that copied 
Ralph was that I was concerned about including the french stuff inline, 
but that seeAlso'ing it to a separate file would work, and be 
more easily extendable, updatable etc. I believe Ralph agreed that 
such an approach would meet his goals. I'll try to track down the mails.

Brian, to answer your direct question, applications would find the data
by following rdfs:seeAlso properties and reading the RDF doc(s) they 
reference.
