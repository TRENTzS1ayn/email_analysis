PatH, might this be ok?

To clarify, we accept that this entailment is true; however, in the hope
of keeping the distinction between two concepts clear, we think that it
would be more usefully illustrative to break the test case into two
parts:

- an inconsistency test which states that (original PFPS premise)
rdfs-entails FALSE

- a general ECQ test case (perhaps three such test cases) that state:

FALSE
entails
    <some random conclusion here, eg, conclusion from PFPS test case>

with test cases for rdf-entails, rdfs-entails, rdfs+dt(xsd:integer)
-entails

The point of these to illustrate that any inconsistent premise can be
used to entail any conclusion.
