Er.. the way to show that we accept this entailment is true
is to put it in the test suite.

That suggests that false premises are typical in RDFS. But they're
not. It's only this one very, special case of XML literals that
allows falsehoods to be stated in RDFS.

I don't mind these two tests *in addition* to the one Peter
requested, but to do anything less than include his test
as suggested says to me that we do *not* accept that
this entailment holds, or that it's not illustrative
of a very special issue.
