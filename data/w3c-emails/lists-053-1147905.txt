Is it legal to include XML markup inside non-XMLLiteral literal 
strings? For example, suppose I wanted to define a datatype called 
ex:XMLnumber whose lexical space was all strings of the form

<xmlnum>English-number-phrase</xmlnum>

and whose L2V mapping looked like

<xmlnum>one</xmlnum>  --> 1
<xmlnum>two</xmlnum>  --> 2
...
<xmlnum>three hundred and ninety seven</xmlnum>  --> 397
....

and write literals like

"<xmlnum>three hundred and ninety seven</xmlnum>"^^ex:XMLnumber

to refer to 397, would that be legal RDF? There are no semantic 
reasons to exclude it.
