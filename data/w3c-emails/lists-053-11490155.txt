If PFPS insists on the original test case standing, then my suggestion
would be to add these two test cases as well, and mark (in the
description) PFPS' test case as a special case of (1) the inconsistency
in rdfs case, and (2) the "basic rules of entailment" test case.

I don't agree that the test case makes any such suggestion; rather, it
underlines that a false premise *-entails anything. We could certainly
indicate in the test descriptions that rdf can't construct inconsistent
graphs; that rdfs can only do it via the XMLLiteral, or whatever.

Basically I'm concerned that PFPS' test case, as it stands, is (possibly
deliberately) overly obscure: therefore I suggest negotiating with him
to see if he's satisfied that the addition of a test case that more
transparently demonstrates the construction of an RDFS inconsistency,
and an "entailment 101", which demonstrates that any conclusion at all
can be drawn from a false premise (such as an inconsistent graph),
adequately address his concern.

If he _is_ so satisfied, then I think the test cases in question will be
better off for it, since their illustrative purpose will hopefully be
more successfully met.

If he's _not_ satisfied by that, then I'd certainly agree that we owe
him such a test case* if he honestly thinks it's useful; but I'd be
inclined to add the illustrative ones as well and indicate that PFPS'
test case is a particular instance of those more general ones.

of test cases that I thought were useful, and I'd hate to be
hypocritical here.
