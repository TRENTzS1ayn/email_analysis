I have a similar niggling feeling.

Brian, at some time in the past (around the time of the Bristol F2F, I 
think), you came up with a simple test case related to reification that 
meant that some otherwise reasonable restrictions were 
problematic.  Unfortunately, I don't recall the test case or the 
conclusion, but I'm wondering if it might be related.
