This is not the usual weekly call for agenda items. I will 
be sitting in for Brian this friday. (I am a bit rusty and need your help!)

Also I will be offline much of thursday, will sort through mail 
for agenda items upon my return. Brian is offline thurs, fri so 
it is up to the rest of us to figure out the best use of the timeslot.

So suggestions please for agenda items asap.

Jeremy, per http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0033.html 
I realise last week's minutes may be further delayed. As a stopgap, 
IRC logs are at http://www.w3.org/2003/06/06-rdfcore-irc and an 
action summary is at http://www.w3.org/2003/06/06-rdfcore-actions
(most of which are on me).

Do we have a scribe pre-volunteered for friday's call? (couldn't see one from IRC log)
Any volunteers?

Dan
