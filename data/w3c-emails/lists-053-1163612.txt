This is OK, but might not be what you want.
e.g. normal XML rules would suggest that in addition

<xmlnum

 >one</xmlnum>  --> 1

(Whitespace differs).

This could be thrown in the lexical-to-value mapping, but we do not have an 
  extensible mechanism for rdf:XMLLiteral.
There might be a postponed issue; and one could experiment with

   <rdf:Description>
     <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&eg;mynum" rdf:parseType="Literal">
        <xmlnum
        >one</xmlnum>
     </eg:prop>
   </rdf:Description>

but to do so would not conform with the WDs.
