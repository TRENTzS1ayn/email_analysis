Summary:
Prefer c++
modify  the test case to say that the case is D-consistent with the
empty graph, not that it is D-entailed by it;
add D-inconsistent test using a different rdfs:subClassOf triple between 
xsd datatypes.

Not particularly OK, well unless the semantics doc discusses 
rdfs:subClassOf in datatyping clearly. i.e. this should not be left as an 
exercise for the reader.

not good

OK
Also add a test case showing that
xsd:string rdfs:subClassOf xsd:integer .
is inconsistent.

Prefer (c) to this.
(Another option is to explicitly list rdfs:subClassOf relationships between 
xsd datatypes as true by fiat).
