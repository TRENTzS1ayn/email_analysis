even in D-interpretations? If you know the datatypes,
you know the relevant subclass relationships, no?

(hunting for pointer to current draft to comment more
intelligently... found 5 September 2003??? draft
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/
from the WG homepage
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/)

Hmm... as written, it says a datatype can only constrain
interpretations in the lexical-to-value mapping. I never
thought of it that way. I would have thought a datatype,
like any other semantic extension, could constrain
things just about any way: introduce arbitrary triples,
maybe even rules. (do we mention that datatypes
are semantics extensions? we should.)

(e) note that semantics of datatypes includes subClassOf
relationships.

Er... that's (e), right? i.e. none of a-d.

I suppose (d) is acceptable to me, but I prefer (e).
