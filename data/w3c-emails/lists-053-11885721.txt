> Danbri, how are you doing on your action item on the boilerplate SOTD?

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/templates/sept-wd-sotd.html

I'd appreciate a sanity check from WG and at least one of 
Brian or Eric before folk start copying and pasting. Of course 
each spec needs it's own info re per-doc changes too, see the @@section
for where to put that.

The guts of the SOTD is:

This Working Draft consolidates changes and editorial improvements
undertaken in response to feedback received during the Last Call
publication of the RDFCore specifications which began on 23 January
2003.

...brief, factual and not really getting into business of where we
expect to go next.


Dan
