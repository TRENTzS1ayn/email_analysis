The difference between the txt below and 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/templates/sept-wd-sotd.html is 
that they're anticipating a CR as their next phase, whereas LC2 looks
more likely for us. I don't feel the need to nail that one down at this 
stage though...

There are a few phrases might be worth borrowing though.

]]

Perhaps dropping 'interim' since we don't name our next stage?
