I'm uneasy with that.

Who is responsible for defining the relevant triples that cannot be inferred?

Suppose I have datatypes

   xsd:integer

and

   foo:EvenNumbers

where the latter's value space is subset of the first's.

Who is responsible to say:

   foo:evennumbers rdfs:subClassOf xsd:integer

?

I think it's easier to leave it unsaid, and allow anyone who needs the 
subclass assertion to addf it in the knowledge that it's not inconsistent.
