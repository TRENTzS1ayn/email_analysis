This boilerplate was carried over from LC2 stod and as Danbri mentioned 
and was intended to be generic across documents. The thought was that 
editors would include high level big general issues highlighted with a 
link to the more detailed changes section.

[[
@@ highlighted changes the editors might want to summarize per document 
here @@. Detailed changes from the previous 23 January 2003 working 
draft are described in the Changes section.
]]

I certainly was thinking the i18n's xml lang/xml literal issue and 
removal of social meaning section at the time I drafted the above.
