me too.


Jan seems to argue with DanC for option (e) - that somehow or other 
datatyping subClassOf is extensional, whereas elsewhere it is intensional.

I guess I find that really quite problematic.

I seem to remember being isolated in defending the extensional semantics 
for subClassOf; I can't understand what (some of) the rest of you want - 
you got rdfs:subClassOf as intensional, but a least be consistent, and 
forget your extensional intuitions.
