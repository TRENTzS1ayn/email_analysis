Nowhere in our SW specs (to my knowledge) do we profess to care about
*who* makes such assertions, or for that matter *when*, *where* or
*Why*. All we care about is whether they are sensible (ie. meaningful)
things to assert, and if so, what they mean.

Well, yes, I guess that's partly why I think that, having chosen an 
intrinsic interpretation of the subclass relation, it's problematic to 
treat datatypes differently.  My use of words "who is responsible" may be 
unfortunate in that it clouds the issue.

But, returning to my example, in the absence of a specific inference (ala 
extrinsic subclass), if one has two independently defined datatypes whose 
value spaces happen to be in subset relation,  how can the semantics of 
such independent definitions include a relation between them?
