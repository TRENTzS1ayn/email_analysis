I tried to take the text from the usual suspects and minimize the 
divergence between different W3C specs.

cf in particular

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-charmod-20030822/#sec-URIs

which links to
http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E26
http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#link-locators
http://www.w3.org/International/2002/draft-duerst-iri-00.txt

None of these %-escape %.

I believe that w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org and uri@w3.org may be appropriate forums 
for discussion of this issue.

I am unwilling to make a change before the 5th September publication.
Nor would I be happy with a change that is opposed by a consensus in the 
above forums.

I am not yet convinced that this materially affects RDF since we *never* 
require the escaping to actually be performed, it is merely a theoretical 
exercise that defines a set of strings. I believe that the set of strings 
is the same whether or not % is itself escaped.
