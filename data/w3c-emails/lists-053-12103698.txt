OK, I like that too and I have experimented with that
in [1] e.g. xsd:integer rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal.
We prefer to do this rather explicitly as opposed
to implicit extensional stuff.
This should work quite well I guess, just that
it is a particular kind of declaration which is
machine readable.
