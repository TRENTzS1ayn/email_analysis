Jan - to me 1. and 2. look OK and I'm looking forward to test those...

This last option seemed the "obvious" one to me: that a datatype
definition might well include subClassOf "axiomatic triples".

The test case document currently doesn't have explicit
"consistent/inconsistent" test cases; these have usually been encoded
using entailment or non-entailment of false graphs.

So the new test cases would be that:

1.
[[
             xsd:integer rdfs:subClassOf xsd:decimal .
]] DOES NOT rdfs+D(xsd:integer, xsd:decimal)-entail
[[ FALSE ]] (the "false" graph)

2.
[[
             xsd:integer rdfs:subClassOf xsd:string .
]] rdfs+D(xsd:integer, xsd:string)-entails
[[ FALSE ]]


... is that ok?

It's a sad fact that the word "semantics" seems to have lost all meaning.
