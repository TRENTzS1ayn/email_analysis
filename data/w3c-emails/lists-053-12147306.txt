Absolutely not.

My opinion is that the "best" solution is that a "datatyping
interpretation" would include additional axiomatic triples where
subClassOf relationships should exist. I'd thought that was option (e).
If it's not, make it (f) and I cast my vote for that: extensional
throughout, with the possibility of a DT interpretation including SCO
triples by fiat.
