Currently I have this text where the rule rdfD4 used to be:

"In addition, if it is known that the value space of the datatype 
denoted by ddd is a subset of that of the datatype denoted by eee, 
then it would be appropriate to assert that

ddd rdfs:subClassOf eee .

but this needs to be asserted explicitly; it does not follow from the 
subset relationship alone."

Well, if these are considered part of some external-to-RDF definition 
of some class of datatypes, then that is fine. I have no problem with 
that.

Well, if y'all are happy to phrase things this way, then OK; but 
there is no such thing as a false graph, actually. About the best you 
could do to get a contradiction in RDF would be to have an XML 
literal clash, such as

ex:a ex:p "<NotALegalXMLString"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .
ex:p rdfs:range rdf:XMLLiteral .

Yes, modulo the above.
