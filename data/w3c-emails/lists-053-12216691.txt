Checking:

(Revision dated: 5-Sep-2003)

Concerning:
ACTION: 2003-08-29#5 gk to liase with JJC on removal of WS "fudge" \
         from concepts

I note that the text just before section 5.1 no longer licenses any 
handling of whitespace beyond that defined by XML schema.  I believe this 
completes this action.

Concerning:
ACTION: 2003-08-29#7 (all editors) update cross-references to 5 Sept \
         documents

I see that the references have been updated.  As far as I can tell, 
internal cross-reference links within the document body are done with 
relative URIs, so no change required here?  I believe this completes this 
action.
