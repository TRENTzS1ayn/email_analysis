Hmmm... that was a pretty obtuse collection of references,
but I finally found something in there...

The text you use seems to come from:
   http://www.w3.org/International/2002/draft-duerst-iri-00.txt
specifically, the description of mapping IRIs to URIs, which would seem
to be a similar context to what is intended here.

In this context, I think it is assumed that the Unicode URI has already been
formed in a way that the only occurrence of '%' is as part of an escape
sequence.  So in this respect, I now think the current text is correct.

But, this point is demonstrated to be prone to misunderstanding, and I think
a brief note of explanation is in order, e.g.:
[[
'%' is excluded from the list of disallowed octets that must be escaped,
because it may appear in a URI only to introduce an escape sequence,
so an additional application of escaping here would be incorrect.
]]
