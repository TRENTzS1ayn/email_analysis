I should have read the thing more carefully :(

What our specs says is:

let URIREF = the set of URIREF's defined according to RFC2396 modified 
by RFC 2732

then RDFURIREF = {x : encoding(x) memberof URIREF}

for the encoding defined in the spec which excludes encoding '%'.

test case: is http://example.org/foo%bar a member of RDFURIREF.  Answer: 
NO because http://example.org/foo%bar is not a member of URIREF.

I now see why it is the way it is (I think).

jjc, this was originally raised by PFPS

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0282.html

and I brought it up in your absence.  Do you think you could resond to him?
