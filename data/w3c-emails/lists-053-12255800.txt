I've done all the pubrules, html, link, css checking and have finished
removing the words and links I made for the xmlsch-02 whitespace note in
concepts.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/
(plus all the linked example files near there)

only needs removal of "@@ This is an editor's draft ... @@" to go.

Dave
