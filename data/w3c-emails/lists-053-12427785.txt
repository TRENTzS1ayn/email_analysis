Just to let you know that the pubreq for the new Working
Drafts went in on weds, and after a few bugfixes (enough 
to be a bit frustrating but not nearly as bad as what 
Eric went through last time) the specs are on their 
way to the TR page. I believe they should show up there 
sometime tommorrow as planned.

Thanks everyone for all your hard work!

Dan
