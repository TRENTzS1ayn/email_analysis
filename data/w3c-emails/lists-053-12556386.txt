Aaron,

I note that the RDF/XML MIME registration draft has expired [1] (they do, 
after 6 months, per IETF rules and practice).

Could you please resubmit what you have to keep it alive?  The last known 
version was -03.  It would be great if this included the changes agreed 
since your call-for-review, but anything you have is better than nothing.

Thanks!
