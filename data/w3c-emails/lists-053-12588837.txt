Nothing about spaces, that's true.
I have to admit that from an implementation
point of view lexical spaces don't matter that much...

PS In xerces-2_5_0 it is now possible to use
   an IntegerDV instead of DecimalDV for all numbers
   (to avoid Patrick's "1.0"^^xsd:integer case)
   but I will wait till Jena has it - my tests
   with replacing the /Jena-2.0/lib/xercesImpl.jar
   were successful, but my AskJena is otherwise
   not downwards compatible.
