http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#technote (informative) states,

...ends with:
 "Notice that the question of whether or not a class contains itself as
 a member is quite different from the question of whether or not it is a
 subclass of itself. All classes are subclasses of themselves."

Isn't this last observation a remnant of the old iff/extension version
of rdfs:subClassOf ?
