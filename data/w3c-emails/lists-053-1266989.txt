R (on my construction is)

x g
x h
g a
g b
g c
h d
h e
h f
a b
b c
c a
d e
e f
d f

R' (replacing a=d b=e)
x g
x h
g a
g b
g c
h a
h b
h f
a b
b c
c a
a b (duplicate)
b f
a f

doesn't look anything like a subgraph.
Even if you ignore all the triples I added it doesn't

S

a b
b c
c a
d e
e f
d f

S'
a b
b c
c a
b f
a f

S' contains a node (b) which has two outbound edges and one inbound edge, 
unlike S.

irredunancy is not a local phenomenon - I need to work on my NP completeness 
proof but you've more work to do on your P proof!

(Note to rest of group these pairs are in fact triples with a missing 
rdf:value in the middle; and all the nodes are blank - this might have 
something to do with RDF)
