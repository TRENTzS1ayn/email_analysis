Allow, or require? That is, if they happen to contain the symbol '<', 
is that *required* to be considered to be XML markup?

I take it that this is intended to illustrate that without the 
parseType, the literal string is rendered exactly as it is (?)
How about
<rdf:Description>
   <eg:prop><<</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

does that parse to

:_a eg:prop "<<" .

?

?? Eh? Where do the foo and bar come from?

That is unacceptable right there. Applications may want to have plain 
literals that are not XML, eg the Reuters applications where literals 
are used to capture free-text paragraphs.

?? So this amounts to a proposal to get rid of plain literals, in 
effect, and to just not mention the 'XMLLiteral' type explicitly?

Indeed, but I do not want us to concede this point to Martin. He is 
WRONG about this, and we should refuse to let him (or i18n) bully us 
into conceding this issue.  Plain text is not the same as XML without 
markup; that view only makes sense in a completely XML-centric view 
of the entire world of lexicography and notation. Most of the world's 
languages and notations are not dialects of XML. SCL, for one, is not 
XML without markup. Virtually every piece of program code ever 
written is not XML without markup. The mathematical statement (I 
quote) "2<3" is not XML without markup, and it certainly isn't XML 
with markup.  And "2&lt;3" is just gibberish.

Which is a fatal objection. If RDF does not outlive XML then it will 
have been a failure.

Wait a minute. If plain literals do not have a datatype, then this 
'lexical space' terminology is meaningless. Are they typed or not?

But that is INSANE. Here I am wanting to write an RDF ontology about 
mathematical expressions, say, and I want to refer to pieces of 
mathematical text like "2<3" (two is less than three). But now I 
can't do that because this is short for "2&lt;3", which is completely 
meaningless.

The basic point is that the RDF machinery is not intended to be 
restricted to only REFER to XML text. It is required to be encodable 
in XML, but it is that already. This proposal makes it impossible to 
refer to non-XML text.

No, the SEMANTICS needs to distinguish them.

It completely destroys the idea of a plain literal.

I think that my 'wet fish' proposal is better than this, if we have 
to accede to Martin.  I would prefer not to accede, since Martin has 
not responded to the technical objections adequately, and has not 
given actual technical arguments for his requests. They amount to 
statements of opinion about the proper role of XML in semiotics, 
opinions with which one may have legitimate disagreement.
