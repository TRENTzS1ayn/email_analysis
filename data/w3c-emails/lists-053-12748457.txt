Well, not necessarily. You could use a typed literal with a 
string-like datatype (e.g. xsd:string) to express such things.

What it simply means is that RDF itself has no plain, simple
string type of any sort, only XML.

If we were starting out at day 1, and designing RDF from scratch,
I could concede certain advantages of such an approach. But we
are far far away from day 1, and to change plain literals to
XML literals at this stage in the game would be dropping an A-bomb
on the RDF community; and to that end, I'm quite surprised that
*anyone* in the WG, much less the chairs, would at this point 
propose such a radical and devastating change.
