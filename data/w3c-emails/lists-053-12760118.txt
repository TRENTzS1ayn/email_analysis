As an example xsd:NMToken
(possible case typos)

" a " is not in the value space and "a" is, because you cannot produce a 
lexical form " a " given the whitespace facet, and hence you cannot produce 
the value " a " either.

XSD views any constraint which rules out certain lexical forms as also 
ruling out the corresponding values which have no legal lexical 
representations.

A non-trivial example is that

"http://www.w3.org/Two/Space  /foo"

is not an xsd:anyURI
