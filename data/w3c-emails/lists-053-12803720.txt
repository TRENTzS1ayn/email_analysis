(moved from the comments list)

Peter suggests following the IRI wording from "Namespaces in XML 1.1" rather
than the current wording in concepts.

This is essentially editorial, although Peter raises a substantive issue to
do with control characters.

Personally my preference would be to follow Martin Durst's advice ... [here
at least :) ].
