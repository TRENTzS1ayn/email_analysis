The reasons didn't get recorded in the minutes, but (since I just dug it 
out to check for myself) the meeting IRC log is here:

   http://www.w3.org/2003/06/27-rdfcore-irc

around 15:10.

Briefly, we could have gone either way on the reflexivity issue, it being 
pretty much orthogonal to intensionality, and it gives us a way to express 
a degree of equivalence between classes.   Also, it was less change to the 
existing spec.
