I've tried to be careful not to describe it as a proposal.  This is an 
alternative design.  I'm not proposing it, just describing it.

At this stage in the game, are "descriptions that
aren't proposals" really productive? Can there
even be such a distinction?

Really.  As an implementor I can choose to represent literals using a 
sequence of f*rts in morse code if it suits my purpose, right?

Now *that* would make for an interesting demo...
(though probably best viewed over webcast :-)
