Section 4.1 now states

[[

1. Add all of the following triples which contain a name in V. These are
true in any rdf-interpretation.

rdf:nil rdf:type rdf:List .
rdf:subject rdf:type rdf:Property .
rdf:predicate rdf:type rdf:Property .
rdf:object rdf:type rdf:Property .
rdf:first rdf:type rdf:Property .
rdf:rest rdf:type rdf:Property .
rdf:value rdf:type rdf:Property . 
rdf:_1 rdf:type rdf:Property . 
rdf:_2 rdf:type rdf:Property .
]]

I think the phrase "which contain a name in V" is intended to eliminate
the infinite set of triples for the the rdf:_nnn properties, but I
suggest the wording needs tweaking.  Each triple of the form:

  rdf:_nnn rdf:type rdf:Property

contains the names rdf:type and rdf:Property which are highly likely to
be in V, so it is highly likely that the infinite set will be included
anyway.

I could suggest alternative wording, but refrain lest Pat find it rude.
