Can we all just agree that the XML Schema spec
is unclear and confusing in this regard, remove all
XML Schema test cases touching on this issue, and
formally recommend a clarification from the XML 
Schema WG (which is unrelated to our own schedule)?

Whether " 3 " is or is not in the lexical space of
xsd:integer is irrelevant to our design and whatever
the XML Schema WG says is correct will work 
perfectly with our design, so let's leave it to them
to clarify for the sake of those using *their* datatypes
and move on...

Yes, but to address the subject issue, you need to use examples that 
show how your arguments apply to value spaces that aren't basically 
"stringy", such as integers, rather than other strings, or URIs.
