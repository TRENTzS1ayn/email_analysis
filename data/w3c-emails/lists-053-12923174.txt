This arises from the I18N debate, but is a distinct issue which I think is 
important to be clear about.

(Not knowing my way around the test cases...)

What graph does this denote?

   <rdf:Description>
     <eg:prop>foo &lt; bar</eg:prop>
   </rdf:Description>

I think it should be:

   _:a eg:prop "foo < bar" .

but others (including the W3C RDF validator service) seem to think differently.

My rationale is:

- RDF/XML syntax is based on infoset
- creation of infoset from textual XML input replaces entities, so '&lt;' 
becomes '<'
- RDF/XML syntax specification (as I recall) does not specify that '<' in 
literals is mapped back to '&lt;'

Am I wrong?
