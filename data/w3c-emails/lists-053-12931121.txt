In the spirit of documenting what WG members have considered offline...

I am NOT by this message making a proposal to change the design.  However, 
IF it turns out that the current design is not accepted because of I18N 
objections, or we feel this is a likely outcome, THEN I do intend to 
propose the design alternative mentioned.

I would like to record that I have thought about restricting the function 
of parseType=Literal to be purely syntactic, along the lines indicated in 
[1] (also described earlier, with some embellishment, by Patrick [2]), and 
have not become aware of any fundamental problem with it.  I believe it 
results in a cleaner design that we currently have.

I did not promote this because at the time it occurred to me we were trying 
to understand the underlying I18N requirements in relation to the existing 
design, and I felt introduction of an alternative design would muddy the 
debate, and would likely lead to delayed completion of the WGs work.
