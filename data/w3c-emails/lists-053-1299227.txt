We suggest to add the following sentence to the first paragraph of Sec. 3.1:

[[
A class description describes am OWL class, either by a class name or
by specifying a class extension of an unnamed anonymous class.
]]

Well, this was confusing. The note should read:

[[
NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of
he type 2-6, this is not considered to be a class description, but a
special kind of class axiom for complete classes.
See Section 3.2.3 for details.

We agree that in some place where it reads "the class description" it
should be read as "the class described by the class
description". As such a global change would make the text less
accessible and as there typically is no ambiguity, we propose to add
to Sec. 3.1. the following note:

[[
NOTE: In this document we sometimes use for readability purposes
the shorthand "class description" to refer to "the class being
described by the class description". Strictly speaking, these are
different in the case of class descriptions of type 2-6: the class is
represented by the corresponding blank node; the class description is
represented by the triple that have this blank node as their subject.

Here, "class description" will be replaced by "class".

We suggest to change this to:

    "ex:Human rdf:type owl:class ." where "ex:" is the namespace of the
    ontology concerned.

Global revision of this has been done, as suggested, using only terms
like "value", "subject" and "object". See the editor's draft for
details.

We removed rdfs:Literal from this list.

We added rdfs:Literal to the list of possible data ranges at the
start of Sec. 6:

[[
OWL allows three types of data range specifications:
      * A RDF datatype specification.
      * The RDFS class rdfs:Literal.
      * An enumerated datatype, using the owl:oneOf construct.
]]

We suggest to include this as an alternative example, with a reference
to the RDFCore concept of nodeID..

The restriction you mention is in a list preceded by the following
text:

[[
OWL DL allows annotations on classes, properties, individuals
and ontology headers, but only under the  following conditions:
]]

So, yes, this restriction is only applicable to OWL DL.

To prevent any misunderstandings, we added the following sentence to
the start of this section:

[[
OWL Full does not put any restrictions on annotations in an ontology.
]]
