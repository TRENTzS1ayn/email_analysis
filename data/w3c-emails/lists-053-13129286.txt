I've submitted my resignation to MITRE, effective COB September 23.  I'm 
leaving voluntarily to take (roughly) a year off to do some thinking, 
independent development work, and other stuff that seems interesting 
(some of which will be related to the Semantic Web).

I'd like to continue participating in the working group (in particular, 
to see the Primer through to Rec status), but my understanding of the 
process is that I'll need to have invited expert status to do that, 
since I'll no longer be an employee of a W3C member company.  I think 
that's a decision for the Chair(s), but if you could advise me what the 
appropriate process is, I'll go through it.

Apart from that, I'll continue to read (and possibly contribute to) the 
other relevant email lists and so on.

My new email address (which will work now;  it's currently forwarded to 
MITRE) will be fmanola@acm.org.
