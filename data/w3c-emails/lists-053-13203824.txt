Brian asked:
[[
Are there any knock on effects in semantics.
]]



From "RDF Semantics" 5th September
[[
Throughout this document we use the term 'character string' or 'string' to
refer to a sequence of Unicode characters in Normal Form C
]]


Hence Pat seems to agree with my understanding that we only deal with
strings in NFC.
