Agreed. Though if we went down that path,
I can't imagine why we wouldn't include such
treatment, since all the pieces would automatically
be in place and the benefits are significant.

Cheers,

I would add that while this seems a natural development from treating 
rdf:parseType="Literal" as a purely syntactic option for RDF/XML, it is in 
no way central to that design, whose main advantage (IMO) is it's relative 
simplicity.
