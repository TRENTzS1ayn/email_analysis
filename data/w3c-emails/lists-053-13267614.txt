9:  Brian's alternate design writeup: summary of pros/cons

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Sep/0099.html and 
subsequent discussion.

If I am absent, please record my objection
to Brian's "discussed" design, on the (primary)
basis of backwards incompatibility.

12: " 3 "^^xsd:integer / xml schema and whitespace: can this be wrapped up?

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Sep/0085.html generated
a huge amount of traffic. Where are we up to?

I would like to officially propose that the WG's
last decision, to not fudge and to remove the
problemmatic test cases (due to ambiguity
in the XML Schema specs) to be upheld and
that no changes be made to our design nor no
attempt be made by us to interpret/clarify the
XML Schema specs.

Patrick
