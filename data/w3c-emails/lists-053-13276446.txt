While I'm ambivalent about the resolution of xmlsch-02, I'd like to
propose we keep the test cases involved:

- they represent our considered opinion on the xmlsch-02. I've heard
PatS argue strongly that the situation in those test cases is _exactly_
what the XML schema specs say; there certainly appears to be no
ambiguity in his interpretation of those.

- this appears to be a point where interop between implementations may
fall down.

On the other hand:

- we've had implementor feedback that existing XML/XSD libraries don't
do the right thing;

- I'm sorry to say that I have the impression that the withdrawal of
this test case was motivated by the desire to "smoothe the process".

I expect to be at the meeting; in any case unless there's a better
technical argument I object to the removal of the test cases in
question.
