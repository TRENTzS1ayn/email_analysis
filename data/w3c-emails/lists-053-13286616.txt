Following on from what Peter said recently, it occurs to me that since
WS processing is part of XML processing for a schema-aware document,
that the right place to put WS processing on DTed literals (if anywhere)
would be in the RDF/XML parser - ie, so the processing gets done and the
lexical values in the abstract syntax are all appropriately
pre-processed. At that point the semantics can stay the same.

So an XSD-aware rdf/xml parser might take

<eg:Foo rdf:about="eg:subject">
  <eg:property rdf:datatype="xsd:integer"> 3 </eg:property>
</eg:Foo>

and produce

eg:subject rdf:type eg:Foo .
eg:subject eg:property "3"^^xsd:integer .

However:

eg:property2 rdfs:range xsd:integer .
eg:foo eg:property2 " 3 "^^xsd:integer .

would still remain xsd:integer-inconsistent.


The cost is that parsers need to know about XML datatypes to be able to
do this.

If it's broken really badly - don't fix it either.
