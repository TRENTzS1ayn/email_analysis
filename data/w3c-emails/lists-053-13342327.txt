I'm broadly sympathetic to Jan's comments, but I do wonder where it leaves 
the interoperability report if developers choose to implement something 
that goes beyond strict RDF.  My impression was that a test-case failure is 
to be regarded as a serious non-conformance.  I suppose we can say 
something like:

    _:a eg:prop " 3 "^^xsd:integer .

does not entail

    _:a eg:prop "3"^^xsd:integer .

and I'm fine with that, because if an implementation chooses to infer the 
second from the first, it's not violating the RDF specification, just 
making an inference not required by it.

In saying this, I have no strong opinion about the handling of whitespace 
around XML schema datatypes, and would really prefer to defer to the XML 
schema working group on this.
