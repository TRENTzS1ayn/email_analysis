Graham, I'm also broadly sympathetic to your point.
That together with the fact that it's not obvious for
a FOL based reasoner to *pass* a negative entailment
test (theoretically not impossible as FOL is complete
but in practice I guess most implementations will be
incomplete) we then now have either fail or incomplete
for all negative entailment tests, so zero percent pass
(at least in our case if we consider it in that way...)

I'm broadly sympathetic to Jan's comments, but I do wonder where it leaves
the interoperability report if developers choose to implement something
that goes beyond strict RDF.  My impression was that a test-case failure is

to be regarded as a serious non-conformance.  I suppose we can say
something like:

    _:a eg:prop " 3 "^^xsd:integer .

does not entail

    _:a eg:prop "3"^^xsd:integer .

and I'm fine with that, because if an implementation chooses to infer the
second from the first, it's not violating the RDF specification, just
making an inference not required by it.

In saying this, I have no strong opinion about the handling of whitespace
around XML schema datatypes, and would really prefer to defer to the XML
schema working group on this.
