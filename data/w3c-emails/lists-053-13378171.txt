I agree that this reads unambiguously. Unfortunately there is also 
other wording in the same document which suggests an alternative 
interpretation: to wit, the inclusion of the whiteSpace facet as a 
constraining facet on xsd:integer, which is meaningless if one 
understands the above text strictly in the way you suggest.  And even 
more regrettably, there is ample evidence in the text of the document 
that it is not intended to be read quite so strictly, viz. it is 
internally incoherent if so read.  Overall, therefore, I think that 
the situation is ambiguous, or at least underdetermined. In any case, 
we have decided to ask the XSD WG to rule on the matter and will 
include a test case illustrating their ruling.

This might affect the test case, however, which is written in XML.
