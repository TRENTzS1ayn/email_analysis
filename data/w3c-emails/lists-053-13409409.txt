I thought it was really clear too, but when I went to trace the
line of reasoning in the text of the spec, I found this
oddness:

"integer has the following ?constraining facets?:

...
whiteSpace
..."
  -- http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#integer


"[Definition:]  A constraining facet is an optional property that can be
applied to a datatype to constrain its ?value space?."
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dt-constraining-facet


So the whitespace facet constrains the *value space*
of integer somehow?

Maybe that's spurious (I just sent a message to xmlschema-comments
seeking clarification). But I hope it makes it more clear why
the RDF Core WG deliberates the way it does.
