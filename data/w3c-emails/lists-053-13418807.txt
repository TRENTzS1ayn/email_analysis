9:  Brian's alternate design writeup: summary of pros/cons

There was a discussion on this design (now described as "Martin's design")
and several people saw problems:
  PatrickS, danbri, GrahamK - backward incompatibility
  bwm (disagreed with backward incompat.)
    1) building XML into the core of RDF
    2) being "two clever by half" - it needed to be explained several times.
  jang - agrees with bwm's points
  jjc - charmod doesn't say always use XML for markup
  patS, gk - XML in the RDF
  gk - stay with what we have
  DaveB - breaking data, problems with graph to RDF/XML serialization

The chair noted that there was no support in the working group for
spending further time in this design area now.

ACTION 2003-09-12#3 jjc mention other designs in I18N proposed response


10: escaping % in RDF URI refs: can this be wrapped up?

Jeremy reported there is a need for a change on what is said about
control characters and maybe on spaces in URIs, or say less.  He
proposed adding a note about fixing it in an Errata in future. DaveB
asked that future promises weren't made.

DanC raised wanting to make a substantive change by changing RDF
URIrefs to say less (or nothing) by refering entirely to another
definition.  Jeremy noted we need absolute uris, and thus resolving
of relative ones such as against xml:base, so the URI RFC alone
isn't sufficient.

ACTION 2003-09-12#4 DanC write email to the WG to propose to change RDF so that there are no syntax errors in URIs (in the rdf:resource attribute etc.)


12: " 3 "^^xsd:integer / xml schema and whitespace: can this be wrapped up?

RDF Core's xmlsch-02 issue response was
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0097.html

ACTION 2003-09-12#5 DanC ask XML Schema WG for a response on the xmlsch-02 issue

11: Internationalization
