[snip]

A quick bit of feedback on this from looking at 'RDF in the wild', ie.
various folks attempts to create, edit and extend FOAF files. It may be
feedback on the FOAF documentation and tools as much as anything, but
still...

One thing I see quite a lot (@@stats? evidence?) is text where URIs
should go:

<foaf:Person>
  <foaf:interest rdf:resource="W3C RDF and Semantic Web"/>
</foaf:Person>

instead of 

 ...<foaf:interest rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"/> etc

I believe (again wish I had crisp evidence to cite) that naming
properties 'fooHomepage' (schoolHomepage, workplaceHomepage etc) may
offset such mistakes.

So am wondering out loud how this issue would affect tools - esp
validators. "That doesn't look like a URI (URL etc), are you sure you
meant to put that text here?"...

Dan
