OK, I see my error. Never Mind.

Quite.  Because although instantiation is transitive and so is 
subgraph, it can still be the case that an instance of a non-subgraph 
instance is a subgraph. So there is no cheap way to avoid doing a 
check of all subgraphs; which is NP.  I was under the delusion that 
one could search by backtracking down the instances, but that will 
miss some cases. Still might be room for a cleverer algorithm, but 
maybe I wont try to solve P+NP this week.

It means that being a lean graph is potentially a very costly 
property to check, whereas I thought it was fairly trivial. Which 
means that in general, checking non-entailment between two graphs is 
potentially expensive.
