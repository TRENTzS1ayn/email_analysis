This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon 
where I'll be in the chair.

I expect the main focus to be on preparing for a second last call.  To 
that end I expect to discuss:

   - what needs to be done before second last call
   - what external dependencies we have (e.g. responses from xmlsch)
   - how long we should wait after announcement for comments on recently 
published WD's
   - schedule for producing LC docs
