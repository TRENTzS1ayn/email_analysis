I do not think this is acceptable.  The literature is particularly 
prone to use/mention category errors of this kind, and they have in 
the past been particularly troublesome to foundational discussions in 
the SW development effort. One can point to the long-standing 
confusions surrounding the RDF reification vocabulary as one example. 
For such confusions to be repeated in the text of a specification as 
complex and semantically sensitive as OWL is therefore particularly 
troubling, and we feel that the text should be rewritten carefully so 
as to avoid these confusions and make it intended meaning completely 
clear. We are not convinced that there is "no ambiguity" in these 
cases, and we do not feel that writing the text so as to be clear and 
unambiguous about use/mention distinctions is likely to make the text 
"less accessible".

The suggested explanatory text is itself ambiguous: it is not clear 
what is meant by saying that  "the triple (sic: should be 'triples?) 
that have the blank node as their subject"  *represent* the class 
description.  According to the RDF semantics, what a set of triples 
represents ought to be a truth-value in an interpretation, or 
possibly something that could be called a proposition or an 
assertion. None of these seem to be what is meant by the phrase 
"class description". Is the intent of this sentence to indicate that 
the triples with the common subject *are* the class description?

It might be clearer if the word 'represent' and its cognates were 
replaced by the more precise terminology based on 'denote'. This 
would at least have the side-effect of removing ambiguity.
