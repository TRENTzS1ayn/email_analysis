Lot's and lots.

(While I personally like that design - it is the wrong time for this
proposal).

Hence I will pick holes:

No that last bit is incorrect - the blank node _:x has language ttt whereas
the string sss does not.

The additional blank node was at the heart of the untidy proposals (either
explicitly or implicitly) and this proposal is essentially untidiness
revisited.
