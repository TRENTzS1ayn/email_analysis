[[
Gosh... I see more issues... control characters and such
in the "escaping % in RDF URI references" thread.

Seems clear to me that our spec doesn't allow control characters;
how would you find a unicode string U' where utf8-%%-encode(U')
is a plain old ASCII absolute URI reference with optional fragid
while U' has control characters in it? Ew... now I see... yes,
they are allowed by our current draft.

Ugh... time to study namespaces 1.1... I'm losing energy at
this point. I think I'll hit send now. Perhaps I'll find
time/energy to pick it up again later.

DanBri:
[[
So am wondering out loud how this issue would affect tools - esp
validators. "That doesn't look like a URI (URL etc), are you sure you
meant to put that text here?".
]]


Martin Duerst said we were wrong in concepts to permit ctrl characters; 
and suggested that the IRI draft when it advances will prohibit space as 
well.

I am unhappy to be the first spec to prohibit space, in the proto-IRIs

Peter seemed to want a forward looking statement, like in Namespaces 1.1.

Peter also had an aesthetic preference for the Namespaces 1.1 text, 
which the WG was not prepared to endorse (given Martin's neutrality).

The concepts document is where the main constraints on RDF URIs refs get 
stated - DanC may have unearthed editorial issues in the syntax doc.

Howabout:
- change concepts text to prohibit control characters
- add a documents SHOULD NOT use space, and implementations SHOULD warn 
on space,
- add informative reference to IRI draft and its successors

I'll try and get a proposal together tomorrow morning, in time for the 
telecon if the chairs want.

Jeremy
