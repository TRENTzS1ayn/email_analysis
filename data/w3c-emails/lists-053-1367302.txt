Agreed - simple entailment is probably NP complete

(I am not absolutely sure: the subgraph isomorphism problem (which is NP) is
closely related, but I do not have an exact embedding).

The result for conceptual graphs (irredunancy is NP complete) is probably
applicable to RDFS entailment, but again it is real work to show this.
