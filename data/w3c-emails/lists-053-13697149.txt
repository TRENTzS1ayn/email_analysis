? No, I don't think so. That is, each node will denote a single 
value. Of course two different nodes could denote the same value, but 
then that is already the case and has always been.  Even in our 
present design, there is nothing to stop a bnode denoting the same 
thing as a literal.

>It would also make literal values untidy

The bnodes (or URIs ) are just as tidy as the rest of the graph. What 
it does do is mean that there might not be a 1:1 mapping from the 
bnodes denoting the values to the (plain) literals indicating them: 
but we know that is inevitable if we have things like decimal and 
octal.  As for "chat"@en versus "chat"@fr, seems to me to be an 
advantage to be able to not say what the lang is if you happen to not 
know, but to have a standard way to say it if you do know, and to be 
able to add the fact when you find out.

Permit, yes. But lets not go there.
