I was hoping it would not.

That was the idea, but I see that this would mean that it would be 
impossible to have "chat" in French and "chat" in English in the same 
graph.  So on reflection, I don't think this old idea really does 
allow us to have tidy literals and optional lang tags. We really 
cannot have it both ways.  Either literals somehow 'include' a 
language - in which case, if you don't display it as part of the 
literal, the graph is untidy on literal strings - or else they don't, 
in which case asserting the language as a property  has no semantic 
basis.

Oh well, never mind.  Sorry to waste everyone's time.
