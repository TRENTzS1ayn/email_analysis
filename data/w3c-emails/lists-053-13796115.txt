Me neither, but *this* design would be out of order because it does not 
address the I18N concern.

In particular what triples arise from

<rdf:Derscription xml:lang="fi">
  <dc:creator rdf:parseType="Literal">
Ora Yrj? Uolevi <b>Lassila</b>
   </dc:creator>
</rdf:Description>

The interpretation property is either the datatype or the language but not 
both.
(I am not saying that's wrong, but given that the only reason for reopening 
the design issue at this stage would be if we could really address the I18N 
issue then this design is not right)
