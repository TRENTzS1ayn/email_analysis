If I understand correctly, that entailment does hold, but it's not quite 
the same as:

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="a">
       <b>10</b>
    </rdf:Description>
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="c">
       <d>10</d>
    </rdf:Description>

entails:

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="a">
       <b rdf:nodeId="l" />
    </rdf:Description>
    <rdf:Description rdf:about="c">
       <d rdf:nodeId="l" />
    </rdf:Description>

which, I think, also holds.  The latter would resolve to:

   <a> <b> _:n1 .
   _:n1 xsd:string "10" .
   <a> <b> _:n2 .
   _:n2 xsd:string "10" .

entails:

   <a> <b> _:n1 .
   _:n1 xsd:string _:l .
   <a> <b> _:n2 .
   _:n2 xsd:string _:l .

in which the triples:

   _:n1 xsd:string _:l .
   _:n2 xsd:string _:l .

would be entailed by

   _:n1 xsd:string "10" .
   _:n2 xsd:string "10" .

as above, hence the result by subgraph entailment.
