Also all editors to use copy from TR page (last published draft).


What needs to be done?
====================

Primer  - one fix in response to comment, change affiliation of editor
Syntax - minor editorial fixes
Schema - minor editorial fixes
Concepts - NFC, and URIs see below
Semantics - clarifying proof appendix, check link to RDF URI reference
Test Cases - OK
LBase - small changes tracking semantics

ACTION jjc review syntax text on bnode IDs
ACTION path Check link to RDF URI Reference from Semantics to Concepts

NFC
===
Some editorial changes agreed between DaveB, JJC and PFPS. These impact 
normative text to clarify when NFC is needed.
PFPS still seems to want more informative text, which the editors have 
declined.
Pfps:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0339.html
JJC argues against such text, indicating charmod is better.

URI
===
Original point on % is resolved.
WG does not want to take Namespaces 1.1 text
Allowing ctrl characters was a mistake
Latest IRI draft now prohibits space and some other characters.

Proposals A and B from
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Sep/0207

RESOLVED  RDF concepts is changed to prohibit control 
characters in RDF URI References 

RESOLVED concepts is changed to informatively permit 
implementations to issue a warning for the use of RDF URI references not 
conforming to IRI draft or its successors

ACTION jjc change URI text in concepts
