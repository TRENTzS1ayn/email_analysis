Jos,

I think what you describe is different from what Pat proposed:

Pat suggested, now withdrawn:  language tags are property values.

Jos describes: languages are properties, following the "interpretation 
property" style suggested by TimBL [1], more recently noted in the ESW Wiki 
[2].

(cf.  "Attempt 2" and "Attempt 3" in [1].)
