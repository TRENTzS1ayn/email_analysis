Just a reminder that I will shortly no longer be receiving email at 
fmanola@mitre.org;  the new address is fmanola@acm.org.

Also, I'm having some surgery on Wednesday which may preclude my 
participating in the telecon on Friday (not supposed to be serious, but 
I may not be able to talk very well).
