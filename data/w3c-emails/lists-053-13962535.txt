This is a partial review of rdf syntax 05 sept 2003.

Considered text:

6.1.7
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030905/#section-blank-nodeid-event

6.3.3 Grammar Action Notation

5.2 Identifiers
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030905/#section-Identifiers

==========================================
Overall - I think the concept works well enough, but the wording could be 
polished.



Some **suggestions** for the editors consideration.


In 5.2 final para:

delete
[[
In addition to rdf:nodeID attribute values being used to give blank node 
identifiers, these identifiers also need to be generated when not given 
explicitly.
]]
replace with
[[
It may be helpful to generate blank node identifiers even when
none is made explicit with an rdf:nodeID attribute value.
]]

(This step is done by the implementation technique described in the WD but is 
needed because of the non-normative dependency on n-triples.
ARP for instance does not generate such IDs; whereas ARP within Jena does, as 
does ARP when used as an RDF/XML to N-triple filter.)

Alternative wording which I like less, but is clearer than the current wording 
might be:
[[
Blank node identifiers are also generated when
none is made explicit with an rdf:nodeID attribute value.
]]

or
[[
In the grammar, blank node identifiers are also generated when
none is made explicit with an rdf:nodeID attribute value.
]]





6.3.3 no change suggested.


6.1.7

Suggest delete
[[
string-value

The value is the concatenation of "_:" and the value of the *identifier* 
accessor. It is permitted to further modify this value in order to preserve 
distinct blank node identity as discussed in section 5.2 Identifiers.
]]

replace with
[[
string-value

The value is a function of the value of the *identifier* accessor. 
The value begins with "_:".
The value matches the N-triples *nodeID* production.
The function MUST preserve distinct blank node identity as discussed in 
section 5.2 Identifiers.
]]


i.e. replace a half implemented version based on concatenation, with merely a 
specification of the blank-nodeid event. The line
[[The value begins with "_:".]]
is implied by the N-triple production, so could be deleted. I think it is 
clearer with it in.
