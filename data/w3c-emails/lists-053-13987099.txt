I have made no changes since then (waiting for updated staging area script).

Yes, that's better than the existing words which tends to emphasis the wrong bit
(ie not the generation).

I prefer:

Blank node identifiers are also generated when
none is given explicitly with an rdf:nodeID attribute value.

with possible forward reference to generated-blank-node-id() in 6.3.3 ?

Slightly rewording it
 [[
 string-value
 
 The value is a function of the value of the *identifier* accessor. 
 The value begins with "_:" and the entire value MUST match the N-triples *nodeID* production.
 The function MUST preserve distinct blank node identity as discussed in 
 section 5.2 Identifiers.
