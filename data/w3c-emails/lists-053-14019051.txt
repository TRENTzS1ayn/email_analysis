In a given interpretation, was my thought.  But different interpretations 
might assign different denotations.

Well, I agree about not sanctioning to the extent of not documenting 
undefined behaviour.  The slight difficulty is that because some fact A is 
not entailed doesn't necessarily mean that it's not true.  So we can only 
say anything meaningful about this by describing a processing model, which 
I thought we were trying to avoid.

I think I'm more in agreement than not, and could support simply leaving 
the existing test case as a non-entailment.
