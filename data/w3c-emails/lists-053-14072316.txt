Having declined to make editorial improvements, I have been thinking some
more.

It was not the principle of greater editorial clarity that I minded, more
the specifics that Peter was suggesting.

A possible editorial improvement that I could support is as follows:

At the end of
section 3.4 Literals (informative)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-concepts-20030905/#section-Literals
add the following new para

[[
The string in both plain and typed literals is required to
be in Unicode Normal Form C [NFC]. This requirement is motivated
by [Charmod] particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization.
The strings of literals can be considered
<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#def-construct">
constructs</a>
in the sense used in that section.
]]

and add charmod into the informative references.

Jeremy
