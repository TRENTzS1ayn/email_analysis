I have now worked through the last call issue resolutions and the editors
draft of concepts should be up-to-date.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/

I need to review it, and I hope Graham will join me in so doing at this
stage.

I will prepare a further resolution concerning XMLLiterals for Friday: since
the text in the editors draft does not correspond with WG resolutions.
