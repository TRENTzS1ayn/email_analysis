Let me try again, although I'm losing the will to live at this point :)

I don't think swapping the words you suggest would help but putting the
sentence the other way around makes the correct parts associate.

  If no blank node identifier is given explicitly as an rdf:nodeID 
  attribute value then one will need to be generated.

  (reminder, this is in 5.2, Blank Node Identifiers first sentence of last paragraph:
   http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Identifiers
  )

plus maybe a reference forward to generated-blank-node-id() in 6.3.3
