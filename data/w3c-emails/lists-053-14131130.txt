Peter has clarified [1] the status of some of the comments he has made 
on the LC semantics document:

pfps-02 - translation to lbase - pfps notes the ball is in our court.

pfps-03 - translation to lbase - pfps just doesn't see the need for 
lbase in the document

pfps-04 - rdf closure rules - pfps wants a stronger notion of 
completeness of the closure rules

pfps-05 - rdfs closure rules - again pfps wants a stronger notion of 
completeness of the the closure rules

pfps-06 - xml literals and LV - it is possible the latest docs fix this 
and we have not pointed this out to pfps.

Brian
