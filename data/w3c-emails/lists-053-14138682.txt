Two of Peter's objections concern the translation to LBase.  I'm 
wondering whether we might defuse these objections by replacing the 
LBase appendix with a suitably worded informative reference to the LBase 
note, e.g.

[[
An alternative formulation of the semantics of RDF(S) in the form of 
axioms for the langauge LBase can be found in the LBase specification 
[ref to lbase note].
]]
