I was hoping for a very little time on NFC - perhaps that can come under the 
action status.

Peter did not like the last sentence in my proposed amendment, which does link 
off into the part of charmod concerning strings that start with composing 
characters, which we decided *not* to implement.

My proposed amendment is now:
[[
The string in both plain and typed literals is required to
be in Unicode Normal Form C [NFC]. This requirement is motivated
by [Charmod] particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization.
]]

added to the informative, more introductory,  part of concepts.

Under
> 10: collecting objections

It would be good to clarify with Peter whether he wishes to be recorded as 
objecting against either the substance or the editorial aspects of NFC (in 
both Concepts and Syntax), and the editorial aspects of the section RDF URI 
References.

PS Please note I have a hard cut off at the end of the 1hr telecon today.
