Graham asked
[[
What change from your earlier 
proposal are you actually suggesting?
]]

Not including the following sentence:
[[
The strings of literals can be considered
<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#def-construct">
constructs</a>
in the sense used in that section.
]]

Peter did not like the earlier proposal, and I felt that the link in this 
sentence (Section 4.2.3) had been counterproductive. The remaining text 
points to section 4 as a whole.

[[
The string in both plain and typed literals is required to
be in Unicode Normal Form C [NFC]. This requirement is motivated
by [Charmod] particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization.
]]

(the section 4 there is a hyperlink, naturally).
