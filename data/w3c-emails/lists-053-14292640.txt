I've created a new directory structure in shadow TR space, to 
work with the perl script I'm still fiddling with.

Basic idea is RDFCore/TR/incoming/ and .../outgoing/ directories.

Editor's should commit documents to incoming/ dir. I'm working on a 
conventions for dated and undated links that can be perl munged, with 
the outputs written into the parallel outgoing/ directory tree.
