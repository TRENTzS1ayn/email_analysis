I have discussed this issue with HP colleagues and we support Jos's position.

While we obviously should not rule out cutting the closure rules, we should be 
convinced that it is necessary to do so 

Given that they are informative I would argue that even if we are not 100% 
convinced that they are right it is OK to go to Rec acknowleding the 
possibility of errata.

I probably would not be prepared to have a second last call just for the 
closure rules - but if that became the substance of the issue I would want to 
consult with my colleagues.
