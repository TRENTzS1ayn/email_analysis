> Funny old world, ennit?


I've changed my mind on this one too, so it's quite easy to quote old 
e-mails from me against my current position. I guess there are a few links.
I like the public exposure of my fickleness.


I have, of course, been persuaded by the force of the arguments made by my 
colleagues on the working group.
