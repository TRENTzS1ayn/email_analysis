I have supported numerous proposals over these many months, some
which I personally supported, and others which I could merely live
with, often motivated by the need to achieve *any* solution
which was minimally workable and sufficiently palatable to
all interested parties.

I've busted my *ass* over the past two years on this, trying
hard to offer ideas and alternatives that meet the needs and
wants of various individuals and groups while still retaining
a generic, scalable, portable, and framework agnostic design.

I refuse to be treated as a scapegoat in this debacle.

Be cautious in what you infer. Be very cautious, Pat.

Patrick
