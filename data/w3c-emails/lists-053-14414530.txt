Pat,

I apologize if I over-reacted to you're comments. I
doubt you were intending to point any fingers. I guess I
(like most folks) are wary about being singled out in
contentious processes such as this has been.

I guess we're all pretty frazzled over this process, and
none of us are fully satisfied with the end result, even if
most all of us are resigned to live with it, taking it as
the "least unattractive of alternatives".

Please disregard my last post, if you can.

Patrick
