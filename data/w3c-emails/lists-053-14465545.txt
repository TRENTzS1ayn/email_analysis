I don't feel strongly, but...

I think suggestion (1) is fine

I think suggestion (2) is a tad over-prescriptive.  It seems to require 
inclusion of xml:lang="" even when there is no in-scope non-empty language 
tag.  Also, if the meaning of parseType=Literal is clear (which I think it 
is), then adding this makes no difference in any case.
