I agree that these are possible weaknesses, I think the schedule issue is 
an important one. Please suggest improvements - possibly to do with use of 
this document, and a separate rebuttal that consists of
a) the blow-by-blow account I added in today's draft
b) discussion of wider issues such as schedule and no compelling reason for 
delay
