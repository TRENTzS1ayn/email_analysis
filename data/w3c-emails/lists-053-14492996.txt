There is a version (dated 29 Sept.) with the changes described below at

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_LC2.1.html

It also has glossary entries for consistent and decideable, with 
brief comments.

I tend to agree with Peter about the rules being normative, 
particularly as I couldn't find a formal record of that decision 
either (the best I could do was to link to the IRC log). The only 
coherent interpretation I can assign to this, on reflection, would be 
that any other inference engine which worked in some other way would 
not be conformant, even if it was complete and correct: which is 
silly.  Maybe y'all could just advise me to make section 7 
informative rather than normative? I'd suggest that we do that before 
LC2, in any case.

>>  Here are my comments.
>>
>>1/ The major new issue I have with the document is the unsupported change
>>of the entailment rules from informative to normative.
>
>Just for the record, that change happened a few versions ago; but 
>your comment is noted.
>
>>
>>2/ The removal of the translation to LBase is a major improvement.  I would
>>have prefered different wording in Section 0.1 concerning this translation
>>but can live with the new situation.
>>
>>3/ The document is of several minds with respect to just what the semantics
>>of RDF (and RDFS) is.  There is wording in Section 1.3 to the effect that
>>the definition of the semantics of RDF and RDFS excludes the entailment
>>rules.  How can this coexist with having the entailment rules be normative?
>
>Well, the rules are not part of the semantics as such. The issue of 
>their normativeness (normativity? normitude?) seems to be orthogonal 
>to this point. The Abstract of the document begins
>
>"This is a specification of a precise semantics, and corresponding 
>complete systems of inference rules, for...."
>
>clearly indicating that the semantics is one thing, and the rules 
>another, a division reflected in the organization of the document.
>
>(??Maybe I havnt followed your point here??)

>>
>>4/ The figures in the copy of the document that I reviewed have naming
>>problems, but I am told that these have since been fixed.
>
>They may not have been fixed to your satisfaction. The changes were 
>largely graphical (color, font rendering) rather than textual. We 
>have discussed the issue of the wording in figure 1, and I responded 
>in an earlier message.
>
>>
>>5/ The Monotonicity and Compactness Lemmas are only stated for simple
>>entailment.  However, readers could easily be left with the impression that
>>the other forms of entailment could also have the desirable properties that
>>accrue from these lemmas.
>
>The text states explicitly:
>
>"These results apply only to simple entailment, not to the extended 
>notions of entailment introduced in later sections."
>
>reiterated after the statement of the anonymity lemma:

>"Note again that this applies only to simple entailment, not to the 
>vocabulary entailment relationships defined in rest of the 
>document.".

>Later, when RDF-entailment is introduced (section 3.1, second 
>paragraph) the document repeats the warning, with a back-link and an 
>illustrative example.:

>"It is easy to see that the lemmas in <a href>Section 2</a> do not 
>all apply to rdf-entailment: for example..."

>>6/ The characterization of simple entailment rules is misleading as they do
>>not currently correspond to the instance lemma.  The comment on how to make
>>this change at the end of Section 7.1 does not adequately serve to correct
>>the misimpression.

>>7/ The document needs a better description of consistency and
>>inconsistency.

>Can you elaborate? Ah, I see that there is no glossary entry for

>>
>>8/ The change to the RDFS entailment lemma is incorrectly noted in the
>>change log as editorial.
>
>It was considered editorial because it was considered to be a 
>correction of an error in the text rather than a change to the lemma.
>
>>9/ I view the development and statement of the entailment lemmas as
>>fundamentally flawed.  I look for soundness and completeness in any such
>>syntactic characterization of entailment.  Neither simple entailment, RDF
>>entailment, nor RDFS entailment have both these characteristics.

>In the sense of 'complete' you probably mean, that is correct. They 
>never have been written in that style and I see no useful purpose to 
>be served by so doing.

>>9a/ Section 7.1 does not provide any statement at all on whether the simple
>>entailment rules are complete with respect to simple entailment.

>Section 2 has already noted, however :
>
>"The interpolation lemma completely characterizes simple RDF 
>entailment in syntactic terms. To tell whether a set of RDF graphs 
>entails another, check that there is some instance of the entailed 
>graph which is a subset of the merge of the original set of graphs. 
>Of course, there is no need to actually construct the merge. If

>I also note that section 7 begins by saying :

>"The following tables list some inference patterns which capture 
>some of the various forms of vocabulary entailment."

>and does not refer to simple entailment. As you may recall, the
