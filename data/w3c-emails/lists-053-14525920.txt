Me too.  After reviewing the IRC log [1], My (possibly imperfect) 
recollection was that although DanC raised the matter of making the rules 
normative, we didn't actually make a decision on that particular proposal.

Having read Peter's response [2], particularly his points 1 and 3, I also 
tend to agree with keeping them informative.

OTOH, Dan's argument, IIRC, was that implementers would work from the rules 
anyway, and if there were any divergence it may be that the model theory, 
not the rules, should be fixed up to most usefully serve the 
community.  That would be difficult position to sustain procedurally if the 
rules are only informative.

This makes me wonder if, given that there is less implementation experience 
of inference based on these formal semantics, it wouldn't be more 
appropriate to request the formal semantics go to CR (with informative 
rules) rather than PR at this time?
