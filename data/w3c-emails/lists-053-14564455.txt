My memory says we decided to make them normative, but my memory
isn't very reliable.

The minutes corresponding to the 27 June IRC log are
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0025.html
and they don't seem to show a decision to make the rules normative.

Sigh.

I think we've been sufficiently careful to add tests for all the
interesting nooks and crannies in the semantics that passing
all the tests is quite a bit of implementation experience with
the formal semantics as written.

Moreover, I maintain that horn rules is a correct implementation
strategy, and I consider anything to the contrary a bug.
While I'd rather that were stated in so many words in the spec,
I'm willing to accept that the burden is on me (and like-minded
reviewers) to find any such bugs. I'm fairly confident
there aren't any.
