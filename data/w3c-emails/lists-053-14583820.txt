OK, that was poor phrasing on my part.

Some actual wording from the I18N formal objection [1] is:

+ provide solutions as close as possible for plain literals and XML Literals
+ Do not require programmers/users to trade off use of language information 
against other goals, such as markup integrity.
+ It is very important to have a consistent way to identify the language of 
a piece of text in any technology so that generic operations needing this 
information can use it easily.
+ to write queries that search for both plain literals and XML literals
+ possible to keep markup as is without loosing language information

My phrasing may have been poor;  I was trying to refer to goals such as 
these, which I was not aware were articulated to the group until after LC.
