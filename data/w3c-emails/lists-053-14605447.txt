That is my memory also.  We talked about it but I think we got so 
deep into the discussions about whether or not to keep reflexivity 
and so on that it got lost in the woods. However on reflection I now 
think we should have considered that step (the normative bit, not the 
reflexive) more carefully, as I don't think it really makes sense to 
say that any set of rules is normative. I think at the time I was in 
an "I'm just the editor, tell me what to do, Im tired"  frame of mind.

?? Like, translating into FOL and using resolution is a bug? Or using 
a tableaux reasoner (like the industrial-strength Manchester OWL 
reasoners) is a bug? Or using a subgraph-cluster checker for handling 
very large sets is a bug?  (etc.)  That seems silly.

I think of the horn rules as a kind of reasoner-erector-set. You can 
put it together fast, you have the parts pre-built, you don't need a 
shop, and it even works pretty well; but its not necessarily what a 
professional would use.  (Which is fine, of course, provided we don't 
make professionalism illegal.)
