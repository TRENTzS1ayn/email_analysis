Pat,

In his response

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0354.html

pfps suggested for pfps-06 that he just needed told that we'd fixed it. 
  Can you check whether we have and if so inform him so we can close it off.

On pfps-04 - is that fixed or an agree to differ.  pfps again suggested 
we had not responded.

Would be good to close these off.

Brian
