Er... be careful what you ask for.

If you put the question (again), I may very well take a strong
stand in favor of making them normative.

So don't do that. ;-)

The record doesn't compel the editor to make them normative.

The record apparently disagrees with the memory of serveral of us,
but all of us had a chance (and an obligation) to correct
the record and we did not.

I trust the editors (both the series editor and the
semantics editor) to do something reasonable.
