I will try to find the first time he was told about this, but it was 
months ago now. Might be simpler just to tell him again?

On this one, Peter and I are in disagreement about what the comment 
was. My view is that the original comment is fixed and that he has 
since transformed it into a new one on which we differ.  Peter's 
view, as I understand it, is that it is not fixed and that we differ.

By all means. Let us say that the first is closed OK and the second 
is closed agree to differ.
