Aaron,

This is the formal announcement.

I would suggest forwarding a copy (or URI) of your XML source code to 
<rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org> (with a copy of or clear reference to this 
announcement, or at least to the approved Internet Draft name).  According 
to [1][2], the RFC Editor can use this to ease internal publishing process.

What will probably happen now is that things go quiet for a while, then you 
will receive an email from the RFC Editor giving you 48 hours to review the 
document edited to its expected final form as an RFC.  Sometimes, errors do 
creep in during the RFC Editor process, so it's worth checking, though with 
a simple document like this I don't anticipate problems.

The RFC editor maintains a publicly visible queue at [3].

Thanks for your prompt turnaround over the past few weeks.
