Two stylistic issues concerning the documents

1.. Normativity.  We might want to clear up this issue noticed by 
several people about which of the 5 documents are considered 
normative, and how to explain clearly the difference in the 
boilerplate (hopefully so it makes sense: I'm certainly confused 
about it, for one. OK, so maybe the primer isnt normative and maybe 
test cases are never normative (?), but why is Vocabulary not 
normative? And if it isn't, why are its semantics normative? )

2. Change log style.  What is appropriate for a change log in the 
publication document? (1) the full change log from day one or (2) the 
change log since the most recently archived public release? I would 
vote for the latter and beg permission to have the semantics doc 
brought up to date in that regard by deleting a chunk of stuff from 
the change log.
