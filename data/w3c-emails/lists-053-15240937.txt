Oh dear, I wasn't aware of this document.

In both the old and new versions, it calls for the MIME type registration 
template to be a normative part of the W3C spec... but we've not done that.

I was only considering the IETF end of things.

I suppose that now the RDF spec is pretty much fixed for publication as 
REC, we'll have to proceed with the registration template in the IETF 
document.  (Maybe a copy of this could be placed at a stable URI in W3C space?)
