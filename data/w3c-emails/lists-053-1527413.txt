Hi Graham

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0138.html
lists two actions against me concerning your message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0114.html

specifically:



ACTION 2003-03-21#6 jjc: review
  
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-rdf-graph
  in concepts WD after proposal to change in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0114.html
  and circulate changes to the WG.

ACTION 2003-03-21#7 jjc: review 
  
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-blank-nodes
  in concepts WD after proposal to change in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0114.html
  and propose change/non-change or further clarification to the WG.

On the first, I have reviewed the text and believe no change is necessary in 
#section-rdf-graph
(I have however inserted the two words "set of" to ensure number agreement on 
"is").

On the second, you suggested:


may not be sufficently clear to non-mathematical persons.  I think it's 
mathematically clear that, though lacking visible labels, bnodes have 
identity and different bnodes may be distinguished, and a single bnode may 
appear in more than one subject or object position in a graph, but it's 
easy to get confused.

Maybe, add something like this explanatory text to the definition?:

[[
A bnode has no discernable structure other than, given two bnodes, it is 
possible to determine whether or not they are the same.  (For the purpose 
of representing RDF graphs as text, bnodes may be assigned arbitrary labels 
so that different bnodes may be distinguished;  such labels are simply a 
means of representation and are not part of any RDF graph in which the 
bnode appears.)
]]

I have added
[[
Given two blank nodes, it is 
possible to determine whether or not they are the same.
]]

since the rest of the para is already covered elsewhere (either in 6.6 or 3.2 
- leaving bnode identifiers only informative in the abstract syntax)
