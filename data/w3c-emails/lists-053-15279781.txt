This is a brief final review of *all* the RDF Core documents (not just 
the Primer) as of the CVS versions indicated.

I note that *all* the documents now have the same SOTD, which means that 
*none* of the documents are explicitly indicated as being normative (see 
below).  There are also a few other issues in some of the documents that 
may or may not be considered problematic.

Primer Rec CVS 1.44
-------------------

All the SOTD and References look OK now.  The Change Log is OK.

Section 7.2 of the Primer, in describing Test Cases, says

"The test cases are not a complete specification of RDF, and are not 
intended to take precedence over the normative specification documents."

On thinking about the discussion on the meaning of  "normative" earlier 
last week, I suppose someone could read this as saying that Test Cases 
is *not* normative.  If that's a concern, simply changing this to:

"The test cases are not a complete specification of RDF, and are not 
intended to take precedence over the *other* specification documents."

would be a simple fix.  Leaving this alone doesn't bother me if it 
doesn't bother anyone else.


Concepts Rec CVS 1.70
---------------------

SOTD:  This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer;  there is nothing 
here that indicates the normative status of the Concepts spec.  All the 
links and other material seem OK.

References:  seem OK

In the Change Log, under "References", there's a "TODO" at the end.  To 
reduce confusion, this should probably either be done or removed.

Semantics Rec CVS 1.69
----------------------

SOTD:  This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer;  there is nothing 
here that indicates the normative status of the Semantics spec.  All the 
links and other material seem OK.

References:  seem OK

Syntax Rec CVS 1.64
-------------------

SOTD:  This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer;  there is nothing 
here that indicates the normative status of the Syntax spec.  All the 
links and other material seem OK.

References:  seem OK

The Change Log lists changes as of the 23 January 2003 last call WD, not 
the PR version.

Test Cases Rec CVS 1.83
-----------------------

SOTD:  This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer;  there is nothing 
here that indicates the normative status of the Test Cases spec.  All 
the links and other material seem OK.

References:  seem OK

The Change Log lists changes since the 20010912 WD, not just the PR version.

There is also an Appendix B, "Open Issues" that has a bullet "complete 
the test cases", which suggests the Test Cases document is not complete. 
  This should probably be deleted (both here and in the Table of Contents).

Vocabulary Rec CVS 1.64
-----------------------

SOTD:  This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer;  there is nothing 
here that indicates the normative status of the Vocabulary spec.  All 
the links and other material seem OK.

References:  seem OK

The Change Log lists changes as of the 23 January 2003 last call WD, not 
the PR version.
