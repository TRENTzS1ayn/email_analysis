Thanks for the careful review, Frank.

As I understand the process, these kinds of changes are made (at this
point, after PR) at the discretion of the Director, rather than by WG
decision.  However, it would be good to know if anyone on the WG sees
any problem with any of these changes.  They all seem good to me,
except the idea that the SOTD should say something about normativity.
As I understand it, to the extent that normativity is conveyed
explicitely, it should be in the document main text, or in
parenthetical expressions on the section titles.  And that kind of
change is potentially substantive, and so not appropriate here and
now.

I like this change.

I like this change.

I'm ambivalent on this.   There's not wrong with listing old changes,
although they are a bit of clutter.

Ambivalent, ditto old changes.

I like this change.

Ambivalent, ditto old changes.
