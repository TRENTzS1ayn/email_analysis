Sandro--

The reason I mentioned the "normative" business was that at one point 
the second sentence in the SOTD of the documents said "It is a stable 
document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative 
reference from another document."  (This seems to be standard 
boilerplate for other W3C normative specifications as well.)  There was 
also a statement above that for translations that said that the English 
translation was the normative one.  I think these sentences were removed 
as a result of my pointing out that the Primer wasn't normative. 
However, it seems to me that they *are* appropriate for the other 
documents.  However, it's really not a big concern to me.  I was just 
pointing out that some changes that were appropriate for the Primer 
seemed to be carried over to the other documents as well, and I wondered 
whether that was intentional.
