Dear Chairs (and please forward this mail to your Group members),

The Program Committee (TPPC) has finalized the Agenda topics for the
Technical Plenary Day on 3 March in Cannes-Mandelieu, France...
     http://www.w3.org/2004/03/TechPlenAgenda.html

Based on input from many of you, the TPPC has built an Agenda that we hope
will be interesting, educational, unifying and inspiring to the broad range
of interests that will be represented in the audience.  Topics include:

   * Architecture of the World Wide Web and Hot TAG Topics
   * Lightening Tech Talks
   * Adventures with Mixed Markup Language Documents
   * Making Test Suites Work for Working Groups
   * Can I Really Get Good Web Access Without a PC and a Big Screen?
   * Querying the Web

The 2004 Tech Plenary meetings week will be a full and exciting
event.  Please remember that registration closes on 20 February.  For
further information on the week's activities, please see the main meetings
week page...
     http://www.w3.org/2003/08/allgroupoverview.html

Hoping to see you all again soon in France ...

Steve,
for the TPPC
