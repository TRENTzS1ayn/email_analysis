This does not look disastrous to me.

In RDF URIrefs ending in # (i.e. with explicitly empty fragment) only
regularly occur as namespace names. All possible uses of such URIrefs
involve qnames which give them a non-emtpy fragment part.

The text in question

"URI producers and normalizers should omit a delimiter if the component it
delimits is empty"

uses a "should" not a "MUST", and is hence sufficiently weak.

We perhaps could suggest modifying the text:
[[

, with one exception: a double-slash delimiter indicating an authority
component should not be removed, even when the authority is empty, since
doing so can lead to misinterpreting the path.
]]
http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#normalize-empty

to
[[
. A first exception is: a double-slash delimiter indicating an authority
component should not be removed, even when the authority is empty, since
doing so can lead to misinterpreting the path.
A second exception is: a common idiom in RDF/XML uses URI references with
empty fragments as XML namespace names.
]]

The overall normalization rules in section 6
http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#comparison
inevitable create a many positive matches that are not honoured in RDF
concepts. Like XML namespaces we chose the simplest possible definition of
equality: string equality. The overall tone of section 6 ought to respect
such a choice.
