Yes, but the text also seems to claim that it is always safe to apply the 
normalization.  That is my concern.  Section 6.1 says "...  while strictly 
avoiding false positives".

I think it would also apply to empty path and query components, so I'm not 
happy to just pick out empty fragments as a second exception.

Yes.  I'm waiting to see what response to my comments, but I think I might 
suggest that the text:
[[
Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives 
while strictly avoiding false positives
]] -- (section 6.1)

be something like
[[
Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives 
while strictly avoiding false positives when used for purposes of retrieval.
]]

(This echoes the earlier comment "URI comparison is performed in respect to 
some particular purpose" [section 6 intro], and I think provides the 
necessary escape route for RDF and XML namespaces and maybe other purposes 
to which URIs are pressed.)
