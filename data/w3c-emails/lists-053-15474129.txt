I don't think we should be suggesting that the meaning of a URI might differ
from that of a URI with a slightly different spelling.

We have remained silent on the relationship between

http://foobar and http://foobar:80/

and I think we should remain silent. The advice in RFC 2396 bis to avoid
forms like the latter of these two is good.

For example using

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns

in place of

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

does not work operationally, but I would not commit myself to making that a
semantic truism.

However, I would not object to being a co-signatory on your suggested
textual change.

Jeremy
