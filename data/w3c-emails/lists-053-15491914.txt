I propose to cancel this weeks telecon and schedule another for 12 Mar 
2004, if needed.

I would like to get moving on comments on the TAG architecture document.

Jan - are you still up for reviewing?  Can we aim to get other comments 
in by the end of this week and agreement by email next week?

Brian
