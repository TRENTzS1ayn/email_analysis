I think that means we will not formally respond to I18N on the charmod 
comments, shall I tell them that we do not intend to, but that the e-mail 
discussion has not shown any disagreement.

e.g.
I have informed the RDF Core WG of your decisions, and no one has indicated 
  unhappiness - however we have not formally discussed these issues; and 
are not likely to.
