Jeremy,

It appears we are in agreement about RDF (phew! ;-)...

Exactly.  My concern is that the revised RFC2396bis suggests that it is 
*always* safe to replace one with the other, by the language:

[[
Even though it is possible to determine that two URIs are equivalent, it is 
never possible to be sure that two URIs identify different resources. For 
example, an owner of two different domain names could decide to serve the 
same resource from both, resulting in two different URIs. Therefore, 
comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives while strictly 
avoiding false positives.
]]

Specifically: "while strictly avoiding false positives"

Yes.  But I have two concerns:

(a) a future version of RDF would presumably cite RFC2396bis, in which case 
it acquires an additional axiom, which I think is a potential source of 
surprise.

(b) the RDF rules for formation of URIrefs from namespaces and local names 
mean that URIrefs may be changed (by the RFC2396bis normalization) in ways 
that cannot be described by additional assertions of this kind.

Yes.

Then some given RDF may have different meanings when processed by different 
systems.  If the triple is to be endorsed, I think it should be explicit 
(somewhere) in the RDF data.

>In the open world, the test triple is true;

That seems like an unjustified leap to me.  It may be true in the "open 
world" *when used for the purposes of retrieval*, but there are other 
purposes (e.g. URIref formation from namespace URI) for which it is not true.

In practice, we would hope that people do not assign different meanings to 
URIs that differ in these ways, but we seem to agree that this is not 
prohibited by RDF.
