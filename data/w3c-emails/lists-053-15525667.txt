But the primary issue here is, if they ARE used then they should NOT 
be considered to be identical or interchangeable. Substituting one 
form of a URI for another could produce unforseeable and potentially 
catastrophic consequences for any SW reasoner.

I agree with Graham that this is a potentially serious problem that 
we should nip in the bud. I also would like to be a co-signatory on 
the proposed textual changes; Graham, please include me. I 
particularly like the inclusion of the phrase " for purposes of 
retrieval" as it acknowledges that URIs have other purposes.
