OK, here's what I propose:

[[[[
Further to my earlier message [1], I've discussed the issue of URI 
normalization with some colleagues and we'd like to propose the following 
small change of wording with respect to [2] (announcement [3]):

...

Section 6.1, para 2, final sentence:

The suggested change is to this sentence:
[[
Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives 
while strictly avoiding false positives.
]]

To be:
[[
Therefore, comparison methods are designed to minimize false negatives 
while strictly avoiding false positives when used for purposes of retrieval.
]]

Rationale:

This reinforces the earlier comment that "URI comparison is performed in 
respect to some particular purpose" [section 6 intro], and I think provides 
the necessary get-out for those purposes other than retrieval for which the 
normalization processes described can result in false URI-equivalence (i.e. 
in circumstances where existing applications may legitimately deliver 
differing results).

The IETF debating culture is slightly different, so the multiple 
signatories count for less than the quality of the argument, but I don't 
think it harms.
