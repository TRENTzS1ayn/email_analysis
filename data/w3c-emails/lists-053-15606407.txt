A formal comment as such has no special weight in the IETF process.

The URI mailing list may not be a formal IETF working group, but it is 
planning to make a submission for IETF publication, so I'd imagine the IETF 
modus operandi will be predominant.

I suggest we make an less-formal response for now (e.g. per [1]), and if a 
problem remains when the draft goes to IETF last-call, we may consider 
something more collective.

As for timescales:  Roy mentioned requesting IETF last-call in two 
weeks.  The IETF last-call for a non-working-group specification is 4 
weeks.  In practice, I expect we have a bit longer because of a forthcoming 
IETF meeting.
