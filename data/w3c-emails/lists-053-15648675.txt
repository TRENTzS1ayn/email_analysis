Probably not.  Better, I think, to debate the case coherently than make it 
a political issue.  Having Jeremy and Pat supporting my comments will, I 
think, be enough to show it's not an isolated comment.  We're not at the 
stage of IETF last-call yet.

On the other hand, if people have additional comments to make that add 
substantially to the debate, that's always welcome.  (But please bear in 
mind that this specification is in its final stages of being nailed down, 
so any comments should be addressed specifically to the specification 
rather than to broader issues, preferably with suggestions for improvement.)

If Pat agrees with the specific wording in [1] cited above (Jeremy already 
has), then I'm ready to send it off.
