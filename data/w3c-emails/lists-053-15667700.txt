I glanced at the RDF primer this afternoon, wondering if the application/rdf+xml media type had been registered.

Apparently, though, the specification referenced by the Primer is not only unofficial (a draft), but expires in mid-March, 2004.  This is not good.

I ask because there's a bug filed for the Mozilla project to support application/rdf+xml instead of the text/rdf media type, which is not approved either.  I'm simply following up, out of curiousity.
