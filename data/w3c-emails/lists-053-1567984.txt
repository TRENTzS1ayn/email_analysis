Hi Brian

in the change log in concepts the items in red are those which the wg has not 
discussed.

Turning that into some subitems, and also bearing in mind some of the other 
inputs, and my review of my actions, I suggest the following may be worth 
discussing:

1: value space of rdf:XMLLiteral

the integrated text *does not* conform strictly with our previous resolutions.
To be squeaky clean I propose:
The WG approves the following defn of the value space of XMLLiteral:
[[
The value space
is the set of all exclusive Canonical XML (with comments, with empty 
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList ), which when embedded within an arbitrary XML 
start and end element form a document conforming to XML Namespaces [XML-NS].
]]

2: datatypes text

I was meant to get mroe feedback from graham and pat (and patrick, who missed 
the relevant telecon, joined in as well).
Relevant text:
#section-Datatypes (section 5)

3. language identifier vs language tag
  I changed the term language identifier to language tag, following a 
suggestion from graham. This probably should be discussed.

4. williams-01 node terminology

I was meant to get WG approval of proposed text in section 6.
I propose no change on graphs, and one sentence added to 6.6 concerning blank 
nodes:

"Given two blank nodes, it is possible to determine whether or not they are 
the same."

5. I18N comment - ???

Other than that, I think concepts is finished.

Jeremy
