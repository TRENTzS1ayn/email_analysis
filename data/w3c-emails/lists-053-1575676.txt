I agree.  But I think the following:

[[
A URI reference or literal used as a node identifies what that node 
represents. A URI reference used as a predicate identifies the relationship 
between the nodes it connects. A predicate URI reference may also be a node 
in the graph.
]]

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-URI-Vocabulary

should be revised to say something like
"... identifies the relationship between the things represented by the 
nodes it connects"

I think that addresses the main point, and accept that for now.  (I may 
change my mind when I do a full document review, but I don't expect to.)
