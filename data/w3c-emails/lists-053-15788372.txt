One quick clarification (other comments may follow later)...

This last-published WD is now badly out of date.  It does not incorporate 
the results of two f2f meetings and some telecons.  The QAWG's current 
thinking is reflected in the editors draft (linked from the Table of Seven 
[1] on QAWG home page):

http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2003/10/TestGL-20031020.html

Unfortunately, the prose in the intro sections is not fleshed out in this 
editors draft.  However, notice in "Concepts" how some types of tests/test 
suites are enumerated.  The QAWG has decided that the applicability of the 
guidelines and checkpoints for TestGL 1.0 will be limited to:  conformance 
test suites.  "Concepts" will discuss other sorts of test suites, and 
methodologies and uses for test cases.

I don't think OWL pretends to have a conformance test suite.  It was partly 
in response to your earlier comments that we made these refinements and 
restrictions on applicability.

We have no intention to "prohibit and/or obstruct" what you are doing.  In 
my view, what you are doing is outside of the scope of the normative 
content of TestGL 1.0.  (This is my view, and I'd invite other QAWG 
participants to comment.)

Regards,
-Lofton.

P.S.  We are pushing to publish again soon, but that effort has been 
diluted in the last few months by the effort around moving other parts of 
QAF to CR.  Your message indicates that we should prioritize publishing an 
updated WD.
