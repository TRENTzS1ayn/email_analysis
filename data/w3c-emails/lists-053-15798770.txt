I'd like to add a comment on this test-led approach as I perceived it in 
the context of RDFcore work.  In many ways I have found it to be valuable, 
and have used similar ideas in other projects I've worked on recently.

One thing I found problematic with the RDFcore test cases was the lack of 
an easily accessible human-readable form -- having the test case data split 
between different files, and file formats that didn't always display fully 
when viewed in a browser.  While I appreciate the value of having 
machine-readable test data, I think the value making it easy also for 
humans to read has been underestimated.

The test data serves two purposes:  (a) to provide some (incomplete*) basis 
that an application satisfies the specification, and (b) to convey to human 
readers in an unambiguous fashion an example of what the working group 
intended to specify.  I feel that purpose (a) has been promoted to the 
detriment of purpose (b).

<aside>
(*)  I say incomplete, because I think it's fallacious to assume that the 
test case suite provides complete coverage of the specification.  We tended 
to create test cases to reflect awkward decisions, not to reflect every 
possible feature of the language.
</aside>

I think it is possible to have one's cake and eat it, though.  With just a 
little additional work, I think the test case data could be prepared in 
such a way that both human- and machine-readable forms can be generated.  I 
think a very simple RDF vocabulary, encoded using Notation 3, could be used 
to describe and discuss test cases from which alternative forms could be 
derived.  We've already seen something similar done for document issue 
tracking.
