I note that Mark's msg
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0344

seemed to suggest that he would like a postponed issue:
[[
Can we at least agree that this is an issue; that RDF Schema isn't
self-descriptive?  I'm not detecting that you agree.
]]

and particularly he is likely to be happier even with an issue postponed until 
after the "media types as URIs" problem is fixed. I don't suppose we have one 
do we?

I vaguely remember agreeing that mime types were inappropriate for carrying 
the intended inference, but it may well make sense to review this later if 
there are media type changes coming down the pipeline.
