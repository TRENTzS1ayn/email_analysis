Agreed for test driven development.

* Propose a feature
* Make a test
* Write the spec
* Create a consolidated TS that will help external world.

I don't see where the QA Framework is in anyway blocking the 
possibility to create a consolidated framework. As exactly we don't 
say, you should use HTML, XML, RDF, or any proprietary format to write 
a spec, but the final form of a spec must respect certain criterias. A 
spec in development per se does not respect the QA Spec GL, but the 
final form can.

So I said there's nothing in the QA Framework which forbids one model 
or another. You made it stricter than it is.

Yes and... You have a win-win situation for the OWL and RDF core WGs. 
Come to this CP, like the spec was test driven... the CP is by default 
filled.

You have won time
You have easily conformed to this CP.

It means that the QA Framework is easier to implement in a OWL type WG.
