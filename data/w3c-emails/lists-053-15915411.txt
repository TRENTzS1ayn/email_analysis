That's much better - I still disagree with it :), but that seems more a 
matter of opinion.

I would not object to such text. (I might have misunderstood the editor's 
draft division between normative and informative)

I agree it would have been low cost for both SW WGs to have conformed with 
that text, as long as 'partition' is understood as high-level partition 
rather than low-level. (I think that's the intent - later text seems to go 
for the detailed relationship between tests and test assertions).

In fact "each *high-level* logical 'partition'" might be appropriate text, 
with informative examples of high-level.

I look forward to the next WD of the test work.
