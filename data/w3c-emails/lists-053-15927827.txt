I've got an opportunity to do some fun family
stuff this Friday, so I'd like to know whether
it conflicts with an RDF Core telcon.

I haven't seen notice, and we're less than 7
days away, so I presume there's no WG telcon this
week. Sorry if I missed an announcement to that
effect.

If the WG meets, I suppose it'll be somewhat unofficially.
In that case, I offer regrets.
