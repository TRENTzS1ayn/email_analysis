Personally I prefer not to discuss postponed issues (for new recs?) until 
we've got this one in the bag.

As HP rep the position I represented was we did not need to resolve these 
issues in this standardization round. For the next few weeks that remains 
the position I wish to represent.

When we get to rec, I have things that I individually think about the 
postponed issues and could contribute to a discussion.

Sorry for being so cautious.
