It looks like we need to make some minor revisions to the semantics doc. 
    DanC has asked for a WG decision to approve the change.

Eric, Sandro, will a decision at a telecon on 16 Jan 2004 be timely from 
your point of view?

I think what we need is a clear description of the proposed changes for 
review.  Pat, I see a proposal from you at:
 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2004JanMar/thread.html

Have you and Herman agreed to this?  I see Graham has reviewed it and is 
happy with it.

If anyone has issues with approving this change, please raise them asap.

Brian
