It would only be too late if it were this coming December 31.  As it is, 
I have your good wishes (thanks!) for the rest of the year (too late for 
the part of January that's gone by already though;  I've got tendonitis 
from shoveling snow!).

BTW:  Happy New Year all!

OK.  I should have the corrections uploaded sometime Tuesday (there'll 
be a new file for the corrected figure as well).
