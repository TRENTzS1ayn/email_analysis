I've just looked through Frank's proposed changes w.r.t. [1] and agree that 
they are (a) editorial, and (b) desirable.  (With a clarification about fig 
18.)

It's not clear to me which way this should be, but I agree it's minor 
editorial.

Then the arrows should point upwards?  Then I agree this is just editorial.

Agree.

Agree.
