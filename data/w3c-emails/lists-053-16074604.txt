Well, not really.  Two OWL classes can have the same extension without
being the ``same'' class.  (At least for some definition of ``same''.)

> Does Owl strengthen the interpretation of rdfs:subClassOf?  

OWL does strengthen rdfs:subClassOf so that in an OWL interpretation if the
extension of A is a subset of the extension of B then A rdfs:subClassOf B.
See Section 5.2 of OWL S&AS for details.

Well, just about any RDF graph modifies the interpretation of the RDF
core vocbulary.  For example the RDF graph that contains

:A rdfs:subClassOf :B

modifies the interpretation of rdfs:subClassOf.
