The corrected version of the Primer PR is now available off the 
"editor's draft" link on the WG home page.  All I've done is make the 
set of changes I noted in my earlier message (less the change in Section 
3.3 I decided was unnecessary after reading Graham's comments);  I 
didn't add bullets for these changes to the Changes Appendix, change the 
title to an Editor's Draft, etc.

Also please note that there are two files involved:  the main .html 
file, and a new file vehicleClassesJan12.png representing the updated 
figure (the old file was fig17dec16.png).
