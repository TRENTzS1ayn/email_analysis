Subject: RE: editorial corrections to Primer PR

Hi Frank,

I hope its not too late to wish you a Happy New Year.

These all look like straightforward typo fixes to me.

I suggest:

   - prepare a corrected version of the document
   - we run a diff to check whats changed
   - As these are just typos, I'll review them
   - we can take a formal decision to approve the changes at this weeks
telecon
   - and offer them to the director for publication as a rec

DanC - that work for you?

Brian

ps: +1 on steadfastness
