Pat--

I've started to go through the Semantics document based on this thread 
arising, and am finding a few additional typos.  Referring to the 
document at the URL cited below,

* Section 1.4, semantic conditions for ground graphs, the 5th cell, 
shouldn't it be I(p) is in IP rather than I(ppp) is in IP?  (I don't see 
ppp defined anyplace).

*  Section 2.1, the first sentence: change "the particular meaning of 
any of any of the names" to "the particular meaning of any of the names"

I'm still going through the document, and so may find others.
