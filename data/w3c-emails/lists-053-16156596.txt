All agreed, if reluctantly.

Uptodate heads-up: the suggested changes have been greatly reduced 
and do not affect any semantics or entailments. They amount to a 
small correction to a mathematical slip, noted by Herman, in the way 
that D-interpretations were defined (the vocabulary was described 
slightly wrongly, and one of the conditions is superfluous.) See the 
proposed changes now at 
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_2004bb.html#defDinterp.

In case you don't see, they are:
-- the extra condition on the vocabulary of the interpretation
-- omission of 'and a subset of LV' in the second line of the table
-- adding 'and IL("sss"^^ddd) is in LV ' to the third line of the 
table (which is not strictly required but helps clarify things)
-- five paragraphs later, adding the sentence 'Since this is an 
rdfs-interpretation, it follows that all elements of the value space 
of any datatype in D must be literal values.', referring to the 
fourth condition. (See the last RDFS semantic condition and recall 
that ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) = LV. )

Apart from some typo corrections, this is all.
