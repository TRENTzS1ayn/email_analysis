Glad to see your conclusions :) and I agree and prefer
http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_2004bb.html#defDinterp

It was actually good to see some test cases in the discussion
(good for fixing running code bugs :))

Gentlemen, I apologize for setting off a rocket in a firework store.  I
guess I asked for a yes/no decision and I got a decisive no.

This is just to reassure you that I have backed off from the original
suggested change, and so y'all can breathe more easily and kind of relax.
The current proposal really, really makes no substantial changes to the
semantics, does not impact OWL or any entailments or test cases, and is
only a small correction to a slight mathematical slip in the way that the
datatype conditions were stated.  Really.

There are two versions of it. This one

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_2004bb.html#defDinterp

is in my view the clearest exposition.  On the other hand

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_2004bc.html#defDinterp

makes the fewest changes to the PR text so may be preferable for logistical
reasons. This only adds the extra vocabulary condition, nothing else.

Apart from typo corrections, all the changes are in section 5.1 between "if
D is a datatype map, a D-interpretation..." and (in the first case) the
table and the paragraph below starting "The fourth condition ensures...".
They are formally exactly equivalent, but it takes a bit of work to find
out (you have to check through the RDFS semantic conditions.)

Pat
