Peter,

re http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0233.html

Thanks for your comments on our suggested closure of this issue. I have an 
action from RDFCore's June 6th meeting[1] to ask whether there are specific 
textual changes to the RDFS document that you would prefer. If you could offer 
some suggestions, perhaps we can find a way of closing this issue.

Thanks,

Dan
