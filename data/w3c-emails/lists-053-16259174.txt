7: Approving minutes of this meeting

Given that there may be significant gaps between telecons in future, the
chair proposes to approve the minutes of telecons by email.  Draft minutes
will be circulated by  email as normal.  A chair will call for review of the
minutes.  The minutes will be approved subject to positive review and no
objections being sent within three days of publication of the draft.

8: AC Review Status

9: Proposed minor Changes to Primer Document

I interpret Frank as proposing:

PROPOSAL: The RDFCore WG recommends to the director that the minor editorial
fixes described in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2004Jan/0029.html

should be included in the version of the RDFCore Primer which is published
as a rec.  The PR document with the fixes applied can be found at:

10:  Proposed Expository Changes to the Semantics document

I interpret Pat as proposing:

PROPOSAL: The RDFCore recommends to the director that expository
improvements should be made to the RDF semantics document before it is
published as a rec.  An updated version of the PR document can be found at:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/

[[Pat this is the ed-be version you prefer - would be good to confirm I
uploaded it correctly]]
