Herman, Peter,

After the flurry of recent discussion about the semantics doc, there is a
proposal to RDFCore to consider a minor expositional change to the document
along with some fixes to types.

This proposal is made in the agenda for Friday's telecon, agenda item 10 of

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2004Jan/0053.html

I would be grateful if you would look at these changes and say that they are
acceptable to you.

Brian
