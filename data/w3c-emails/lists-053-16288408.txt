Meta-level remarks:  In order to avoid disappointing anyone, the 
following are *not* "suggested changes" to any document whatsoever, 
merely facts that I've discovered that might be of interest to some 
member of the WG.  I'm reading the Semantics document for my own 
reasons, and thought it might be useful to document any typos I've found 
(I'm not through the document yet).  Far be it from me to suggest that 
anyone might fix them;  put them on a list to fix later maybe :-)

Object-level remarks:

I've found a couple more typos in the Semantics document (I checked both 
the PR and http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_2004bc.html and 
they're in both).

*  Near the start of section 4.1, in the paragraph that starts "Although 
not strictly necessary...", the 4th sentence says "...the first two 
conditions in the table of RDFS semantic condiions...":  condiions --> 
conditions

*  Right at the end of section 4.1, in the example illustrating an RDFS 
contradiction, in the first line, the XMLLiteral has an unmatched angle 
bracket.
