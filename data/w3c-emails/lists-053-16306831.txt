I'm going on fixing up my copy just for a sense of personal 
satisfaction, but the version I'll fix up will be called 2004bcc, so 
2004bc will still produce the same htmldiff.

er...yes, its supposed to be unmatched, that's why its an illegal XML

why its important to get all the real typos out, though.)
