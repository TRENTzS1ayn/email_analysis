Brian,

I am the HP rep, you are the chair - these are distinct roles, and I intend to 
continue to represent HP.

If you believe that I am failing to do so, may I suggest contacting Martin 
Merry or Jim Bell in preference to messages to the working group.

I would prefer to see the claim to completeness weakened e.g. "It is 
conjectured that these rules are complete."

IMO a complete set of rules, in the recommendation is more useful than either 
an incomplete set of rules or a set of rules not in the recommendation.

It is possible that the rules in the current draft are incomplete, and this 
may become apparant shortly after we go to rec. In such a case I would like 
to see an erratum with an additional rule (if possible). It is not clear that 
such an erratum would be justified without some sort of claim to 
completeness.

I am reading the current editors draft at the moment, and will be able to give 
a more considered opinion once I have finished.

Jeremy
