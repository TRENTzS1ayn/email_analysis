Aaron, thanks.  Er, I think you mean:

   http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-03.xml

The "recent innovation" is not (as I understand it) an official policy, and 
may be relatively recent, but what I take to be a recognition on the RFC 
editors' part that XML2RFC saves them work in putting the document into 
nroff format (see [1]).  Marshall Rose has put a fair amount of effort into 
making the XML2RFC output compliant with their editorial policy.  (Now, if 
we had a version that would generate W3C pubrules-compliant HTML ;-)
