The changes are acceptable, although the suggestion has not 
been adopted not to require all values of a datatype in a 
D-interpretation,
to bring the definition of D-interpretation more in line with the rest 
of the RDF Semantics document, and to allow a completeness lemma for 
D-entailment.

The small error that I noted in the definition of D-interpretation
(in connection with the vocabulary formed by the datatype URIs in D)
has been corrected, in an elegant way.
