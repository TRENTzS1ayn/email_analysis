I note that the suggestion to not require all values of a datatype in a
D-interpretation, which has not been adopted, makes noticeable, significant,
and negative changes to D-entailment.   I see no reason that there could
not be a completeness lemma for D-entailment under the current model theory
for RDF datatyping.
