I have reviewed the proposed changes and I support them.

I would marginally prefer a slightly more explicit word than "Following" in 
the change log, sentence:

"Following comments by ter Horst , the definition of D-interpretation has 
been re-worded."

my (tiny) concern being that the re-wording follows Herman's comment in 
time but not in substance.

Possible rewording would be

s/Following/After considering/

If the editor or chairs do not wish us to consider this change that is no 
problem.

Jeremy
