This is correct, with one exception:  After considering Graham's 
comments, I decided not to make one of the corrections listed in my 
original message (the third bullet, changing an "is" to "are").  As a 
result, the list of editorial corrections actually included in "the PR 
document with the fixes applied" cited in the agenda (and reflected in 
the diff cited in the agenda) is:

*  in the TOC, sections 5.1 and 5.2 need to have "Defining" replaced by 
"Describing" to be consistent with the actual section titles.

*  in Section 2.2, there are two instances of "example.com" that need to 
be changed to "example.org" to be consistent with the overall example

*  in Section 5.1, Figure 18 is upside down (class MotorVehicle should 
be at the top, not the bottom).  This was fixed early last year in 
response to a comment from PPS, but somehow an earlier version of the 
figure got loaded into TR space and I missed it.  This is just a matter 
of re-uploading the corrected figure.

*  in Section 6.1, just above Example 32, there's a reference to Example 
  30 that should be a reference to Example 31.

*  in the References, the [LBASE] reference has the right URL but the 
wrong date (it should cite the 10 October 2003 version).


[I'd also note that another reason Figure 18 needs to be changed as 
described above is for consistency with change entry for LCC-016, which 
says it was changed to have the more general classes on top.]
