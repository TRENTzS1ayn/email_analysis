Please do not reply to this message.

I have removed all documents from my public website which look 
anything like a W3C official document.
All the URLs in the  email archive referring to 'editors' versions of 
the semantics document for the past 9 months or so will now take you 
to an  explanatory document which points to what I devoutly hope will 
be the final version, archived at

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-rdf-mt-20031215/

If anyone wishes to check any details, all the original documents are 
available, but they should now be of interest only to a particularly 
obsessive kind of historian.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to getting this done.

Pat Hayes
