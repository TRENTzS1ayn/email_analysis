This is a review of:

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_append.html

(no apparant unique-id)

My review is in a number of parts.
This part is restricted to XMLLiteral.

I start with a question: your treatment of the relationship between URIs and 
datatypes is somewhat more thorough than that inc concepts.

Are the following two phrases from concepts OK or should they be changed:

a) 

"A datatype is identified by a URI."

b)
concerning XMLLiteral

"The datatype URI
is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral."

possible change to a) is e.g.
"A datatype may be identified by one or more URI references"

possible change to b) is e.g.

"A datatype URI reference
is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral."
or
"The preferred URI reference 
is ..."

====

The value space of XMLLiteral is not XML documents but exclusive Canonical XML 
(see latest concepts editors draft) ... you've done pretty well given the 
lack of clarity I have given you.

Suggest global substitute 
  s/XML document/XML data/
(problem with actual making this change is if we are going to go back and 
accept I18N desire to keep the lang-tag - the easiest way to do that now 
would be in RDF/XML Syntax, which would then make it go back from XML data to 
XML document - I hope we can close this on Friday).

Also the reference

[XML-C14N]
Canonical XML, Boyer, J. W3C Recommendation, March 2001.

should be replaced by


[XML-XC14N] 
Exclusive XML Canonicalization Version 1.0, J. Boyer, D.E. Eastlake 3rd, J. 
Reagle, Authors/Editors. W3C Recommendation. World Wide Web Consortium, 18 
July 2002. This version of Exclusive XML Canonicalization is 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718. The latest version of 
Canonical XML is at http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n.

I will detail this global substitution, and other points in order in the file, 
searching for XML, also refering to my paper copy with scribbles:

a) in change log last line, suggest s/XML documents/XML data/
b) 0.2 first para
s/XML document corresponding to/XML data corresponding to/
and change link from #section-XMLLiteral to
#XMLLiteral-mapping
(if you agree, I will add at that definition -
  "(This is referred to as the *XML data corresponding to* the string)."
c) end of 1.2 @@ text
suggest
[[which is considered to denote exclusive canonical XML 
[XML-XC14N] (hereafter "XML data")
corresponding to the string in the typed literal;]]

d) section 3. third para s/XML document/XML data/ (three times)

Note: following the links to exclusive canonical XML makes it clear that 
exclusive canonical XML is octet sequences, not sequences of character codes, 
so we could decide to make a call concerning this agnosticism and go for them 
being different. I prefer not to.

e) section 3 in green box slightly lower down s/XML document/XML data/

f) suggest
"mis-typed XML literals" should be "ill-typed" (section 3 para after purple 
box)

g) section 5 para above purple box

 "contain <rdf:XMLliteral, x> where x is the built-in XML datatype"

suggest "built-in XML Literal datatype"

h) Appendix C - note I have not read this yet

s/XML document/XML data/ twice

i) section 5 first para
"It also includes a single built-in datatype XMLLiteral."
suggest 
"rdf:XMLLiteral"
