This does not seem to be the proper link: it is the PR version,
complete with the errors recently corrected in the RDFS entailment
lemma and the definition of D-interpretations.

Shouldn't it be the following link:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/  ?

Although this link contains the year 2003, it is the link
from the explanatory document that you mention above,
and from the editor's version on the RDF Core page;
this document does contain the corrections I just mentioned.
