Hi Eric

I understand that you are in charge of producing the rec documents.

This is a heads up that I am on holiday from next Friday for a week - I think 
I am unlikely to make the telecon. Thus if you want me to help with any 
changes needed to RDF Concepts then please let me know soon. 

In particular I note that in WebOnt I am being asked to use a consistent 
reference format for refs to OWL and RDF docs cf.

http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/swrefs.html

I am not aware of any changes required for concepts other than updating the 
references to the other RDF and OWL documents, and deleting the change log.

The informational reference to OWL Ref, could be, but need not be to the Rec.


Jeremy
