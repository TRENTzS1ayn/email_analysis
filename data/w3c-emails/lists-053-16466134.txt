I think the message below (which only explicitly asked about C024 - a 
personal comment) might also mark that the RDF Core comments have now been 
fully processed. (I suspect they will formally notify us soon - the 
comments are marked as "closed" which seems to be the stage before 
"notified").

See

http://www.w3.org/International/Group/2002/charmod-lc/SortByOriginator.html#C028

and on a bit.

The ones where we had comments that have not been wholly accepted are:

C029 - we suggested charmod was overly broad in scope, while this comment 
was not accepted, comment C035 was reluctantly accepted, which at least 
partially addresses our comment (IMO), by not making charmod mandatory for 
all W3C recs.

One thing that our initial comment reflects was concern about N-triple 
being a ASCII only language. We perhaps ought to review whether we would 
like I18N to make any more effort on that subissue.

C030 - we explicitly made an informative comment that we would not object 
about. They decided it was not helpful.

C031 - dependency on IRI. They accept the spirit of the comment, but not 
our suggestion. They say:
[[
       Rationale: Our plan is that the IRI ID, referenced in this section, 
will have been submitted for Proposed Standard by the time CharMod moves to 
the next stage. IRI equality is fully addressed in the latest IRI ID version.
]]

===

I suggest a response along the lines of:
[[
RDF Core has reviewed the current status of the comments C029, C030, C031.
We believe that our concerns under C029 are adequately addressed by the 
changes you have made in response to C035. We are disappointed but 
unsurprised that our comment C030 was not helpful. We are happy with your 
decision on C031 and look forward to both the IRI Proposed Standard and he 
Charmod Proposed Recommendation.
]]

although we might need to check the N-triple issue before saying this.
