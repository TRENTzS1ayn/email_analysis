I've had an brief exchange with Ned Freed (who is probably the concerned 
IETF area director in this matter) ... he has indicated a willingness to 
request IESG approval informational RFC publication -- this looks like the 
easiest path at this time.

I'm waiting for Aaron to reissue the draft with revised dates for the RDF 
documents, reflecting the PR publication date (as noted by Dave), at which 
point I'd seek the WG's agreement to request publication.
