I'll answer in two parts...

(1) I was pursuing what I understood the agreed goal of aiming for RFC 
publication to closely follow the PR specification.

(2) Should we wait for full recommendation?  Well, maybe.

My personal preference is to go for RFC publication ASAP, so that the gap 
between published MIME type registration and full W3C recommendation is 
minimized (preferably zero).  Among other things, this reduces the amount 
of WG "unfinished business" at the point of achieving REC status.  Also, 
with increasing use of RDF, I think we owe the world a proper MIME type 
registration as soon as possible.  Also, I think that if the specs go to 
REC while the document is in the RFC editor's queue we would find that 
changing the reference dates would be acceptable fix in the final 
publication process.

In summary, I see reasons to move quickly, and no compelling reasons to delay.

That said, if the group decides that it would prefer to delay publication 
until the RDF specifications go to REC, I won't put up a vigorous argument.
