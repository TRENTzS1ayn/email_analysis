 From the IETF announcement list:
   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf-announce/Current/msg28148.html

I'm not sure how this affects our MIME type registration... I need to read 
the revised spec more closely, and it may be a while until it is actually 
published as an RFC.  I suggest we get our own I-D in order, and review the 
situation at that point.
