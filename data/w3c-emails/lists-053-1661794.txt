I think it is low-to-zero risk, with the document in its present 
form.  For calibration, I think that our documents are now MUCH more 
thoroughly debugged than the published XML Schema part 2 documents.

BTW, I drafted the _append version before reading all the emails. The 
document simply makes no mention of completeness, but it would still 
be low-risk to add 2  sentences like:

" We believe that these rules are complete in the following sense: if 
S rdf(s)-entails E then there is a graph which can be derived from 
S+the rdf(+rdfs) axiomatic triples by these rules which simply 
entails E. However, this has not been conclusively established at the 
time of writing."

Note that this does not mention closures, so the question of whether 
or not they are finite does not come up.

This is done in a modified version:

dated 18a June

I will try to propose resolutions for the outstanding semantic issues 
asap, but I may have to get on a plane soon.
