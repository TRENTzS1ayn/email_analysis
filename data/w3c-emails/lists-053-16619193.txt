> - Rec docs sanity check

I am unavailable from tomorrow (telecon start time) to make any changes to
Concepts - until 9th Feb, which I hope will be too late.

Things which might be considered:

- deleting the change log
- updating the OWL and RDF references following Sandro's message to WebOnt.

I could do these before the telecon if someone asks me to do so today.
