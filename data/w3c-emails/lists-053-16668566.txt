In response to this, I've done another check of the Primer Editor's 
Draft (the pre-publication Recommendation version) and have found a few 
glitches (or possible glitches):

1.  The boilerplate just before the Abstract says "The English version 
of this specification is the only normative version."  But the Primer 
isn't normative.  Is this a problem?

2.  Similarly, under "Status of this Document", the second para says "It 
is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a 
normative reference from another document".  I know this is boilerplate, 
but once again, the Primer isn't normative.

3.  Under "Status of this Document", the URLs in the "set of six" cited 
are not the staged URIs, and so the global replace presumably won't find 
these.  NB: This also seems to be true of the other documents where this 
boilerplate is used (so far, I've seen it in Concepts and Syntax).

4.  "Status of this Document" only cites changes since the PR working 
draft.  (a) Are the other change log entries to be deleted?  (b) If so, 
there are anchors in the text that some of these entries point to (to 
highlight where the changes were made).  Should those anchors be removed 
or left in place (IOW, how clean do you want the source to be)?

5.  In Section 2.1 (and also in Appendix B) the URL that "Extensible 
Markup Language" points to is a dated version of the XML spec, but not 
the dated version cited in the references.  So the URL will have to 
either be updated or removed (leaving just the pointer to the [XML] 
reference).

6.  In the Normative References, the "cite" URL for RDF Concepts points 
to the 12/15 WD rather than being a staged URI, so the global replace 
won't find this.
