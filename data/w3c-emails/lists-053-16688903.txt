Aaron,

With the RDF publication as REC being so close now (aiming for 10 Feb), the 
working group has agreed (per telecon 2004-01-30) to hold off finally 
requesting MIME type registration until the registration document can 
contain references to the full recommendation documents.  Could you 
accordingly please submit the revised Internet-draft for publication when 
RDF is published as REC, containing references to the final published RDF 
documents?

Thanks.
