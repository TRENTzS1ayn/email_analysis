Just a quick word. I personally am quite happy with the semantics 
document being in the form it now is in, ie with the rules in an 
appendix and no lemma-style claims of completeness.  Just a note in 
case anyone was under the impression that I had buckled under 
unreasonable pressure, or was weeping silently among the mangroves, 
or anything like that.
