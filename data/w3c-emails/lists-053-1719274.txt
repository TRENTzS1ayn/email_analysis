Further small comment, suggest delete "at the time of writing this document" 
from section 5; that is always implicit - and you are talking about xsd 
version 1.0 datatypes not any futurue ones.


I've gone through the issue list to try and understand where the current 
editors draft sits, here's my thoughts:

NO impact.

RESOLVED: we accept comment pfps-05, and it is addressed by by rule rdfs1 
in section 4.2 of the Semantics editor's draft

more importantly: we no longer claim the entailment lemma.


pfps-07

complete change, comment still accepted, but now we no longer have the beasts.

RESOLVED: we accept comment pfps-08, and 3.4 in the semantics editors draft 
addresses it.

The section number has changed to 5, the detail minuted is still fine.

no change addressed by LV = ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal))  in section 4.

=================

Open Issues

horst-01
RDFS entailment lemma
none
raised
Herman Horst
none

does not seem to be addressed ...
other than by dropping the completeness claim.

pan-01
Extending to FOL
none
raised
Jeff Z Pan
none

hmmm ... we should have discussed this by now.
if we are going to accept even a little bit of it we have been heading in the 
wrong direction.



pfps-02
Lbase translation of XML Literals
none
raised
Peter F. Patel-Schneider
none

not considered.


pfps-04
RDF closure rules
none
raised
Peter F. Patel-Schneider
none

The specific example has been addressed by changes in XMLLiteral (in 
concepts).
The general problem has been addressed by dropping the claim to completeness.



pfps-06
typed XML literals and LV
none
raised
Peter F. Patel-Schneider
none

This comment is addressed both in section 3 green box and in section 5 green 
box.



pfps-09
datatypes
none
raised
Peter F. Patel-Schneider
none

I don't really understand the comment.
The current draft is better vis-a-vis URIs and datatypes - but RDF does not 
provide a mechanism for tying the two togther, and I can only sympathize with 
Peter.




qu-03
Ontology subset of RDFS
none
raised
Qu Yuzhong
none
