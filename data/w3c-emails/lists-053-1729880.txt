having read the comments list I will reproduce the proof.

>>Consider the RDF graph G:
>>   x rdf:type rdfs:Class .  (1)
>>   rdf:type rdfs:domain y . (2)

rdf:type rdf:type rdf:Property . (3 = 1 and rdf1)
rdf:type rdf:subPropertyOf rdf:type . (4 = 3 and rdfs5b)
rdfs:Resource rdfs:subClassOf y. (5 = 2,4, and 12a)
x rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Rersource . (6 = 1 rdfs7a)

>>   x rdfs:subClassOf y . (7 = 5, 6, rdfs8)

and the issue is addressed by the current editors draft.
