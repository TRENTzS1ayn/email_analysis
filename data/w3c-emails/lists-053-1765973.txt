That version suffers the following defects vis-a-vis simple completeness

<eg:a> <eg:b> <eg:a> .

entails

_:a <eg:b> _:b .

but this cannot be shown.

Similarly

_:a <eg:b> _:a .

entails

_:a <eg:b> _:b .


but this cannot be shown.

However your wording in msg

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0202

is, I believe, satisfactory.

...


The same phrase could be used to conjecture the completeness of the simple 
entailment rules.

Again, stylistically I dislike the phrase "at the time of writing" in the 
statement of your conjecture. (Take it or leave it)
