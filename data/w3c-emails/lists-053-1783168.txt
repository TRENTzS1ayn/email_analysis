"Datatype clashes and assertions that ill-typed literals are of type

are you sure - this sentence looks like a hostage to fortune, but I tend to 
agree with it.

Peter has pointed out the possibility of a datatype with empty value space - 
lets suppose we have one identified by eg:broken .

Then

<eg:a> rdf:type <eg:broken> .

is a contradiction, but is only a datatype clash with a rather generous 
reading of 'disjointness' in the defn of datatype clash.

I cannot see any other problems with empty datatypes - although the closure 
rules for datatypes are incomplete, but that is too difficult to fix.
