I have now republished with changes from Graham and Pat.

I think the current version is ready for WG review, although if Graham gets 
me any further changes before the telecon tomorrow I will include them.

I list the latest changes below (the very last one is possibly the most 
interesting, concerning synonyms for XMLLiteral).

Patrick:
 >>> "The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with
 >>>  XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes..."

Pat on datatypes:
 > That reads OK to me also as a first sentence, although you might want to
 > qualify it pretty quickly since we explicitly rule out some of the XMLS
 > datatypes as being incompatible.

I now have " ... is compatible with the abstraction used in XML Schema ..."

I also explicitly say at end

"[RDF-SEMANTICS] contains a more detailed discussion of specific XML Schema 
built-in datatypes."

If Pat could provide an anchor on the table of XSD datatypes then I would 
link directly to that.

gk:

 > should be revised to say something like
 > "... identifies the relationship between the things represented by the 
nodes it connects"

I did this and also changed from "the relationship" to "a relationship"


jeremy concerning semantics:

 >
 > "A datatype is identified by a URI."
 >
 > b)
 > concerning XMLLiteral
 >

 >
 > possible change to a) is e.g.
 > "A datatype may be identified by one or more URI references"

The new text is:
"A datatype is identified by one or more URI references"

which excludes a free floating datatype with no URI but makes no unique 
names assumption. I beleive this agrees with semantics.

 >
 > possible change to b) is e.g.
 >
 > "A datatype URI reference
 > is http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral."

 > is ..."
 >

The new text reads:
"A URI reference for identifying this datatype
is ..."

Brian reminds me:
 > 2002-11-22#5      jjc      check that RDF Concepts does not allow a
 > synonym for rdf:XMLLiteral


The text above is intended to allow a synonym, without actually saying so 
explicitly. If the WG believes this detail does need explicit text I have a 
weak preference for it to go in semantics.
