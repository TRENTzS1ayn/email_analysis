This is very much a strawman - intended to provoke suggestions for 
improvement.

I18N made two post call comments.

The comment makes two points.

Regarding the first:

JJC has proposed that the value space of XML literal is not a character 
string, and thus (if that proposal is accepted) the point is moot.

Regarding the second:

If the user wishes to have a language tagged string without markup, they 
  should use a plain literal.

We accept that the recent change to require that language tags be 
represented explicitly within an XML fragment is less convenient. 
However, we believe that this is outweighed by the confusion that is 
likely if xml literal is made a special case.  We note that we received 
feedback prior to last call requesting that xml literal be treated as a 
datatype.  We note that the value space of the datatype is a fragment of 
canonical XML and the canonicalization spec supports the RDFCore 
position that a surrounding lang tag is not part of a canonicalized XML 
fragment.
