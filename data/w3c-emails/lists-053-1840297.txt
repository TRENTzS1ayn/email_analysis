Once again, we have to reschedule.  There has apparently been some 
informal discussion based on have documents ready for the next step by 
14 Jul.  We also have to take a view on what the next step is.

What remains to be done?

- complete process on oustanding last call comments:

   primer all done
   syntax all done
   concepts 11 with resolutions but no response to commenter
   schema 2 with no resolution
   semantics 7 with no resolution, 6 no response to commentor
   test cases - 1 without resolution

There is a not inconsiderable amount of work to be done on this.  It is 
unknown whether commentors will be satisfied and futher discussion needed.

- Documents

   - What is the current status?  My understanding:

     - primer    - unknown
     - syntax    - nearly ready
     - concepts  - nearly ready
     - schema    - unchanged from last call
     - semantics - nearly ready
     - test cases - unchanged since last call

However, all the 'nearly ready' are at risk whilst we have outstanding 
issues.

- Decide what the next step should be

- Review document changes

- Update the issues list

- Prepare request to advance

I note also that we are nearly into the holiday season when progress 
will inevitably slow down.  I also note

I would appreciate commitments from the editors about when:

   - the last call comments process will be completed for their document
   - Documents ready for the next step will be ready
