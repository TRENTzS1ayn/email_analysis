I tend to focus on this.
Hmm... you did a draft, no? I can't find it from
the WG home page.

Ah... from a CG agenda... but I see it's world-readable...

For WebOnt, I'm just changed the top item in
our "current events" from last call to the preparation
of our request...
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/rqim.html

So every week, I look at what's missing from that request,
and I try to get it done or get it on the telcon agenda.
