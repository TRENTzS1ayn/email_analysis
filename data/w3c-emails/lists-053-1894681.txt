assuming no pollution from other documents, I am expecting we will agree your 
proposal on the I18N comment tomorrow. I will update the document in light of 
any comments made at the telecon tomorrow and then Graham and I can respond 
to the commentators. (I believe it is Graham to respond to Peter on all 
issues, and I can do the others).
