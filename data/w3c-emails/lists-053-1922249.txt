Trying to nudge the process along a bit - Pat - shout if this is barmy.

In this comment:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#horst-01

Herman makes a couple of points:

   1) a specific example of incompleteness of the (then) closure rules
   2) a general concern about the completeness of the closure rules, 
suggesting that the claim be weaked to apply only to a specific class of 
RDF graphs.

I propose that:

The WG resolves:

The specific example pointed out is covered by the closure rules in the 
current document as in:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0119.html

The present editors draft no longer claims completeness of the closure 
rules.

That this comment be closed.

Actions Arising:

   bwm update the official ed's draft in shadow TR space
   ??? respond to Herman
