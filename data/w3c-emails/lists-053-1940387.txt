Semantics issue

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#qu-03

was summarized by Pat in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0318.html

as

[[
There is a class of languages called 'ontology languages'.
Considered as an ontology language, RDFS provides too much expressive
power, and the extra power is inappropriate for an ontology language.
Therefore, it would be desirable if a subset of RDFS could be
identified which conforms to the requirements for an ontology
language (by imposing constraints on the ability to define classes of
classes, classes of properties and properties of classes, as outlined
later in your message.)
]]

This co-chair states that the RDFCore WG was chartered to complete the 
work on RDF Schema.  The definition of subsets of RDF Schema for 
particular purposes is out of scope for this WG.

Propose the WG resolve:

o This comment is not accepted on the grounds it is out of scope and the 
WG does not have the resources to take on this additional task.
