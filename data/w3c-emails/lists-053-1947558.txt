I wrote

Also w.r.t. to the test case document I believe that
I already mentioned that
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest.rdf#language-and-xml-literal
is now a PET (PositiveEntailmentTest) according to
our resolution that
  Language tags *don't* affect the denotation of an rdf:XMLLiteral


Other than that, I haven't found other test case document issues.
