This is in response to an editorial comment from XML Schema WG; I will
double check (their comment was about the term "root element tag")

"maps a string to the corresponding exclusive Canonical XML "

click though on exclusive canonical XML to
"XML that is in exclusive canonical form"
look up to see that

"The exclusive canonical form of a document subset is a physical
representation of the XPath node-set, as an octet sequence, produced by the
method described in this specification"

i.e. the value space of XMLLiteral is a set of octet sequences whereas the
lexical space is a set of strings (character) sequences.

I pass on whether { 173 } is both a character sequence and an octet
sequence.
ditto for {} (which is exclusive canonical XML if it is an octet sequence)

Hmmm ... I think that's trying to jump ahead of rfc2396bis - and basically
given the state of the TAG issue IRI Everywhere, we should really only be
treading water.
