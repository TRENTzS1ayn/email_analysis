10: value space of rdf:XMLLiteral
See:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0101.html
Discussion of this item started, we then jumped to item 13, (for most of the
telecon), we then came back and completed this item.
The initial discussion presented jjc's proposed definition of value space,
duplicating:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0150

** after discussion of item 13
15:15:00 <jjcscribe> back to value space of XMLLiteral

discussion included
XML equality is not hard, rather too easy, lots of answers.
We had the requirement to have equality over XML. The specs of the
consortium that had this were the c14n specs; so that's the basis of our
design.

JJC proposes, Jos seconds:
"The value space of XML literals is a set of exclusively canonicalized XML"
no abstentions, no opposition.
RESOLVED


13: Post last call comment from I18N

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0025.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0023.html
see:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0132.html

A lot of discussion (56 minutes).

Highlights from IRC:

I18N msg treatment of parseType="Literal" should be dependent on  whether
there is XML markup (excluding entities) inside string.
DanC suggests folliowng I18N suggestion.

A change to the parser - parseType="Literal" with no embedded mark-up
generates plain literal.

Can we reject this on the grounds of lateness?

*is* XML a tree structure, or does in *encode* a tree structure

Does distinguishing XML and non-XML conflict with not distinguishing text
from an identical text?

Consider <prop parseType="Literal">foo &amp; bar </> vs <prop>foo &amp;
bar</>

danc: the I18N group has not convinced RDF Core.

I had this on an agenda with tim ...

Is this information consistent with cannes? No, it is not.

ACTION em get W3c mgmt feedback on I18N issue
ACTION jjc Dig out cannes minutes
ACTION danc give feedback to martin d?rst

primer aims to be ready 1st July
concepts is ready
syntax is, or will be ready
schema waiting on peter a bit

discussion of completeness claim in semantics
discussion of normativity of entailment rules

no one spoke in favour of dropping the entailment rules

completeness remains.
However, no formal decision was made.
