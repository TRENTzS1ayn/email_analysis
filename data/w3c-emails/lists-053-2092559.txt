Having discussed this minute with Dave Reynolds, who leads on the Jena RDFS 
implementation, I now express what will pass for the HP opinion, which 
comes to a mild preference for the treatment in the current editors draft 
over the changes discussed in this minute.

It seems like rather a big change to make at this late stage. Would you be 
confident there weren't other properties that need to be declared by fiat 
that haven't yet been identified?

A further advantage is that it may make it less likely that someone will 
find an additional corner case like ter Horst's.

This rules may be a nuisance but they are not a major obstacle.
They don't look difficult or expensive to implement.

Given that the result of the rewrite would be, in some sense,
less clean I would think it would need some additional motivation than just
moving a couple of obscure rules slightly further down in the appendix.
