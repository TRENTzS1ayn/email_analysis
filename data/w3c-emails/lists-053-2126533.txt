I've updated the things I forgot last time (!) and now checked that I
record all the LC issues, even those that required no actual word
changes.

This version should be stable for reviewing (hint hint).  Since I'm on
vacation for the next three telcons - this also serves as my regrets for
the telcons till 11 July (inclusive). I'm likely emailable over that
period, definitely will be in the last week.
