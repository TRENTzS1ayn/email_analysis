Guys, I now have connectivity.

I have been working on a version of the semantics doc along the lines 
several of us discussed after last Friday's telecon. It is still 
incomplete, but I will keep a version here:

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html

I hope it will be reasonably final by Friday, though I may not have 
the proofs written out until early next week. At the time of sending 
this email, only section 4 has been rewritten and that not fully; the 
rule section hasnt been done yet.

In this, *all* the RDF/S semantic conditions are 'if' not 'iff', so 
the correspondence to the rules will be easy to establish, and the 
relevant closure lemmas easy to prove. The only extra condition added 
is that all classes are subclasses of rdfs:Resource, which I think is 
needed to make sense of the 'empty' domain and range conditions, and 
in any case is handled fully by rdfs 7a

The complete RDFS rules are now rdfs 1, 2, 3,4a,4b,6, 7a, 9,10,11; 
the correspondence to the semantic conditions is very clear.

I plan to discuss the 'extensional' versions and mention the extra 
rules they sanction (5,7b,8,12) but without any claim of 
completeness. Thus, the overall content will be similar to the last 
version except that a simple basic RDFS rule set can be complete and 
included in the normative spec in the way that will make DanC's heart 
lighter.
