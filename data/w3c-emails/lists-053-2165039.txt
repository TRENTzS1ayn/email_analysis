The main outstanding edits needed for schema are some tweaks to
rdf:List vocab's description, per thread w/ Peter. I didn't get those 
done last night, will have to be next week now. Everything I have done 
is committed to CVS under shadow TR space. Regrets for tommorrow's call 
(Brian and Eric already knew); I'll catch up with things next week.
