I've updated the N-Triples section of the test cases editor's draft
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-testcases-20030117/#ntriples
for changes after the last call version.

The only significant thing was removing language from typed literals.
I also did some editorial changes and hope that the mapping of
N-Triples  to RDF concepts is useful and the new way of explaining
the N-Triples escapes is clearer.

The details of the changes are as usual in the changes section:
