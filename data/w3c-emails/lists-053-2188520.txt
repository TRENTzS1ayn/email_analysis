Yes I put in rdfs12a and 12b this morning to confirm it could be done, 
though I haven't checked the changes into CVS.

Approximate effort:
   - 5 mins to enter rules and have code ready to run
   - 10 mins to enter a test case and add it to harness
   - 5-10 mins to track down three typos in my test case data!
