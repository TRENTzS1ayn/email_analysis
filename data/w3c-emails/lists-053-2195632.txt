CC/PP have responsed to the the last call comments we sent them.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-mobile/2003May/0008.html

I've checked the response and they have dealt with our comments to my
satisfaction.

I'll be putting an agenda item on tomorrows telecon so that we can
formally respond.

Please review the responses.

Brian
