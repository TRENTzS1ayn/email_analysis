10: Issue horst-01
 http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#horst-01

We seem to have two proposals for resolving this:

  a) change the closure rules
  b) change the semantics

Hopefully we will have an analysis of the pro's and cons of each by the
telecon.  It would be good to choose.

11: Issue qu-03
Discuss:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0145.html
             


12: Schedule
I suggest our current priorities are:

  - resolve outstanding comments
  - complete the responses to commentors
  - get the docs finished and reviewed

Which docs ready for review?

  - syntax?
  - concepts?
  - test cases?
  - more?
