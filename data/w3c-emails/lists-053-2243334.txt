I'd like to be sure we understand the relationship of rdfs:subClassOf to
Owl.  As I understand things, the intent is that Owl would retain
extensional semantics.  Is that correct.

If so, then Owl want a stronger notion of subClassOf than that proposed
in this document for rdfs:subClassOf. 

Would that meant that the 'correct' thing for WEBONT to do would be to
define owl:subClassOf as a subproperty of rdfs:subClassOf?
