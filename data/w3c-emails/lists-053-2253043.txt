I'd like to see a table of factual pro's and cons - separated from the
rhetoric - to enable that decision.  If folks send in their views, I'll
try to synthesize one before the telecon, if no-one beats me to it.

Nonetheless the WG did endorse the decision by going to last call.  The
issue on the table, as far as I'm concerned is dealing with horst-01. 
horst-01 is about the incompleteness of the closure rules with respect
to the MT.

In considering changing it we might consider the effect on those users
who do grok MT.  In particular I have in mind being clear about the
effect on Owl.
