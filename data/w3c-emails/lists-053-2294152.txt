also regrets (whole day meeting in Munich)
real regrets on the MT topic
(well, I've a Management Team meeting in Munich,
but that's different stuff)
I've done tests with
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/rdfs-rules.n3
also including Jeremy's suggestion to have
rdfs12a and b cases for rdfs:domain and rdfs:range
and those test results were to my satisfaction
(also running the OWL testcases).
