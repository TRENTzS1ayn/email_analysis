we use them as simple Horn rules to get evidence
for the case


rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subPropertyOf :xcd.
:xcd rdfs:domain :ycd.
rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subPropertyOf :xcr.
:xcr rdfs:range :ycr.
rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:subPropertyOf :xpd.
:xpd rdfs:domain :ypd.
rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:subPropertyOf :xpr.
:xpr rdfs:range :ypr.

RDFS-entails

rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf :ycd.
rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf :ycr.
rdf:Property rdfs:subClassOf :ypd.
rdf:Property rdfs:subClassOf :ypr.


but this is of course not a sufficient
way to derive rdfs:subClassOf triples
(there are many other ways in owl...)
