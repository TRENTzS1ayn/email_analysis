Yes: at elast, OWL Dl certainly will. I am not sure about OWL Full as 
Peter has defined it.

It will want to impose stronger conditions on the meaning of that term, yes.

I no longer have any firm idea what 'correct' means in the W3C WG 
land. We defined the notion of 'semantic extension' carefully so that 
things like OWL could impose stronger conditions on RDFS vocabulary 
meanings as long as they didn't contradict the RDFS meanings. OWL 
already does this for domain and range, for example, and nobody seems 
to find that odd. It can do similarly for subClass and subProperty, 
seems to me, on a similar basis.
