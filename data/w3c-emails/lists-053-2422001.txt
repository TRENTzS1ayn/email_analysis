Ah, s'ok. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that Brian's use of
entailment notation is wrong here. Certainly you can _conclude_ using
OWL (various flavours) that the owl subclass applies when you can't
rdfs-conclude the equivalent relationship. however, if c1 owl:sco c2
then c1 rdfs:sco c2 is entailed, surely, because of what "entails" means
(all satisfying interpretations of the first MUST satisfy the latter).
Right?
