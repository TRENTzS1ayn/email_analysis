Speaking for myself, and my understanding of our discussion...

What I found "distasteful" was the suggestion that one would have to look 
*inside* the content of a literal to figure out what type it is.  In 
discussion, I understood the request to be for:

[[
<dc:title rdf:parseType='Literal'>
   A Midsummer Night's Dream
</dc:title>
]]

to denote a plain string literal, but

[[
<dc:title rdf:parseType='Literal'>
   <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>
</dc:title>
]]

to be a completely different kind of literal denoting an XML document in 
some way (because of the presence of markup).

(I originally read Martin's note to suggest that an XML document is itself 
just a string of Unicode characters, not distinguished from non-XML 
strings.  That is a position I could support but with which others have 
expressed concerns.)
