Hello Dan, others,

Below some more on denotations vs. graphs.

While I still don't want to claim any kind of knowledge
about denotations, I think that I seem to remember that
in the last call draft, in the graph and in N-triples, all
types had language attached, but the denotation said that
language was only relevant for the special type used to
represent XML literals.

This seemed to have confused a lot of people, to the extent
that the RDF Core WG decided to fix it. (Unfortunately, rather
than actually fixing it by removing the language information
in the graph from all types except the one used to represent
XML literals, they threw out the baby with the bathwater and
removed it everywhere.) If differences between the graphs and
the denotations cause this kind of confusion, it seems that
it would be much better to be avoided.

[What are the other kinds of cases where the graphs and the
denotations are different?]


Regards,    Martin.
