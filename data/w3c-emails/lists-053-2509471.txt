Hmm this point is overlaboured.
In abstract:
[[
RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax defines an abstract syntax on which RDF is 
based, and which serves to link its concrete syntax to its formal semantics.
]]

In section 1
[[
This document defines an abstract syntax on which RDF is based, and which 
serves to link its concrete syntax to its formal semantics.

]]

In section 1.1
[[
RDF's abstract syntax is a graph, which can be serialized using XML (but 
which is quite distinct from XML's tree-based infoset [XML-INFOSET]). The 
abstract syntax captures the fundamental structure of RDF, independently of 
any concrete syntax used for serialization. The formal semantics of RDF are 
defined in terms of the abstract syntax.
]]

The 1.1 comment then leads into text about XMLLiteral, which resonates a 
little with the infoset reference. It would probably be better to not 
delete it altogether:

**TODO
How about deleting the quoted text from 1.1 and changing the 1 text to
[[
This document defines an abstract syntax on which RDF is based, and which 
serves to link its concrete syntax to its formal semantics.
This
abstract syntax is quite distinct from XML's tree-based infoset [XML-INFOSET].

Replaced "a set of strings." by "a set of Unicode [UNICODE] strings."
to mirror the phrase used in the defn of the lexical form of a literal.

rejected. I prefer the strict correctness of the text "one or more"

correct - I have checked, and the term does use "tag" so I have corrected 
this. Now "when embedded between an arbitrary XML start tag and an end tag"

I hate to suggest it but, how about:

** TODO
Note: the lexical space and value spaces differ in that
the lexical space is a set of Unicode strings, whereas the value
space is a set of UTF-8 octet sequences.

Otherwise leaving the text unchanged so that the same text is used to talk 
about the lexical space and the value space.

No changes made - this area is a mess I look forward to being able to defer 
to IRI spec as an erratum - we got through last call with the current text 
- I agree it is fragile.

I prefer to leave it, since it emphasises that a typed literal is different 
from a plain literal with a language tag not only because RFC 3066 is a 
different set of strings from URIs, but because the second component has a 
different name.

I will delete the phrase "how to best represent typed data to the end-user" 
since this note originally related to abuse of the langauge tag in typed 
literals.

No. I feel that expanding this e.g. "(no two have a common member)" will 
not really make it any more accessible. Someone who struggles with this 
phrase is best off looking for another source of info e.g. google for 
"pairwise disjoint"

OK
WIth some simplification of the wording which is somewhat redundant in that 
position.
