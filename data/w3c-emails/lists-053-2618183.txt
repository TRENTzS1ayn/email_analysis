I'll note that while the issue of using exc-c14n arose out of my Last Call 
comments,  I haven't insisted on use of exc-c14n. I merely noted that the 
specs specified c14n in some places, and exc-c14n in others and asked they 
be consisted and recommended exc-c14 [1,2]. exc-c14n seems to be the 
preferred choice now-a-days since it permits subsets of XML to be easily be 
moved beyond contexts and it can be implemented a bit more easily. The ease 
comes from the fact that the ancestor nodes of the subset don't have to be 
crawled (or kept while parsed) to get ancestor xml attributes (e.g., 
xml:lang). (Ancestor namespace declarations are always in a descendent's 
axis, but xml attributes must be crawled.) However, I also resisted calls 
for c14n to be completely deprecated. If people care about context, it's a 
good choice for them.

Right, this is suggested in:

XML is sufficiently complex beast that I've felt that there will never be a 
perfect "canonical" representation. I'd like if XML were simple enough that 
there could be, but until then, the serialization is really an applications 
decision, and our goals was to provide a sufficiently expressive and small 
set of serializations that met the majority of the applications 
requirements. In this case you can use:
1. c14n
2. exc-c14n and do a "apex node" restatement
3. exc-c14n and forget the xml attributes
