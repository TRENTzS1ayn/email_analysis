Dear RDF WG,

I'm writing this email to discharge two action items, one from
the I18N WG and another from the MIT team meeting.
Both of these action items relate to N-Triples.


 From the I18N WG
----------------

[Compared with the other issues that are currently being discussed,
this may be a detail]
The I18N WG (Core TF) has looked at the escaping conventions
for N-Triples at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntrip_strings.

We do not think it is a good idea to have more escaping than
necessary. This only introduces additional uncertainties.
It would be better if N-Triples used UTF-8 directly, therewith
not testing any escaping conventions, but only the actual RDF
statements and entailments.


 From the MIT team meeting
-------------------------

The question came up from a team member whether there was a
difference between N-Triples and N3. It was pointed out that
a quite probable way to read "N3" is as 'n-triple' (rather than
as 'n-three'). It was suggested that choosing a different name
than N-Triple would avoid (or would have avoided) such kinds
of confusion.


Personal comment: Both of the above comments seem to at least
                   point to the need for a strong warning
                   "Warning: N-Triples in not N3".


Regards,    Martin.
