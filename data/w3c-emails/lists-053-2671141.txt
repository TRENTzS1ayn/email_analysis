Partly wanting to nail down one of Grahams comments before sending a response 
on the reagle issues, and partly wanting advice from other WG members, I have 
drafted but not sent a response to reagle, webont and eric Prud'hommeaux 
concerning the XMLLiteral design changes.

The draft is at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Jun/0066

I particularly would like advice on the following para:
[[
Please note that the I18N-WG have made a comment criticizing this decision:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0023.html
which the RDF Core has not officially yet agreed a response (although we have 
spent more than an hour of telecon time on it, with still a majority opposing 
further changes).
]]

Have I gone too far, or not far enough - I could even invite the others to 
join the fray. (I note Martin has cc-ed reagle with some of the messages).
