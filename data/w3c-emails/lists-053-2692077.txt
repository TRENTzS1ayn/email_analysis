There is a new version of the Primer at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/rdf-primer-2003LCrevised30June.html

This is *not* ready for detailed WG review;  I'm just putting this up 
FYI.  There are still some places in the text that need revising 
(there's commentary to that effect in those places), examples and 
figures need to be renumbered, etc.  However, someone with some spare 
cycles might want to cast their eye over the new material in Section 2.2 
(where I've tried to address some of Peter's concerns about "vocabulary" 
and "meaning"), Section 2.4 (where I've added some to the discussion of 
typed literals) and Section 4.3 (I've rewritten the reification section 
again, including some RDF/XML examples in response to DanC's comment). 
The major pieces of changed text are in red.

I'll be out of town the rest of the week, and somewhat 
Internet-challenged, but I'll try to some some of that time to fix the 
remaining bits (and do the spell checking and so on).
