What is a "definition" of a predicate? Nothing in any of the RDF or 
OWL specs refers to definitions.

BTW, there is a huge hole here: Nothing in any W3C spec, except 
possibly that for URNs,  provides any account of what it means for a 
URIref to "identify" something. There aren't any names on the Web; 
or, more accurately, there are millions of them, but there are no 
protocols or standards for specifying what they are names of.

Please do not lose the word 'intended'. If you omit it, that 
paragraph needs to be struck from the document. The whole point of 
distinguishing between 'intended meaning' and (actual) meaning is 
that the latter is often not the same as the former. Comments can 
indicate intended meanings; they can be documentation. They cannot 
constrain or specify actual meanings.

SO, to return to the point, the above is NOT about specifying the 
meaning of a term.

That really is a persistent and very harmful delusion. The entire 
point of the whole AI/KR effort, of most applied ontology work, and 
even of a large part of commercial relational database technology, is 
that large sections of meanings do NOT need to be 'grounded' in 
English. If all meanings had to be grounded in English then the SWeb 
would be a non-starter. Fortunately, this isn't even remotely true, 
which is why the SWeb isn't totally impossible.

There is a GREAT danger here of having English comments be wildly 
overoptimistic. In many ways it is better to have the  "indicates an 
xyz relation"  form rather than something which claims some 
inexpressible content or grossly oversimplifies some actual meanings.

This isn't just griping: we have about two decades experience, and a 
pretty solid collection of cases studies, of just how misleading such 
naively optimistic 'English glosses' of intended meaning can be, and 
how they lead to errors, cause failures of interoperability. and even 
dangers. Its often called the 'gensym fallacy'.

That is a dangerous and false assumption. It is based on a hopelessly 
naive view of what 'meaning' means in normal human discourse; but 
even a moderately competent lexicographer could tell you that there 
is almost never a single meaning for almost any term in almost any 
language. Worse, the more exactly you require the meanings to be 
specified, the more fragmentation of meaning you get. For example, 
many dictionaries distinguish two or three meanings of 'bank' 
(financial institution, edge of river, aeroplane turn). BUt if you 
start getting fussy about distinguishing senses, the first of these 
can be used to mean a company, an agent, a legal entity, a building, 
a location, a collection of buildings, even things like an 
architectural style. Most common word meanings fracture into about a 
dozen meanings when 'meaning' is required to be delineated with any 
precision. And our ontologies REQUIRE that meanings be used with this 
kind of precision, because they have taxonomies of 'kinds of entity' 
built into their very skeletons, so they are obliged to be achingly 
precise about distinguishing locations from agencies from financial 
institutions, etc.,.

If the SPEC refers to meanings defined in English then it needs to 
say what it means by that. And if it says anything that implies that 
any software depends on that meaning, then it is guaranteed to be 
useless, because to write such software is beyond the competence of 
anyone at the present time.

But try checking it out in reasonable-sized cases.  (Listening to you 
talk about this stuff is like listening to a bunch of guys in a bar 
discussing how to climb Everest next weekend.) In any case, the issue 
before us is, which is normative? If the meaning of the English is 
declared to be normative, then RDF is dead in the water, since it is 
immediately totally impossible to write any RDF-conformant software.

The sooner you stop being guided by that illusory fiction the better. 
Its a very, very, very poor guide. It can't even handle the current 
state of RDF and OWL.

If you think about it for a second, its kind of obvious that it 
doesn't even make sense. Did you know what "Froxible" means? It's a 
word in Fragolian, and maybe you aren't familiar with Fragolian...oh, 
but wait: for you, meaning is *independent* of language, right? So 
*you* ought to know what it means even without knowing the language.

The meaning IS the use.  The best that the W3C WGs can do is to 
provide the world with more useful languages and hope that it starts 
using them. But the W3C is not a fount of authority about meanings. 
To set oneself up as the meaning-shop would be to invite 
well-deserved ridicule.
