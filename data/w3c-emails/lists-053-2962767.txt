Agreed, that would be unreadable.

Right, there seems to be a circularity there.

Hmm. I presume there was a good reason for that restriction. Seems on 
balance that there is no obvious reason why RDF should exclude any 
class of identifier. Logically, the 'RDF URIrefs' could be any set of 
strings which are distinguishable from literals and bnodes. I cannot 
see any good pragmatic or semantic reason to exclude any URIrefs from 
RDF.

Has this got something to do with bloody XML ?

I didn't mean to suggest any major change, only that we get the 
various documents using a common terminology and notation. And I knew 
that I had it wrong in Semantics.
