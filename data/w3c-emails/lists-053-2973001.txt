A thread which argues philosophically about the identity of URIs but 
does not
discuss allowed entailments.

There was a lack of test case.   One test case is whether (writing = 
for daml:equivelentTo)
the following is a valid entailment:

:Superman =  :ClarkeKent.
Lois :believes :s .
:s  rdf:subject :Superman .
:s rdf:predicate rdf:type.
:s rdf:object  :Strongman.
_________________________
Lois :believes :s .
:s  rdf:subject : ClarkeKent .
:s rdf:predicate rdf:type.
:s rdf:object  :Strongman.

This follows from a current axiom of = that

{ ?x ?p ?y.  ?y = ?z } => { ?x ?p ?z }.

This settles the question as to whether quoting would matter or not.
Clearly quoting solves the problem.

:Superman =  :ClarkeKent.
Lois :believes :s .
:s  rdf:subject2 ":Superman" .
:s rdf:predicate2 "rdf:type".
:s rdf:object2 ":Strongman".

does not allow that entailment.

One has then a

Patrick and janet accepted the problem but didn't see how using literals
helped.
