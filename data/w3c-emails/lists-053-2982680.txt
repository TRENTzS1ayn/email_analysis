Pat, I think I agree with you more than you agree with me.
Your message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Feb/0164.html
I thought was a good summary of the difference between the sorts
of meaning and the imporatance that any "social" meaning is consistent
with the formal meaning.

But below you seem to take a rather extreme view.
I suppose it shows the differences between our backgrounds.

A definition is a text which describes the meaning of a term..

For example, http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#property
is (part of) an english definition of a rdf:Property.

I know its a bit ofashock, but we are not being formal here. This definitoin
of property is a rough and ready english definition. But we get by with it
and the rest of the stuff about predicates in the document.

Um.. by using a URI, where sender and receiver share
information which restricts the assication of the URI to one thing
(or one thing withiin a given shared context).
I am not sure what level of answer you are looking for here.

Statements which restrct interpretations such that
within the domain of discourse, for any intepretation,
any things identified by the URI are equivalent?

No, that's good, because the questoin of what is identified by a URI
is dealt with in URI spec and associated specs.

The only question that RDF has to answer (not as part of
itself, but as part of a duty delegated from the URI spec) is to
show how, when the URI
is an identifier within an rdf document  (a la foo.rdf#bar), to show how 
RDF allows
the set of things which a URI might by identified to be restricted by
RDF statements about that thing, or as we say in english, how RDF
documents can describe things.

They do. Casesium red is the sprectrum of an excited Caesium atom.
Some are vauge -- red is a color which has predominatlylonger wavelengths.

Notionally, the URIref identifies the car so long as everyone who uses
it does soconsistently with it identifying the car.

Specifically and practically, the semnatic web protocol is that
a web page in RDF foo.rdf  has a description of something
of type Car and typically giving a country code and plate number
as property values.
