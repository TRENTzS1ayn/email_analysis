I believe we don't have relative URIs in the abstract syntax because, in 
the abstract, we don't define anything for them to be "relative" to 
(like a "graph id" or something), so there's no way to "complete" them. 
  URIrefs in the abstract model (in triples) have to be absolute.  In 
the XML, we *can* have relative URIrefs (like those names for schema 
classes like #Person we use all the time), because there we XML 
mechanisms to turn them into absolute URIrefs.
