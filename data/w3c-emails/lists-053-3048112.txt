Tim,

I thought I understood something of what you were looking for, but now I'm 
confused.

I really think we should separate this idea of the meaning of a statement 
defined by its predicate from the other issue of social meaning.

In an earlier draft of Concepts, I tried to capture this idea of a 
statement's meaning being somehow primarily defined by its predicate, but I 
couldn't make it fly.  In the final analysis, the meaning of a statement is 
defined by its predicate, subject *and* object;  despite trying, I have 
failed to really find any sense in which a predicate dominates over the 
other parts.

I had thought that the issue you tried to raise was that the purpose of an 
RDF document was to be more than just a bag-of-bits, that its publisher 
should expect to be held responsible for its content.  Your message here 
seems to ignore that aspect completely.
