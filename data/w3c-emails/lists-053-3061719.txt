Pat,

I'd like to explore this a little, noting that RDF is not "ordinary human 
discourse in natural language".

Stepping back from meaning that can be formally specified, I'd like to try 
a notion of a single meaning (in RDF):
(a) each URI used has exactly one denotation
(b) each URI used as a property has just one relational extension

(A consequence --for which this is sufficient but not necessary-- would be 
that the truth or falsity of any expression using a given vocabulary of 
URIs is fixed.)

I'm not attempting to describe a specific interpretation in the model 
theoretic sense.  Though I suspect that there can be only one such 
interpretation (on a given vocabulary) that could concur with such a meaning.

We have no way of fully specifying such a "one meaning", but I think it's 
reasonable to allow that we can develop successive approximations that 
converge (asymptotically, as it were) to such a meaning.

This may not be a useful idea, but I'm trying here to see if there may be 
ways to reconcile what I think are two apparently-reasonable viewpoints.
