Well, in fact you are. That is, if you fix the denotations and the 
relational extensions, you've fixed everything.

Right.

Well, maybe that is a reasonable idea, but there are several 
limitations to it, since one can easily show that there is never a 
single such satisfying interpretation as far as the MT is concerned. 
So the single intended model has to be defined by some extra-MT-ish 
constraints.

More seriously in the context of the original thread, this entire 
picture assumes that it makes sense to think in MT terms over a range 
of languages. This is indeed possible with RDF/S/OWL-Full, but (a) 
setting this up was a major piece of work, and amounted to making 
these into a single language; it is meaningless when we are supposed 
to have a single meaning which crosses arbitrary language boundaries; 
and (b) it may well not be possible for future languages, or 
extensions which take the RDF/S/OWL axis in some other direction (eg 
some of the 'rules' proposals).
