It stops the bad inference, indeed. But it stops it utterly. For 
example, consider what Lois eventually finds out, when she discovers 
that ClarkeKent really *is* Superman. Now you want to be able to do 
equality reasoning on this part of her beliefs, but howre you gonna 
do it? You don't want to say that Lois believes that

":Superman" = ":ClarkeKent"

because she hasn't lost her ability to distinguish different 
character strings. She has just come to realize that two different 
strings denote the same thing, a fact that is best described with an 
equation which *uses* the strings:

:Superman = :ClarkeKent

The difference being that although this was always true, now Lois 
actually believes it.

What you really want to be able to do is to describe Lois' beliefs, 
to see the world from her point of view, without getting that muddled 
up with the way the world actually is. This requires some kind of 
scoping mechanism, such as a modality, to separate beliefs from 
facts. Then there is a clear difference between saying CK = Sup  and 
saying that Lois believes( CK = Sup) , and the general point of view 
is that

If you use quotation to express beliefs, then you do indeed have an 
insurance against inappropriate de re inferences, but you are unable 
to express actual de re beliefs properly. So quotation is a very 
blunt tool for handling propositional attitudes.
