The following comment was agreed, and I have sent it to the comments list 
(it has not shown up though).

I point out that all the parties with a declared interest, except for Peter 
Crowther, were at the meeting and agreed to this resolution.

In particular Patel-Schneider and Parsia who raised issues with the 
section, and Connolly, Brickley, Eric Miller and Berners-Lee (amongst 
others) for W3C (who originally raised the issue rdfms-assertion).

I have asked Crowther to endorse the resolution.

The Semantic Web Architecture meeting at the W3C tech plenary
resolved unanimously to this message.

We suggest that:
- section 4 is struck
- postpone rdfms-assertion
- strike other text concerning rdfms-assertion
- CG prioritise work on this issue,
    co-ordinated with the TAG over URI denotation.


Jeremy Carroll.
