The actual changes I propose that suggest that parser should canonicalize are:

1: adding test(s) that are based on that asusmption (We have not included 
tests in the test suite that require C14N).
2: adding following note to concepts:
[[
Note: For systems which reason about RDF graphs
it is suggested that the canonicalization be
performed on XML input. The internal representation
and non-XML external representations should be
in canonical form.
]]

There is some webont resistance to the cost of c14n, and the added 
complexities they perceive. It has not helped that Pat felt a need to spell 
out the L2V mapping of rdf:XMLLiteral in the semantics doc.

By spelling out the obvious implementation we may make it clearer that 
webont implementors just do a string compare.

This text does not preclude other implementations even for reasoning systems.
