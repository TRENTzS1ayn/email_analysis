I propose we accept the recommendation from the group meeting at W3C tech 
plenary:

[[
The Semantic Web Architecture meeting at the W3C tech plenary
resolved unanimously to this message.

We suggest that:
- section 4 is struck
- postpone rdfms-assertion
- strike other text concerning rdfms-assertion
- CG prioritise work on this issue,
    co-ordinated with the TAG over URI denotation.
]]

<aside>
Absent from the meeting, I'd like to thank Jeremy for taking the hot-seat, 
and everyone who spent effort to bring the relevant issues to the fore.

I think it is particularly appropriate that this issue be dealt with by 
SWebCG or TAG, clearly separated from the RDF *technical* specification, 
but indicating a sense of the purpose of RDF (whatever that may be ;-)
