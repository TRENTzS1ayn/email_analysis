I'm not convinced the social and technical can be so easily separated, but
I am convinced that further discussion is needed!

With RDFIG chair hat on, I propose www-rdf-logic@w3.org (an RDFIG list) 
as an initial forum for continuing these discussions. If a more specific
list is needed, or detailed doc drafting happens, we can always use 
www-archive or investigate a new list. For now I think the mission and 
membership of www-rdf-logic (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/)
is close enough. 

That said, SW Coordination Group has the job of figuring out how to
prioritise this work, so this is my view only at this stage...

cheers,

Dan
