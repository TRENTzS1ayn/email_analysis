It was also dated 10 Jan, before the LC WDs were published. PFPS's
mail was a note that it might be recorded as future work.

WebOnt's official request in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0335.html
was a preference that RDF Core make a change now, but not a requirement.
