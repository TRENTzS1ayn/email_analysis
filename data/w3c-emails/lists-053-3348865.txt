4: Apology
Apologies to the WG that this is a cursory agenda without the usual links etc.
A combination of the W3C site being down and backlog of work after the tech
plenary means I didn't have the time to do better.



5: Issues to be considered

see:  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/

reagle-01  XMLLiteral equality
reagle-02  exc-c14n throughout
pfps-14    Social Meaning
hendler-01 literals in parsetype collection
hodder-01  RDF in HTML
krech-01   emptyPropertyElt ambiguity
jjc-01     rdfms-nested-bagIDs/test007.rdf
pfps-15    Say anything quote
danc-03    rdf/xml reification examples

bwm believes there were more that folks promised but these are not recorded
in the irc log.
