If there is time I would like some discussion of the RDF URI reference vs 
IRI issue.

I am minded to propose a global renaming of RDF URI reference and uriref to 
IRI and defer to namespaces 1.1; and would like some idea of how much that 
is a lead balloon.

I still need input from I18N-WG on this.
