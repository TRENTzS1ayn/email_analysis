danc-03  rdf/xml reification examples

I propose a rewrite of the reification section to include an RDF/XML 
example.  In fact, I have nearly completed a rewrite of the reification 
section (I was hoping to have already posted it) that:

a.  Includes an RDF/XML example showing use in representing provenance 
information (it uses rdf:ID but another example could easily be added to 
illustrate rdf:bagID)

b.  deals with some other comments on clarifying reification by Bob 
MacGregor (e.g., pointing people to references on propositional attitudes)

pfps-15  Say anything quote

In the interests of international peace-keepiing, I propose to replace

"These examples also illustrate one of the basic architectural 
principles of the Web, which is that anyone should be able say anything 
they want about existing resources [BERNERS-LEE98]."

(which, strictly speaking, doesn't say "anything about anything") with

"These examples also illustrate one of the basic architectural 
principles of the Web, which is that anyone should be able to freely add 
information about an existing resource, using any vocabulary they please 
[BERNERS-LEE98]."

pfps-17  namespace v vocabulary

I propose to replace "namespace" by "vocabulary" where this is 
appropriate (in other places the Primer is talking about XML 
namespaces), per the WG email discussion on this.  I've already 
identified those places where changes are needed.

Question:  is it reasonable to use terminology like "we use a namespace 
URI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# to identify the RDF 
vocabulary"?  Or should we just say it's a URI rather than a "namespace 
URI"?  (The same question applies to referring to any vocabulary using a 
URI:  the PRISM section also uses this idea, for example).
