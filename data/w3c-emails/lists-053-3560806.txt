Section 3.3: "For example, the QName datatype requires a namespace 
declaration to be in scope ...";  I think that's OK in the XML sense.

Section 3.7: "3.7 RDF Core URI Vocabulary and Namespaces (Normative)";   I 
think that's in the XML sense.

Section 3.7: "(conventionally associated with namespace prefix rdf:)".  I 
think that's OK in the XML sense.

Section 3.7: "these URI prefix strings correspond to XML namespaces 
[XML-NS] ...";  I think that's in the XML sense.

Section 3.7: "Note: these namespace URIs are the same as those used in 
earlier RDF documents [RDF-MS] [RDF-SCHEMA].";   I think that's in the XML 
sense.

Section 3.7: "[[[NOTE FOR REVIEWERS: Some terms in these namespaces have 
been deprecated...";  I think that should be "vocabularies", but the text 
will be removed anyway.

Section 3.7: "Vocabulary terms in the rdf: namespace are listed in section 
5.1 of the RDF syntax specification [RDF-SYNTAX]."  This is a closer call, 
but I think that's in the XML sense.

...

Those are all the occurrences of 'namespace' that I found.
