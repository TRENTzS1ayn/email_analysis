Right, and this might be an opportunity for the other docs to mention 
the idea of semantic extension. This notion is pretty central to any 
discussion of what RDF 'means' but currently looks like an arcane 
abstract matter inside the MT.

The expressive power of a notation depends on its semantics.  We 
rather play fast-and-loose with this because we introduce new 
semantics when we add some vocabularies.  'Basic' RDF strictly has a 
very limited expressive power, but RDFS has quite a lot more and 
OWL-in-RDF has a lot more still. If these were all just RDF 
ontologies, ie if this were all *really* represented in pure RDF, 
this would be impossible, so we really need to explain what it means. 
Since each of these vocabularies comes with its own extra semantics, 
it strictly speaking has to be considered a separate language. But as 
far as parsers are concerned they are all RDF, of course. I chose the 
term 'semantic extension' partly to emphasize that they are not 
syntactic extensions.
