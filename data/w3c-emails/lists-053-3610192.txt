Volunteer Scribe

(None recorded)



4: Apology
Apologies to the WG that this is a cursory agenda without the usual links etc.
A combination of the W3C site being down and backlog of work after the tech
plenary means I didn't have the time to do better.


Process discussion:  Brian queries whether the meeting is quorate.
Most of the editors are present, so the decision is to proceed with
the telecon as a normal working group telecon, but defer formal
announcent of any decisions until after the next WG telecon, where
the decisions can be retified and/or challenged.



5: Issues to be considered

see:  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/

.....

reagle-01  XMLLiteral equality
reagle-02  exc-c14n throughout

discussion: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-03-11  16:11:32

see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0025.html

The meeting's general consensus was to tighten up the specification to use
canonicalized form in the abstract syntax, while noting that applications
remain free to use a non-canonical form to represent the canonical form.
This simplifies the specifications, and effectively requires that reasoners
do full canonicalization, but leaves applications that don't reason about
XML literal forms free to not canonicalize.

ACTION 2003-03-11#1, JJC: Make a proposal that abstract syntax contains 
canonicalized XML, with comments.

pfps-14    Social Meaning

discussion: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-03-11  16:46:40

Jeremy reported back from the meeting in Boston:
see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0027.html

Unanimous recommendation from that meeting was to strike discussion of
social meaning, and attendant issues.   It was noted that this did not
preclude the possibility to define these issues in another, later,
document.

hendler-01 literals in parsetype collection

discussion: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-03-11  16:58:28

see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0034.html

PROPOSED BWM:
RDFCore resolves to postpone this issue on the grounds that it
would require extensive changes to current spec, is not a critical
requirement for webont, that it would involve considering several
different approaches, taking time and consequent changes to
syntax draft, test cases, implementations and primer
SECONDED JJC
CARRIED with no objection or abstentions.

ACTION 2003-03-11#6, DB:  Respond to WEBONT on Hendler-01

pfps-15    Say anything quote

discussion: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-03-11  17:16:59

see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0054.html

It was generally felt that the intent of the current wording, in its context,
was not likely to be misunderstood.  But some improvements to the wording
were discussed and broadly agreed.

PROPOSED PatH:  Frank has editorial discretion to amend wording in light of 
the comment
SECONDED EM
CARRIED with no objection and 1 abstention.

ACTION 2003-03-11#11, FM:  Update documents as proposed in message and

pfps-17    namespace v vocabulary

discussion: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-03-11  17:46:21

PROPOSED FM: to change 'namespace' to 'vocabulary', except when
              specifically talking about XML namespaces
SECONDED DB
CARRIED with no objection or abstention.

ACTION 2003-03-11#13, FM:  Respond to pfps-17
ACTION 2003-03-11#14, FM:  Update documents as proposed
ACTION 2003-03-11#15, BWM: Re-post boilerplate for response to comments

Technically, "namespace name" is the correct term for "namespace URI [ref]"
(per http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/).
