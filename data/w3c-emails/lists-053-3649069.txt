This can be reflected in an RDF non-entailment.

qu
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0269.html

_:xxx rdf:type rdf:Seq.
_:xxx rdf:_2 <ex:a> .
_:xxx rdf:_2 <ex:c> .
<ex:a> <eg:foo> <eg:bar> .

does not entail

<ex:c> <eg:foo> <eg:bar> .

I believe we can address qu-02 by adding this non-entailment to the test suite 
and not changing the semantics doc.
(Unless we already have a similar test, in which case this is a no-op).
