I don't understand this.  Link from this section?  To the
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE you propose below.

There is a bullet point in section 6
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#start

Could you add some URLs to what you want to change?

In http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-concepts-20030123/#section-XMLLiteral

how about: 
  strings that are the contents of the root element of canonical XML documents

I should note that I've answered several people who wanted to know
where the rdf-wrapper element was defined, so maybe a more prominent
stating that this is arbitrary might help.

This note reminds me, do we canonicalize the language strings to
lower/uppercase?  I know it has been suggested (from I18N WG?) that
it is best to preserve this for people but given there is no other
variation allowed in literal or URI canoncalization, I think we
should consider picking one and requiring it.

Where are these first & second examples?

This is the point that has confused some people, looking for a
definition of rdf-wrapper.

The latter seems clearer, rather than defining the condition in terms
of yet another transformation.

If you mean the three line <rdf-wrapper> above, then I'm not sure
what to answer.  If we are going for a tighter definition of what is
canonical, then some XML will be transformed to canonical form, so I
can't really say better or worse.  The group(s) that created these
canonicalization transformations surely considered this.
