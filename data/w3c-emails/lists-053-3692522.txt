Sorry I have not been sufficiently clear.
Links included etc.

(I think this was clear enough - proposed text is needed)

Clarification:
in section 6
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#section-Data-Model
replace:
[[This specification does not require that N-Triples be used to represent 
an RDF Graph.]]

by
[[
This specification permits any
<a href="rdf-concepts#implementation-note">representation</a>
of an RDF Graph (see [RDF Concepts]); in particular, it
does not require the use of N-Triples.
]]

Hope the above is clearer.

I was thinking along the lines of first defining value space and the 
mapping and then
[[
The lexical space is the set of
(string value) pairs that map into the value space.
]]
It's sort of cheating.

Any suggestions as to how - it currently comes right after the first 
occurrences.
I guess I could change the value space bullet point from
[[
Have root element tag: <rdf-wrapper>
]]
to
[[
Have the fixed but arbitrary root element: <rdf-wrapper>
]]

(One of the xmlschema editorial comments (2.5 in msg 0489) is to delete "tag")

Yes; we chose lowercase, mainly to make life easier for Pat.
Tex Texin misunderstood that so the note is intended to clarify ...

[[
Above, repeat:
As a first example: language tags may be
represented in their original case, and language tag comparison would
then be a case insensitive string comparison. As a second example:
literals with datatype rdf:XMLLiterals can be represented in a non-canonical
format, and canonicalization performed during the comparison between two
such literals.

Yes, I'll go with that I think.

The editorial problem is that the inclusive C14N spec defines the term 
"canonical XML" which is actually quite useful in defining the value space.
There is no equivalent term in EXC-C14N. The document:

<rdf-wrapper xml:lang="">
  <eg:a xmlns:eg="eg:a" xmlns:unused="eg:b"></eg:a>
</rdf-wrapper>


is canonical XML, but not in the corresponding set for exc-c14n.
Choices are:
- use term from inclusive C14N, and modify it (illustrated by my text)
- use only terminology from exc-c14n and construct the concept we really want.



Hope this is a bit clearer ...
