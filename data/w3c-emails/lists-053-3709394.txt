The chairs will have to rule on whether my claims below that some of
these comments are out of scope/charter are on target.

Just commentary, no discussion or changes required.  We also agree
there are good reasons that xsi:type as designed is not appropriate
for RDF/XML which uses with URIs for datatypes, not qnames.  Maybe
the XML schema WG wants to hear more reasons why xsi:type wasn't
used?

The Primer is the place that users can already look for to see how to
write RDF datatypes in the RDF/XML syntax:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20030123/#typedliterals

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20030123/#example22

There is already discussion near figure 9

Summary: closed. explanation, no action

That XML detail is discussed in "The Syntax Data Model Section"
where it already states in the fifth paragraph:

  "The syntax does not support non-well-formed XML documents, nor
  documents that otherwise do not have an XML Information Set; for
  example, that do not conform to XML Namespaces [XML-NS]."
  -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#section-Data-Model

So if there is no namespace name, it isn't RDF/XML.

"cannonical syntax"

Discussion of out of what I believe is out of RDF Core's charter,
creating a new XML syntax or modifying RDF/XML (created 1998)
to work with XML technology designed later.

  "The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF syntax,"
  -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

Summary: closed.  we don't have to do this, out of charter ??



ISSUE http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-11
"layering on xml"

There is some explanation to do since they seem to have missed
reading the Syntax Data model section in defining RDF/XML on top of
the pile of XML technologies.

>    Not only does this confuse levels and thus readers, it also runs the
>    risk of inadvertently defining an XML subset. It also appears, on a

It neither creates a subset nor rules out using other XML APIs as
long as an XML Infoset is available.

  "This model illustrates one way to create a representation of an
  RDF Graph from an RDF/XML document. It does not mandate any
  implementation method - any other method that results in a
  representation of the same RDF Graph may be used.

  In particular:
  ...
   * This specification does not require the use of [XPATH] or [SAX2]
   * This specification places no constraints on the order in which
  software transforming RDF/XML into a representation of a graph,
  constructs the representation of the graph.

ISSUE http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-12
"capricious syntax"

Discussion and proposal for a better XML syntax (RDF/XML 1998) to
better match the RDF concepts and abstract syntax (2002).  Out of
charter:

  "The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF syntax,"
  -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter

Comments on the problems W3C XML schema (designed 1999/2000), XSLT
and XQuery has dealing with RDF/XML and its many variations.

Long comments on difference between XML and RDF data models meaning
different tool sets.  Tree (sort of) and graph.  We knew that.

Proposal to work together to create new XML serializations.

Action: closed
  out of charter/scope??,
  coordination group work??
  joint work / postponed work / feedback to new activities??
