Hi Dave,

Thanks for the speedy analysis.

As a general point,  I hope that the WG will respond warmly to the comments 
we have received from the xml schema folks.  To my mind, there has in the 
past been a gulf in our respective points of view, and I believe that with 
a little care we may be able to build some bridges across that gap.

So my reading of this is that they wondered why didn't just use xsi:type, 
and figured out part of the answer.  I suspect there is a spread of opinion 
within that group and we can help by giving a clear explanation of why we 
didn't use xsi:type.

So we can say that we didn't introduce rdf:datatype capriciously, but because:

   - we use URIREF's not qnames as identifiers
   - to allow qnames in just one attribute would have caused confusion and 
we felt that introducing
     the use of qnames throughout the syntax was beyond our charter
   - and, as they point out, we allow datatypes not defined by xml schema
   - we recognise the potential for confusion, we have explained as best we 
can in the primer, but if they have other editorial suggestions, we'd be 
happy to hear them.

Personaly, I'm not sure what is being said here.

I think what they are getting at is whether or not QNAMES are required, for 
example

<RDF xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
   <Description>
     <value>10</value>
   </Description>
</RDF>

is legal RDF but there are no qnames in it.  The text they quote:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-intro

[[In order to encode the graph in XML, the nodes and arcs have to be 
represented by XML element names, attribute names, element content and 
attribute content. RDF/XML uses XML QNames to represent RDF URI References. 
The namespace prefix part of all QNames is associated with a URI Reference 
as defined in XML Namespaces [XML-NS]. The RDF URI Reference represented by 
a QName is determined by appending the local name part of the QName to the 
URI Reference associated with the namespace prefix part of the QName. This 
is used to shorten the RDF URI References of all property arcs labels and 
some nodes. RDF URI References identifying subject and object nodes can 
also be stored as XML attribute values or XML element names via QNames. RDF 
Literals (which are only object nodes) become either XML element text 
content or XML attribute values.]]

left them unsure at first reading whether the above example was legal.  At 
least that is my guess at what is being said, but it might be good to 
confirm that.

If that is the concern, then a minor editorial change to the quoted 
paragraph would clear it up.

I suggest we can agree that it is hard to process RDF with general XML 
tools such as XSLT for the reasons they point out but that RDFCore decided 
that this issue was outside our charter.  None the less we recognise that 
there is some disquiet about the current RDF/XML syntax, we have tabled an 
issue for consideration by a future WG and would hope that WG would welcome 
involvement of the xml schema wg.  We could also note that the XHTML WG are 
already considering a DTD friendly syntax for inclusion in XHTML documents 
with the support and encouragement of the RDFCore WG.

I found myself wondering more about this comment.  The suggestion that the 
syntax is defined at the character level seems just wrong.  It is also 
noteworthy that the approach they suggest of considering a transform into a 
canonical form is not dissimilar to the snail approach we considered, and 
rejected.

This comment belongs in the category of "we would have done it 
differently", which may be true, but there you go.  I think the response 
might also include:

   - agreement that layering of specs is important
   - emphasis that unlike M&S the grammar is not character level, but is 
built on top of an infoset
   - acceptance that are other ways to do it, some of which we considered 
(snail) and why we decided on this approach (the grammar is clearer)

Right, and we should say we recognize and share these concerns.

How much of their arm would they like us to bite off?

Right - postponed work.
