Do we have any test cases for dealing with literal equality?

In particular, I'm wondering if the recent discussion of XML literals and 
canonicalization will have any effect of the interpretation of language 
tags for typed literals.  Currently, if I have the details right, typed 
literals with different language tags are distinct values in the abstract 
graph, but always denote the same thing, with the exception of XML 
literals.  Plain literals are language-tag sensitive.  What about xsd:string?

I didn't find any entailment tests covering this area.

...

While I'm on this topic, I assume it's clear that the following describe 
the same graph:

[[
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
          xmlns:ex='http://www.example.org/xxx/a>
   <ex:subj>
      <ex:prop>abc</ex:prop>
   </ex:subj>
</rdf:RDF>
]]

and

[[
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
          xmlns:ex='http://www.example.org/xxx/>
   <ex:asubj>
      <ex:aprop>abc</ex:aprop>
   </ex:asubj>
</rdf:RDF>
]]

...

On my attempt to use it for real, I'm finding the test cases document 
difficult to follow, for two main reasons:

(a) it is formatted as a very wide document, such that the full width will 
not fit on my display.

(b) the test cases are not obviously organized by functional groups, but by 
issue.  While it made sense to use an issue-based organization for 
assembling the tests, I think a more functionally oriented arrangement 
would better serve the goal of clarifying questions about deign intent.
