xsd:string is a datatype in the XSD specification and from what I
recall, RDF doesn't use it - no RDF literal is an xsd:string nor has
one as a part, although the lexical form definition is compatible
with it.  A quick grep in the concepts WD confirms this as far
as I can tell.  So we don't need to test xsd:string comparisons.

The nearest we have is
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-charmod-uris/

which checks that the literals from the syntax (RDF/XML) correctly
get into the RDF graph (as N-Triples)

Slightly related, there is the N-Triples test, which exercises the
N-Triples syntax by having many forms.  It should entail itself.
Linked from http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntrip_tests
to http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/ntriples/test.nt
and includes many XML Literal forms; which I guess I should check are
appropriately canonical.

Yes.

I'll leave this for Jan to say more on but I feel it would be a much
longer document without the 5 column tables to summarise the tests
and the test cases are for the issues - that is where the discussion
lies.  The test cases WD shouldn't try to duplicate that.
