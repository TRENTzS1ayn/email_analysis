careful... no RDF literal is specified to be (i.e. denote)
an xsd:string; but neither is it specified to be
(i.e. denote) *not* an xsd:string.

RDF literals and xsd:strings are both sequences of unicode
characters, so it's straightforward to see them as
overlapping.

No, but keep in mind that WebOnt does, and if they have questions
as a result, we might owe them answers.
