yes, there are many things RDF or parts of it are not, but we don't
generally list them :)

RDF plain literals have a language part, so are not equal to xsd:string.

The lexical form part of RDF typed literals is compatible with
but not equal to xsd:string.  

Both imply no need to run xsd:string tests
