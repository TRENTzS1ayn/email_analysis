Reviewing:

In 0.2 Graph syntax

[[

Prefix rdf: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

Prefix rdfs: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#

Prefix xsd: namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#

]]

This is correct usage.

In 3. Interpreting the RDF(S) vocabulary

[[
So far we have considered only the model theory of what might be called the 
logical form of the RDF graph itself, without imposing any special 
interpretations on any vocabulary. In the rest of the document we will 
extend the model theory to describe the semantic conditions reflecting the 
intended meanings of the rdf: and rdfs: namespaces.
]]

Suggest change to [[vocabulary]].

[[
Since there are now several distinct notions of interpretation, entailment 
and satisfiability, we use the Qname namespace prefix conventions to 
identify the various distinctions, eg an rdf-interpretation is an 
interpretation
]]

This is correct usage.

No other occurences were found.
