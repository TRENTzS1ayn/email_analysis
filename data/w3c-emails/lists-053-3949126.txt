Pat,

to make sure you are informed, the WG decided on 28/Feb

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0053.html

[[
DECISION: An RDF graph is a set of triples, the term graph equality be
changed to graph equivalence and this disposes of danc-01 (contex:
http://www.w3.org/2003/02/28-rdfcore-irc#T16-37-35)
]]

I think this is what you wanted.

Brian
