At Tuesday's telecon we recorded individual actions on folks to update docs 
and send responses.  Normally, I track all actions individually, but I just 
don't have the bandwidth to do that for all of these.

Therefore:

  o I have silently dropped those actions from my list
  o I will rely on the doc editors to track the changes they have to make
  o whether responses have been sent will be tracked in the comment 
tracking document
  o I urge editors to follow Frank's practice to record the doc change 
reference in sending responses
