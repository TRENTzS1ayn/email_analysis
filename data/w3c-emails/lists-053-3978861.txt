4: Next telecon 21 Mar 2003 1100 Boston Time
We have a telecon scheduled for 18 Mar 2003, but:

  o I have another meeting I have to attend at that time
  o Turnout at this weeks extra telecon was poor
  o my request for another chair has met with no response

I propose therefore to cancel the extra telecon next Tuesday.

9: Status on Incoming Last Call Comments
Editors please note the editorial comments from the xml schema WG.
These have not been recorded in the comments list as they can

Otherwise, is the LCC comments list uptodate?  VDL (aka schema)?
