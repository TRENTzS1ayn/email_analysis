Fine.

Yes, it is cute :) but it probably doesn't help people more familiar
from the XML side of things rather than datatype mappings.  The
existing explanation does OK but I was just rewording the sentence to
be more linear:
  content-of root-element-of canonical-XML-documents(*)

(*) for some canonical

Better.

Yes, that would work.

Maybe ask the appropriate XML WG (xml digsig?) for which one?
I'd prefer the latter choice for now since we are using exc-c14n.
