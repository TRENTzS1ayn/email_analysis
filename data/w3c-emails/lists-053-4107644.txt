Graham--

I agree with what you say about the slipperiness of reification, but not 
with what you say about how helpful the discussion is to the working 
group (or at least to at least a *part* of the working group, namely 
me!).  At the moment, Semantics and the Primer are the only documents 
that try to explain the rationale behind reification, why you might want 
to use it (or why you might *think* you want to use it), and why the 
vocabulary is the way it is.  (Syntax shows some examples of how you 
*do* reification, but doesn't get into *why*).  I certainly agree that 
it's our responsibility to "clarify the existing vocabulary", but I 
don't see how you can do that without getting into this material, and I 
think this requires the sort of discussion that has been going on here.

I have some comments on the technical issues which I'll post in a 
separate message and, if the WG leans in that direction, we can take 
subsequent discussion off-list.
