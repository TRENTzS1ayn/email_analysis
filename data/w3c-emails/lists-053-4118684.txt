An initial review of these issues:

...

williams-01, What is a node in an RDF graph?
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#williams-01

Both Jeremy and I have made proposals:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0059.html
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0045.html


pfps-16, RDF's Expressive Power

I think this is a largely editorial issue, involving text at various places 
in the document.  I propose that the issue is addressed by me revising text 
in sections 2.2, 2.2.6 and 3.5.

...

pfps-18, namespace v vocabulary
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-18

Brian has proposed a resolution:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Feb/0221.html

and I have subsequently noted usage in RDF-concepts:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0062.html

I this is a basis for closing this issue.

...

pfps-22, reserved names in abstract syntax
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-22
pfps-23, sanctioned by?
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-23

I think these are really a single issue.

With respect to section "RDF Core URI Vocabulary and Namespaces":
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-URIspaces
I suggest:


1. Soften the initial sentence:
[[
RDF uses URIs to identify resources and properties. Certain URIs are 
reserved for use by RDF, and may not be used for any purpose not sanctioned 
the RDF specifications.   Specifically, URIs with the following leading 
substrings are reserved for RDF core vocabulary:
]]
to
[[
RDF uses URIs to identify resources and properties. Certain URIs are 
reserved for use by RDF, and should not be used in ways not supported by 
the RDF specifications.   Specifically, URIs with the following leading 
substrings are reserved for definition by the RDF specifications:
]]

2. add some additional text along the lines of:

[[
The meaning of URIs in the RDF and RDFS vocabularies (i.e. those that start 
with the RDF or RDFS namespace name) is determined by the RDF 
specifications (including possible future revisions and extensions).  Any 
information about such URIs that is not supported by the RDF specification 
should not be taken to be true in all uses of RDF.  Thus, URIs based on the 
RDF and RDFS namespace names should be treated as reserved, except for 
purposes specified by RDF specifications.

Also note that some URIs in the RDF vocabulary have purely syntactic 
purpose;  e.g. rdf:ID is used in the RDF/XML syntax, and is not specified 
for use to denote an RDF subject, object or property.  Such use has no 
defined meaning, and should be avoided.  A list of syntactically reserved 
URIs is in section 5.1, The RDF Namespace, of the RDF/XML syntax specification.
]]

[cf. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#section-Namespace]

(There's some redundancy here with the existing text, but the goal here to 
indicate an intent, not rewrite the document.  So the actual changes would 
not be exactly as suggested here.)
