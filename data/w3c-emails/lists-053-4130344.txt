No.

Tuesdays meeting was a formal meeting of the WG, agreed well in advance and 
properly consituted.  In recognition of the low turnout, we decided that we 
would hold off sending out announcements of decisions reached to allow time 
for those not present to comment should they choose to do so.

No formal ratification is necessary.
