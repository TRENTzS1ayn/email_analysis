Just for the record, the need to do so arose from the lack, in the 
Concepts document, of referenceable definitions of the lexical and 
value spaces of the datatype.  (BTW, I note that the proposed changes 
will still not give an adequate definition of the value space, since 
the lexical mapping is not surjective.)

One way or another, treating this thing as a datatype seems to cause 
more problems than it solves.
