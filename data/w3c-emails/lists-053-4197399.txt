Brian,

I should probably have mentioned this in the telecon, but was lost in a web 
of pointers.  The actual action was:

[[
 >ACTION: Gk to help respond to Vassillis's comments on datatypes
 >http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0282.html
 >(context: http://www.w3.org/2003/02/28-rdfcore-irc#T15-48-40)
]]

I mention this because I did not myself respond to Vassilli, and this note 
in the agenda may lead readers to assume he has received a response.
