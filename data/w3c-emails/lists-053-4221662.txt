Thanks for your comments on the RDF semantics document.

I will adopt your editorial suggestions, correct typos, and will try 
to remove uses of terminology with any potential philosophical 
penumbra from the technical prose in the document.

I have one clarification question concerning your comment on datatypes:

3.2. Types as lexical mappings (schema-related)

       A datatype is an entity characterized by a set of character strings
       called lexical forms and a mapping from that set to a set of
       values.

     We have a couple of reservations concerning this characterization.
...
      * The statement describes (with the exception of the problem just
         noted) simple datatypes, but not the class of complex datatypes
         which can be defined by XML Schema, nor all the types (or
         type-like constructs) definable in various other schema languages
         for XML.

I have followed other authors in this characterization, and am 
somewhat surprised to discover that it is incomplete or inadequate. 
Can you suggest, or point me to a source for, a definition which does 
cover the more general case, or which clarifies what is wrong with 
this characterization? We are supposed to have a datatyping framework 
which can handle all the built-in XML Schema datatypes.

Thanks for any help you can give.
