Members of the Schema WG have pointed out that the spec actually
doesn't use 'datatype' as a term for complex types, so the comment
we sent you is not quite right.  Some members of the WG, including
the individual who actually drafted that comment, think of the
term 'datatype' as denoting a class with two major subclasses,
the simple and the complex (data)types; on that interpretation, the
description in the RDF semantics document describes only the simple
types, but not all datatypes.  The XML Schema spec, it would appear,
may well stop short -- and almost certainly does, though I have not
checked this question in preparing this reply -- of committing the
WG or the reader to that as an official view.

If one does not think that the superclass common to complex types
and simple types is usefully called 'datatype', then (a) one has
some good company in some members of the XML Schema WG, and (b) the
description in RDF Semantics would appear to be unobjectionable.

At the moment, I'm speaking only for myself; I will put the question
to the WG in a future meeting and ask for a clarification, revision,
or retraction of the comment in question.

Thank you for your request for clarification; it promises to be
enlightening for a larger number of us than might at first have been
suspected.
