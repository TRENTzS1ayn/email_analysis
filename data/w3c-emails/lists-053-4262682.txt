I think the union case is decisive here (though depending on
how one squints, one could see each value having a lexical form,
even if the mapping is shadowed by that of a "preceeding"
datatype). 

In any case, I see no
reason why XML Schema cannot be more restrictive than RDF
with regards to datatypes. There may be other datatyping
frameworks which do not presume that all values have lexical
representatations, but which will work just fine with RDF.

Agreed. 

So many headaches would be cured if we just ignored xml:lang
entirely...
