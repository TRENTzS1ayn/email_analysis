I think this is the way to go.

Well, XML Schema can be seen as simply partitioning their L2V
mapping into two phases: (1) whitespace handling and (2) mapping.

RDF just treats L2V mapping in a more general manner, whereby
some lexical form (character sequence) is mapped to some value.

Most (if not all) scanning functions for programming languages
also take into account whitespace and other superfluous markup
when mapping a character sequence to a value.

I don't see an issue with RDF offering a more general description
of the L2V mapping process than XML Schema (or any other datatype
framework).

Perhaps we could simply add a note that states that some/most
datatyping frameworks define a means of discarding superfluous
characters from character strings as part of or prior to actual
mapping, and leave it at that.

Perhaps an example in the Primer with pointer to the XML Schema
specs on whitespace facets would suffice?
