I have to agree with Peter on the point made below, and propose that
the WG do one of two things to correct it:

1. Define XMLLiteral as an rdfs:Datatype with no exceptional
   interpretation (i.e. lang tags are not relevant to the L2V
   mapping).

2. Define XMLLiteral not as an rdfs:Datatype, but as a special
   literal node type similar to plain literal nodes, whereby
   D-interpretations do not apply.

My own preference would be #1, but as it seems a good number of
folks still think xml:lang should infect XML literals, I think
that #2 would be the most widely acceptable solution.

#2 essentially means that both plain and XML literals remain
exactly as defined by M&S, and typed literals are something
completely new, and not affecting any existing literals defined
in terms of M&S.

Brian, could this issue be added to today's aggenda?

Cheers,

Patrick
