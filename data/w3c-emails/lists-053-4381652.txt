On this one, the examples I gave and the analysis were slightly
wrong, another few reasons to delete it from the propsoed response.

This examples are wrong for the current datatype solution and was
being discused when we were proposing to use (the URI of) xsd:string
as an rdf property. In that case the two examples would have been:

   <ex:Node xsd:string="foo" ... />

   <xsd:string>foo</xsd:string>

but isn't so relevant to the current state.  I don't want to even
hint of re-opening this in a response :)
