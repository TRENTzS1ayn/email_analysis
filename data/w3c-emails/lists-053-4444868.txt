It looks like Webont are about ready to go to last call :) for which kudos 
to Jim, Guus, DanC and the rest of the webont WG.

They are hoping to publish their documents by 01 Apr 2003 and have asked us 
to review them by 09 May 2003, just before WWW 2003.  We are asked 
specifically to review the reference document, the semantics document and 
the test cases document.

I'm looking for volunteers to review these on behalf of the WG, to the 
following schedule:

   01 Apr - docs available
   21 Apr - draft reviews sent to WG list
   25 Apr - reviews considered by WG
   02 May - reviews approved by WG
   05 May - reviews sent to WEBONT

The webont folks were very good about reviewing our docs; its only fair we 
return the favour.

Brian
