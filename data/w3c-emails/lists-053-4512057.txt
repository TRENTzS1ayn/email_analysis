One problem is - did we accept/reject/whatever the issue?
From the minutes,
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0138.html
I was just actioned to post a reply.

I think we accepted that the wording could be improved but rejected
that it was an error.  I'm going with accept for now.

I'd like a read through / ack before I send this - thanks.

Dave



The RDF Core WG has considered your this comment

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-09

from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0489.html
section "4.2. QNames (Editorial, but important)"

and decided

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0138.html

to accept it with the following explanation.


The RDF/XML syntax WD section referred to
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-intro
is the very first section in the document introducing the syntax
intended as an overview, not defining the grammar.

We accept that this paragraph could be misleading and imply that an
XML prefix, and thus only prefixed names are required.  We propose to
amend the text in that paragraph to make it clear that in a XML QName
the prefix is optional where there is a default namespace. 

The suggested terminology change is to use namespace-qualified names
rather than mention prefixes.  Here is one rewording of the paragraph
that will be the basis of the resolution:

    In order to encode the graph in XML, the nodes and arcs have to
    be represented by XML element names, attribute names, element
    content and attribute content.  RDF/XML uses XML
    namespaced-qualified names (QNames) to represent RDF URI
    References.  The namespace part of all QNames is associated with
    a URI Reference as defined in XML Namespaces [XML-NS].  The RDF
    URI Reference represented by a QName is determined by appending
    the local name part of the QName to the URI Reference associated
    with the namespace-name of the QName.  This is used to shorten the
    RDF URI References of all property arcs labels and some
    nodes.  RDF URI References identifying subject and object nodes
    can also be stored as XML attribute values or XML element names
    via QNames.  RDF Literals (which are only object nodes) become
    either XML element text content or XML attribute values.



However, we note, the link [Qnames] in the section above already goes
to the following definition of QName:

   QName ::= (Prefix ':')? LocalPart
   Namespaces in XML
   -- http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/#NT-QName

which shows that the prefix part is optional in the current definiton
of QNames.

This is also mentioned in the errata:
    "Names with no colon can be qualified names."
     Namespaces in XML Errata
     -- http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-names-19990114-errata#NE10

We also peeked at XML 1.1 CR:
    QName ::= PrefixedName | UnprefixedName
    Namespaces in XML 1.1, W3C Candidate Recommendation 18 December 2002
    -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml-names11-20021218/#NT-QName

which keeps the same distinction.
