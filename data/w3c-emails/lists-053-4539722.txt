I believe that is correct, but we should kick either the minute taker (you) 
or the chair (me) for not making sure this was clear :)

The proposed new text is a bit heavy.  I don't want to get to much into 
wordsmithing, but there was some suggestion of adding a note that Qnames 
don't have to have prefixes.  I wonder if it works:

[[
In order to encode the graph in XML, the nodes and arcs have to be 
represented by XML element names, attribute names, element content and 
attribute content. RDF/XML uses XML QNames to represent RDF URI References. 
The namespace prefix part of all QNames is associated with a URI Reference 
as defined in XML Namespaces [XML-NS]. (Note: if a default namespace is 
defined, the prefix is optional)...
]]

You're call which you prefer.

And please don't forget the "Please reply, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org 
indicating whether this is an acceptable resolution of the comment."
