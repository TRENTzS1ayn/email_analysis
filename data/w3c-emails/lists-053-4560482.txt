I think this document enhances Tim's case.

The only occurrence of bagID in the doc is to create a bag that has a 
matching aboutEach - which we axed.

Moreover, judging from the surrounding RDF/XML the document author appears 
to want every triple generated within the XML element to be reified into 
the bag, rather than only the toplevel triples (as we clarified).

i.e. this document shows a use of a construct that is not bagID which is 
useful with a construct which is not RDF.

bagID was an ugly sibling to aboutEach and should have been chopped at the 
same time.
