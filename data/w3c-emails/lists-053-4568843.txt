It isn't the only one, it is just one I knew of, there were hundreds
(I didn't bother to count) more references on google.

and I agreed with you - at the time.

I also put off implementing rdf:bagID in my parser, expecting we
would kill it.  But we didn't.

This point is, the WG made the decision so what new information is
there to remove it?  That we removed aboutEach?  No, that was before.

If we were to remove it, we would owe people a good reason and would
have to make sure it really wasn't used or useful.

If we were having another last call syntax WD, it would mean new LC
WD test cases, LC WD primer to follow the changes, probably not the
others in this case.
