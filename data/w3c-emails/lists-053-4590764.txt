Possibly treding on Graham's toes ...

Propose to close both issues as "not in this version".

Draft respose to Bob:

[[
Dear Bob,

as a result of other concerns about Section 4 of concepts, it has been
struck in its entirety. Hence, neither of the detailed issues we recorded
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#macgregor-01
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#macgregor-02
about this section seem pertinent any more, and we are closing them with no
further action.

+ boiler plate.
]]

Jeremy
