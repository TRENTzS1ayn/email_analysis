Summary: accept in full.

Propose to make the following changes to the documents:

Syntax:
=======
In section 7.2.17
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#parseTypeLiteralPr
opertyElt
Old text:
[[
This specification allows some freedom to choose exactly what string is used
as the lexical form of an XML Literal. Whatever string is used, it MUST
correspond to an XML document when enclosed within a start and end element
tag, and its canonicalization (without comments, as defined in Exclusive XML
Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]) MUST be the same as the same canonicalization
of the literal text l. It is often acceptable to use l without any changes
but this is incorrect if, for example, l uses entity references or namespace
prefixes defined in the outer XML document.

]]

New text:
[[
The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal
is the Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N])
with comments and with empty <a href="
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#def-InclusiveNamespaces
-PrefixList
">
InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList
</a>
of the
literal text l, i.e. the entire element content
of this property element.
]]

In section 7.2.34
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#literal
add final paragraph
[[
The string-value for the resulting event is discussed in
<link>section 7.2.17</link>.
]]

In section 6
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#section-Data-Model
replace:
[[This specification does not require that N-Triples be used to represent
an RDF Graph.]]

by
[[
This specification permits any
<a href="rdf-concepts#implementation-note">representation</a>
of an RDF Graph (see [RDF Concepts]); in particular, it
does not require the use of N-Triples.
]]

Concepts
========

In current section 5 (to become 4)
old text:
[[
The value space
is the set of all XML documents that:
+ Have root element tag: <rdf-wrapper>
+ Have no attributes on the root element other than xml:lang
+ are Canonical XML [XML-C14N] (with comments).
]]

new text
[[

is the set of all XML documents that:
+ Have the fixed but arbitrary root element: <rdf-wrapper>
+ Have no attributes on the root element other than xml:lang
+ are <a href="

</a>).
]]

old text:
[[
The lexical space
contains all pairs ( string, lang ) where lang is any language identifier
[RFC-3066] in lowercase, and string is well-balanced, self-contained XML
element content [XML], for which the XML document corresponding to the pair
is a well-formed XML document [XML] that also conforms to XML Namespaces
[XML-NS].
also contains all strings string which are well-balanced, self-contained XML
element content [XML], and for which the corresponding XML document is a
well-formed XML document [XML] that also conforms to XML Namespaces
[XML-NS].
]]
new text:
[[
The lexical space
is the union of the set of all pairs ( string, lang ) and the set of all
strings string,
for which:
+ lang is any language identifier [RFC-3066] normalized to lowercase;
+ string is well-balanced, self-contained XML element content [XML];

</a>);
+ the XML document corresponding to the pair or the string is a well-formed
XML document [XML] that also conforms to XML Namespaces [XML-NS].
]]

old text:
[[
The mapping
is defined as the function that maps a pair or string to the canonical form
[XML-C14N] (with comments) of the corresponding XML document.
]]

new text:
[[
The mapping
is defined as the function that maps a pair or string to the corresponding
XML document.
]]

+  add implementation note at end of abstract syntax section (old 6, new 5)

[[
<a name="implementation-note"> </a>
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
This section describes an *abstract* syntax which describes
equality of literals and equivalence of graphs. This is the
syntax over which the formal semantics are defined.
Implementations are free to represent literals and RDF graphs in
any other equivalent form.  As an example:
literals with datatype <tt>rdf:XMLLiteral</tt>s can be represented
in a non-canonical
format, and canonicalization performed during the comparison between two
such literals. In both this example, and in the example
<a href="#lang-implementation-note">above</a>
the comparisons may be
being performed either between syntactic structures or
between their denotations in the domain of discourse.
Implementations that do not require such comparisons can
hence be optimized.
]]

(The lang-implementation-note is in a subsequent e-mail subject tex-01).

Semantics
========
+ follow concepts as appropriate
  (Note: there is still rdf:XMLLiteral as a special case because even though
the mapping is simplified, it is still there, and it still requires the lang
tag as an argument).
ACTION jjc To help pat to do this.
