Summary: duck and swerve - neither accept nor reject

Background: anxiety that normalizing language tags to lowercase is
non-standard.

solution: clarify that implementations should preserve case, leave abstract
syntax in lowercase.

Old text:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-concepts-20030123/#section-Graph-Literal

Add new Note before the other two
[[
<a name="lang-implementation-note"> </a>
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
This section has described part of an abstract syntax (see
<a href="implementation-note">below</a>), not an implementation.
Implementations should preserve the case of language identifiers for:
+ round-tripping.
+ interaction with other software that conforms with [RFC 3066]
Document authors are reminded that [ISO 3166] recommends,
but does not require, that country codes be in uppercase,
as in the RFC-3066 language identifier
usually written as "en-US".
Implementations may, for example, choose to implement the abstract syntax
by using case insensitive comparison for language tags, rather than also
storing a case normalized form.
]]

The new ref to ISO 3166 could be normative, since it is already part of the
normative closure of RDF Concepts, or it could be informative, to stress
that this implementation note is informative.

Proposed new test case (in directory tex-01?)

<rdf:Description>
  <eg:prop xml:lang="en-US">Hello world</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

entails, and is entailed by


<rdf:Description>
  <eg:prop xml:lang="En-us">Hello world</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>
