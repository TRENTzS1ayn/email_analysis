Issue was raised in this fashion ...

Tex-02:
[[
2) With respect to the rules for comparing literals:
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Literal-Equality

For reasons of standardization and ease of use, there should exist a higher
level matching rule that allows one to search for (lang="en", str) and to
get
matches to more detailed tags (lang="en-gb", str).
This higher level rule should be defined to
insure a standard practice. I assume this is, or will be, defined somewhere
else in RDF. Presumably this rule will also provide for inclusion of strings
with no attribute as well, so I can search for a string and find all matches
with relevant sets of lang attributes.

To repeat the earlier point, the comparison rule should also be made case
insensitive for language identifiers.

Proposed response:
[[
We have added this to the postponed issues list.
We have also asked the co-ordination group to note that better support for
langauge related operations is needed.

A sketch solution, that is outside our current charter to consider in
detail, is as follows:

For each language tag define two clases:
For example for language tag en-US define

<rdfs:Class rdf:about=
  "http://www.w3.org/example/lang#en-US" >
  <rdfs:comment>The class of all plain literals and XMLLiterals with
language tag en-US</rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:Class>
<rdfs:Class rdf:about=
  "http://www.w3.org/example/lang2#en-US" >
  <rdfs:comment>The class of all plain literals and XMLLiterals with
language tag which has
                en-US as a prefix</rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:Class>

Then a combination of rdf range constraints, and various OWL constructs, can
be used to query/search/describe language tagged literals within the
semantic web.

?? Some of the RDF Core WG would be willing to work with I18N IG members to
pursue this.
?? Not in charter for us to do so.
]]

Note for discussion,
we currently have no way of describing the class of plain literals within
RDFS; this feels like a related defect.
