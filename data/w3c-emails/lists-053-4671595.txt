I'd prefer we did this.  We've greatly variety on the abstract RDF
syntax and after requiring XC14N with comments, this seems the last
one.  Would it be so bad to just require it?  I can't weigh up the
downsides of that since I'm not an I18N expert, I can't recall the
detail of their anxiety.

[aside:
I've been wondering about having excess NOTEs in our WDs.  Is it just
clarifying a point or are we leaving a normative section?  Seems that
if it is important, it should be in the main body.  Here an
implementation note, which is a good reason, but there are many
others.

It is?  Does it say that?  I was assuming it was normative.

I will have to review what all NOTEs say and consider moving them
into the body.

Possibly.  An RDF/XML to Ntriples test case is the only thing a
parser can test (and there are more of them than RDF inferencers) so 
would be better.  I don't think you necessarily need entails & entails-by
to get the point across.

 <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/">
   <eg:prop xml:lang="en-US">Hello world</eg:prop>
 </rdf:Description>

entails
  <http://example.org/> <http://example.org/prop> "Hello world"@en-us.


and
 <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/">
   <eg:prop xml:lang="en-us">Hello world</eg:prop>
 </rdf:Description>

entails (the same file)
  <http://example.org/> <http://example.org/prop> "Hello world"@en-us.


This would require ntriples to be modified to require languages in
lowercase which might be compatible with this proposal, since it is a
concrete version of the abstract syntax.
