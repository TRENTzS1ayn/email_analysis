I would argue to reject rather than postpone this issue, for reasons set 
out in my response [1].  (I could be persuaded otherwise if real value can 
be argued for a higher-level matching rule in RDF, but I've not yet seen 
any such compelling argument.)

I note that rejecting this issue doesn't mean that a future working group 
can't pick it up again.  It would indicate that the present working group 
doesn't feel that further consideration is required.
