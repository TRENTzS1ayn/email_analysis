I've looked at this review, which is 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0489.html 
BTW.

The comments listed under "1. Notes on RDF Primer" seem to be comments 
that may have been induced by *reading* the Primer, but they don't seem 
to be comments on the Primer per se.  They have to do with (1) why typed 
literals are designed the way they are (not specifically to how they are 
presented in the Primer) and (2) whitepace (which the Primer doesn't 
talk about at all).  Someone may want to check me on this, but I think 
they are general issues about specific aspects of RDF, not about the 
Primer (although the Primer may change depending on what, if anything, 
the WG wants to do about these things).
