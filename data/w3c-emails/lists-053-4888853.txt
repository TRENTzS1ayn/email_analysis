Correct.

Correct.

Correct.

That's a bug - should be fixed.

I will first try to say why the text is clear and unambiguous, but I am
obviously on weak ground, given that it was not clear for you:

The "Exclusive XML Canonicalization" is a process relating the literal text
l to the lexical form whereas "exclusive canonical XML" is a class of text.
You appear to find a misreading in which the lexical form = the literal text
l and both are requried to be exclusive canonical XML.

Dave do you want to make editorial changes to the agreed text, or would you
like me to propose some variations. A very simple one might be to s/E/e/
s/C/c/ and then link "exclusive XML canonicalization" to the right part of
XML-XC14N.
