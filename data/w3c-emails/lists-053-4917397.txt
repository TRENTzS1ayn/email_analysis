We can't speak in terms of "the parser", this is a mapping between
forms.  So if we want the mapping to include XML canonicalization, it
has to go in the mapping section of (in this case) the appropriate
RDF/XML grammar action.

It is relevant to implementing the mapping of RDF/XML to the RDF graph.

No.  It belongs where the mapping is defined.  Plus it has been
changed to be normative (MUST), not as present recommended (SHOULD).

Going
   RDF/XML -> uncanonicalized XML syntax -> canonicalized XML
              in graph syntax               in graph syntax 

seems wrong.  We've agreed that the graph has canonicalized XML,
therefore the documents that map to it must describe how to
get there.
