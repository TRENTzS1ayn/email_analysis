It would not, however, support an inference of the following

|-
ex:s ex:p "foo"@tag^^ex:bar

since the RDF semantic conditions require that language tags are
ignored in non-XML typed literals.

I did a test and (unfortunately) we get that

:bar owl:sameAs rdf:XMLLiteral.
:s :p "foo"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral.

entails

:s :p "foo"@fr^^:bar.

on the grounds of our owl:sameAs interpretation
(we substitute equals for equals)
I wonder what we should do with that...
