Looking into all this messages/issues wrt rdf:XMLLiteral
I would second a proposal to change the semantics in the
way that lang tags in rdf:XMLLiteral-typed literals would
be ignored by the semantics and reflect that in the testcase
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/datatypes/Manifest#language-and-xml-literal
which would then become a rtest:PositiveEntailmentTest i.e.

eg:foo eg:bar "chat"@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral.

entails

eg:foo eg:bar "chat"@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral.

I've tested that with a test implementation
and also made a bug correction so that

:aaa :ppp "sss".

|-

:aaa :ppp _:x.
_:x rdf:type rdfs:Literal.

As far as I've been able to read/test it, I agree
with the other changes Pat made in the MT
which is an impressive piece of work!
