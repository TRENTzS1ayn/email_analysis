Please change this to something akin to

"The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with
 XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes..."

OK.

Should we say "denoted" rather than "identified" (given the
current bruhaha about what "identify" means...?

Typo? "RDF *may* be used..."

Should we rather say "part of the datatype definition". It is not
clear (to me at least) that the facets are part of the datatype,
in the same way as e.g. the lexical/value spaces, etc.)

Rather, the facets serve to define what those lexical/value spaces are
and are mechanisms of the definition/interpretation of the datatype,
not of the datatype itself.

This is demonstrated by the fact that the same datatype can be 
defined in various ways using various XML Schema means, such as
defining xsd:int using only a regular expression defining the
lexical space rather than min/max values constraining the value
space. Thus, facets are part of the definition of the datatype,
not of the datatype itself, and RDF is concerned only with what
is part of the datatype (the lexical/value spaces and L2V mapping).
If facets are used to define the datatype, that is irrelevant
to RDF.

Right.
