That sounds very reasonable; I can live with that.

If lang tags in rdf:XMLLiteral typed literals are to be ignored,
then why would we preserve them in the graph for *any* of the
typed literals?

If it is in fact decided that the entailment below is valid and
reflected by the MT, then let's just nuke the lang tags from
typed literals.
