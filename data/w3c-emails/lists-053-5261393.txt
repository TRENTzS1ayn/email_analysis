That feels to me like a step backward from what M&S provides (sort of).

e.g.
<rdf:RDF xml:lang="en">
...
  <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal">I did <em>not</em> 
like that</eg:prop>
...
</rdf:RDF>

==>

<eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><span xml:lang="en">I did <em>not</em> 
like that</span></eg:prop>
