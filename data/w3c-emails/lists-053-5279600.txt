The old treatment was in say:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-concepts-20020829/

I think that the reagle issue resolutions would in the main stay, and the
canonicalization would still be specified in the syntax, but with the
implementation note that makes it clear that they "only **need** be
canonicalized when testing for equality."

I have three concerns about this option:

a) we had comments
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002JulSep/0092.html
linking to
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/29-rdfcadm-tbl.html#xtocid103643

and

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002JulSep/0165.html

both of which would need resurrecting, since we have followed up saying that
we have changed in the way they sort of wanted.


b) how difficult would it be for Pat to go back and rework

c) impact on OWL support for XML Literals - webont are generally negative
about them, the more work they have to do, the less support there will be in
OWL for these.
