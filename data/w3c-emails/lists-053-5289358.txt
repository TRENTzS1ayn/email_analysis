That looks right. Along with reverting the NTriples to the
XML"..."@nn syntax.

Right.

The key argument here is that RDF applications shouldn't have to have
XML infoset processors in order to compare XML literals. I don't see
how the proposed change affects that. If one is going to compare XML
literal values, one must canonicalize them. That is true whether the
values are treated as datatype values or built in XML literal values.

So the requirements on RDF processors appear to be equivalent whether
we treat XML literals as typed literals or M&S like XML literals.

If I understand what is being said here (and I'm not 100% sure I do), the
key concern relevant to option 1 is about why we would have a special
type of literal to handle XML literals rather than just a built-in datatype.

The answer (now, presuming we nuke lang tags in typed literals) is that
per M&S, XML literals can be qualified by lang tag just as can plain 
literals and the lang tag is significant to equality tests, so XML literals
can't be addressed by a datatype, because typed literals don't take lang
tags.

And our charter (probably) precludes making lang tags irrelevant for
XML literals.

Thus, both plain and XML literals remain pretty much as defined in M&S,
with necessarily clarifications regarding canonicalization, etc.

Right, but I think we know what our responses would be, if we
went with option 1.

The question is whether the persons submitting the comments would be
agreeable to the revision.

Good question. Pat?

In a sense, we're not really changing the bulk of what is said about
XMLLiterals:

1. the RDF/XML syntax remains the same
2. the NTriples syntax is analogous to the the present representation 
   (just moving a datatype URI 'rdf:XMLLiteral' at the end to an 'XML'
    flag at the start)
3. canonicalization and equality tests remain the same
4. the semantics essentially remain the same in that one has a pair
   of lexical form and (optionally absent) lang tag mapping to an
   XML literal value

It's simply the disassociation of XML Literals with the RDF Datatyping
machinery that needs to be done -- and doing so notably simplifies
RDF Datatyping (which I would presume OWL would be happy about).
