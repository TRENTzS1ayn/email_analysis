Not very difficult.  I am ready for almost any decision we make, I 
think. I have the relevant changes scoped out for them all, and will 
do the edits once we decide.

But...

...right. BUt then, Webont are free to rule out this part of RDF from 
OWL, and take the resulting heat from their user community.

I think it would be easier for OWL if it were presented with XML 
literals as a distinct syntactic category, since that would enable 
them to deny equality substitution inside XML literals without 
compromising their semantics.
