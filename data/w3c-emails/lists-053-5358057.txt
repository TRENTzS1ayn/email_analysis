Im an invited expert so have no organization. For myself, I don't 
formally object to anything concerning timbl-03. I personally agree 
with Tim that these (type List) triples are redundant, and I would 
bet that the OWL stuff, even if it does need them, could be trivially 
rewritten so that it did not. I was hoping that we could get back to 
Peter and find out whether he thought the problem was serious.  ButI 
don't feel strongly enough about the issue to hold up resolving it 
one way or the other, so you can rely on me to vote abstain in 
future..
