Folks,

The Semantic Web activity having run out of time, has applied for a charter 
extension (member only link)

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2003AprJun/0022.html

The extension requests sufficient time for RDFCore and WEBONT to finish up 
what they are doing.  I expect a further extension to be requested to move 
on with new work after that.  Please encourage your AC reps to support the 
extension.

As part of the extension the CG has agreed a new schedule for RDFCore:

[[
The following schedule is planned. Revisions of this schedule must be 
agreed through the Semantic Web Coordination Group.

     * Last Call : Jan 2003
     * Proposed Recommendations: June 2003
     * Recommendation : July 2003
     * Errata / Wrap-up : July 2003 - Jan 2004
]]

Brian
