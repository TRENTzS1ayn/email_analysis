Well, really I'm counting them as done when we have completed the whole 
dance and got a response to our resolution from the commentor.

I can't confirm that.  I've been tracking responses to commentors on the 
misguided assumption that responses would go out soon after the 
resolution.  A mistake to be corrected next time around.

I suppose I could refactor my records to track the actual resolutions but 
I'm not sure its worth it at this stage.
