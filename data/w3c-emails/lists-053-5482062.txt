There was a hack I could do to show resolutions until the formal responses 
come out which I've now done:

   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/

With that filled in, I can:

agree that those you list are still to be resolved.

We have not resolved tex-01 - you have an action to update the proposal.

   2003-03-28#16  jjc  update proposal on tex-01

so according to my records that is still on the list as well.

18 done and 6 to go.

Brian
