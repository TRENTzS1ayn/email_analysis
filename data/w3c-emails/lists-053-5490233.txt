Regarding my action...

ACTION 20030425#5 danc figure out the cost to WebOnt of accepting
timbl-03

where timbl-03 is short for
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#timbl-03

The relevant bit of the OWL spec is:

"the ontologies in O, taken together, provide a type for every
individual ID;"
 -- Web Ontology Language (OWL) Abstract Syntax and Semantics
Section 4. Mapping to RDF Graphs
 http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/mapping.html#4.1
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-semantics-20030331/mapping.html#4.1

And without the rdf:List triples, the collection syntax
doesn't meet that constraint.

Jeremy and Peter discussed the cost of relaxing that constraint,
and it seems, to me, to be considerable: the details of the
mapping of owl-dl-abstract-syntax to RDF graphs are somewhat
subtle and impact many parts of the S&AS spec, especially
the semantic layering bits.
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.3-Semantic-Layering

Meanwhile, note that the exact details of the mapping
to RDF graphs were not decided by consensus; there is
an outstanding objection (from JJC/HP).
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.26-OWLDLSyntax


In sum, the rdf:List triples do serve a purpose in the graph
syntax of OWL; a purpose which rdfs:domain/rdfs:range won't
help with.
