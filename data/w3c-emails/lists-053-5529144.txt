I believe you and Tim are right and I tested with my

[[
An experience that we implemented is that we create a

triple when we load a

triple.

dropped and it all worked out quite well
(at that time I hadn't thought about domain and range)
So I also think we should accept it.

Adding them is a valid entailment. Removing them is not. There would
be no reason to remove them if they had not been gratuitously added
in the first place by special fiat from the syntax rules.

That seems like a VERY weak argument; it is purely aesthetic, and it
is predicated on a reduction of List to a form of typing, which
itself is highly arguable in OWL in any case (try selling that line
to Ian and watch his face carefully). And the disadvantage for many
other uses of RDF is considerable: the collection syntax - already
rather overkill for many purposes but likely to be widely used
because of the incredibly bad job we have done with containers - now
is obliged to generate 50% more triples than it did formerly, none of
which provide the slightest extra information. Given that lists are
likely to be ubiquitous in many 'layerings' on top of RDF, this seems
to me like a very bad decision for RDF to make on dubious aesthetic
grounds in OWL.

Seems to me that timbl-03 is a reasonable request which it would be
trivial for us to comply with and which identifies an error we made,
or maybe copied from DAML. The only reason to reject it was because,
we were told, Webont needed us to reject it; and apparently Webont
does not need us to reject it. So I think we should accept it.

But these triples, notably, provide absolutely no functionality of that
kind.
