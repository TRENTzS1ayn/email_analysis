Maybe.

I'll expand a little on that comment:  there were some steps that I did not 
find were clearly spelled out, but when I actually looked at the specific 
abstract syntax and transformation rules there didn't seem to me to be any 
likely alternative interpretations.

Hmmm... possibly tricky.

1. Based on the specific transformation rules I've looked at in detail, I 
think that some reverse transformations could reasonably be constructed.  I 
can't be confident about all the rules without attempting a full 
implementation.

2. My concern is that it is not obvious to me that the reverse 
transformation would be unique.   I'm (vaguely) concerned that different 
combinations of RDF triples might be usable to construct different abstract 
syntax.  The document itself says this is possible, but that any AS thus 
obtained would have the same meaning.  A related question might be:  how do 
I know I've done a complete reverse transformation?  That is not at all 
clear to me.

Is this really a requirement?  Why is it necessary to map RDF to abstract 
syntax?  I guess it's something to do with defining the semantics, but the 
OWL AS&S spec claims to contain a semantics based directly on the RDF 
triples.  I would assume the mapping (one way or the other) is needed as 
part of a proof of equivalence, but I don't see any operational need to map 
the RDF triples into OWL AS.

Regarding the OWL AS->RDF triples mapping, I would say:

(a) recommend slightly more explanation of the transformation table.  I 
think the table itself is probably OK, possibly modulo small 
adjustments.  I roughly sketched an example in my previous message, which 
could certainly be improved, but which I hope suggests a modest level of 
additional detail that would be helpful.

(b) that said, I think it's probably OK for proceeding to Proposed REC, but 
note that multiple interoperable implementations would be the appropriate 
proof-of-the-pudding for moving further along the REC track.

Regarding RDF->AS mapping, if this is really needed, I think more needs to 
be said about the selection of triples from an RDF graph.  Once triples are 
selected for a given transformation rule, I think applying the 
transformation in reverse should be relatively straightforward in most cases.

Since Jan has reviewed the entire document, I'd be interested to hear his 
comments on whether I'm looking at the right aspects of this.

Sure.  I expect LHS=nonterminal, RHS=expansion.  This was just a sketch -- 
actual wording details are not fully worked out.
