You have incoming RDF/XML off the wire - is it Owl FULL, DL or Lite?

I was imagining that the abstract syntax might be a good abstraction on 
which to build an implementation.  So if your implementation is based on 
the abstract syntax, you'll need to translate incoming rdf/xml into that 
syntax for processing.

But I'm out of my depth here.  I just noticed that you'd looked at the 
rules one way round and wondered whether the inverse was significant.

OK - that sounds like no official comment from RDFCore is needed - or would 
you like WG endorsement?

And from Jeremy.  Jan may be at xml europe.
