I'm not currently aware of any other.

I think that we need to be dogmatic to the extent that
(a) the syntax specification states what (minimum) triples are generated 
from some RDF/XML input, and
(b) the semantics specification states what a collection of triples means,
such that taken together they give a complete account of what some given 
RDF/XML means as RDF(S).

Beyond that, and here I think I agree with you, I think it's up to layered 
specifications to "condition" the RDF graph in any way they may need to 
ensure that the layered semantics work out as desired.
