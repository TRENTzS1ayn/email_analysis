Ummm... I don't think section 4.1 really helps there at all.

Section 4.2, which I didn't review, has something to say about this.  It 
gives some rules to determine whether some RDF graph is an Owl-lite or 
Owl-DL ontology.  Presumably anything that doesn't satisfy either of these 
criteria is Owl-full.  But the rule is stated in terms of an AS->Graph 
transformation, so I'm not sure they constitute an effective procedure for 
making such a determination.

There's a point that isn't entirely clear to me:
   "the ontologies in O taken together provide a type for every individual ID"
What about mixtures of arbitrary RDF and OWL ontology statements?
Does this mean that every individual must have an explicit type statement?
Exactly what counts as an individual for the purposes of this assertion?

Which suggests, then, that the intended purpose of the mapping tables 
should be spelt out more clearly?  I said up-front that I'm not familiar 
with this stuff, so I just took the material as I found it, without any a 
priori expectation of its use.  That use not being stated, maybe there's 
room here for different guessing?

To be honest, I'm not sure why *any* such comment requires WG endorsement, 
except when there's an abuse of or contradiction with the WG's own 
specifications.  But we were asked to provide review, and I was asked to 
contribute a bit, without being clear (to me) what was the larger 
goal.  The only goal I was aware of was to provide some additional input to 
reinforce or mitigate some aspects of Jan's review.

Which prompts me to look up Jan's comment on this:
[[
4.1
[note] While the abstract syntax naturally associates (via syntactic
nesting) ontologies with all their directives, no such association is
made in teh RDF graph expression of the ontology (apart from
Annotations). I can see why this is the case.

I'm not really sold on the translation table; I think the meaning of it
is unclear. However, I'm stumped as to an alternative compact expression
of the translation into RDF Graph form so feel free to ignore this
comment.
]]

I think the association/nesting is captured in RDF in the shape of the graph.

Jan (also) seems to have assumed the table is for "translation into RDF 
Graph form".  I think the table is OK, but would benefit from a little more 
explanation.
