Wherever any part of the OWL-XX syntactic conditions currently 
mention triples of the form

xxx rdf:type rdf:List

that reference is modified to refer to triples of the form

xxx rdf:first yyy
or
zzz rdf:rest xxx
or
xxx rdf:rest zzz

which could all be called 'list triples of xxx' or some such phrase. 
A minor edit to the text, no significant change to any actual 
conditions.
