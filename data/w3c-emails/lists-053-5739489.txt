Well, if I follow this right, rdf:List is in the RDF disallowed 
vocabulary, so any vocabulary which asserts anything to be of that 
type would not be a separated vocabulary in any case, since it would 
be using disallowed vocabulary as a class ID; and the same would 
apply with the suggested modification since both rdf:first and 
rdf:rest are also disallowed and hence cannot be property IDs. Either 
way, lists had better not be mentioned in the ontologies in O.
