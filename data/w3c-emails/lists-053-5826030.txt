These are for the Option 1 and Option 3, I will keep those names.

Both options:

PROPOSE reopen
   pfps-08 reagle-01 reagle-02

then

... (below)

then
   propose close
   pfps-08 reagle-01 reagle-02
accepting all three comments.


Option 1:

PROPOSE
   XML Literals are as in the working drafts prior to November 2002, in 
which it was not a typed literal, but a special sort of literal,
with the changes made as a result of the reagle-01 and reagle-02 issues. 
(i,e. exc-c14n performed in the syntax document)
   Typed literals to exclude the language tag in the abstract syntax.

editors of Syntax, Concepts, Test and Semantics actioned to come back with 
text, based on current editors drafts, and last version before we switched 
to the rdf:XMLLiteral type, for the group approval.

Option 3:
PROPOSE
   Typed literals, including XML Literal, to exclude the language tag in 
the abstract syntax.
   XML Literals to be refactored by deleting the <rdf-wrapper> text from 
concepts and putting it into syntax (probably in para 7.2.17).
   Add the following implementation note (or similar) to syntax.
   Change NTriples in test cases to show explicit <rdf-wrapper> for all 
XMLLiterals.

editors of Syntax, Concepts, Test and Semantics actioned to come back with 
text, based on current editors drafts, and issue resolution for the group 
approval.

Suggested implementation note for Syntax doc:
[[[
NOTE: Implementors are reminded that they are free to represent the RDF 
graph in whatever way is appropriate, and there is no obligation to use 
N-triples or any specific concrete representation of the abstract syntax. 
Specifically, RDF/XML implementations that wish to manipulate XML Literals 
as XML may find it more appropriate to represent this lexical form as two 
components: the XML element content and the language tag (if any) - these 
two components could be combined to give the abstract syntax representation 
if needed.
