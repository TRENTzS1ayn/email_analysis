9: Issue xmlsch-07 datatype definition

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-07

Formal proposal to not accept this comment as it has been withdrawn by
the xml schema group:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0316.html



10: Issue tex-01
According to the IRC log:

  http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-04-04#T16-21-39

we resolved tex-01 on the 4th April but this was not recorded in the IRC log.

Therefore propose, as was previously agreed and not recorded:

  - classify tex-01 as a clarification
  - add the following note to concepts:
[[
 Note: The case normalization of language tags is part of
 the description of the abstract syntax, and implicitly the abstract
 behaviour of RDF applications. It is not intended to constrain an
 RDF implementation to actually normalize the case. Crucially, the result
 of comparing two language tags should not be sensitive to the case of
 the original input.
]]
 - add the following test cases
[[
  <rdf:Description>
    <eg:prop xml:lang="en-us">a</eg:prop>
  </rdf:Description>

entails

  <rdf:Description>
    <eg:prop xml:lang="EN-us">a</eg:prop>
  </rdf:Description>

entails

  <rdf:Description>
    <eg:prop xml:lang="en-US">a</eg:prop>
  </rdf:Description>
]]

JJC please update/correct as necessary.



11: Issue timbl-03

We had a couple of proposals:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0262.html
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0280.html

But could not agree.

Decided to investigate cost to WEBONT of changing:

20030425#5  danc  figure out the cost to WebOnt of accepting timbl-03
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0040.html
too high.

Others disagree - its a small change
  PatH
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0058.html
  JJC
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0066.html

However, jjc favours keeping the type triples because its better for Owl DL
to require type triples everywhere, than have special cases where they
are needed in some places and not in others.



12: Language tags in typed literals
At last weeks telecon a straw poll indicated we were of a mind that having
lang tags in the abstract syntax of typed literals was a mistake.

After some discussion on the list Jeremy has offered two options for removing them:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0071.html

A co-chair would like us to be clear about the advantages/effects of these
changes.



13: Issue xmlsch-01 Typed Literal Structure

Various proposals to close:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0247.html
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0252.html



14: Issue xmlsch-02 Whitespace facets

Proposal:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0224.html



15: Semantics Issues
We have several semantics issues:

  horst-01
  pfps-01
  pfps-03
  pfps-05
  pfps-09

That I suspect we are ready to close, but we need a formal motion to 
close them.
