The reopen these issues is essentially a formal device for indicating that 
in my opinion we should notify pfps, reagle, and the others of any changes 
to rdf:XMLLiteral that we make.
Option 2, which had no support on the list, makes no changes to XMLLiteral 
and hence would not require this.

If we were to go with option 3 in particular, (but to a lesser extent 
option 1), we have made a change that allows us to be more positive about 
pfps-08 - that seems like an advantage.

Having the language tags on the xsd typed literals is decidedly odd - so 
option 2 seems like a no-brainer (that really is the small change of just 
syntactically omitting semantically irrelevant language tags for the types 
other than rdf:XMLLiteral) - we then have to decide whether we are happy to 
have rdf:XMLLiteral as both a syntactic and semantic anomolous datatype or 
fix it - either option 1 by not having it as a datatype or option 3  by not 
having anomolous.

I think either of those are advantageous. Maybe not sufficiently so.
