Vote: yes for either Option 1 or Option 4. Prefer Option 4 over 1.

The great advantage, as Graham pointed out, is simplifying datatyping,
where the role of lang tags has cause alot of confusion and a good
bit of strangeness in the specification.

Option 4 simplifies matters the most, I think, and also has the
added benefit that XML literals can be used for modular content
management without concern of infection from the particulars of
a given RDF/XML serialization (i.e. xml:lang attributes).

Vote: reject, and agree that reasonable explanation be provided
