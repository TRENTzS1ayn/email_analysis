[[
A:  Option 2
   straw poll:
   "We prefer Option 2 to no change."


If Yes then
     straw poll - we prefer option 1 to option 2     
     straw poll - we prefer option 3 to option 2     
     straw poll - we prefer option 4 to option 2

each with fors, against and strongly against (i.e. would vote against in formal vote).

Chair to put question (option 1,2,3 or 4) based on results of staw polls.

If no to A, then no question is put.


]]

Rationale:

Option 2 is the smallest sensible change, if we prefer the status quo to option 2, then we should do nothing. Otherwise we should decide to go for option 2 or more sophisticated, and then see if we have support for a more sophisticated XMLLiteral solution (options 1, 3 or 4).
