No.

Don't you mean, if No, then

Why?

That seems to be somewhat manipulative.

One can prefer no change over option 2 yet still strongly
prefer option 1, 3, or 4 over both option 2 and over no change.

I would rather put the question as follows:

"We prefer one of the options 1-4 over no change"

If Yes, then

   Prefered options: any of 1 - 4, in order of preference
   Can live with:    any of 1 - 4
   Can't live with:  any of 1 - 4

--

My vote would then be:

"We prefer one of the options 1-4 over no change" - Yes

If Yes, then

   Prefered options: 4, 1
   Can live with:    2
   Can't live with:  3 (reason: making the wrapper real)
