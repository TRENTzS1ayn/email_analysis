Possible proposal:

PROPOSE: that RDF Core asks WebOnt WG to decide this issue.

Pat and Dan might be better placed to say than me, but it might be best to
delay another week ... :( (I was not at the webont telecon, and there are no
minutes or IRC as yet, but got signs of a lack of resolution in the e-mail)
