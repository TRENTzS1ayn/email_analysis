This message summarises the disadvantages of each proposal (and the fifth option of doing nothing).

Doing nothing
=============

This leaves a language tag in the syntax of literals such as "2"@en^^xsd:int, which is (a) explicitly meaningless and (b) without rationale.
This is likely to lead to user and implementor confusion and possible interoperability problems.

This design was negatively received in earlier drafts.

With XMLLiteral as a distinct thing from typed literals then more implementors may choose not to implement it, causing interoperability problems between systems that support XML Literal, and ones that don't.

This excerbates rdf:XMLLiteral being an anomolous datatype, in that the syntax is anomolous as well as the semantics.
This then has similar dangers  (to option 1) of a schism between implementors who can be bothered with it, and those who can't.

This is ugly in the syntax, and the <rdf-wrapper> hack becomes increasingly in-your-face. There is also a danger of non-backward interoperability with people who used to generate

<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<p>This comes from RDF</p>
</body>
</html>
Now getting
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<p><rdf-wrapper>This comes from RDF</rdf-wrapper></p>
</body>
</html>

This makes it awkward to embed xhtml inside RDF maintaining language information. Since this is an important use case we probably need to:
1) make sure that examples are included in syntax or the primer showing use of 
<span xml:lang="en"> to include langauge information inside a literal.
2) give clear warnings
3) alert I18N
