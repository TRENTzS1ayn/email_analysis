PROPOSE RDF Core accepts the comment xmlsch-02 and agree to add the
following test case:


<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.example.org/a">
   <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;int">3</eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

Does not entail

<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.example.org/a">
   <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;int"> 3 </eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

Moreover the following comment to be added to concepts:

[[
NOTE: In [XML Schema (part 1)], white space normalization occurs
during validation according to the value of the whiteSpace
facet. The lexical-to-value mapping used in RDF datatyping
occurs after this, so that the whiteSpace facet has no
effect in RDF datatyping.
]]
