Yes, this is a consequence of the wording in section 4.2

They're significant, but not showstoppers, I think - at least, that's
what I _thought_, because I was focussing on the use of RDF to express
OWL DL. Looking at the reverse process (going from RDF graphs to the
abstract syntax), it does appear that the idiomatic use of bnodes that
characterise the RDFS applications I've seen thus far (I'm talking about
grassroots stuff like FOAF) doesn't fit well here. That is, I'm coming
around to the point of view that this is maybe more of an issue than it
might at first appear.
