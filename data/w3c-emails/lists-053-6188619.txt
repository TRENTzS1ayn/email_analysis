I had another thought on why WebOnt should remove their dependency on
those triples being stated explicitly rather than implied by rdfs:domain...

...in doing this, they constrain not only the current RDF/XML syntax, but 
all future OWL-friendly RDF syntaxes and markup-based exchange mechanisms. No 
future syntax will be able to just emit the obvious triples. This includes 
whatever folks do in the 'xml schema anntotation' space, XSLT-based transforms, 
N3-ish stuff, the works. 

If they were just constraining the current RDF/XML syntax, it'd be bearable. But
for this to be their legacy for all future syntaxes seems pretty heavy, given 
that the triples are implied.
