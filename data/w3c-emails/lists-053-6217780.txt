If bNodes can only be used as the object of a single triple, they lose most 
of their value as a construct in the language. As does rdf:nodeID for that 
matter. 

<Image>
 <depicts>
  <Person>
    <mbox rdf:resource="mailto:danbri@w3.org"/>
  </Person>
</Image>

<Group>
 <member>
  <Person>
   <homepage rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/People/DanBri/"/>
  </Person>
 </member>
</Group>

...is OK in OWL, but if we add in an rdf:nodeID on the two Person elements
to express that they serialize descriptions of the same (un-named) resource, 
we're in trouble? Ouch. That breaks most of my uses of RDF, and a lot of 
deployed FOAF documents.

What would an OWL friendly re-serialization of the above look like? I guess they
would just invent some URI to name the Person? (yuck...)

If the restriction is that individuals can't be the _object_ of multiple 
triples, we could use an inverse of the 'depicts' of 'member' property instead,
but that's an ugly hack. Is this restriction across all of OWL, or just the 
DL & Lite dialects?
