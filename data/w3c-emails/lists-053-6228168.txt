I would only accept this argument in relation to choosing
option 1 over option 4. As for choosing option 1 over doing
nothing, or option 2 or 3, I think that the implementational
burden is less with this option so would make life easier
for implementors.

Even though option 2 or 3 have fewer types of literals, treating
XML literals as typed literals, the work required to keep sense
of the lang tags is I think greater.

Ugg... sorry, I'm probably making this too complicated ;-)

Yep. Goes from bad to worse, IMO.

Right.
