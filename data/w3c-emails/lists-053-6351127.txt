That's a workaround that works at the OWL layers, but takes away the 
ability for RDF/S tools to be able to answer questions like 
"what groups is this person in, and what's his/her homepage?". By making 
things more acceptable to OWL tools, we make them less scrutable to RDF. A 
painful tradeoff. For FOAF, it's bearable as we use owl:InverseFunctionalProperty
a lot anyway. But this isn't (yet...) common practice. Many RDF parsers are
acquiring rdf:nodeID support; not so many tools do merging on InverseFunctionals
yet.

Oh, I think I knew that and was trying to forget it. Yet more evidence that
the DL/Lite profile of OWL will turn out to be of niche interest, imho. So long 
as it's allowed in OWL Full I can contain my dissapointment...
