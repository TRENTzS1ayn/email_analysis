At its telecon yesterday the Webont WG discussed the "redundant" 
rdf:List triples, following a request from Brian. Unfortunately, we were 
not yet able to come to a WG position wrt. this RDFCore LC issue. The 
problem is that it has impact on a closed Webont issue. We hope to be 
able to provide a Webont position on the rdf:List issue before your 
telecon next week.

We're sorry for the delay.
