We might not be ready to close this one.

The XML Schema rec is clear (sort of like the RDF working drafts :) that
whitespace normalization is performed in part 1, but precisely which
processing is specified in part 2.

i.e. the processing chain is:

input-text => entity substitution => whitespace normalization => [[Lexical
Form]] => lexical-to-value mapping => value


If you look at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#decimal

for example, the defn of lexical space does not include the leading and
trailing blanks.

Whitespace normalization is specified in
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-1-20010502/#section-White-Space-Norm
