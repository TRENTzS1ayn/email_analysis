A further possible RDFCore comment on the owl docs.

-------------------------------

owlref-rdfcore-relationship-to-RDF

RDFCore are concerned about the clarity in the OWL specifications of what 
RDF is legal OWL DL and OWL lite.  This seems to be described only in S+AS 
which is a highly technical document and is likely to be inaccessible to 
many.  On reviewing the reference document some significant restrictions 
were not apparent to the RDFCore reviewer.  We cannot be confident, 
therefore, that other restrictions we would care about, have not been missed.

RDFCore requests therefore, that the specifications be amended to include a 
description of necessary conditions for a RDF document to be in OWL DL and 
OWL Lite.  This description should be as accurate as possible consistent 
with a goal of it being comprehensible to a majority of the community.

Such a description may bring to light further issues.
