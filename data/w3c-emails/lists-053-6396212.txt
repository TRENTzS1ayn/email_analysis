Everything does have a type: Resource

If the hypothesising is so easy, why can't OWL do that for our current 
syntax?

I've registered my discomfort with the OWL design, but I can live with 
compromise. It's time to finish these specs, and a few uglinesses are 
inevitable. This is one of the them, I guess.
