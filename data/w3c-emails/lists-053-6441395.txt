Brian,

I don't know... I thought I was just following up an assigned action, and 
didn't go checking for wider context:

[[
williams-01 (revised proposal):

latest amendment reflect comment from Patrick
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0192.html

RESOLVED:
  williams-01 is rejected, but the text is made more consistent as in msg 0199
UNANIMOUS
ACTION jjc update CONCEPTS in light of decision williams 01
ACTION gk respond wrt williams 01
