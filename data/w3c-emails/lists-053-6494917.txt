As I understand it,

An OWL DL or OWL Lite reasoner reads both the ontology data and the instance 
data and interprets them with the OWL abstract syntax (which has the the 
section called facts for such instance data:
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/syntax.html#2.2
[[
There are two kinds of facts in the OWL abstract syntax. 

The first kind of fact states information about a particular individual, in 
the form of classes that the individual belongs to plus properties and values 
of that individual.
]]
)

All of these are subject to the bnode restrictions - although there are subtle 
differences between those on the unnamed individuals and those on the 
description and restriction nodes. I believe the WG endorsed my comments on 
the unnamed individuals and not the description nodes - which is fair enough.

Graham, if you think you have an issue here that is not covered by the 
comments Brian has sent, I would suggest you send a personal comment.
