I have added the test cases that I think we were discussing to the test suite 
as proposed tests.

These are in

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/xmlsch-02/

test001.rdf Shows the well-formed literal
29:   <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.example.org/a">
30:     <eg:prop rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int"
          >3</eg:prop>
31:   </rdf:Description>



test002.rdf Shows the ill-formed literal
29:   <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.example.org/a">
30:     <eg:prop rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int"
          > 3 </eg:prop>
31:   </rdf:Description>



test003.rdf Is the was this a literal bnode.
30:   <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.example.org/a">
31:     <eg:prop>
32:         <rdfs:Literal/>
33:     </eg:prop>
34:   </rdf:Description>


The Manifest declares 4 tests:

test001 does not entails test002
test002 does not entail test001
test001 entails test003
test002 does not entail test003

I haven't added the datatype supports statements to the manifest because I 
don't understand those. I guess all four should show xsd:int as required 
datatype, and the last two need rdfs.

I am not sure how well, or not, these fit with Jos's results.
