I reported our typed literal decision to the Jena team and got a negative
response.

The current plan is that:

- I draft an send a rationale to the jena-devel list
- the naysayers may propose that the jena team objects to this decision


I will copy the rationale to this list FYI.
I hope to have an objection, or not, by Friday.

Sorry, I appear to have failed to adequately consult before Fridays'
telecon.

Jeremy
