Hello

the RDF Core WG made a decision as part of its last call process that we
decided to formally communicate to the I18N WG.

Note, we are still looking forward to your review comments on our Last Call
documents.

The decision made on Friday [1] is to modify the definition of a literal to
exclude the possibility of typed literals having an associated language tag:

[[
> Option 4:
> Language tag is simply dropped from all typed literals including
> rdf:XMLLiteral
>
>

PROPOSE
  Concepts is changed to say that a literal can have either a datatype or a
language tag and not both.
  rdf:XMLLiteral datatype is changed to have the identity as its lexical
value mapping (no wrapping), with consequential change to the value space of
rdf:XMLLiteral.
  Other editors to make consequential changes.
]]
from [2]

We specifically draw your attention to this being at variance with the
decisions made at the inter-WG meeting at the Cannes Plenary in 2002
concerning the scope of language tags (xml:lang) and embedded XML within RDF
(the rdf:parseType="Literal" construct).

As an example:

<rdf:Description xml:lang="en">
   <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><b>chat</b></eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

and

<rdf:Description xml:lang="fr">
   <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><b>chat</b></eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

are given exactly the same representation as an RDF graph and exactly the
same meaning. (Which differs from the Last Call documents in which the
language tag is significant).

The intention in these examples is now expressed as:

<rdf:Description>
   <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><span
 xml:lang="en"><b>chat</b></span></eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

and

<rdf:Description>
   <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><span
 xml:lang="fr"><b>chat</b></span></eg:prop>
</rdf:Description>

I have produced a rationale [3] (not endorsed by the WG).

Jeremy, on behalf of RDF Core
