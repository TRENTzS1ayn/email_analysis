I realized that in my reports to RDF Core about OWL DL I have emphasised some 
of the mismatches that I care about at the expense of other mismatches that 
other people might care about (and I have learnt to live with).

As well as the bnode constraints, another, "in your face" constraint is that 
every node must be typed (classes and properties must be appropriately typed 
with OWL vocabulary not just RDFS). (Certain 'builtin' uri refs are excluded 
from this requirement as are literal nodes).

This means that rdf:Description should usually not be used, and if you can't 
think of anything better to write owl:Thing usually substitutes for it.

With URIref nodes the owl:imports mechanism can be used to have any missing 
type triples in a separate file.
