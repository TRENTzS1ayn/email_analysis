This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.

On my list of possibles, I currently have:

   - xmlsch-05 character sequences
   - xmlsch-06 natural language data
   - timbl-03 collection clutter

I'd like to have

   danc-02 goofy literals
   jang-01 datatype subclass entailment

and to make progress on both semantics and rdf vocabulary issues.

Without those, this telecon is looking rather bare.

Brian
