This looks promising.  I have a couple of nits.

My suggestion for the above is to replace "referring to" with "denoting", 
particularly since you propose to use that term in the concepts 
document.  (Rationale:  "denoting" seems to have a fairly stable meaning 
when used in this context;  I don't know if this is so for referring, since 
the latter term seems to get us into the "what is a resource territory" .

I'm not sure what this is intended to mean.  It reads as if to say that all 
plain literals should be used only for plain text in a natural language, 
which I don't think is right (e.g. strings that are product serial numbers, 
or from vehicle licence plates, etc.).  I think you mean to say that 
*strings with language tags* should be used only for plain text in a 
natural language, which I think is better.  So I think the wording should 
be a little clearer:

[[
A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language
         identifier. The language identifier should not be used
         except with plain text in a natural language.
         As recommended in the RDF formal semantics
         [RDF-SEMANTICS], these plain literals are self-denoting.
]]

BTW, have we agreed to use the term "language identifier", or are we 
following RFC 3066 [1] and using the term "language tag"?
