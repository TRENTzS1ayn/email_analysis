There is text like:


[[
<a name="implementation-note"> </a>
IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
This section describes an *abstract* syntax which describes
equality of literals and equivalence of graphs. This is the
syntax over which the formal semantics are defined.
Implementations are free to represent literals and RDF graphs in
any other equivalent form.  As an example:
literals with datatype <tt>rdf:XMLLiteral</tt>s can be represented
in a non-canonical
format, and canonicalization performed during the comparison between two
such literals. In both this example, and in the example
<a href="#lang-implementation-note">above</a>
the comparisons may be
being performed either between syntactic structures or
between their denotations in the domain of discourse.
Implementations that do not require such comparisons can
hence be optimized.
]]

which is intended to minimise the *need* for implementations to change.
