with graham's corrections, the only thing that is missing is actual text.

I hope to provide some this afternoon or tomorrow morning (very early
 tomorrow morning for the US people !)

The problem is:
1: minimizing the risk of misreading concepts to give
<eg:a> <eg:p> <eg:c> .
and
<eg:a> <eg:p> "eg:c".
the same abstract representation.

2:ensureing that the  abstract representation of:
<eg:a> <eg:p> "00"^^<eg:en> .
and
<eg:a> <eg:p> "00"@en
differ by more than the three characters "eg:"
(It is fortunate that the set of absolute URI references and the set of
language tags are disjoint, but I am not happy to have an abstract
representation that relies on that).

3: not introducing new text/framework etc to make these distinctions
(don't be too heavy - objectives 1 and 2 are obvious really)

4: not being too goofy

I felt that the old text, with the old literals (including all three
components) adequately met these objectives (while Dan differed on 4). But it
is quite fragile and I don't want to bodge it.

In my head at the moment is something like:

[[
A literal in the RDF abstract syntax is either a plain literal or a typed
literal.

A literal has one or two ?named? components.

All literals have a *lexical form*. (Defn of lexical form from current draft)

A literal with only the lexical form is a plain literal.

A plain literal may also have a language identifier (defn of language
identifier from current draft)

Typed literals have a "datatype URI" (defn of dattaype URI from current
 draft)

]]

The earlier informative text should be much easier to read e.g.
In RDF there are:
- plain literals consisting only of a string
- plain literals consisting of a string and langauge identifier
- typed literal consisting of a string and a datatype URI


Polish is needed - working from the WDs and any relevant mail traffic, and
looking at any changes made by Graham in the editors draft.
The sketched normative text maintains the style that DanC-02 objects to, but
 I find it the simplest way of meeting the objectives 1-4 above, (well 1-3 at
 least); and I am hoping that the changes in the semantics address the
 underlying issue.
