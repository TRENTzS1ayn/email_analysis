The RDF Semantics document specifies the formal semantics of RDF(S).  It 
includes an informative appendix

   http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#Lbase

which restates the semantics in the form of a small set of axioms.  The 
intent is that this representation is easier to understand.

RDFCore have had a last call comment suggesting this appendix be removed:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0092.html

It would be helpful in resolving this comment, for the WG to have feedback 
on whether or not folks find this appendix useful.

Brian
