with graham's corrections, the only thing that is missing is actual text.


I hope to provide some this afternoon or tomorrow morning (very early tomorrow 
morning for the US people !)


The problem is:
1: minimizing the risk of misreading concepts to give
<eg:a> <eg:p> <eg:c> .
and
<eg:a> <eg:p> "eg:c".
the same abstract representation.


2:ensureing that the  abstract representation of:
<eg:a> <eg:p> "00"^^<eg:en> .
and
<eg:a> <eg:p> "00"@en
differ by more than the three characters "eg:"
(It is fortunate that the set of absolute URI references and the set of 
language tags are disjoint, but I am not happy to have an abstract 
representation that relies on that).


3: not introducing new text/framework etc to make these distinctions
(don't be too heavy - objectives 1 and 2 are obvious really)


4: not being too goofy


I felt that the old text, with the old literals (including all three 
components) adequately met these objectives (while Dan differed on 4). But it 
is quite fragile and I don't want to bodge it.


In my head at the moment is something like:


[[
A literal in the RDF abstract syntax is either a plain literal or a typed 
literal.


A literal has one or two ?named? components.


All literals have a *lexical form*. (Defn of lexical form from current draft)


A literal with only the lexical form is a plain literal.


A plain literal may also have a language identifier (defn of language 
identifier from current draft)


Typed literals have a "datatype URI" (defn of dattaype URI from current draft)


]]


The earlier informative text should be much easier to read e.g.
In RDF there are:
- plain literals consisting only of a string
- plain literals consisting of a string and langauge identifier
- typed literal consisting of a string and a datatype URI



Polish is needed - working from the WDs and any relevant mail traffic, and 
looking at any changes made by Graham in the editors draft.
The sketched normative text maintains the style that DanC-02 objects to, but I 
find it the simplest way of meeting the objectives 1-4 above, (well 1-3 at 
least); and I am hoping that the changes in the semantics address the 
underlying issue.
