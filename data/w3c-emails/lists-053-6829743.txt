That's in
   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#dtype_interp

Some evidence that folks find the appendix useful would settle this.  I've 
asked on rdf interest.

How is Herman on this?  Since his comment is on the correctness of the 
entailment lemma, maybe we should have updated that before resolving it.
