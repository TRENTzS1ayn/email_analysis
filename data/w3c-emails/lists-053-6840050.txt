No.

The current situation is that:

RDF MT states the principles.

OWL Semantics gives an application of the principles in a list with 
explanation.

W3C owes the world a Note or similar on XSD and semantic web.

I don't think that duplicating the list is sufficient, so propose doing 
nothing awaiting the Note.
