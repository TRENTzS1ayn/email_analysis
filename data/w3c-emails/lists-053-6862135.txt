[Brian, as requested...]

Summary:  modulo a very small suggested wording change, I agree that Pat's 
comments do address the issues raised.

I've added some links to the issues and other material in my commentary below.

I suggest a minor change to emphasize what I think is the intent here:
"... where sss is a built-in datatype that has well-defined lexical and 
value spaces and a lexical-to-value mapping,  and is named sss in ..."

(i.e. use "that" rather than "which", indicating that the following phrase 
is part of the defining expression rather than just additional informnation.)

Agree.  (Hopefully, in time, others will do more work that will allow 
developers to use this with greater confidence.  Meanwhile I agree that 
without it an important class of readers may be excluded.)

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdfs_entail

I agree, though I had to dig to find the full closure, using:
   rdfs1 +  rdfs3 + rdfs7a + rdfs9


   rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:range rdfs:Class .       (sect 3.3 axiom)
   rdf:XMLLiteral rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal . (sect 3.3 axiom)
gives:
   rdfs:Literal rdf:type rdfs:Class .            (by rdfs3)
gives:
   rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .  (by rdfs7a)

then, from rdfs1, we have:
   _:nnn rdf:type rdfs:Literal
hence:
   _:nnn rdf:type rdfs:Resource                  (by rdfs9)

which completes the closure Peter noted was missing.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-09

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#dtype_interp

I don't understand the second paragraph of Peter's comment, but from the 
first I think the issue is to formalize the idea that a datatype must 
provide a URI by which it may be referenced.

I agree that the text addresses this issue.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#horst-01

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdfs_entail

I sketched a derivation of the missing closure in a previous message to 
rdf-comments:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0058.html

and hence agree that adding closure rdfs12 provides a closure for the 
entailment noted.
