BTW, I could insert an explicit list of the datatypes which DO work, 
following the list used in the OWL docs. Might that be helpful?

I belive that Euler has checked that all the obvious cases are in the 
closure, BTW.

I am pretty sure that the entailment lemma itself is OK, but if you 
want to wait on this until I finish writing up a proof of it, that 
would be fine. About 2 weeks, provided we don't change the XML 
literals or the lang tag decisions.
