I have a concern with this text.  It seems to say that one prefer to use 
xsd:string over plain literals.  Should it turn out that xsd:string and 
plain literal without a lang tag denote the same thing is there a good 
reason to press users to use the datatyped form with its attendant 
syntactic burden?

Perhaps substitute 'may' for 'should'?

Note also switched 'These may be used...' for 'This may be used...'
