8: Issue pfps-08
Proposal as in:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0181.html



9: Issue pfps-01
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-01

As per Pat's message
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0162.html

Propose:
  - accept
  - note that it has been addressed by the following text (between **-**) in
    the editors draft:
    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#dtype_interp
[[
The datatype map which also contains the set of all pairs of the form
<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#sss , sss>, where sss is a built-in
datatype **which has well-defined lexical and value spaces and a
lexical-to-value mapping and** is named sss in XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes
[XML-SCHEMA2], eg decimal, string, is referred to here as XSD.

10: issue pfps-03 LBase appendix is pointless
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-03

I've been trying to get some evidence to support a decision on this.
See thread beginning:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003May/0111.html

I have had one person offlist saying that they would prefer to see the
LBase appendix published separately.

Do we have any evidence or anecdotal experience from other specs, e.g
DAML, that similar axiomatic systems have been useful?

As per Pat's message
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0162.html

Propose:
  - not accept
  - note that the purpose of the appendix is informative (for a certain 
    class of readers) rather than definitive. 
  - note that document states:
[[
"The editor believes that both of these descriptions, and also the closure
rules described in section 4, are all in exact correspondence, but only the
directly described model theory in sections 1- 3 should be taken as
normative."
]]   



11: Issue pfps-05 RDFS closure rules

Per Pat's message

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0162.html

and Graham's additions:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0175.html

Propose 
  - accept it
  - addressed by rule rdfs1 in section 4.2 of the editor's draft
    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#dtype_interp 
so that using rdfs1 +  rdfs3 + rdfs7a + rdfs9

   rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:range rdfs:Class .       (sect 3.3 axiom)
   rdf:XMLLiteral rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal . (sect 3.3 axiom)
gives:
   rdfs:Literal rdf:type rdfs:Class .            (by rdfs3)
gives:
   rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .  (by rdfs7a)

then, from rdfs1, we have:
   _:nnn rdf:type rdfs:Literal
hence:
   _:nnn rdf:type rdfs:Resource                  (by rdfs9)



12: Issue timbl-03
We are awaiting a response from WEBONT.  They had hoped to respond in
time for this telecon, but I note they had a last call vote at their last
telecon.



13: Issue xmlsch-05 Character Sequences

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-05

Per Jeremy's message:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0151.html

PROPOSE: to not accept this comment.
Rationale:
It feels like a fairly extensive editorial change. Also in the semantic web 
activity documents xsd:string is always refered to in its qualified form, and 
so the possible confusion is diminsihed.



14: Issue xmlsch-06 natural language data
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-06

Per Jeremy's message
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0151.html

PROPOSE to accept; with rewording (added 'not' and 'except for')

[[
A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language
        identifier. This should be used only for plain text 
        in a natural language. As recommended in the RDF formal semantics
        [RDF-SEMANTICS], these plain literals are self-denoting.
]]

(Note this an informative "should not", not a normative "SHOULD NOT")

An alternative is to use 'may be used for plain...' rather than
 'should not ...'
