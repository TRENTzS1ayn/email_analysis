Hmm, yes, it seems problematic.  In particular, it seems to violate:

[[
General monotonicity lemma. Suppose that S, S' are sets of RDF graphs with 
every member of S a subset of some member of S'. Suppose that Y indicates a 
semantic extension of  X, S X-entails E, and S and E satisfy any syntactic 
restrictions of Y. Then S' Y-entails E.

In particular, if D' is a datatype map and D a subset of D' then if S 
D-entails E it also S D'-entails E, provided that S and E both recognize 
all the datatype urirefs in the domain of D'.

There is also some wording nearby about entailments of inconsistent

Imposing a syntactic constraint on a D-interpretation allowing
   x rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
only if I(x) in D might help, since that would render the antcedent of 
Peter's  first entailment syntactically invalid.

[[
1/      xsd:int rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
                 {<rdf:XMLLiteral,XMLLiteral>}-entails
         rdf:XMLLiteral xsd:string rdf:type .

2/      xsd:int rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
                 DOES NOT {<rdf:XMLLiteral,XMLLiteral>,
                 <rdf:int,int>}-entail
         xsd:string rdf:XMLLiteral rdf:type .
]]

But there's still a question of such statements in non datatyped 
interpretations.  I think that's not a problem because there's no 
constraint there that:
   x rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .
is false in all such interpretations, so the first entailment would not hold.
