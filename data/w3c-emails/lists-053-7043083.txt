13: Issue xmlsch-05 Character Sequences

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-05

Per Jeremy's message:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0151.html

PROPOSE: to not accept this comment.
Rationale:
It feels like a fairly extensive editorial change. Also in the semantic web 
activity documents xsd:string is always refered to in an unambiguous form,
typically with a qname or hyperlinked to the definition, and so the possible 
confusion is diminsihed.



14: Issue xmlsch-06 natural language data
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-06

Per Jeremy's message
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0151.html
and contributions from Graham and Dave

PROPOSE to accept; with rewording

[[
     A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language
     identifier.     As recommended in the RDF formal semantics
     [RDF-SEMANTICS], these plain literals are self-denoting.
     Plain literals with a language identifier 
     should be used only for plain text in a natural language.
