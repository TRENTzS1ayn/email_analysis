>Brian-
>  The Web Ontology Working Group was asked for our opinion on your issue 
> timbl-03, the removing of seemingly redundant rdf:list triples in various 
> places.
>  Our WG discussion (minutes in [1]) centered on two issues - First, we 
> tried to decide whether this would "break" our design in the sense of 
> causing us significant technical work and require opening new issues or 
> reopening existing ones. Second, we discussed whether this change would 
> be consistent with the design goals of OWL and with the current language 
> design.
>  Our WG did not reach strong consensus on either of the above, but did 
> seem to feel that while it was probably the case that removing rdf:list 
> would not break our design, it would cause our group to do extra work and 
> would conflict with some of the aspects of our current design.
>   In particular, a number of places in our documents we would have to say 
> things like
>    "ALL ?x (except for rdf:list - see <link>) MUST have a ?y"
>which would also mean implementors would have to have appropriate checks 
>in their code in multiple places - making it marginally more complex.
>  Thus, it appears to be the case that our WG would be happiest with the 
> status quo and generally prefers that you not make the change, but we 
> would probably not file an objecting comment on behalf of the WG if the 
> change was made.
>  Putting it more informally in WG terms -- if I had to represent my 
> group's opinion I would vote against during a straw poll, but abstain (as 
> opposed to objecting) if it went to a vote.
