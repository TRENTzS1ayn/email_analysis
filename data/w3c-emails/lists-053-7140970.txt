I was actioned by RDF Core to provide early feedback on this issue
resolution.

After receiving the feedback from WebOnt on this issue
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003May/0288.html
the RDF Core working group considered it in the last teleconference
on Friday 16th May.

The (draft) minutes of this meeting
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0199.html
now record our decision to accept timbl-03 and as such, to remove the
  _:n rdf:type rdf:List
triple from the triples generated parseType="Collection" construction.

Although this is not yet recorded in a published working draft, it is
expected to be reflected by a change to the RDF/XML Syntax last call
working draft in section
  7.2.19 Production parseTypeCollectionPropertyElt
  
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123/#parseTypeCollection\
PropertyElt

removing:
  [["For each event n in s, the following statement is added to the graph:
    n.string-value <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> 
<http://ww\
w.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#List> .
  ]]

(and updating the examples earlier in the document) plus any some
consequent changes to the RDF Semantics WD (where mentioned) and RDF
Primer WD (where it is used in examples).
