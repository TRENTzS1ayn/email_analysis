Overnight, I was thinking a bit more about the wider issues at hand.

It appeared to me that there are three different ways to have
a simple string in RDF:

<foo xml:lang=''>Hello World!</foo>
<foo xml:lang='' parseType='Literal'>Hello World!</foo>
<foo rdf:datatype='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string'>Hello World!</foo>

All three are plain strings without language, but they are
represented slightly differently in RDF.
What the recent decision of the RDF WG has done is that it has
said that the xml:lang='' in the second variant is unnecessary.
But this doesn't look like it has addressed the underlying problems.

Regards,    Martin.
