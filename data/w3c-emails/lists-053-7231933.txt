Since our recent decision to handle canonicalization in the parser [1][2], 
I don't think it's correct to say that C14N has any impact on entailment 
relationships between RDF graphs.

Though I must concede that C14N can affect entailment between RDF/XML 
documents.
I'm not currently understanding why that's important.
