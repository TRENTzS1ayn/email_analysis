I don't see the problem here:  a parser would apply C14N for 
parseType="Literal", and not for other literals.  I.e. there is still a 
*syntactic* distinction, but could all be treated the same in the graph.

By "treated the same", I interpreted that to apply to the graph, not the 
RDF/XML syntax (see above).  So I'm still not seeing where a problem would be.
