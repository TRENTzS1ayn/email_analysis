That was not how I understood the suggestion. If all we have
are XML literals and typed literals, then I would expect
canonicalization to apply to all XML literals regardless.

Also, my concerns were about comparisons. Even if C14N was
only applied by the parser for parseType="Literal" cases,
equality would still be defined in terms of canonicalized
forms, and that would apply to all non-typed literals regardless 
of how they were serialized.

I.e.

   <foo>&lt;span xml:lang='en'&gt;blargh&lt;/span&gt;</foo>

should then equal and/or entail both

   <foo>&lt;span xml:lang="en"&gt;blargh&lt;/span&gt;</foo>

and

   <foo rdf:parseType="Literal">
      <span xml:lang="en">blargh</span>
   </foo>

Note the difference in single and double quotes around 'en',
which are subject to canonicalization.

If all we have are XML literals, then the above two forms
of expression canonicalize to the same value. 

Now, I myself could live with this. But it would require re-working
alot of the specs, and some very clear treatment in the Primer to
help folks understand how some of their previous simple strings
may in fact be canonicalized to something different and thus
equate with other strings that before were not considered
equal.

See above.
