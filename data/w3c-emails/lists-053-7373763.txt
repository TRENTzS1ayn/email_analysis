Following discussion with Peter on the rdf comments list,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0099.html
I propose the following closure of the issue 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-24 'what is 
rdf schema?' which was raised initially by Peter in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0149.html

proposed resolution:

Peter accepted this proposal, and notes that we should look out for other 
places where similar issues occur. I have checked RDFS for this. 

I am therefore asking that the WG close this issue as accepted, and move 
the above change onto the RDFS editorial todo list.
