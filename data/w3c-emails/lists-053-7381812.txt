From discussion with Brian...

re http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#qu-04

raised:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0219.html

This message raised several pretty straightforward issues with the 
RDF/XML appendix in the RDFS spec.

Proposed closure:

That we accept (1),    
adding
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/> 

That we accept (2),
removing the redundant (editorial error) representation of 
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
...in rdfs:isDefinedBy

That for (3) we accept the addition of a 'subclass of resource' triple 
for rdfs:Literal, rdf:List, rdf:XMLLiteral. But that we refrain from 
explicitly writing that 'resource subclass of resource' in the XML since 
this (trivial and implied) assertion would raise expectations that we 
do this for each and every other class, reducing the clarity for no 
practical gain. 
(Every class is a subclass of itself as well as of resource)

For (4), accept as editorial the suggestion that we have a uniform ordering
of classes and properties.
