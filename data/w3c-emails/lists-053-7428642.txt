Dan--

I've no problem with the idea of a name change as suggested by WebONT 
(and am prepared to grit my teeth and make all the Primer changes), but 
I don't especially like the specific change being contemplated, because 
it seems to ignore some practical issues.  The following are some 
considerations I think are important in any resolution of this business:

1.  It is *mandatory* in my opinion for there to be a *short* way of 
writing (a) the name of the language itself, and (b) the things written 
in the language.  "RDF schema" passes those tests.  "RDF Vocabulary 
Description Language" fails the (a) test, and "vocabulary description" 
(or "RDF vocabulary description") fails the (b) test (not by a whole 
lot, but it does).  WebONT has "OWL" for (a) and "ontology" for (b).  We 
need something similarly short, unless we expect no one to actually use 
this language, instead jumping directly to OWL (and if what we're 
talking about substituting for the thing described isn't an "ontology", 
if only a very impoverished one, we need a clear understanding of what 
it takes to qualify as an "ontology" versus whatever it is we're 
defining).  (NB:  "VDL" has been used already for something else.)

2.  I don't really care for encouraging the OWL editors to talk about 
"vocabulary description" without some additional amplification of what 
that means.  Our Semantics document talks about a vocabulary being a 
collection of URIrefs used in RDF graphs, and it seems to me any RDF 
that provides information about those URIrefs (by using them as subjects 
in RDF statements) "describes" that vocabulary, whether it uses the RDFS 
vocabulary or not.  So "vocabulary description" in this context has a 
particular meaning that I'd like to see elaborated a bit.

3.  If we're going to change either the name of the language, or the 
thing described by the language, or both, I really have a problem 
keeping the old namespace with "rdf-schema" in it.  I know that these 
are supposed to be opaque identifiers, but that text isn't opaque enough 
for this purpose.
