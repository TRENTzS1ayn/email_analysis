quoted version here]

[[
schema n. (pl. schemata // or schemas)
1 a synopsis, outline, or diagram.
2 a proposed arrangement.
3 Logic a syllogistic figure.
4 (in Kantian philosophy) a conception of what is common to all members of 
a class; a general type or essential form.
[Greek skhema -atos ?form, figure?]
]]
-- the Concise Oxford Dictionary

"schema" is, to my mind, a perfectly respectable generic term.  I don't 
think that because it's used in the phrase "XML schema" we should be 
bullied out of deploying the equally reasonable term "RDF schema".

I have observed that it often seems to occur that when a word gets used in 
a specific technical context, it becomes difficult to use the same term in 
other variations of its widely accepted meaning.  In recent RDF 
discussions, the word "model" comes to mind.

The phrase "XML schema" refers to a arrangement of and relationship between 
syntactic elements.   I think the term "RDF schema" is equally valid to 
refer to some relationships between semantic elements in RDF.

In summary, I think the use of the phrase "XML schema" is not a valid 
reason to abandon the phrase "RDF schema".  Maybe there are other reasons 
to prefer a different phrase to "RDF schema", but I don't think legitimate 
re-use of the word "schema" is one such.
