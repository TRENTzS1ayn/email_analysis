I'm not convinced of a *need* to do this.  (But if we can, then fine...)

I think the main issue here is that the non-layering is a fundamental 
feature of the RDF we were tasked to clarify.  I think we don't really have 
any discretion to consider other design approaches.

This might be underscored by mentioning the large number of implementations 
that currently depend on this model (esp schema uses where rdfs:Class is 
treated as both resource and class, and is a member itself, etc.).

A good point to make, I think.
