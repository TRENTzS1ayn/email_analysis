I a quick check, it appears that my particular comments have been
satisfactorily addressed.  

However, the RDF semantics has undergone considerable change prior to Last
Call.  I have not reviewed whether these changes have affected other
portions of the RDF Schema document.  Determining whether the RDF Schema
document corresponds with the new RDF Schema would require, in my view, a
complete review of both documents.
