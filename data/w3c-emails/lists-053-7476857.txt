This response does not satisfactorily address even the summary of my
comment.  How can it, as the summary uses rdfs:commment as only an example
of where the RDF Semantics document goes beyond the RDF semantics?  Other
examples include rdfs:label, rdf:first, rdf:rest, rdf:List, rdf:Alt,
rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, rdf:object, and rdfs:isDefinedBy.
I note that recent changes to the RDF semantics have added rdfs:Datatype to
this category.  There may also be others - with so many examples, it is
entirely possible that I have missed some.

A solution to the general problem of the RDF Schema document promising more
than is delivered is needed, not just a solution to one example of the
problem.
