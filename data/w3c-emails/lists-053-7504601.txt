I'm leaving on vacation and will not participate in any teleconfs
from now until the first of July.

I was hoping to have seen closure on the datatyping issue before
I left, but will just have to trust I can live with whatever comes
out in my absence.

Anyway, have a great summer and I'll be back in the loop in July.

Cheers,

Patrick
