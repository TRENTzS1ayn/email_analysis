Patrick's point might have been in the context of round-tripping, but is just 
as relevant to serializing the RDF content within an HTML document.

You *need* to know whether the literal has already had XML excaping applied or 
not, and you need to have the ability to include unescapable xml content for 
explicit <em>markup</em>. Every solution we have published has these 
capabilties, which are deployed and in use. We should not change the solution 
in a way that loses these capabilities. Some of Martin's comments seem 
unaware of the importance of these,

(It is merely a single bit)
