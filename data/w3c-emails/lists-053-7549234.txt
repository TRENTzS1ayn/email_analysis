actually that is a little too strong, (there are some model-theoretic 
consequences), but as peter points out it is also not general enough.

This feels as though it is more an introductory paragraph explaining the 
difference between the formal semantics and the informal semantics, and 
highlighting those properties and classes (and rdf:nil) which are:
- not given special treatment in the fomal semantics
- and/or have some informal meaning associated in the schema doc

I suspect that paragraph can be written without the use of technical terms 
such as model theory.
