I disagree. first, we did not make it, it was imposed by our charter. 
Second, the only objection to it from this comment can be succinctly 
phrased as "I don't like that way of doing it" which does't really 
need to be dignified with a careful answer, particularly in view of 
the fact that when asked for clarification, the commentor's response 
was somewhere between unhelpful and downright rude.

That might be well worth articulating in more detail. I think we 
could do a fairly exact job on this which a lot of people would find 
helpful.  Since Jeremy has already done the donkey work for this in 
defining how to tell if an OWL-RDf graph is in OWL-DL ( which is 
precisely the 'layered' subset of OWL in this sense), we should be 
able to easily adapt his algorithm to define a 'layered style' of 
writing RDF and put it in an appendix somewhere. I am willing to 
tackle writing a draft of this.  It would be relevant to vass-01, 
pan-01 and Qu-03.
