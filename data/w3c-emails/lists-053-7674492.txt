I regret the use of the emotive term 'bullied'.  I see no evidence of the 
XML schema folks putting any pressure on us about the use of this term.

I have however observed a tendency from folks, and not just those from the 
XML world, to assume that a schema language supports validation and this 
can cause some confusion.

Personally, whilst I can see advantage to a name change, I think its too 
late, but as always, will be guided by the wisdom of the WG.
