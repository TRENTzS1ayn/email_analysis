I don't think it was the XML schema folks who were being thought of as
doing the bullying.

RDF schema *supports* validation.  The problem is that it doesn't
*mandate* that is has to be used for validation.  That's left up to what
the application wants to do with it (there's a section in the Primer
trying to explain this).

Part of the problem with any reasonable name change is that it probably
won't indicate that the language doesn't necessarily entail validation
any more clearly than "RDF schema" does.  Certainly when people look at
domains and ranges in "RDF Vocabulary Description Language", unless they
read the fine print very carefully, I'd bet they'll continue to believe
that those domains and ranges are necessarily interpreted as constraints
(and I bet the OWL folks are going to have the same problem).  I haven't
heard any proposals for renaming the language to something "real clear"
like "The RDF Vocabulary Description, but Not-Necessarily Constraining
or Used for Validation, Language", but anyway about all this would do is
make for a more-opaque namespace name:
