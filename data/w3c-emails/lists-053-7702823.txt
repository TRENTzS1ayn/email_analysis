I don't see anything in www-rdf-comments about these.  Please remember that 
responses go to the commentor(s), copied to www-rdf-comments and seeking a 
response, e.g.

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003AprJun/0170.html

Please could you redo do this following the normal process.

And if there is still time, some proposals to close some open issues for 
the telecon would be good.

Except that I think it should be the 'collection vocabulary' not the 
'container vocabulary', containers are alt bag and seq, this looks ok to 
me.  I believe you can just make these changes if you don't get any 
negative feedback
