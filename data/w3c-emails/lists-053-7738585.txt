Hello Brian,

My post was trying to address some specific points in the argumentation
of Patrick and Jeremy, which is related to the overall issue.

I copied i18n because I think they should have been copied on the
whole discussion, not because that particular mail of mine was
particularly important. On the i18n side, many of my colleagues
still have a hard time understanding what is at issue, and the
more of a chance they get to follow the discussion, the more
they might have a chance to get an overall impression.

Two days ago, the I18N WG (core TF) asked me for a summary.
Now you are asking me for a summary. Unfortunately, these are
two totally different summaries. What is more, I just had
a very interesting long discussion this morning with Ralph,
and agreed to write a summary of that, too. I hope to be able
to do these things soon.


Regards,  Martin.
