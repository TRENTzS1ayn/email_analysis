I have an outstanding action to point to current editors drafts but have 
held off from doing it until I knew that updated drafts were available.

As you will recall we decided to maintain the editors drafts in last call 
TR space.

I've had a request for visibility of the editors drafts, so it would be 
helpful if you could let me know the current status and plans of updating 
your documents.  If you need help with updating access to CVS, I can help out.

Brian
