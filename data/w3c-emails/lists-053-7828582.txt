                             ^^^^ inference

This is not an application of rule rdfs4a.

On the contrary, software is an excellent method for determining if an
inference follows, so long as the software emits a proof that can then be
checked.  Software is also an excellent method for determining if an
entailment does not hold, so long as the software emits a counterexample.
The situation is somewhat different when the proofs and counterexamples
become very large, but we are certainly nowhere near that stage yet.

For other purposes, software is much less suitable, although, with
appropriate safeguards, it is possible to actually use software to
determine that an inference does not follow or an entailment holds.
