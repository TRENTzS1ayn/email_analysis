Summary: I doubt you can make clearer tests of this issue than the one peter 
proposes - in particular Jan's proposed test is incorrect.


while sympathetic to Jan's desire for meangingful test cases, I note that 
peter's test (particualrly the choice of conclusion) depends on a somewhat 
non-obvious technicality.

false does-not-simply-entail G

for any non-empty G, because G uses at least one URI which is not in all 
interpretations of false.

Thus the test case needs to show an inconsistency, followed by garbage using 
the same vocab as the premise (or  the central RDF vocabulary). (And we have 
rdf-entailment), ditto rdfs entailment).

Peter's choice of garbage out

rdf:type rdf:type rdf:type

seems to be about as best as you can do to have obvious garabge given the 
constraint
