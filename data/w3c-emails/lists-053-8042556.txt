A family emergency has come up and I'm going to be out of town for the 7 
November telecon, with limited internet (and possibly phone) access. 
I'll try to make the call, but just a heads-up in case I don't.

I've updated the Primer editor's draft with some of the changes to 
address comment "primer-minor-editorial" (not all of them;  I'm still 
trying to figure out what to do about some of them).
