OLD

The value is the concatenation of "<", the value of the *identifier* accessor 
and ">"

The <>-quoted *identifier* accessor value must use the N-Triples escapes for 
URI references as described in 3.3 URI References.

6.1.8 Plain Literal Event 

OLD
[[
The value is calculated from the other accessors as follows.

If *literal-language* is the empty string then the value is the concatenation 
of """ (1 double quote), the value of the 2 *literal-value* accessor and """ 
(1 double quote).

Otherwise the value is the concatenation of """ (1 double quote), the value of 
the *literal-value* accessor ""@" (1 double quote and a '@'), and the value 
of the *literal-language* accessor.

The double-quoted *literal-value* accessor value must use the N-Triples 
escapes for strings as described in 3.2 Strings for escaping certain 
characters such as ".

6.1.9 Typed Literal Event
suggest 
[[

The value is the concatenation of the following in this order """ (1 double 
quote), the escaped value of the *literal-value* accessor, """ (1 double 
quote), "^^<", the esca[ed value of the *literal-datatype* accessor and ">". 

The escaping of the *literal-value* uses the N-Triples escapes for strings as 
described in 3.2 Strings for escaping certain characters such as ". The 
escaping of the *literal-datatype* uses the N-Triples escapes for URI 
references as described in 3.3 URI References.
]]


I think the rest of the text then uses these accessors and so invokes the 
escaping. I believe this was the intent all along.
