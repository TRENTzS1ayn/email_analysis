This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.

Suggestions to the list please.

Brian, I'm happy chairing this week. I'll be in 
Japan during the Nov 14 and Nov 21 calls, where 
chairing (or even attending -- am investigating)
might be a challenge.

Many thanks to Graham for scribing last week's call
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Oct/0217.html)
and to Jan for volunteering for Friday's (Nov 7th) meeting.

Thanks,

Dan
