If we are short of things to discuss, the I18N comment that is still brewing
surfaced here

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-i18n-ig/2003Nov/0008.html

(member only link)

I find the Alt argument the most interesting of the things we haven't seen
before; it would be interesting to know if the WG would be happy to make the
change Martin suggests (no default, all items have equal weight)

I understand that they have asked for an extension, so this looks critical
path given the good status of the rest of the comments ....

The other comments either are editorial or the expected substantive comments
on XMLLiteral.

If we have a full agenda we should hold off discussing this comment until it
is made.
