At this stage of the game, if we choose to make any substantive changes in 
response to these comments I think they should be simple excisions.

I could see removing the preference for the first Alt as an excision.  Or 
simply removing Alt all together?  There's nothing special about rdf:Alt 
that users couldn't define their own vocabulary for it.  (Personally, I 
think Alt is rather like the human appendix:  of little practical value and 
a potential source of inflammation.)
