We already decided not to change RDF containers, I don't see any point
doing that further now - it is not a critical change.

RDF Semantics says on Alt:
"things of type rdf:Alt are considered to represent a collection of
alternatives, possibly with a preference ordering"
-- 3.2.2 http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#Containers

RDF Concepts & AS WD says nothing.
RDF/XML WD deals with the syntax use only.

RDF Primer does mention the prefered value rdf:_1

"An Alt container is intended to have at least one member, identified by
the property rdf:_1. This member is intended to be considered as the
default or preferred value. Other than the member identified as rdf:_1,
the order of the remaining elements is not significant."
-- just after http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/#example15

Maybe there is some work to make these a little more aligned.
