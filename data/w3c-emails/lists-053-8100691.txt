Perhaps the simplest clarification that would fix rdf:Alt is to make it 
clear that it needs to be used with supporting vocabulary, ie. this is a 
modelling level component of RDF, something that can be used, rather
than something down deep in the RDF infrastructure.

ie. I can't write

<foaf:Person>
  <foaf:workplaceHomepage>
    <rdf:Alt>
      <rdf:li>
       <foaf:Document rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/"/>
      </rdf:li>
      <rdf:li>
       <foaf:Document rdf:about="http://ilrt.org/"/>
      </rdf:li>
    </rdf:Alt>
  </foaf:workplaceHomepage>
</foaf:Person>

...and to expect it "just work" by the power of RDF.

If foaf:Document and rdf:Alt are disjoint (which FOAF could state in
OWL) this would be false, since foaf:workplaceHomepage has a range of
foaf:Document.

I guess the best practice guideline is that rdf:Alt is only useful when 
used alongside RDF vocabulary explicitly created to work with it.

eg. a foaf:workplaceHomepageAlt property with rdf:Alt as its value would 
be OK.

Would the primer be a natural home for something like this? Or maybe 
just shove it in the ESW wiki...?
