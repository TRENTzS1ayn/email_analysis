The formal agenda may be slightly late; I am in a telecon
that deserves my attention. 

We haven't had many suggestions yet btw. Ideas?

I don't believe it is appropriate to discuss the 
draft we noticed on the I18N list; let's deal with that 
when the final version arrives.

I would also like to use the telecon to solicit RDF Core WG 
input into discussions on future revisions to the 
XML Schema WG charter. That work is member-confidential 
and as we work in public I won't go into details here.

So... the basic shape for tommorrow's call is as last week, 
very document centric. 

Editors, please try to be up to date w.r.t. your LC2 
comment handling and be in a position to summarise any 
problems or points where WG input is needed.

thanks,

Dan
