Attached, agenda for tommorrow's rdfcore call. As last week, 
very document centric. I've mined Brian's action list for 
recent doc-centric actions. Eric Miller won't be on the call,
but owns the implementation report / PR request; I've left 
this on the agenda though. Sandro has done some nice work 
that will be included; see
