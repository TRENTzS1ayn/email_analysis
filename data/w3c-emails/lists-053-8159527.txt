I gather you meant

Very nice; I can see the whole issue in one place, and
the issues with outstanding dissent are easy to find.

I expect this will make briefing The Director quite
straightforward, not to mention leaving a nice description
of the situation for the community and any future WGs.

Umm... this looks OK (except the "we request..." sentence, about
which more below), but the shorter text was intended for
the request for PR. I'd prefer to see the table of
designs that the WG evaluated in the issues list under
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure

Umm... under
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes
I see
"On these grounds the WG asks the director to support the decision of
the WG despite outstanding dissent."

Please leave that out of the issues list; it belongs only in the request
for PR. This issues list has a long lifetime; the request is ephemeral.

Right.
