One small agendum.  I recall that when we discussed the MIME type 
registration last week, I said we were in good shape and suggested folks 
look at my message [1].

[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Oct/0198.html
[[
So where from here?  I suggest:
(1) remind folks on the ietf-types list [4] that a revised document is here
for review.
(2) assuming no adverse feedback, request IESG approval for RFC publication.
]]

Pursuant to that, there is an action suggested by that message, which I'd 
like to propose:

PROPOSED:  GK to post note to IETF-types (MIME types registration) list, 
noting that RDF is now in 2nd last call, and asking for any final comments 
on the MIME type registration, on the basis that we will request IESG 
approval and RFC publication as soon as we are happy that all last call 
comments have been addressed.

I don't wish to spend time discussing it, unless others feel there's 
something controversial here.
