Incidentally, should I be making editorial fixes to a particular copy of
the document now?

Sandro, thank-you for your comments, and for taking the time to run the
test cases.

The intention is that in the absence of other entailmentRules, simple
entailment is used. I note that that condition is missing from the test
case document through editorial oversight; my proposed fix is to add the
text,

[[
In the case that no test:entailmentRules elements are present, the rules
of simple entailment as specified in [RDF-SEMANTICS] are used.
]]

Again, these tests demonstrate the distinction between language-tagged
and non-language-tagged plain literals, and should be viewed as simple
entailments.


With the addition of the above editoral fix to the test case document,
would your concerns here be addressed?
