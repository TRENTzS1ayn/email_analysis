The I18N group also raised the following XMLLiteral related issue:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003OctDec/0120.html
[[
- XML Literals containing only text should be equivalent to the
   corresponding plain literals and to the corresponding string type
   literals.
]]

I propose we add a new issue to the issue list: relationship between
XMLLiterals and plain literals, and postpone it.

Rationale:

It is too late in the day to add new requirements. The lack of semantic
equivalence between XMLLiterals and plain literals has been clear since the
first WD of RDF Concepts, and was arguable in RDF Model and Syntax.
The RDF Semantics does not preclude RDF applications using additional
information to determine that two literals are equivalent, but does not
mandate that they should be.
Hence, RDF applciations which require this equivalence may operate in such a
mode, and so this issue is not a show stopper.

====================

Dear Martin

thank you for your comment

]]

The RDF Core WG have decided to add a new issue to the issue list and
postpone it.

This decision to postpone is on the grounds of timeliness. We noted that
applications which require this equivalence are not prohibited from
asserting it, so we do not regard this issue as a showstopper.

Please reply cc-ing www-rdf-comments@w3.org, indicating whether this
response is acceptable or not.
