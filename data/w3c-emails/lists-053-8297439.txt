[[
I do suggest, however, that there be some indication in RDF Concepts that
applications that wish to generate RDF URI references that contain non
US-ASCII characters not escape these characters.  See Section 6 of
http://www.textuality.com/tag/uri-comp-4 for a similar indication.  (This
text may have been incorporated into RFC2396bis.)

I suggest adding another note, as in the following proposed reply.

===============

Hi Peter,

I am happy to add yet another note at the end of section 6.4 RDF URI
References

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-concepts-20031010/#section-Graph-URIref

reading

[[
Note: Two different RDF URI references, one of which uses %-escape sequences
may
encode to the same URI reference. These are not equal. To minimize the risk
of this,
when generating RDF URI references it is prefered to avoid using the
%-escape form.
