No, it does. A entails B means (forall interpretations I (if I 
satisfies A then I satisfies B))

so if A is false then this is always trivially true; so false entails 
anything, no matter what vocabulary it uses.

I removed the vocabulary restriction on entailment at Herman's 
insistence: he was right.
