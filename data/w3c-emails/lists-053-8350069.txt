These tests are incorrect.

They are failed by Jena and 3Store and passed by Surnia and Euler.

The tests are

*empty*

entails

rdf:_1 rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty .

and

rdf:_1 rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:member .


The empty interpretation (i.e. an interpetation of the empty vocabulary)
provides a counterexample. (With true implies false).

We have an outstanding comment from Dave Reynolds from 25 July to this
effect.

Suggest change the premises to

eg:foo rdf:_1 "bar" .
