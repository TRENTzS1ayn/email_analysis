These tests appear to be true according to the latest copy of the
editor's draft: that is, the "core RDF vocabulary" subset of rdfV has
been dropped. The appropriate prose from the ed's draft now is:

[[
An rdfs-interpretation of V is an rdf-interpretation I of (V union rdfV
union rdfsV) which satisfies the following semantic conditions and all
the triples in the subsequent table, called the RDFS axiomatic triples,
which contain only names from (V union rdfV union rdfsV).
]]

This reflects, I think, the abandonment of the attempt to shoehorn
forward-reasoner rules into the semantics (Pat?) so the test case is
invalid if one reads the LC draft but is valid according to the ed's
draft.

If the ed's draft represents a final position on this then the test case
is accurate (although it is impossible for a last-call reviewer to
observe this).
