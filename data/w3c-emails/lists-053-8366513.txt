This seems particularly timely given our upcoming
task of getting some combination of 12 specs to cite
each other at Proposed Recommendation.

Editors, please try it out and let us know whether
it helps.

Hi all,

There was some discussion back in July about using the TR in RDF data to
facilitate the creation of bibliography in XMLSpec; while I'm not sure
where we are on this topic, nor who should have any action on it, I
wrote up a small tool to re-use these data for creating XHTML
bibliography, along discussions I had with Ian Jacobs.
As so often these days :), the tool is based on XSLT:
http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/tr-biblio.xsl
which should present you with XML/CSS or XSLT-aware browsers with an
HTML form to submit URIs on which you want to get bibliographic data.

You can give it dated or undated URIs, separated by a space or a line
return. For instance, with the following URIs:
http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-ops/
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-qaframe-spec-20030912/

the results is as follows:
