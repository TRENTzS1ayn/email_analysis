As an additional datapoint, Sandro has just made an additional comment
to the -comments list that (independently of this discussion) suggests
adopting an rdf:List format.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003OctDec/0133.html

Although he doesn't mention it explicitly, the same comments apply to
the manifest format for declaring datatype support.

Looking for guidance from the WG here (and in particular from JJC since
he's the WebOnt test case editor).

Cheers,
