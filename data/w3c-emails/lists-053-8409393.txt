Apologies to Jos! Who is, of course, co-editor.

In a nutshell, since the owners of many testcase harnesses are present
(so disemination of this change won't be too difficult),
I think that the selection of an rdf:List-based approach for declaring
(a) entailment rules and (b) "supported" datatype requirements for test
cases really comes down to the impact on WebOnt's test cases.

As to the impact on this WG's test case documents:

- the range of entailmentRules and datatypeSupport become rdf:List; the
testcase schema document would need to be updated.
- the syntax for the Manifest files would use rdf:parseType=collection
to keep the parsing of manifest files simple.
- simple entailment rules are indicated by an empty entailment rules
list.

The various manifests would need rewriting (pretty trivially
automatable).

Goedel would be proud - I'm both inconsistent _and_ incomplete.
