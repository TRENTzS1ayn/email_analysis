No need to apologize, it's on the web :-)
and Jeremy is definitely the driving force!

I think you need to use an rdf:List for test:entailmentRules.  As you
have it now, the test:entailmentRules arcs can be dropped by RDF
simple entailment, but doing so renders the test statement false.
For example, a PositiveEntailmentTest on RDFS entailment is likely to
have its conclusions no longer follow from its premises if the
entailmentRules arc is dropped.
]]

and rdf:List can indeed repair that situation I think.
Same for (more than one) test:premiseDocument btw
(we actually have such cases in OWL test today).
It is late in the day, but I think we have to fix this...

plus the test:premiseDocument list I gather...

The bane of my existence is...
