Fellow Editors:

The latest version of Semantics

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_LC2.5.html

has some changes to the subsection organization. I mention this in 
case other documents refer to any sections by name. The changes are:

Section numbers 3.n 4.n and 5.n are all changed n/n+1, so for example 
3.2.3 is now 3.3.3, etc. . All the old anchors still go to the same 
section as before, even though the section number has changed.

Sections 5 main title is changed to

5. Interpreting Datatypes

The sections

3.1 RDF Interpretations  (anchor #RDFINTERP)
4.1 RDFS Interpretations (#RDFSINTERP)
5.1 Datatyped Interpretations (#DTYPEINTERP)

are all new: they each contain the material which was formerly the 
'first part' of sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively. This is the bulk of 
the precise normative material after section 1.

This was done in order to make the normative RFC 2119 stuff about 
semantic extensions in section 0.1 more precise. It now reads:
"Semantic extensions of RDF MUST conform to the semantic conditions 
for simple interpretations described in sections 1.3 and 1.4 and 1.5 
and those for RDF interpretations described in section 3.1 of this 
document. "

With the earlier (lack of) organization, it was impossible to exactly 
pin down the material need in this reference.
