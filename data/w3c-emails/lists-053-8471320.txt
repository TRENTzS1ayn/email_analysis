No, they are correct. The stuff mentioned in the conclusion doesnt 
have to be mentioned in the assumption.  However, it is fine for a 
FORWARD rule-based reasoner not to generate all valid conclusions 
from an empty graph, just as it would make sense not to generate 
everything from a contradiction. But think of a query-responding 
engine that is given the conclusion as a query: it could just say YES 
without even bothering to check into its KB.
