With regards to rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure there is IMO absolutely
nothing new here. 

The wrapper proposal that they suggest is (a) an earlier design that we
discussed in great length and (b) not the kind of solution that we should
be responsible for, as it concerns the general problem of capturing
contextual information of arbitrary XML fragments -- and if/when the XML
community agree on a standardized solution to that problem, it will work
flawlessly with our present design.

I'm not the least motivated to reopen this issue.

Regards,

Patrick
