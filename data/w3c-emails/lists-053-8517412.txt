WebOntWG

there is a proposal to change some of the RDF test schema, which would have
some impact on the derived OWL testOntology.

Looking at

http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-test/#manifest

OWL tests use the rdfTest:entailmentRules property only indirectly.

Each OWL test has a test type, and most have definitions which restrict the
value of rdfTest:entailmentRules appropriately e.g.
[[
<rdfs:Class rdf:about="#PositiveEntailmentTest">
   <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&rdfTest;PositiveEntailmentTest"/>
   <rdfs:comment>
This is a positive entailment test according to the OWL entailment rules.
   </rdfs:comment>
   <rdfs:subClassOf>
     <owl:Restriction>
       <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="&rdfTest;entailmentRules"/>
       <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"/>
     </owl:Restriction>
   </rdfs:subClassOf>
</rdfs:Class>
]]

Thus, unless some developers actually do OWL processing of the manifest, to
access the appropriate entailment rules, we can make changes.

For example, the HP tests use the test class as an explicit indicator of
which testing software to run. Hence the implied values for
&rdfTest;entailmentRules don't actual enter into it.

Mr incredibly-commited-to-OWL might extract a test from the manifest, then
determine which rules to apply by taking the values for
&rdfTest;entailmentRules in the OWL closure of the manifest. I don't really
believe anybody does that! They would have to change their code.

In any case, this change would mean that there will be a knock on change on
the OWL testOntology.
