The RDFCore message thread [2] responding to my previous reporting of this 
seemed to indicate otherwise, I guess I misunderstood or something has changed.

We're not using a (purely) forward rule-based reasoner, we are running the 
tests via a query interface, and would have no problem implementing it, if 
that is the correct thing to do.

My reading of the LC2 working drafts (not the editor's draft) is that a 
query to an empty model of the form:

   * rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty

should return empty, due to the restriction of the rdfs axioms to the 
vocabulary {V U crdfV U rdfsV}. Is that right (again in the LC docs not the 
editor's draft)?

I guess this would be framed as a negative entailment test of the form:

    "does the empty graph entail the graph:
    _:a rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty ."

If this understanding is right then that is why I felt the vocabulary in 
the conclusion does have to be mentioned in the assumptions. It would be 
rather inconvenient if a query of this form returned empty but a query for 
a specific rdf:_1 property returns a match.

I guess all this is now moot. I see from [3] that the semantics document 
has changed to drop the crdfV restriction so the above wildcard query 
should return an infinite set of matches. Is that correct?

This seems like quite a big post-LC2 change.
