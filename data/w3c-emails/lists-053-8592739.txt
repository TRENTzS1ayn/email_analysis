Further, as far as I understand, the Last Call 2 doc had the empty document
entailing only a finite number of ground triples, whereas the current
editors draft has the empty document entailing an infinite number of ground
triples.

HP is unlikely to implement such a change, and would oppose it, if it were
formally proposed.

Moreover, since this substantive change (assuming my understanding is
correct) had not been highlighted before the PR vote, we may need to ask the
chairs to rewind history a little.

I don't follow the transitivity argument ...

G entails H if every interpretation of G is an interpretation of H.

this is clearly transitive, and a "counter-example" like

*empty*
  entails
rdf:_1 rdf:type rdfs:Resource
  entails
rdf:_1 rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty

is flawed because the first entailment is false according to the LC2
semantics.

Is it possible to undo some of the changes to semantics without it falling
apart, leaving hermann and/or peter dissatisfied?
