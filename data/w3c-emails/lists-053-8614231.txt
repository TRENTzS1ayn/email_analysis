In the absence of arguments that this change is editorial and not substantive, 
I ask that the chairs reopen the PR decision, in order to consider the 
resolution of Herman's last call comments which triggered this change.

[This is nullified if Pat or others, can make a compelling case that I have 
misunderstood the situation, and the correct understanding of the two test 
cases is the same in both LC2 semantics and the current editors draft]

Sorry

Jeremy
