In the LC2 semantics I read

[[
Even the empty graph has a large number of rdfs-entailments which
are not rdf-entailments, for example all triples of the form

xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

are true in all rdfs-interpretations of any vocabulary containing xxx.
]]

so this is about the *empty* premise graph and

[[
A set of names is referred to as a vocabulary. The vocabulary
of a graph is the set of names which occur as the subject,
predicate or object of any triple in the graph. Note that
URI references which occur inside typed literals are not
required to be in the vocabulary of the graph.
]]

so I guess xxx is in the vocabulary of the conclusion graph
and so I don't see where the above entailment is flawed...
