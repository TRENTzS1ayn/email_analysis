As I recall, Pat is travelling in the early part of this week.  This 
will hamper clarification of this issue.

The suggestion is that a substantive change, i.e. one visible in a test 
case, has been inadvertently made without consulting the WG.  If true, 
that is unfortunate.

However, I suggest the barrier to reopening the PR decision is quite 
high.  Procedural irregularity is not enough.  Lets address substantive 
matters.

This suggests that HP can live with the current situation.
