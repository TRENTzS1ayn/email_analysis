The deleted I-D appears to be a mistake.  I've just sent a message to the 
I-D editor, but due to the IETF meeting in progress it may not be seen for 
a while.

Anyway, my understanding and recollection is that the MIME type 
registration does refer to the Concepts document.

I'll digest and contemplate the other points separately.
