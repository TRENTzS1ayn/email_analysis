To:w3c-rdfcore-wg@w3.org, Martin Duerst<duerst@w3.org>


Thinking about items 2-7 of Martin's email.

These comments, particularly item 3, seem to indicate that Martin is 
missing the point.  According to the approach described in Concepts, 
different MIME types are free to adopt their own fragid handling (I avoid 
saying 'semantics' here).  This isn't so much a decision as a recognition 
of the real world out there.

Which suggests that some editorial clarification may be needed.

BUT:
(a) this section has already been the subject of a fair amount of active 
debate during the first last call period, and
(b) the formal semantics leave no room for alternative treatments of 
fragment identifiers as they appear in an RDF graph, and this is just an 
explanatory section that attempts to explain how that view is not at odds 
with the conventional web-retrieval view.

THEREFORE:
I propose that we do not put the publication schedule and consensus already 
developed at risk by trying to address Martin's editorial points in the 
short period available to us.

Instead, I suggest that careful editorial work be undertaken for 
publication in an errata document, and subsequently in a revised 
publication of the Concepts document.
