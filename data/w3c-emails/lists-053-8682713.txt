[[
Even the empty graph has a large number of rdfs-entailments which
are not rdf-entailments, for example all triples of the form

xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource .

are true in all rdfs-interpretations of any vocabulary containing xxx.

For the entailment to hold, all interpretations of empty must make the 
consequences true.

There are (or at least were) interpretations of empty which do not include 
rdf:_1 in their vocabulary. For such interpretations the consequences are 
false and the entailment does not (or at least did not) hold.
