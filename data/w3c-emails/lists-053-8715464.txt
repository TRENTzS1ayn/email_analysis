I've just updated the disposition of lc2 comments document [1]

There is a bit of tidying up to be done:

   - I've posted an attempt to close comments arising from Herman's 
review of semantics
   - DanC has the action to respond to I18N comments

However, that still leaves 5 comments on TestCases and one on primer 
needing a response.
