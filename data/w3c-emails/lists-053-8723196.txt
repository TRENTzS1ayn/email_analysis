I propose that the comment in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003OctDec/0097.html
is editorial, and that I send the following reply:

[[
Dan--

Thanks for catching this.  As you suggest, the indicated text will be 
changed from:

"typed literal is given as the value of the ex:creation-date property
element"

to

"typed literal is given as the value of the exterms:creation-date 
property element"

Please reply cc-ing www-rdf-comments indicating whether this change is 
acceptable.

Thanks again.

--Frank
