I am still trying to understand this properly, and I am still not sure whether 
or not the change is substantive.

I am hoping Pat can clarify why the ground entailments of the empty graph 
became infinite. It seems that in July we had only finite ground entailments 
e.g.
in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0352.html

which quotes 

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_Weak.html#rdfs_interp

in particular

[[
The subset of rdfV consisting of the first 3 items in the above list,
{rdf:type   rdf:Property rdf:XMLLiteral} is called the core RDF
vocabulary, crdfV.
]]

[[
An rdfs-interpretation of V is an rdf-interpretation I of V union crdfV
union rdfsV which satisfies the following semantic conditions and all
the triples in the subsequent table, called the RDFS axiomatic triples,
which contain only names from V union crdfV union rdfsV.
]]

If the comment from ter Horst concerning transitivity calls for substantive 
change, or in response to Reynold's comment concerning the two relevant 
tests, how difficult would it be to revert to wording more like this?
