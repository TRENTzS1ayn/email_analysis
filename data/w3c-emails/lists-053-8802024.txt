Brian, Eric, Sandro, DanBri,

I'm resuming work on getting to propose rec,
i.e. resolving remaining @@s in

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030331-advance
  $Revision: 1.18 $ of $Date: 2003/11/06 21:56:27 $

  which cites
  http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#Objections
and
  http://www.w3.org/2003/11/results/rdf-core-tests
and the specs, of course.

To the extent you're available for real-time collaboration,
please be available in irc://irc.w3.org:6665/rdfcore .

Editors are welcome too, as well as anybody else
who wants to cheerlead or otherwise contribute.
