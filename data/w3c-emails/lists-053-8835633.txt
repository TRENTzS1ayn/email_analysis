I'm not sure what semantics you intended for querying, but if the 
question is posed in terms of entailment, and if you supply an actual 
CMP name and ask if it is a CMP, then the answer should be 'yes' even 
from an empty graph, since (in LC) entailment(of E by S) is defined 
relative to interpretations of the combined vocabularies of E and S.

OK, in that form the answer is "yes" both in the LC version and the 
modified version. It does entail it.

Well, the MT doesnt specify a semantics for a query language, so I 
don't quite know how to deal with this. BUt take as an analogy simple 
propositional calculus, where any tautology is entailed by the empty 
set of assertions. Given an empty set, you wouldn't want an engine to 
generate all tautologies: but given a a tautological query, you might 
expect it to say 'yes'. What about given part of a tautological 
query? Suppose you ask it

* or not P ?

would you expect it to answer 'P' ? I wouldn't, myself: but in any 
case, the semantics has no way to answer that question, since you 
havn't give a semantics for the wild-card symbol.

Being more helpful, I think that a perfectly reasonable way of 
interpreting the wild-card is that it should match any vocabulary 
items actually present, so that it would make sense for such a query 
to fail on the empty graph but succeed when an actual name is 
supplied.  That would be normal for a syntactic wildcard. It means 
that a wildcard is not the same as a genuine universally quantified 
variable, but then you probably don't want it to be.

Yes....

I really have no idea what you think the appropriate behavior for a 
wildcard query should be; I don't think we have ever discussed this 
in the WG (??to my recollection, in any case). The test-case 
entailments havn't changed, however.
