No, it has always entailed an infinite number of them of the form

rdf:_n rdf:type rdf:Property .

They weren't in the 'closure', as we once defined it in the
closure lemmas - and that was the point of going through all this 
contortion involving crdfV - but they were entailed, in the sense that

{ } entails {rdf:_n rdf:type rdf:Property .}

was a true statement (in LC2 and now.)  Since the lemmas are no 
longer stated in terms of closures, and that was the only reason for 
the crdfV restriction, this change seemed to me to be purely internal 
to the semantics.

Well, Im not sure what that word 'implement' means. The MT doesn't 
constrain a reasoner to be strongly complete wrt entailment, and 
certainly not a forward rule-based reasoner. But this is an issue 
with forward reasoners in just about any language. Such a reasoner 
for propositional calculus would have the same issue: the set of 
tautologies is infinite.

Yes, phrased this directly it is, which is why I like this direct 
phrasing.  LC2 doesnt state it this directly, which is where the 
problems arose.
