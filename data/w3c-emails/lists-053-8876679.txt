My understanding however is that it is not true, and that as I said, 
no test cases are affected.

Full disclosure: there is a case which COULD have been a test case 
but isn't, which would have been affected if had been a test case, 
which is

{ } entails { _:x rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty .}

which is not an valid LC2-entailment.  That is, the current semantics 
requires that some containermembership properties must exist, even if 
nobody talks about them.
