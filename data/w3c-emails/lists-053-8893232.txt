Yes, exactly.

Right, spot on.

Well, OK, I confess that this particular case only occurred to me 
recently ( apparently after it occurred to you) which is why I did 
not mention it in my earlier message.

Reverting to procedure for the moment, I was under the strong 
impression that 'no change to any test cases' was the currently 
applicable criterion for 'substantial change', perhaps also including 
'no substantial affect on OWL'. Since Herman's comments, to which I 
am trying to respond, are as I understand it spoken with the voice of 
the Webont WG, I take it that checking the latter with Herman is 
prima facia sufficient for that part of the process.
