In brief: pending confirmation from Brian, I'm inclined to
agree with Pat that this is an editorial change. It
seems to be consistent with the proceedings of the WG
and responsive to a comment.

Details...

Euler and Surnia seem to agree that they're correct.
3store disagrees with test004, but I'm inclined to
chalk that up as a bug.

That has never been entirely clear to me, so I take this
opportunity to catch up on the details... The test above
are named after issue
http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-seq-representation

The only WG decision I can find under that issue is about
the first/rest style collections, so as far as I can tell,
the WG has never explicitly instructed the editor, but
implicitly accepted the design in the LC1 and LC2 semantics
documents (by deciding to go to last call, i.e. deciding
that all issues are closed ot the WG's satisfaction).
The manifest for the tests cites the 10 Jan minutes as approval
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0025.html
I don't see a decision there, but item 6 notes a number
of completed actions. I'm having trouble finding the relevant
one; perhaps it was a consequence of a relevant WG decision.
I can't tell.

Anyway...


It seems important to distinguish between simple entialment,
RDF entailment, and RDFS entialment in these cases.
The empty graph does not simply-entiail rdf:_1 type Property;

"Empty Graph Lemma. The empty set of triples is entailed by any graph,
and does not entail any graph except itself."
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-mt-20031010/

Ah... I concur with Pat; the LC2 doc is pretty clear
that the empty graph rdf-entials rdf:_1 type Property
and infinitely many triples like it;
the "RDF axiomatic triples" box is quite explicit on that.
