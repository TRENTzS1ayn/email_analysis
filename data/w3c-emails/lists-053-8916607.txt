This is indeed right (and nice to see those {} btw)
but I was nor sure if my actual code was doing the right
thing, but it did, at least we couldn't find a proof thing for

_:X rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty .

(whereas we could find evidence for
rdf:_9270 rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty .
and for both case nothing else was given)

The MT gives a very clear account and that is really valuable!
