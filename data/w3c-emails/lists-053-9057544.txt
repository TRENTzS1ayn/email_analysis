Ugh... I spent the whole day on this!

We're now at $Revision: 1.25 $.


The remaining @@s are

 -- One for each occurence of "DRAFT"
 -- Proposed Status. Brian, please make one up
or get EricM to make one up.
I think EricM put one in one of the request
drafts at some point. It's not critical that
you get it exactly right; it'll get tweaked
before actual publication.
 -- "@@DanC can't tell what edits are pending on this
   one [rdf-testcases], requests that Brian describe them
   before sending this request"
 -- re rdf-concepts, "Editorial updates in response to comments
  from PFPS (@@Brian, is that right? are there others?) to
  appear in an editor's draft presently."
 -- under summary of review "(@@TODO: responses to LC2 comments
   from I18N, fragments, a few on test)." I have since sent
   a response to I18N; it needs follow-up by primer and perhaps
   concepts editors.
 -- Under "Implementation Experience and Endorsement"
  "@@ cite sources for descriptions and links back to projects @@"
  This is from a discussion between EricM and myself, where I
  pointed out that it wasn't clear where we're quoting vs.
  paraphrasing. e.g. we can't say "Drive fully compliant with
  the W3C RDF syntax specification" because we haven't defined
  what it means for software to comply with the RDF syntax spec.
  But we could quote the developer saying it, since it's clearly
  an endorsement of sorts. Brian, do something you think is
  reasonable, please.

In discussion with Brian, I decided not to send the request
for PR today since we haven't answered all the last call
comments. Brian has agreed to send
our request as soon as the @@s are worked out. He asked
whether there's a deadline and I told him no, just ASAP.
I'd like to see it done by Friday or early next week.

Thanks for dropping by, Pat and Sandro.
