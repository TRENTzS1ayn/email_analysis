First, the entailmentRules marker for "Simple" entailment is added;
that's the first of Sandro's comments, and Brian has indicated that this
is editorial.

Secondly, a simpler approach to Sandro's closed-world comment is:

[[
The working group accept this comment that the test case manifest format
currently has some closed-world assumptions.

However, it is felt that a change to the manifest format at this stage
would be potentially counter-productive, requiring effort from all
maintainers of test case harnesses in order to run the same set of
tests.

Therefore a postponed issue, [test-case-format-closed-world], has been
created, to track this concern.
]]

It's not an outright rejection and meets the time constraints of PR, so
I think this might be the better middle ground - ?
