I'm scrambling to deal with some HP stuff and getting the request to 
advance ready, so I'm a bit behind on email, but getting to it.

My present understanding is that we don't need a telecon - we've got 
things acceptably well sorted out by email, so I propose to cancel this 
weeks telecon unless anyone shouts.

I'll send an update on the status of comments etc in a wee while.

Brian
