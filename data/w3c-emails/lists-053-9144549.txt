There is an anchor at the beginning of that paragraph (para 7 in 
section 0.1, beginning "Particular uses of RDF, ..."):

#DefSemanticExtension

and in the latest version (2.6,  just done today) I have added the anchor

#RDFSemanticExtension

one sentence before the point you suggest, ie at "Extensions or dialects..."

Yup. And DAML, for that matter.
