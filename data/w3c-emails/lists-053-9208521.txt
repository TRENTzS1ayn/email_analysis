DanC:  I've completed the changes you requested to

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030331-advance.html

and removed draft status and final @@'s

The next step is to send to the director, copying chairs - right? Do I 
send the doc, or a link?  The request looks different to others I see in 
the archive, so I'm checking.  It makes no mention of satisfying 
dependencies as required by process doc [1] - thats ok - right.  It 
doesn't suggest a timescale for review as the recent XML Core request does.

EDs:  The request to advance contains status info about edits still in 
progress.  Please verify these are correct.  I think they are and will 
go ahead as soon I've verified the process, if I don't hear form you.

Brian
