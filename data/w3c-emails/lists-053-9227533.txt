To be precise, the Primer will also include editorial updates in 
response to the first message from Martin,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003OctDec/0120.html
which also arrived 7 November.  (This message is the one pointed to by 
the "raised" link on issue "i18n-comments" assigned to Concepts;  but 
some of the comments in that message were directed at Primer).
