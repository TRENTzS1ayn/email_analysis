I took a quick look at v 1.36; looks good.

I'd send a text version of the document
http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/html2txt?url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030331-advance
plus a link.

That's less than ideal. Ideally, we'd enumerate dependencies
under "summary of review", but I'm reasonably confident
we did in fact resolve our dependencies (esp. I18N, WebOnt,
XML Schema) and we can supply details on request.

Was the XML Core request a CR request? The time for a PR review
is set in the process document: 4 weeks.
