If I'm not mistaken there's an error in the manifest
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdfs-entailment/Manifest.rdf
in that misses 2 s'es in following URI's
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-entailment/test001.nt
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-entailment/test002.nt
                                               ^s
The same for the overall manifest
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/Manifest.rdf

Sorry that I haven't come up with that earlier
but those are recently added tests and I wasn't
able to run them before this evening (and I also
had a lot of trouble to run them as they are
about inconsistencies, but they now run (*))
