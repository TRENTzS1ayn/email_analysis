If it helps, I just knocked up this...

<div class="entry">
<p>Swish is a toolkit for Semantic Web inference written in
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
It is being developed to support simple Semantic web applications, through 
the creation
of generic and specific command-line RDF inference programs, with a 
particular view to
inclusion of datatype-aware reasoning.   Datatype reasoning is seen as a 
way for
controlled inclusion of additional processing capabilities into a simple 
RDF inference
process.</p>
<p>The current released version of Swish contains a Notation3 parser,
together with graph comparison and merging capabilities.
A framework for implementing various kinds of rules, including datatype 
constraint reasoning,
is at an advanced state of development, and is hoped to be released before 
the end of 2003.</p>
<p>It is intended that this framework can be used as a testbed for exploring
RDF inference features required to build real applications, a motivating 
example
of which is a network access control configuration experiment undertaken as 
part of the
SWAD-E project
(cf. <a href="http://www.ninebynine.org/SWADE/Intro.html#HomeNetAccessDemo">
http://www.ninebynine.org/SWAD-E/Intro.html#HomeNetAccessDemo)</a>.</p>
