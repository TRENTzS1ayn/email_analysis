On the 2LC comments page, the comment "i18n-comments-more" under Primer 
shows a WG response of "not accepted".  This seems a bit odd, since the 
link points to a message in which, of the 8 comments made, I agreed to 
make 4 of them exactly as stated, and suggested an alternative solution 
to address a 5th one.  It also makes us look less responsive to comments 
  that we perhaps actually are.  Perhaps this is unimportant at this 
late stage of things, but isn't there such a thing as "partially accepted"?
