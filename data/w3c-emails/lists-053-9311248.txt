You make a good point Frank.  In the past we might have split these up 
into separate comments, but this time round I haven't done that.  I 
don't have a partially accepted and when I came to filling in the RDF I 
figured that the not-accepted dominated, in the sense that it would be 
more misleading to suggest that we have accepted the comment, when we 
had not accepted at least part of it.

I could introduce a partially-accepted if folks feel strongly about it, 
or if I find time to do it anyway.  I guess we could also split the 
comment into two, the ones we accept and the ones we dont.  I'm actually 
inclined to leave it alone, but that could be laziness on my part.

Let me know if folks think its important to correct.

I don't think it will be perceived as a reflection on your 
responsiveness to comments.
