I don't.

W3C process has no need to know whether we accepted their
comment or not; only whether they were satisfied with
the way we responded to it.

For my purposes, it would be better not to say whether
we accepted or rejected it. It can be distracting.
What's critical is that (a) we were responsive,
providing a response to all the points in their message,
and asking "are you satisfied by this response?"
and (b) keeping careful track of when they said "no"
and we didn't subsequently try to satisfy them a
different way.
