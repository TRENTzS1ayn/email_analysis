Not that it needs a telecon,. but no doubt you have seen Herman's 
latest message by now. Im not sure what we can/should do about it. 
Privately I am working on a 'minimal edit' correction which makes the 
smallest possible change. I think I can get it to be a small 
restatement of the RDFS entailment lemma (along the lines I outlined 
in my reply to Herman) together with an explanatory paragraph; or 
else his additional rule and a short paragraph of explanation of its 
role and relationship to rules 6 and 10.

If anyone has any opinions about which option would be the least 
awkward or preferable, please let me know.

I have no idea what the appropriate way to handle a correction would 
be at this stage, however. If it would be best to do nothing, that 
would be fine with me: this is a very marginal case and unlikely to 
arise in practice.
