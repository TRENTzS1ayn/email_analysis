Following review comments, the W3C RDFcore working group's draft for 
registering application/RDF+XML was updated some time ago, per [1]:

[1] 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-03.txt

(after a brief absence, this is draft is now back online)

No further comments have been noted, either on <ietf-types@iana.org>, or on
<www-rdf-comments@w3.org>.

The RDF specification has just completed its second W3C last-call, and is 
requested [3] for consideration for advancement to a Proposed 
Recommendation (W3C-speak for approximately draft standard).  The 
specification documents are linked from [2].

[2] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#documents
[3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Nov/0146.html

Accordingly, I think it is appropriate that in the near future we request 
IESG consideration of this draft for RFC publication and registration of 
the Content Type.  If there are any remaining issues, please let us know on 
<mailto:www-rdf-comments@w3.org>.

Thanks.
