I'm just back from travelling.  I would have preferred to send this 
message yesterday.

We have not had a telecon for a while, but I'm not aware of any business 
for the WG to discuss, so I'm proposing not to have one again this week.

But if anyone knows of stuff we need to discuss, please let me know.

Brian
