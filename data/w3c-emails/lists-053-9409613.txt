Sandro - it seems as if the results of the negative entailment
tests are included in the results of the positive entailment tests
at http://www.w3.org/2003/11/results/rdf-core-tests
(I was triggered by my low percentage :))

Unfortunately I also found a bug in my handling of negative
entailment tests and so we now have 4 failures :( bad bad bad
