See
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-Datatypes
for current text.

1: delete note:
[[
In [XML-SCHEMA1], white space normalization occurs during validation according 
to the value of the whiteSpace facet. The lexical-to-value mapping used in 
RDF datatyping occurs after this, so that the whiteSpace facet has no effect 
in RDF datatyping. 
]]

2: Replace:
[[
A datatype consists of a lexical space, a value space and a lexical-to-value 
mapping. 
]]
with
[[
A datatype consists of a lexical space, a value space, a lexical-to-value 
mapping, and optionally a whitespace facet. 
]]

3: Before:
[[
A datatype is identified by one or more URI references. 
]]

[[
The whitespace facet, if any, is one of the values ???? [TBD] as defined in 
[XML Schema1]
]]


3:
Between:
[[
A datatype is identified by one or more URI references. 
****
RDF may be used with any datatype definition that conforms to this 
abstraction, even if not defined in terms of XML Schema. 
]]

Add the following:
[[
To define the operational of an RDF datatype we use the terms 
extended lexical-to-value mapping, and extended lexical space.

For datatypes without a whitespace facet, the extended lexical-to-value 
mapping is identical to the lexical-to-value mapping, and the extended 
lexical space is identical to the lexical space.

Otherwise, the extended lexical-to-value mapping consists of first
applying whitespace normalization following [XML Schema1] as
appropriate for the 
whitespace facet
and then applying the lexical-to-value mapping. 
The extended lexical space is the domain of the extended lexical-to-value 
mapping. i.e. a string is in the extended lexical space if and only if the 
result of whitespace normalization of that string is in the lexical space.
]]

4.
Specifiy that rdf:XMLLiteral does not have a whitespace facet

5. 
Specify that XSD datatypes have the whitespace facet as defined by XSD.

6.
In other documents (particularly semantics) globally substitute lexical space 
by extended lexical space and lexical-to-value mapping by extended 
lexical-to-value mapping.
