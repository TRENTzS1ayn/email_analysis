Hi Pat,

I note that in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0375

you are responding to Herman indicating that some of the text in semantics has 
tried to avoid more obscure mathematical conventions.
While I think this is generally desirable, I got the impression (without a 
detailed read), that the sections being discussed were things like proofs 
which were hardly going to appeal to a non-mathematical audience.

(No particular suggestion - just a comment)

Jeremy
