Sorry Patrick I did not provide context ...

At the telecon on Friday it was mentioned that we might get a negative 
comment from XML Schema WG about whitespace.

However, as you will have seen, most likely we get no comment.

Given the tight timeline the chairs asked that I should have a draft ready 
for consideration if the WG wished to reopen this issue in light of a 
negative comment.

I am largely on your side, I think the text I posted is a bit of a hash, 
but tries to make as clean a job as possible of the potential alternative 
design. I am not expecting this to be proposed, but await the agenda with 
interest.

The scenario we are trying to avoid is getting blown off course by a 
comment we cannot ignore saying we have made a mistake.

I wonder if the last call for review should mention this as an at risk 
aspect of the design, and whether that can be done in a way that still 
allows us to change if we get LC2 comments to the effect that we should.
