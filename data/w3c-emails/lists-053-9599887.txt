It hasn't.

There are two questions we can ask here.

A)

Is " 3 " in the lexical space of xsd:decimal?

If asked, I'd be very surprised if anyone in xml schema answered 
anything other than no.

B)

What is the value of the property in

   <rdf:Description>
     <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;decimal"> 3 </eg:prop>
   </rdf:Description>

We had informal indications at last weeks telecon that the xml schema 
WG, looking at question B, were going to be seriously unhappy with the 
answer the current specs give.

Accordingly, jjc was actioned to draft an alternative that would allow 
he answer to B to be 3.  This was so that we could take a look at it and 
have it ready should we get a formal comment from the xml schema folks.

Neither a decision, nor a proposal.  Just preparation.
