Well, OK, but there's can-read-math and 
lives-and-breathes-category-theory audiences, and the second is even 
smaller. I tried to follow Herman's basic advice (it does come out 
simpler, I have to admit) without assuming acquaintance with 
conventions like fxg(a) meaning <f(a),g(a)>

>(No particular suggestion - just a comment)
