Looking at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-testcases-20030117/
dated 5 September 2003.

some editorial comments I only just noticed:

"come out false" --?--> "be false in any interpretation"  or maybe 
"always be false"

RDF-Entailment --> RDF-entailment

section 2  datatype-aware entailment tests, why is 'supported' inside 
quotes in last bullet but not elsewhere? Also second bullet ends 
"finally," but there are two more.

----------

My action item <>

20030919#14 PatH To consider amendments to test cases concerning nonentailments

was to suggest a form of words for describing what it means to pass a 
negative entailment test, right? Suggestion:

"The test is considered to be passed if the entailment is 
<em>not</em> drawn using the rules of RDF-entailment or 
RDFS-entailment, as above."
-->
"The test is <em>failed</em> if the conclusion can be drawn from the 
premises using the rules of RDF- or RDFS-entailment. The test is 
considered to be <em>passed</em> when a thorough attempt to fail the 
test is unable to achieve failure."

This sounds vague, but then success at a non-entailment test *is* 
vague, so the wording is designed to suggest to a thoughtful reader 
that the notion needs some care.
