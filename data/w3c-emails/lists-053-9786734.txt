Interpret it as: when you run your code to exhaustion (it stops, or 
runs out of memory or time according to your view of what its 
resource limitations are) it fails to fail. The vagueness arises from 
the fact that if you had bought more RAM, maybe, or let it run for 
TWO weeks, maybe it might have failed.
