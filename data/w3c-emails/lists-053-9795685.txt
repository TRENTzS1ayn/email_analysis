Alternative, maybe too long-winded (?)

"The test is <em>failed</em> if the conclusion can be drawn from the 
premises using the rules of RDF- or RDFS-entailment. The test is 
considered to be <em>passed</em> when it can be conclusively 
demonstrated that the conclusion cannot be so drawn. In practice, the 
test may be considered to be passed when a thorough attempt to fail 
the test is unable to achieve failure."
