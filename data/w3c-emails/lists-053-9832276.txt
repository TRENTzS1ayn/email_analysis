My personal opinion only: the first part would be consistent with the
current state of Charmod, in which most of the normalization-related
requirements have been softened to SHOULDs.

The last part, however, is not consistent with the first.  If data SHOULD be
normalized, then implementations SHOULD NOT accept it when not normalized
(but may, if "the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed
before choosing a different course" [RFC2119] is fulfilled) and SHOULD issue
a warning in such circumstances.
