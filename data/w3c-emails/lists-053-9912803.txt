Dear RDFCore colleagues,

Two  participants of Webont are in the process of reviewing the new RDF 
Semantics WD, in particular to see whether the changes since the LC 
version might give rise to problems for Webont. The reviews have not 
been completed yet; partial reviews can be found in the mail archives 
[1, 2]. The Webont WG discussed the review status tonight at its telecon 
and resolved to let RDFCore know that, although we certainly have some 
comments (as the partial reviews show), there is at the moment no 
indication that the changes to RDF Semantics since the LC version are 
problematic for Webont.

On behalf of the Web Ontology Working Group
Guus Schreiber, cochair
