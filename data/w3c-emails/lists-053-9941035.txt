You know, Francois, this analogy doesn't help 
your case.  Obviously using a non-normal form is 
not a crime or a sin, and it is not evil, and the 
analogy just makes your point seem ludicrous. 
Remember we are here responding to a strenuous 
technical objection to the restriction being 
applied at all, on interop grounds.  If most, or 
even a substantial fraction, of the world is 
'evil' then it is our job to allow them to be 
evil, and the priests can go to hell.
