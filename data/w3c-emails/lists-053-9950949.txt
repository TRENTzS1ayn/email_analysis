Thanks, guys.

I think not, since the old constraint applies to all RDF (and up) 
interpretations.

Perhaps the wording of this could be improved and expanded a little, I agree.

Yes, because of the disjointness of xsd:integer and any non-integer 
values in xsd:decimal.

Yes, since the value spaces of the datatypes are disjoint.

No.

That is true, and I should probably insert some more explanatory text 
to draw attention to these cases. Thanks for shining a light on this 
issue.

It may be impossible to make these changes before LC2, as our 
timetable is now extremely tight, but if not then I will undertake to 
insert some explanatory prose during the LC process before 
publication.

I think this can reasonably be regarded as editorial changes to the 
exposition, since it only seeks to clarify an existing situation.
