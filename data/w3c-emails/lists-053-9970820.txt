The doc at my website

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_LC2.1.html

is now dated 2 October and has some revised text in section 5 (and a 
small wording change in section 7) explaining the various ways that 
datatypes can produce inconsistencies, following today's feedback 
from Ian via Webont. These are editorial improvements to the 
exposition which I think will be helpful; Jeff was right that the old 
wording was rather ambiguous and didnt adequately point out all the 
possibilities.
