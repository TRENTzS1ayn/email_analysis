regrets (almost certain) for the meeting; I'll be                      
on way to Dublin Core advisory group in the morning (here in Seattle).

Aside: have had a few interesting conversations at DC re datatypes and 
re I18N/XMLLiteral. I now feel quite confident we've done the right 
thing w/ xml:lang and datatypes.

update:
So I have actions outstanding re sorting out the publication script and 
SOTD. I made the mistake of trying to get this done while sat in the 
conference, didn't get it finished. Basic outline: we put docs into
RDFCore/TR/incoming/rdf-schema/ (or whatever, eg. .../rdf-mt/), and 
whenever we have a dated document we point to sibling docs in this 
space, eg. in RDFS when I link to Primer I'll use uris like
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/incoming/rdf-primer/ 

The unfinished perl script on my laptop is intended to take content like 
that, plus a target date, and munge the docs into a form ready for 
copying into TR space on www.w3.org/TR/. The output will live in the 
outgoing/ directory nearby. That way, stuff in incoming/ (as in
"incoming from the editors") should be link-checkable.

I haven't got to the SOTD at all yet. I'll be sat in an all day DC 
meeting tommorrow, hopefully find time to progress that (also not 
sure about connectivity).

Dan
