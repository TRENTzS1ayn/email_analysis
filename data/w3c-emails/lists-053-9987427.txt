I disagree with this... I don't think we should be prescribing what to do 
with bad inputs ... it's up to an implementation how it wishes to deal with 
error situations.

Particularly since, in this case, I see no reason why different RDF 
implementations that choose to accept and process such non-NFC data as 
valid would arrive at different conclusions.
