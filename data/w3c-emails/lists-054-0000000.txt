>Hi Pat,
>Are we on for the telecon today at 11 my time?

Yes, lets target that time today, 11am your time, 1pm our time. I 
forget to send you the number: everyone phones 413 351 4140 . Any 
number of people can call from anywhere.  Say who you are when you 
call in.  If you hit the # key a mechanical voice will tell you how 
many other people are on the call.
