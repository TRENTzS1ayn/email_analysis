Looks like we are going to be late getting WG comments in on the  tag 
architecture document.  I had a quiet word with the Tag co-chair and he 
suggested we could ask for an extension.

Having committed that the WG would respond, I'd prefer that we honour 
that commitment.  Thus I propose to ask for an extension till 27 Mar and 
  we approve comments by email, if possible.

I suggest that folks send in personal comments asap and we get WG 
endorsement of them by email.  We have comments from Graham (thanks gk).

I propose:

   - any proposed WG comments to list by Friday 12th March.
   - email discussion following week
   - approve 19th Mar if there is no controversy

Brian
