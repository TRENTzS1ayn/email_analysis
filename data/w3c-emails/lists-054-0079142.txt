I will be sending some comments.  One immediate comment is that the one 
RDF reference cites M&S rather than any of the new batch of specs, and 
needs to be updated.  We might also want to think about a suggestion as 
to what form that reference should take.  If there is only going to be 
one RDF reference, and that to a single document as now, my call would 
be it ought to cite Concepts (just as the one reference to OWL is to the 
Language Reference), but people may have other ideas.
