Stuart,

I'm afraid, despite the TAG allowing ample time for review, that RDFCore 
will be late submitting comments on the architecture document.

We now hope to have them to you by 27 Mar 2004.  In the meantime, I have 
encouraged folks to send in such comments as they have as personal comments.

Brian
