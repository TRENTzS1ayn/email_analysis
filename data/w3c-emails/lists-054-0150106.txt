Hi Ned,

It's been a little while since we last exchanged emails concerning:
   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-04.txt

As we were so close to publication of the RDF specification as a full W3C 
Recommendation, the RDFcore working group decided to hold off so that the 
MIME type registration draft could cite the final specification 
documents.  In that time, a couple of minor editorial changes were applied, 
which I'm fairly confident are trivial enough to not require another round 
of review.

The editorial changes to the text are outlined in this message:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2004Mar/0001.html

Otherwise the only changes are in the references.

Accordingly, we'd like to request the appropriate approval for RFC 
(informational) publication, and registration of this MIME type in the IETF 
tree.

Thanks.
