Ted,
Scott,

I was engaged in some discussion with Ned about registration of 
application/rdf+xml MIME type as part of the W3C RDFcore working group 
output, but didn't notice he's no longer APP AD.  I was anticipating that 
our registration would go through under the old process (the I-D has been a 
work-in-progress for some time, since well before the new procedure was 
approved).  Are you content to run with this?

The I-D concerned is at:
   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-04.txt
and now that the revised RDF specs are finalized, we'd like to request 
(informational) RFC publication and registration of the MIME type in the 
IETF tree.

Apart from a few very minor editorial changes, and updates to the 
references, the draft has been presented for review on the IETF-types list, 
and no comments were received.  The editorial changes to the text are 
outlined in this message:
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2004Mar/0001.html

Can you please indicate how we should proceed?

Thanks,

#g
