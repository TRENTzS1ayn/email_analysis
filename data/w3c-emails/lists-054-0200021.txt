After talking this over a bit with Ted I think we're OK with either method.
If you started this work assuming use of the older 2048 procedure, let's
just continue along that path unless you want to use the newer procedures.

Now that I think about this some more I think we can do without the IETF
last call as this is just a registration document that's intended for
Informational status.  I'll leave it up to you, though: Informational -> no
last call needed, but I'd prefer a last call if this is intended to be a
standards track document like 3023.  We can add the 3023 references as an
RFC Editor note if nothing significant comes up during IESG discussion.  You
can also add them now and rev the document before I take it to the IESG if
you wish.

Yes -- if we go that route.  Let me know how you wish to proceed:

- registration procedure to be followed
- 3023 references
- Informational or standards track
