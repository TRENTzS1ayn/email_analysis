How annoying. I just trawled back through old versions of the spec:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327/ (CR of March 2000) has it.

http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303/ (PR of March 1999) didn't.

Took 4 years for someone to spot the typo. Wonder what else will have 
surfaced by 2008...
