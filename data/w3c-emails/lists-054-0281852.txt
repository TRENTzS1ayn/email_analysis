Scott,

My preference, because I think it is least additional work for all 
concerned, is:
- RFC2048 procedure
- Informational RFC
- 3023 references to be added as RFC editors note.  (I'll suggest that 
Aaron adds them and sends the corresponding XML2RFC source file to the RFC 
editor as soon as publication is approved;  cf. [1].)

Thanks for your consideration.
