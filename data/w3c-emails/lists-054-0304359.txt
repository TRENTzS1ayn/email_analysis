Here is a strawman formal comment from RDFCore to the TAG concerning the 
  architecture document last call.

I would like to decide by email that the WG approves sending this. 
Accordingly, I will send it on behalf of the WG if I hear sufficient 
specific endorsement and have no unresolved objections by Tues 23 Mar 2004.

===========

RDFCore would like to congratulate the TAG for making an excellent start 
on documenting the principles that govern the design of the architecture 
of the web.  We also recognise the great difficulty of the task the TAG 
has taken on.

In response to the call for review of [1], several members of the 
RDFCore WG have submitted many detailed comments on the document [2][3] 
[4] which we hope the TAG will find useful.  We are confident the TAG 
will give due consideration to each comment on its merits with or 
without specific endorsement by the RDFCore WG.  RDFCore requests, 
however, that the tag pay particular attention to comments that relate to:

   - having a clear vocabulary and meaning for fundamentatal notions 
such as resource, representation, naming, identifying etc.
   - interpretation and use of fragment identifiers
   - notions of authority and ownership of URIs and resources

We trust that the citation of the RDF Model and Syntax specification be 
replaced with a citation of the new RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax 
document [5] in due course.
