I approve in principle, and I think I approve in detail.

My slight uncertainty stems from not being sure if the points to which you 
draw particular attention adequately cover the issues of reference and 
denotation that (I think) lay at the heart of the debate between Pat and 
TimBL (cited in my comments).  I think your first such point:
[[
   - having a clear vocabulary and meaning for fundamentatal notions such 
as resource, representation, naming, identifying etc.
]]
could reasonably be construed as covering this.  If there is no further 
comment about this forthcoming, I suggest accepting your proposed text as 
it stands.
