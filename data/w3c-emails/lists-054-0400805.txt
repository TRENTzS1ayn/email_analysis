For what it's worth, I do see a difference between:

(a) believing that a certain decision is not the best decision that could 
be made (grounds for a vote against in a WG meeting), and

(b) believing that a decision is sufficiently harmful that it merits a 
formal objection on the record.

At least, that is how I have thought about these matters.  There are 
several decisions we made that I don't think were the best possible, but 
not so seriously flawed that I felt compelled to register a formal 
objection.  Consensus involves some compromise.
