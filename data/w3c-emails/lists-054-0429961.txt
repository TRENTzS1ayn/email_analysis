Yes, I think so.

But it would maybe require some terminological upheaval (e.g. is a URI 
primarily an *identifier*, as its name would suggest?  Not as far as RDF is 
concerned).  I suppose, though, if the distinction can and should be drawn 
anywhere, it's in the architecture document.  There's also a very different 
distinction between "identifier" and "reference" that TimBL has 
articulated, giving rise to URI vs URI-reference.

(I think that, in addition to a glossary, a short introduction to the 
concepts here --Description vs Computation-- which can explain something of 
the other side to computation-oriented developers could be helpful.)

Anyway, I'm not the person you have to convince here.  I'd be happy to see 
the terminology clarified along these lines to give us well-defined ways of 
talking about the various concepts at work, as long as many people will use 
it consistently, but others may be more resistant.
