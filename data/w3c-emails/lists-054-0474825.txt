My reading of the process document concurs with Graham not Dan ...

http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/tr.html#doc-reviews
[[Reviewers MAY register a formal objection any time they are dissatisfied 
with how a Working Group has handled an issue.]]

with formal objection linked to
http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/policies.html#WGArchiveMinorityViews

with text which clearly suggests that a formal objection is a document of 
some sort (e.g. an e-mail).


However,
http://www.w3.org/2004/02/Process-20040205/policies.html#Consensus
defines consensus has including the absence of objections - and it is not 
clear whether this is or is not intended to mean formal objections.

I act on the assumption that voting against=objection
and these !=formal objection
