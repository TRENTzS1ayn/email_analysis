Do they? Are you quite sure? I have heard this claimed many times,
and I have never seen a convincing argument. I am looking at
your comments for just the 2nd time; the first time was just
a quick skim.

Your claim sounds very reminiscent of
  "The Myth of Names and Addresses"
  http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/NameMyth.html
I cite that not as an argument from the TAG, but as
evidence that this line of argument is perennially raised,
but not persuasively.

no, I don't believe there is any such presumption in the webarch
document.

yes, quite.

I don't think so. As I recall, we just haven't much reason
to say that wood is a resource.

It's a resource.

You seem to feel we need to constrain it more. I don't think
there's any need to.

in that case, it's related by some HTTP protocol messages.

And so...? 

This seems to be a comment that web architecture is incompletely
specified. Yes, it is.

But earlier, you seemed to be claiming that the webarch document
is inconsisent. This does not justify that claim.

There is your claim again, still not justified.

Well, the level of detail we have written down so far seems
to be an improvement over nothing to quite a few people.
We do intend to elaborate it eventually, but it's not clear
to me what you need that you haven't got already.

What's the difference?

That's yet another strong claim, without justification.



I have spent about half an hour reading these comments without
finding justification for your claim that our document is
inconsisent.

I wonder if I could trouble you for a shorter version of your
argument?
