Hi all,

just a note that the XML Core are tinkering with the language concerning 
xml:lang (particularly xml:lang="").

This seems OK to me. The wording below is still one on which we could 
have had the very same argument with I18N WG - so that seems to be 
maintaining the status quo.

Jeremy

Hello Paul,

Many thanks for updating me on this issue. Because it actually
originated with the I18N WG, I am forwarding this to the I18N IG
mailing list and putting it on the agenda of this week's meeting.

Regards,    Martin.
