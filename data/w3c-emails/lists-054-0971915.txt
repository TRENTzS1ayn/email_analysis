At the time 9070 was published, I checked with the U.S. ISBN agency and was told
(in writing) that they would support our use of publisher prefixes for
registered owner identifiers, and that there was no fee for the assignment of a
prefix. You do not have to be a publisher to obtain one.

Exactly! Using "-//SUN::SUNSOFT"  as an unregistered, not guaranteed unique
prefix is perfectly o.k. Where Sun departs from the standard is in trying to
claim that it owns the prefix. Only registered owner prefixes can be owned.

An ISBN publisher prefix is a two-level hierarchy, region and publisher. I think
there are 10 regions (the first digit).

And there is no need to. Even if GCA-assigned ISO 9070 prefixes are not yet
available, ISBN prefixes are.
