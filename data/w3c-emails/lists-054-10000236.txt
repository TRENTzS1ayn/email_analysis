I disagree. Using FPI's and FSI's for naming is simple enough.
The really hard part is name *resolution* (ie. turning a name
into a physical adress that can be accessed).

I agree that we cannot solve the resolution side by November, but
XML naming conventions certainly can be resolved by then. Again,
if we have an extensible naming scheme with a robust grammer, then
I am all for it.
