I buy that.  Which do you prefer?

<e></e> or <@e>

The <@e> solution is attractive to me because it 
is easy to explain, easy to use, and meets the 
rule of thumb Dr. Goldfarb mentions that different 
features need different syntax.

I can live with either, it's just easier to explain <@e>
because most SGML hackers have stumbled over empty elements 
and know there is a problem there.  Like mixed content, just 
say, "oh that solves the mixed content fubar" and they 
will be happy.

Otherwise, we say, "you use empty elements, you need a DTD", 
or, "please get used to this syntax convention that was 
proposed to make your production simpler, and the cost 
of your tools less?"
