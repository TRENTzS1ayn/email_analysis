Let application developers decide how to handle error recovery. Some will opt 
for graceful recovery, whether as a result of "untutored/unsophisticated users" 
or some other "failure" like transmission errors. Others will opt for a coredump 
- like some 30% of Unix utilities. I don't think we should specify the expected 
behavior.

We should take into consideration whether robust applications can be developed 
around XML and part of that is graceful error recovery. My point on </TAG> is 
that it enables an application to recover from what is likely to frequently 
occur in the input stream.
