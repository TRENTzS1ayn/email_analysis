I just counted the number of lines of code in the part of SP that handles
external entities; I included just the URL and OSFILE storage mangers, and
just the UTF-8 and Unicode encodings.  It was more than 5000 lines.  I don't
see how we can possibly meet our goals for ease of implementation if this
part of XML has this level of complexity.

Don't get me wrong: I love FPIs and FSIs.  But I strongly believe this whole
XML exercise is going to be a total waste of time unless we exercise extreme
self-restraint in the features we put in XML, especially in version 1.0.
