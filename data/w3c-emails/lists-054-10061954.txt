I agree that this is a usefull immediate solution.

One extension to URLs that I believe that XML would need is a means to
refer to other parts of a MIME multipart message.  To my knowledge,
there exists no current URL formalism for this.  Such a thing would be
usefull beyond XML, so this might be become proposal for extending
URLs (in general) to support MIME multipart messages.  

Or XML could define its own syntax of referencing parts (by their id)...
