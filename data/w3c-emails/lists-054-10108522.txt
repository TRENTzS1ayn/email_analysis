Not so:  an element declared using an Elephant's Child type declaration
can certainly take this form in SGML.  The rule would simply be that
elements declared empty in an XML DTD would be declared, in the
equivalent SGML DTD, using declarations of the form

  <!ELEMENT e - - (e?)  -(e) >

One may or may not like this solution, but let's discuss it using
reasons that actually apply, not erroneous claims about what can and
cannot be handled by SGML processors.
