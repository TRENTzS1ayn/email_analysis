I didn't say that URLs don't offer indirection, only that there are
better opportunities with FSIs. With an FSI, I can add my own storage
object handler to pull the doc out of a DMS, for example. With a URL, I
would have to go through a gateway to accomplish the same purpose. If
you've ever had a key gateway crash because the process table overflowed,
you understand my reluctance to be cornered into this.
