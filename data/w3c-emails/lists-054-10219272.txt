There is a cost to the user: instead of entering a kind of thing they are
familiar with, namely a URL, they have to enter something that they are not
familiar with, namely an FSI.

If we stick to URLs now, we can still support FSIs in the future: any FSI
must include < and > but these two characters are not allowed in URLs.  It's
ridiculous to force users to type <url> at the beginning of all their URLs
when it's completely unnecessary to do so.

URL syntax is extensible: why can't it be used to do location-independent
naming? Something like fpi://W3C/DTD/HTML_3.2 is a perfectly good URL.  I
can't resolve it, but then I can't resolve FPIs either.

Location-independent naming is not a problem specific to XML.  We should use
whatever general solution gets adopted for the WWW, rather than trying to
come up with a solution specifically for XML.
