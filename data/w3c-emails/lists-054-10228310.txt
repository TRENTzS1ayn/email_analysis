Sure, but then the URL is just a dummy. Why force me to invent a scheme
like that? It's too messy. I like to have things that do what you expect
them to do. If it looks like a URL, it is a URL, and it should resolve
a URL. Trying to make it into something else is too much like server-side
includes, yeccchhh. I just can't see myself explaining to people: "Well,
true. It looks like a URL, but it is really this other thing...."
