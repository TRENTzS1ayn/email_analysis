Here is a possible solution to the impasse between FSI and URL-only.

The FSI design effectively treats an informal system identifier (i.e., an
ordinary string) as a default storage object specification. The usual default is
OSFILE. For XML, we could let the default be URL. In other words, for a URL you
could enter either:

http://www.exasperated.org

or

<url>http://www.exasperated.org

For other storage managers that XML supports in future versions, the normal FSI
syntax would be used.
