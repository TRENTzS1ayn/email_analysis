On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to requiring all
text entities -- certainly external ones -- to be synchronous (if
text entities exist at all in XML, which has not yet been decided).

C.1 should XML require all entities to be synchronous with the
document's logical structure?
