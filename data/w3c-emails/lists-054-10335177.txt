On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to leaving this
question to the implementors.

C.2 should XML prescribe the use of an ENTITY-END character as the
canonical method of handling entity boundaries, as a way of
simplifying exposition and implementation (6.2.2)?
