On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the question needs further
discussion in the work group.

C.5 if XML uses ISO 10646, should there be a special form of
character reference using hexadecimal, not decimal, numbers, since
most references to ISO 10646 and Unicode use hex, not decimal (9.5)?
