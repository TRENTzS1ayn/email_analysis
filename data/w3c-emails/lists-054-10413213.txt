On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to keeping
NAME(S) and NMTOKEN(S) but losing NUMBER(S) and NUTOKEN(S).

C.12 Should XML change the set of types available for attributes?
E.g.  by suppressing NAME(S), NUMBER(S), NMTOKEN(S), NUTOKEN(S) and
adding constraints in the form of regular expressions, ISO dates,
language-code, external-id, type IDREF, ... (7.9.4, 11.3.3)
