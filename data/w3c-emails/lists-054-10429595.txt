To: W3C SGML Working Group<w3c-sgml-wg@w3.org>

On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the question needs further
discussion in the work group.  Possible positions are to remove
8879's restriction (at the cost of more complex XML-to-SGML
DTD translation), to retain it, to eliminate enumerated values
entirely in the hope that WG8 will relax the restriction, or
to retain the restriction but make it a non-reportable error.

C.14 Should XML allow more than one enumerated type (name-group
declared value) to contain the same possible value (11.3.3)?
