On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to no, on the
grounds that this can be done with architectural forms.

C.15 Should XML define new specific methods of inferring values for
attributes with no attribute-value specifications (11.3.4)?  E.g.
INHERITED, to signify that the value is taken from the attribute of
the same name (and type) on the smallest enclosing element with such
an attribute.
