On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to not
prescribing any particular behavior.

C.16 When given an incomplete DTD, should XML parsers assume all
attributes are implicity declared CDATA, or should some attribute
names cause other assumptions (e.g. attributes with the same name as
some type of declared value might be assumed to have that declared
value)?
