Sorry for the confusion.  Both of the flush-left paragraphs are reports
of decisions:  <!-- ... --> is in and <!> is out.

The motive for omitting <!> was that its most frequent function, namely
the escaping of delimiters (e.g. to type an SGML example showing the use
of the <<!>p> tag and the <<!>/p> tag) is no longer applicable since <
and & are always recognized as delimiters in XML unless escaped by &lt;
and &amp;.  Its other uses (escaping record ends and decoration in a
simple ASCII-art style are those that come to my mind) were not felt
critical enough to justify retaining it and its attendant complications
to the grammar of XML.
