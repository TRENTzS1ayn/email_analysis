    After reflection, I think we should keep external entities. FPIs and
FSIs should be syntactically reserved, with pointers to the relevant SGML
material as an explanation, but they themselves should not be part of XML
1.0. This _commits_ us to an XML 2.0. If such a commitment is not
plausible, we should bite the bullet and put it all in now.
