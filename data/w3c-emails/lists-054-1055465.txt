I have put the WG mail for the month of November out on
sunsite.unc.edu in files named 9611a and 9611b:

   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9611a.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9611b.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9611a.gz
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9611b.gz

You can also use HTTP to retrieve these.

As usual, I cannot guarantee that I received everything sent to the
list, but these files contain everything that I did receive.  The W3C
archive for this group is publicly visible, so you are free to share
these with anyone who might be interested in our transactions.

New participants are advised to take a quick pass through 9611b to
catch up with the present discussion.
