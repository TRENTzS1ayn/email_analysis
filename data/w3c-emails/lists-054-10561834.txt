Well, this is a peculiar reversal for me, but since we are going to keep
the weird semantics of SGML content models, & does not seem too burdensome.
And it is useful in some contexts. I don't feel strongly about it, but
we've already given up the hope that anyone can apply well known theory, or
common knowledge in implementing the feature, and & is easy when you just
parse against the parse tree (which is what people will do).

   Maybe that's an instance of another straw for the implementor's back,
but since we're throwing in a brick, I don't see that baking the brick with
straw in it is going to make that much difference.
