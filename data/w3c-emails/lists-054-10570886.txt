   A last _plea_ for their inclusion. Using strings to identify system
dependent content (we could even require that SDATA always be a glyph,
though I think that is excessive) is far better than using numerical codes.
Let's not make any prescription about the use of square brackets in general
entities, for pity's sake. SDATA will make a lot of things easier, and it's
_easy_ to implement and explain. We need no convention for display of SDATA
-- We could declare SDATA strings with "[]" to always be glyph
identifications: only those in ISO standards are guaranteed to be available
to all XML processing systems.

Later, we could even define a protocol (or application convention) to ask a
server to resolve one of its SDATA strings to whatever is appropriate.
