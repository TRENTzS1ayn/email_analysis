I don't see suggestions for kludgey implementations of a feature as easing
either exposition or implementation. If we simply disallow lexing of entity
references between unescaped < and > characters, we can solve all the Ee
problems. An implementation then must be able to resolve entities when an
attribute value is examined. Clean, and I think it's even easy to do with
LEX.

I'd rather not mention the Ee strategy, and certainly would not require it.
