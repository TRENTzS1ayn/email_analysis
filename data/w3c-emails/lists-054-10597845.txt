All the ISO Latin-1 entities should be declared, as should any of the
entities curently in HTML (even ones we think are stupid, if there are any
such).

People think this is a part of SGML anyway, and the names are well known.
Compatibility with the general public's expectations dictates this answer.
People _like_ namespace pollution when it meets their expectations
(otherwise why would people like PERL?). This is a case where the anti-CS
viewpoint should win out.

What does reportable error mean for netscape? I think that, at the least,
we should suggest non-bindingly that display applications treat undefined
entities as "broken text" -- similarly to the current broken image strategy
(which could also be viewed as a reportable error).
