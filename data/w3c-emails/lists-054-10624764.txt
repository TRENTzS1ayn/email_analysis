We should either expand the space as originally suggested; I like regexp
myself, and it's a drop-in in any language I can imagine people using for
an XML parser (C, C++, Java).

   Otherwise, we should just go for CDATA, IDREF, and enumerated attributes
and bag the rest (ID should always be legal, and always be an attribute
called "id", I think). We're not allowing the unquotedness that NAME gets
you, so we might as well make it as easy as possible for each application
to reinvent the wheel of attribute subtyping without any interference from
us. I find the built-in attribute types almost useless, myself.
