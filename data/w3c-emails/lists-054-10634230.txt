We _MUST_ remove this restriction. It's annoying even to SGML users of the
minimization hack it enables. We can never sell it as a reasonable
syntactic restriction. A reportable error should reflect something the user
did that might cause a problem. This attribute value restriction, like the
-- in comment restriction, no longer has any function in XML but to annoy
the user. We don't want to annoy our users, especially when trying to get
them to do something new.

I can't imagine what a non-reportable error even is. If it's an error, it
should be reported, if it shouldn't be reported, then that is prima facie
evidence that it should _not_ be an error.

Enumerated values are too well entrenched in HTML (as well as damned damned
useful) to be eliminated.
