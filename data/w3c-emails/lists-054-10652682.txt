Yes.

All we get from this is a bunch of "clever coding tricks" == "weird,
hard-to-understand hacks". It's much easier, and moer natural, to go with
the first commandment of every other language in the world except SGML:

   1.0 "you must define what you reference"

  Languages differ on when and how and what you declare, but few have this
feature. If we allow reference to undefined elements, they should be legal.

   In addition, if we retain this distinction, we can't tell the difference
between an "elephant's child" hack and an "incomplete DTD".
