The function character solution proposed by Gavin, I think, is perfect.
Either that or a special set of predeclared entities: but case-sensitivity
gets you in trouble there.

We need an easy way to do this, and unless we're going to give away hex
calculators to every user, they should be able to use hex. I suppose
another possiblity would be to use a 2-level lexer like Java does, but
that's not easy to understand.
