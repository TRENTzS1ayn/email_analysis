11.3.1 no.
   I still think that this simple mechanical DTD transform would be
staggeringly useful.

11.3.2 yes.

    I can't even tell what 2 delcarations for one attribute would mean. I
wish that I could declare one model for an attribute on one element and a
different model for the same attribute on another element, but the language
surgery would be too intense even for me to advocate it in XML.
