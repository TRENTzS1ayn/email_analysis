This is a pretty decent solution. I'd like the option to use FSI's and
FPI's since I think I can implement the few kinds I would want in _much_
less than 5000 lines of code. We can handle this like the alternate
character sets: implementations are allowed to support it, but need not.
Network publication should _not_ use FSIs or FPIs until XML 2.0 defines
exactly how they should work.
