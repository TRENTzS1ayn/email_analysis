Yes. 

1. The restriction has to do with minimization rules and the SHORTTAG
feature being an omnium gatherum.

2. Not allowing this fails the Stoopid Test when attribute specifications will 
be in the canonical NAME="VALUE" form anyway.

Order of preference (most to least desirable):

  - remove 8879's restriction
  - eliminate enumerations
  - nonreportable error
  - retain
