WG8 has agreed to remove this restriction in  SGML97. 

However, I think the right solution for XML is to eliminate enumeration on the
grounds of simplifying attribute definitions. I'd dump all of the tokenized
values for the same reason, except those that have SGML semantics that we are
retaining in XML (possibly ID, IDREF, IDREFS, ENTITY, ENTITIES, and NOTATION).

The SGML Extended Facilities, which WG8 have voted to incorporate in SGML97,
have a lexical typing facility for data content and attribute values using
regular expressions and other goodies. Why burden XML with the existing half
measures? Keep things simple for XML 1.0 by sticking to CDATA and add clean
lexical typing later.
