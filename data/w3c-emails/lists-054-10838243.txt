Questions like this are more easily analyzed if we avoid the confusing term
"optional DTD". A missing DTD is really an implied DTD (like SGML's implied SGML
Declaration) in which all element types have mixed content consisting of
"(#pcdata | any element type)*" and all attributes are CDATA #REQUIRED (except
for special conventions for ID, etc. that we might adopt).

So there is always a DTD. Now the question is: what does a parser do with
references to undeclared entities? There is no reason to do anything different
from what is done in SGML.

As for declaring entities automatically, I assume that means there will be a
piece of public text containing the "automatic" declarations that is considered
to be referenced by all DTDs (including the implied one). Or, to put it another
way, all DTDs are partial; the "automatic" entity declarations are the other
part.
