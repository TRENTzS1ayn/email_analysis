I agree with David and Arjun. We only need CDATA and ID (which should always be
named ID). With a DTD, IDREF(S), ENTITY(S), and NOTATION can be useful as well.

SGML97 will have "regexp" and then some. The SGML Extended Facilities already
has it. WG8 has not yet designed a revised ATTLIST syntax to incorporate it
properly, though, so it is premature to include it in XML 1.0. (We'll have a
mailing list for SGML97 so all of you will be able to participate in the
design.)
