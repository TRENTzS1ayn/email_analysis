It's the webserver's business. If people don't like the standard HTTP
header directories, or server extension configurations, they can use the
"self-detecting character hacks" (the PI).

   Parsers, on the other hand are what we are specifying. And parsers only
need to say what they do given some input. We can define a "metadata
channel" -- additional input to the parser, determined as reasonable; we
will provide two bindings: Command line option, for command-line parsers,
and HTTP header policies for HTTP stream parsers. Other channels will have
to define how they will transmit or use meta-data, as appropriate. If they
don't have meta-data, they can use the hack.

XML is not defining server behavior, but client behavior. The server will
have two options: metadata, or PI. We should declare that metadata is
preferred over PI, if the channel provides metadata.

This falls out of my proposal, if that's the way the server wants to work:
no metatdata in, but metadata required to go out because HTTP has the
metadata channel.
