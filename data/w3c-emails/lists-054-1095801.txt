That is a very clear statement of the potential benefit of public
identifiers. our documents can predict the eventual URN facilities of the
Web and take advantage of them as soon as they become available. In the
meantime we can use proprietary mechanisms, like SGML Open catalogs, PURLs,
handles, or whatever.

Could you clarify here? Do you and Debbie wans a simple established
mechanism for name resolution, or just the option to put in the public
identifier (which is what I have been pushing for).

Well, URLs must be handled according to URL semantics so we *could* specify
a resolution semantic for public identifers. But I think that would put an
extra burden on implementors, risk XML's acceptance, and inappropriately
disqualify the URN effort before it got off of the ground.
