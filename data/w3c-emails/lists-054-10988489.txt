Any of the above, and others possibilities too (fields in a database
etc.) The very fact that you have so many options should make it
obvious that this is meta-data, not data, and does not belong *in* the
document.

I have no problem with *allowing* PI's (I personally would never use
them, or write software that did), but I cannot condone *requiring*
them or *promoting* them.

In that case, why not just use catalogs and FSI's for storage? I
cannot see *why* we need markup to describe meta-data that also
applies to the markup describing the meta-data. This seems to be to be
logically inconsistant.
