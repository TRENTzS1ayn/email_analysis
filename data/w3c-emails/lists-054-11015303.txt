I don't recall seeing this resolution passed by the ERB,
did I miss something :-)?   What "brick" are you talking about?

Since we've dropped OMITTAG, and will probably drop inclusion
and exclusion exceptions, '&' groups are the only feature remaining
that are beyond the scope of what anyone with a copy of the Dragon Book
can handle in a day's work.

(The ambiguity restriction does not matter here: unambiguous content models
are a strict subset of regular expressions; any algorithm for matching
against general REs will also work for unambigous ones.  In fact,
the ambiguity rule can make things *easier* for implementors.)

I don't see that '&' is _easy_, but as long as we keep the
ambiguity restriction it's at least tractable.
