Indeed. The SGML compatibility rule [*] is the real problem, in that the (core)
concrete syntax (actually, even the abstract syntax) is *lexically*
inadequate. The issue has always been one of tokenization. The denotation
of an empty element is indistinguishable from the start tag of an element
with content: in SGML systems the DTD has always been present to resolve 
the ambiguity on what from a lexical point of view are essentially "semantic"
grounds. Without a DTD, the alternatives are restricted to either disallowing
empty elements altogether or disambiguating them *lexically*.

If a NET variant can be made to work (I still don't see how, though), that's
fine. Otherwise, IMHO, since the need for empty elements is clear cut, it's
time to bite the bullet and seriously consider a syntax that requires
preprocessing before it can be accepted by, ah, legacy SGML processors.
(For instance, the STAGC proposal discussed a few months back on CTS.)

[*] This rule tends to be invoked much more often in the interests of
*forwards* compatibility of legacy systems [will old tools grok new stuff?]
than the backwards compatibility of new specs [will new tools grok old stuff?]
