I'm not sure that any significant complexity is added, especially since the
only content model allowed is a repeatable or group (right?).

A second declaration merrely adds to the or-group.

If my understanding on this is right, by the way, then the
non-determinisitic content models have already become a non-issue.
You can't have ambiguity in a model of the form
    (#PCDATA|a|b|c....)
