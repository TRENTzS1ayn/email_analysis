How can all attributes be CDATA #REQUIRED, when I suspect that many 
tags will omit attributes for some occurrences, and include them for others.

In most SGML applications I believe #IMPLIED is the most common default.

An implied DTD can provide minimum semantic interpretation of any attribute,
unless the attribute name suggests its semantics, such as ID would, or
possibly the form of the attribute value, such as a valid URL might.
So, the other attributes whether present or omitted can have effect on some
associated style sheet, where an implied action would be overridden by
an explicit attribute value.

An undeclared entity could be passed on to the application, and possibly
retained as such when part of #PCDATA.

That "automatic" set of entity declarations is open-ended, effectively any
apparent entity should be in it.
