No.  It means that to the extent that we have () and | and ,
and * and PCDATA and so on in XML content models, they mean the
same thing as they mean when they appear in SGML content models.
Between the things that we've turfed and the things that we're
going to turf, there is going to be A LOT LESS allowed in XML
content models.  With the explicit aim, as reflected in our design
goals, of making parsers easy and in particular susceptible to
standard formal methods.

And specifically, let's lose the &.  Not that it isn't useful... but
the ROI is negative.
