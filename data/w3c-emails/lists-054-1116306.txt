[Per-?ke Ling:]

| I have with interset followed the debate "CSS vs. DSSSL-O" and
| realized that although I have a fair knowledge of DSSSL-o, the same is
| not true of CSS. I will hunt around on the W3C site and see what I can
| find.
| 
| However, it struck me that there may be others in a similar (or
| opposite) position, so I believe that it would be helpful if somebody
| could summarize the pros and cons of the respective specifications in
| an objective? or at least factual manner.
| 
| I think the comparison would be helpful in focusing the attention on
| the issues that are of primary concern, eg design philosphy instead of
| syntax.

I agree that this would be a very interesting and useful discussion,
but this is not the right place for it.  In this phase of our
activity, we are scheduled to talk about hypertext mechanisms, with a
specification due in April.  This group picks up stylesheets as an
activity as part of Phase III, which takes place between April and
November of 1997.

The list for discussions of which stylesheet language to use for the
Web is www-style@w3.org.  You should be able to subscribe to that list
via the W3C home page at http://www.w3.org.  A number of people on the
w3c-sgml-wg list are also on the www-style list and would be happy to
join such a discussion, which I think is long overdue.  You would also
find many more people on that list who could answer your questions
about CSS.
