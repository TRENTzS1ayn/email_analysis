I don't think we should emulate the policy of having errors that may break
some parsers and documents, but are not reportable.

I agree. But it's not something you can look up in a book.

This seems to me to support removing the unambiguity distinction.

More reason to drop unambiguity, as that feature died an unlamented death
practically at the inception of the project.

You have convinced me though, that both features should be dropped, & and
unambiguity. We should take advantage of the slack allowed in the standard,
and hope that SGML parser writers who care about XML will adapt.
