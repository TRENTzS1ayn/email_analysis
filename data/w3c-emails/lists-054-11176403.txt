MIME headers would meet this requirements, if they are allowed in the file.
See my earlier posting for an elaboration of this proposal.

We can make the metadata in the document supersede the data in the HTTP
header, if that will improve reliability. Then people will stop using the
internal headers for HTTP delivery, once they are no longer needed to make
things work because of improved HTTP implementation and practice.

I no longer trust in self-evidence. Let's make a (simple) rule. Good sense
and character set issues never seem to go together. I'm sure people will
implement naming conventions for XML file suffixes and the like, and we
need not worry about that, but we're talking about data that is _essential_
for the document to be processed. That cannot be left to the implementers
ingenuity. (They'll be far to ingenious for their own good!)


Neither of these arguments will fly in the Web technical community, unless
they can see that we are not tromping on the (sensible) infrastructure that
is already defined. A brand new character set syntax and
self-identification technique tromps, in my opinion.
