I'mna afraid most of my reactions to the following are rather flamish.
Apologies, but no regrets for that fact.

How do I declare a character like "TENGWAR VOWEL LETTER A" or "ME GLYPH
GARDINER 201" (Middle Egyptain). It's just &#23434 or something.

My gut reaction to that is #$*#&$#?!

These declarations must be included automatically, if we hope to have
anyone _use_ XML. (Which does not seem to be a major concern, as far as I
can tell).

We should specify and reserve the syntax for Public Identifiers now. It's
not like we don't know what they will be.

We should certainly _accept_ the <url> prefix, so that those of us who are
interested in doing things right will be able to. Come on, test URN
deployments are already taking place -- must we repeat the mistakes of the
past HTML's location-only syntax has already set the world back 10 years by
spreading a bad model into millions of minds, just as SGML has failed to
move the world forward 20 years, by cloaking good ideas in crappy syntax.

   I'd like that the end of this process will be something that can be
endorsed instead of inveighed against. I'm starting to worry.
