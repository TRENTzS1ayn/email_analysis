Not exactly. The standard just doesn't require ambiguity checking as a
requirement of every validating parser. We expected that products would
differentiate themselves in this (and other) respects, as indeed they have.

But it is true that, with or without parser assistance, a document type can't
have any ambiguous content models. (Even without start-tag omission, unambiguous
content models are typically easier for a user to understand, and therefore to
determine which element types are allowed at a given juncture.)
