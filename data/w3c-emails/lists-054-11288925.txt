I thought that was what was being proposed for XML. I'm not proposing it, just
trying to put it in context. Sorry for the confusion.

I guess you are right on that point, which to me shows the fallacy of implying a
DTD.

Unfortunately, not in 8879 as it exists today. WG8 has proposed something
similar for character references in SGML97.

It doesn't. I was trying to characterize what I thought was a proposal for XML
(non-existent DTDs) in terms of SGML.

I was referring to a proposal for XML which would have the effect of making all
DTDs partial.

As I said above, I was referring to a proposal made on this list. It is not my
proposal. In fact, I don't like it at all, Lee. Your note has revealed even more
problems with it.
