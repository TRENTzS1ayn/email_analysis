Let me reiterate: XML 1.0 is not addressing this problem.  A future version
of XML will address this problem.
We haven't decided whether or not internal SDATA entities will be part of
the solution.

Typically, use of internal text entities wouldn't be apparent in the grove
that style sheet works off.

If I had to do this, I would use somthing like

<!ENTITY tail-s
 '<rendition glyph-id="your favourite style of glyph-id">s</rendition>'

if it's appropriate to regard the tail-s as an alternative presentation form
of the letter s.  If it's better  to think of it as just a glyph, I might
use something like

<!ENTITY tail-s
 '<glyph id="your glyph id"></glyph-id>'

In either case I would also have a DSSSL style-sheet to specify the
appropriate presentation of the element.
