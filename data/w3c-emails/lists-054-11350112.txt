I have one small problem here with the decision to drop FPIs. If we expect
people to include their own sets a simple way of identifying well known sets
of useful characters, such as the sets identified in 10646, would be useful.
If we have to use system identifiers to do this then everyone is going to
assign his own name to these sets. If we were able to use FPIs we could at
least point people to a file containing FPIs for each of the sets in 10646
so that they could have a common starting point for including these
standardized sets of useful characters. How do you envisage people
identifying which character sets they have used as the basis for their
numeric SDATA specifications?
