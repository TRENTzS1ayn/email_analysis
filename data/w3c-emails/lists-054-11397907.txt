That is _exactly_ what we have to fix in XML.
XML must be amenable to bison and yacc, or similar tools.
(in practice you'd have to use flex or otherwise avoid lex, I suspect,
because of character set issues -- most implementations of lex are
not fully 8-bit clean, in that they swallow NUL)

The perl hacker's voice is loud.

If & prevents that, drop &.
If OMITTAG prevents that, drop OMITTAG (done already).
