Arjun,

Is it accurate to conclude from your argument that:

1) It would be best to have *only* empty end-tags as that would guarantee proper
nesting in all cases (although not necessarily the nesting intended by the
author).

2) If we allow (or require) named end-tags, we must also allow end-tags to be
omitted when the named end-tag of a containing element occurs (at least as the
required form of error recovery).
