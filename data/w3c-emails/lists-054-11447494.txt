Pardon my ignorance about the details of URLs.  What I'm wondering is,
as defined above, does XML allow the use of simple local file names as
external identifiers?  Can I have declarations such as:

<!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chapter1.sgm">
<!ENTITY logo SYSTEM "c:\graphics\logo2.tif" NDATA tif>

given the ERB's decision on external identifiers?  If not, and without
public identifiers either, how would I make references to files on my
local file system as typified by the above?  (I realize if we decide
not to have external text entities in XML, then the first example above
would have to be an NDATA, but that's irrelevant to my question.)
