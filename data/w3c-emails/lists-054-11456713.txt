I realize that Paul was asking about URL syntax, but his last remark deserves
remarking on. Adding "NDATA SGML" to the declaration makes it a data entity,
even though it is in SGML notation. Data entities are not parsed in context, so
if we don't allow external SGML text entities, "chapter.sgm" could not be a
chapter in the element structure of the document containing this entity
declaration. It would have to be an independently parsable document.

(And "NDATA SGML" is an oxymoron; can't we have CDATA as well?)
