I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, John, but I would like to point out
that "[name]" doesn't have to be a hack. We could have an XML notation, declared
formally for all element types with data content, in which "[name]" was *always*
a character name. As long as the ESIS content is unchanged for all systems,
there is no need for text to be declared to the parser as SDATA.
