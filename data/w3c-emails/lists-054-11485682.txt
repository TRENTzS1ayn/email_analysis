Yes, but adding yet another special delimiter with a unique new syntax
seems to be making things worse, and not better. Doing that introduces a
new limitation (as square brackets now need to be escaped, and a whole new
kind of error [undefined character code encountered].

  We're better off with a new (pre-reserved) tagname, or even better,
sticking with the tried and true SDATA solution. It's new to the HTML folx,
but familiar to SGMLers and their parsers.
