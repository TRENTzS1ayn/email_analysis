   Your Platonic idealism is quaint, but the nominalists among us will
disagree. At any rate, these (putative) philosophical entities _need_ not
be addressed in the XML standard.

There is an infinite set of such classes.

To make a statement like this, you need to define a well-founded ordering
on DTDs, with the property that any set of DTDs has one and only one least
upper bound. You need to prove that these properties hold.

Once you have, then you can talk about _the_ minimal DTD. This is not a
case where handwaving will do.  A book on denotational semantics of
programming languages might clarify these issues.

First you have to prove that such an object exists.

Pardon the philosophical note, but how else should one respond to
syntaxt-definition discussions where the mind of God plays a significant
role!
