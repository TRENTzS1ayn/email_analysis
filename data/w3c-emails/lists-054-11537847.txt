We old lisp hackers knew these as "super-parens". They never caught on, though.

I don't feel strongly about this, though you have some good points. The
major problem with empty end-tags is that they change people's habits from
HTML, which is not a big win. It also makes implementing Emacs modes
slightly less simple, I think.

I must say that after experience with SGML minimization, even this small
convenience makes me nervous. Given the nerves and the difference from
existing practice, I have to throw in a _no_ vote on empty end tags.

   Anyway tag salad can be very satisfying if the chef is good!
