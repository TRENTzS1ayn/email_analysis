From what I've seen, people's habits are strongly influenced by the software
they work with. Even more so in environments where binaries without source
code are the rule (the PC/Mac world.) Assuming the software is good enough,
there's every reason to have some distinction from HTML. (Grandfathering
HTML du jour should be the least of our concerns.)

Would some other error recovery method (as a candidate for a rule) be simpler?
