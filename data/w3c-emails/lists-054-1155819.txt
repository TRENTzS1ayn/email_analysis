Very true, and they were a pain.  But I used them extensively.  If they 
got resolved, I tried not to worry (other than once, per setup, per 
sofdtware package, per system) how.  My point is even that was better 
than nothing!

1)  Yes, FPIs are a Good Thing, for me and for many of my clients.
    Yes, I used them even before SGML Open.
2)  Yes, I would like a full spec for handling them as part of XML, but 
the consensus seems to be against that.
3)  Yes, the Web requires URLs just now.
4)  So, yes I will accept the "Magic Cookie" approach.  It isn't good.  
But it gives me a hook.  Yes, this is a compromise, and not one I like.  
But is this better than nothing?  Yes, it is.
