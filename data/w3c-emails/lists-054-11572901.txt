David Durand has already pointed out some problems inherent in this
notion of "maximally precise".  Until you provide a determinate
mechanism for generating one and only one maximally precise DTD for an
arbitrary instance, prove that the maximally precise DTD is unique for
that instance, and prove that the procedure will always produce the
maximally precise DTD from any instance, then I don't think that
"maximally precise" really means anything.

Beyond the formal problems, however, I cannot see any reason to
introduce this concept into XML.  The whole idea of XML is that any CS
graduate can construct a parser for it from the BNF grammar set forth
in the specification without knowing anything at all about SGML.  This
notion of a maximally precise DTD does not appear to me to aid such a
person in performing this task.
