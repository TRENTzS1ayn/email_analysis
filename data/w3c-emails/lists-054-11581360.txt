| A datapoint from, er, existing practice. 
| 
| (http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_3.0/layout/colu
| mns_spacing/index.html)
| 
| = Font styles - The MULTICOL tag recognizes current font status. 
| = So if you begin a bold section before the multicolumn, the text 
| = in the columns will be bold, and if you close the bold in the 
| = middle of the multicolumn, this nonbold status will continue 
| = after the multicolumn ends.

This Netscape abomination is not accepted by the W3C and has been
explicitly condemned by Microsoft's Internet Explorer designers, who
(it is now clear) will end up owning the browser.  (See Netscape's
latest news releases regarding their current browser strategy if you
doubt that statement.)  So going forward, this is not even standard
HTML practice.
