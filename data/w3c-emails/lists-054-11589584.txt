CSS is not on the XML agenda.  There is no requirement that every XML
application support stylesheets, but ones that do support stylesheets
are expected to be using DSSSL for this purpose. See

   http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/SGML/Activity

where "public text and extensions needed to apply the DSSSL stylesheet
language" is listed as the third phase of this activity, scheduled for
completion in November 1997.
