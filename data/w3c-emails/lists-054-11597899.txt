The ongoing discussion of the questions from batch A and batch B
already decided by the ERB is interesting and useful, but please don't
forget that the ERB is going to be deciding Wednesday on the questions
in batch C.  If you wish to give input on those questions and haven't
already, please do so as soon as possible.

Jon
