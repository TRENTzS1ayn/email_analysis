Very true.  CSS is so inadequate to the applications for which XML is
designed, however, that it has explicitly been omitted from the
activities for this group from the very beginning.  I can imagine this
group, in the interest of formal completeness, defining a method for
associating stylesheets in any arbitrary notation with an XML
document, but I can't at this time imagine that we will be spending
any significant time on CSS in particular.
