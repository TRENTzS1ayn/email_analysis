If I am reading the postings from David Durand, Lee Quin, and John
Lavagnino correctly, it seems that my earlier note embodied a large
misconception.  I had asked for references to 8879 to explain the
behavior they seem to be associating with SDATA entities; they
seem, if I understand correctly, to be unanimous in saying that
8879 does not in fact define the desired behavior at all, but that
it's widely implemented and well understood (and, I assume, should
be incorporated into XML 1.0).

So what seems to be at issue is *not* whether XML 1.0 should retain
the SGML 'SDATA' keyword, but whether it should retain that keyword
and prescribe some particular behavior for processors encountering
it.

Here's a confession that if this behavior is widely implemented, I
haven't seen it in the software I use most frequently.  Perhaps I
just don't read the manuals carefully enough, but the only program
that comes to mind as describing any behavior like this is Panorama,
and its functionality (rendering correctly all the characters in the
ISO entity sets for which the local system has font resources) can
be done with character references to ISO 10646, since all the
characters in the ISO entity sets are in 10646 (some glyphs
representing ligatures are missing).

As to the other proposition, that it is widely understood, I can
only say that if it is widely understood, then surely someone can be
found to describe the behavior on this list explicitly enough that
the rest of us can also understand it.  I for one do not understand
the behavior, and would really like a description, preferably with
reference to some documentation.
