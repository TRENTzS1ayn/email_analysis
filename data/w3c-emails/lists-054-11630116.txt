That is still insufficient justification for the PI hack. You could 
have just as easily recommended the *.mim format. I am vehemently
against *data* sniffing. If the PI is a header, say so, and then
give it a different syntax.

I cannot see this as justification for the PI hack either. Broken
software is just that: broken. I know, probably better than anyone on
this entire list, what the exact dangers are with WWW content
labelling mechanisms. I also know what the potential is for
correctness, and how to overcome a lot of the bogosity/idiocy.
I do not see the PI hack as a necessary part of this solution, though
I agree with the overall *concept* of having a header (which is what
it really is).

I understand the problem you are trying to solve, and understand how
your answer tries to solve it. I do not think that the problem gives
sufficient justification for the answer proposed, though, and think
that cleaner mechanisms, both semantically, and syntactically, and
both preferrable, and likely to be widely used *irrespective* of XML
adoption.  

Let's not repeat the <META> idiocy here.
