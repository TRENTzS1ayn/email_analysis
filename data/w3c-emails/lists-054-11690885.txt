Actually, I would expect nothing to pop out of the void. 

In my opinion, DTDs *must* not required to process XML (version 1.0) documents. 
If we state the opposite, we're left with SGML and this discussion has been for 
naught. Worse, we could state that "the maximally precise DTD" is used. This 
introduces a level of ambiguity that even SGML has managed to avoid. We should 
as well.
