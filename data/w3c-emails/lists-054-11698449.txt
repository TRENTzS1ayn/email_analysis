Yes, this is the key point. The neat little trick James shows is
interesting, but does require that your DTD (if you have one)
have such a beast (I guess you could add it as an inclusion). 

What we really want is a way of saying something about what the
entity reference is (kind of attributes of the entity as it were)
that you could use to switch on for special processing, and then
some way of passing the extra information along.
