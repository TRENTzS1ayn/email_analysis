Gavin omitted to mention that the nice thing about the function character
solution is that SGML already folds the case, so we don't need to prescribe
a case, whereas entity names are (and should remain) case sensitive.

   This would be a non-issue if we do the right thing and make things case
sensitive (and define all keywords, etc. as lower case). But I expect that
people are too used to their preferred case conventions for this to fly.
