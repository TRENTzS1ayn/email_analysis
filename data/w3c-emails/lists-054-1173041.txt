As an author or publisher, I don't care about the mechanics; I do
care, rather a lot, about ensuring (a) that the document consumer can
actually resolve entity references and (b) that when they do, they
get the right thing.  Specifying a method of resolving FPIs seems to
make those guarantees; specifying FPIs without a defined method of
resolution seems to make neither guarantee.  That's a level of
independence between publisher and reader which I am not prepared to
endorse.

Not that I know of.  Version 3.2 of HTML did not exist before the advent
of SGML Open catalogues; the entity sets did, but I don't believe I ever
downloaded SGML documents from the Web at that time; when on occasion I
got SGML documents from other people, working with the DTD subset to
make my SGML systems find the entity sets was just part of the job of
getting the files to parse.

Don't believe your eyes; TEI Lite has a public identifier and has, as
far as I can remember, always had one.  I could be wrong, of course.
Maybe it's only had one since Panorama became available and used the
SGML Open catalogue.
