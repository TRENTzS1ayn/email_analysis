It seems there is disagreement over whether a DTD (real or imagined) is required 
in order to process XML documents. From my perspective, we can not require DTDs 
in XML 1.0 and have any chance of acceptance.

I'm more concerned with applications and how they are used - either by a machine 
or a human.

Let the application (user) dictate whether a DTD is required.

What occurs between consenting users is not my concern. However, requiring DTDs, 
especially from the void, is of concern to me. Let (some) "experienced SGML 
users" snicker. I for one will not because document structure and tag 
extensibility, whether enforced or not, are powerful concepts that will be 
understood if properly presented. 

HTML users may in fact be oblivious to this debate - that is their gain. 
However, they won't ignore the issue that HTML is not sufficient for their 
needs. Solutions to their problems will be found, and they will look far more 
like VisualBasic or JavaScript than any markup language we have devised.

Validation.
