Right, but it's not necessary for the header. I can agree to using
this *after* the header has been stripped off...

Well, given that ISO and US-ASCII share most of the same code points, it
seems that this is unlikely. As I noted, the only problem is for pure
16-bit encodings, which are reasonable scarce.

Most of which use 8 bit multibyte encodings that are ASCII compatible.

I could be convinced that allowing 16bit header encodings makes sense,
as I don't feel *too* strongly about it. However, losing MIME
compatability seems a waste.
