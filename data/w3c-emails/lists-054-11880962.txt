As a note on undelcared entities. I proposed a while back on this
list that XML processors provide a fallback resolution mechanism: 
namely that of trying to find an entity of the same same within
a catalog etc., and if found, treat it as being declared.

My prime motivation is that with this mechanism, it is easy to 
use XML within realtime systems, and without it, close to
impossible.

It also seems to be intuitively correct.
