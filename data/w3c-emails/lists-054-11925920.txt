Dave Durand is to be commended for the effort and thought that went
into his plan.  However, we already covered this ground at length and
in great detail when we considered Tim Bray's DSD proposal.  The
question that was finally placed before the ERB was as follows:

   Shall XML use a markup declaration syntax based on a simplification of
   ISO 8879 clauses 10-11?

This was put to a mail vote, which under our rules takes a week to
complete.  One of the ERB members has been unable to reply for most of
that period due to family matters.  He has finally registered his
vote, and I can now report that the proposition above has been
unanimously approved by the ERB.

However disappointed some of us may feel about this, the decision has
been made and it's time to move on.  Please take any further
discussion of this point off the list so that we can continue to meet
our deadlines.  I will be happy to answer any further questions you
may have about this through private correspondence.

Jon
