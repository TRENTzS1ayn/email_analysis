If the defined method of resolution is "resolve as URNs", which
various systems may do variously but with the same results (unless
some succeed and some fail), does that suffice for you?  There
will be many (possibly competing) methods of resolving URNs;
your system (NOT your XML system, your dealing-with-the-Internet
system) will have local preferences about how to use them; you
solve the problem there for all applications that need to handle
URNs.  As a reader, I want that kind of independence; as a writer,
I want to avoid having to touch my docs after I'm finished with 
them; as a publisher, I'm more or less where I am with ISBNs,
except that the resolution mechanisms are still being constructed.
