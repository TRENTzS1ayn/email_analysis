Thank you David. This is a point I have felt, but been unable to

As is explaining to people that you can do:

   <?XML-ENCODING "SHIFT-JIS">
   .....

but not

  <?XML-ENCODING "SHIFT-JIS">
  ....
  <?XML-ENCODING "UCS2">
  ....

I agree with the notion of keeping "in-file" labels, but simply 
cannot accept "in-data" labelling, or anything that pretend to
be like it.
