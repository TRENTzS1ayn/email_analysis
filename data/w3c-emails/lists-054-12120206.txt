Hmmm, how can I sum up my feelings for this comment in a nice polite
manner.... Ahhh, BULL!

As Anders has pointed out, there is rather poor support in Unicode for
Math. I don't yet have all of the details as I haven't gotten my Unicode
books yet, but from what I have seen so far, it isn't adequate for the
relatively simple yet extensive math that we have in our docs. The one
obvious one that jumped out at me was that there didn't seem to be any
way to differentiate script, open face, and Fraktur letters.

By the way, I concur wholeheartedly with the opinions expressed by
David and Lee. There are plenty of times when I could predict that
the receiving system will not be able to render the character that I
want them to see. Given that, a reasonable description of the character
*could* suffice. Some meaningless number, would be just that--
meaningless.
