First, we have a compriomise on this issue that is far from perfect, but
took us at least a month of intense debate to reach: why are we re-opening
it? Let's leave not-so-well-enough alone! I'm wistful for a better
(different) solution, but given that everyone (including me) seems to find
the compromise livable, shouldn't we leave it in place?

   I dunno, none of the proposals we've considered leads to a "clean
design" other than making all whitespace significant (a policy that has
been vetoed for compatibility reasons).

We already determined that resolving entity references is not required: the
XML data structure cannot completely hide entity references from
applications in that way that SGML parsers do. Default attributes at least
have fixed values, so they must offer relatively little to an application
that doesn't care about DTDs.

We did determine, I think, that some differences would exist between the
SGML and XML "data streams" in the case of RE near markup. This was deemed
acceptable compared to the horrendously complex SGML status quo.

This is far to complex: two kinds of parsing are enough.

   I don't know from groves, but if we repeat the mistakes of the ESIS on
ID/IDREF (making them into crypto-types that the application can't see), we
are truly foolish. for the same reason we need to make sure that empty
elements are treated as a distinct type from elements with no content:
another ESIS mistake that I thought we had forsworn. Or are we going to
give up trivial XML->XML filtering?
