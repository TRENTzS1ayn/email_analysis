Since I don't know what tools you use, Michael, I can't contradict you,
but I can say that the replacement text is used with all the tools that
I use daily, including the ones that I wrote. For a transform to Interleaf,
the replacement text is the necessary Interleaf markup for that
character; for a transform to HTML, it is an IMG tag with the URL to a
library of GIF images that I created from TeX.

The behavior is really up to the application: it is system data, thus
essentially the same as a system identifier. It is up to the system to
determine what to do with it.
