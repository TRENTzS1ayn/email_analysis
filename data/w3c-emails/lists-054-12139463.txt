95% of the documents that I deal with now have extensive math in them. If
I had the right tables I could tell you more specifically how many of them
contain characters not in Unicode.

I have to admit that I could continue to do the same thing with them as I
do now: run them through TeX (I still find it hard to believe how
dependent I am on that wonderful life saver) and render them as GIF, but
if I'm stuck with that then there's one more thing that I don't get from
XML that it seems HTML will provide for....hmmmmm.
