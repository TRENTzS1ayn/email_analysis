I agree wholeheartedly with Eve and Lee--multiple IDs are useful.

I can't remember what I needed them for the last time, I guess it's past
my bedtime. I rememember that I was trying to duplicate the linkages that
a DMS used between its records because it was very easy to generate the
SGML from the report generator. In the end, I didn't use any IDs anyway
since I couldn't assure that they would be valid NAMEs anyway. Didn't
matter, the browser allowed me to make the links anyway.

But, I bet you like symbolic links, don't you? Same principles. With current
SGML implementations, an ID is best if the name is meaningful, but names
are only appropriate to a given context. If you can have two meaningful
names, you can address the needs of two discrete contexts.
