I have to say I think in the context of the decisions about valid
vs. [whatever -- my archive is temporarily inaccessible -- you know,
processable] XML, there is no reason not to say that empty elements
are notated exactly as they are in SGML, i.e. <e>, and that w/o (partial) DTD
information, empty elements will cause errors, i.e. empty elements are
allowed iff the necessary declaration fragment is present.
