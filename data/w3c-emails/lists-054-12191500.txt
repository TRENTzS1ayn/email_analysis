I'm not sure what you mean by 'corrective action', but using our
toolkit engine Synex ViewPort you can integrate a notation processor,
and process the data--assuming its type and extent are known and, as I
recall, the notation being an external entity, but don't quote me
on that ;-).

Inline integration of the notation (using ViewPort widgets,
a general plug-in architecture) is possible. You cannot however
toggle the parser processing from the SGML declaration.


Cheers,
