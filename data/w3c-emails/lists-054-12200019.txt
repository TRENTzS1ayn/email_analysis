I must be in possession of a different set of data.

In my book, "osfiles" have no header information, and the "storage
object identifier" on the right hand side of an SGML Open TR9401 catalog
is the name of a file, all bytes of which gets sent to the SGML
parser.  So, I would expect most existing SGML systems would need to
be modified to process files that are "headed" by data that are not
supposed to be sent to the SGML parser.
