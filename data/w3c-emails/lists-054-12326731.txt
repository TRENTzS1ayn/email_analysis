HTML doesn't do anything at all here, because it doesn't have 
subdecl's and the character repertoire is the same - ISO 10646.

I guess what you mean is that this is another problem that XML
will not solve any better than current HTML - based solutions.

BTW. SDATA, or something like it, is crucial to the idea for
font services that I have -- we do need a way of specifying
"type" for entities.
