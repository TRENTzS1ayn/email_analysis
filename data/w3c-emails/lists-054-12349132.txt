Sorry, I was too elliptical It would make sense to have a new type,
for the sake of argument HOSFILE, which would be the default if you
didn't provide a type, meaning OSFILE with prefix header to be
processed and NOT set to the XML application as data.  The option to provide
an explicit type would allow you to use OSFILE as you point out it is
specified, with the additional requirement for XML that the default
encoding is implied for type OSFILE (and any other type without
provision for out-of-band meta information).
