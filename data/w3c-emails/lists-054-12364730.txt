True -- does it handle the combining characters now?

Also true, although given
<!Entity Jakob 'J&#228;k&#246;b'>
what does it do?
Unknown character 246 in entity Jakob
is better than
Unknown character 246
I agree, just as
unknown image: jakob.gif
is better than
Unsupported image type or file not found
but both are worse than
missing image file jakob.gif [box of cream crakckers]

HTML wins here with ALT for images.
Let's follow that lead with ALT for images of characters.
