It seems to me that from a CS point of view, a non-reportable error
sounds like an error in the specification!  If you mean `it is optional
that an XML application detect this as an error', say that.

Agreed.  We already have obfuscatory language in the SGML spec!

XML must use the kind of language (whether or not one considers it to be
English) that is used in programming language specifications, and not
the kind of language that is used in legal briefs, legal opinions,
political statements or, for that matter, Sunday Morning Homilies :-)
