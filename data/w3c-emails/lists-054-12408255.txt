Sorry to be unclear.  The antecedent of 'these' was intended to be
'display-specific sets of entity declarations', not 'unkown glyphs'.
That is, what I meant was "without formal public identifiers being
part of XML, there will be no public text display version field in
the external identifier for an entity set; it will thus be impossible
(by which I meant:  I don't know how) to select automatically the
specific version of the entity set which should be used by a system
with the display characteristics of the current application; since
the public text display version field can be used to identify
device-specific versions of entity sets and handle some sophisticated
fallback schemes, this means that XML may have no standard way of
handling fallback information via device-specific and generic entity
sets."

Possible forms of private arrangements are indeed on the list of
topics to be addressed in future revisions.  I don't think there are
proposals on the table to address it in version 1.0.  Sorry; my
obscurity; I should have said XML 1.0.
