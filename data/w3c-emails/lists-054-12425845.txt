You *could* do this, but it is semantically incorrect in my books. It
is also a less interoperable solution (all systems would know that
SDATA was something special, but not all would necessarily know that
<glyph> was to be replaced by characters). Also, the *requirement* of
DTD changes/additional is not one to be ignored either.
