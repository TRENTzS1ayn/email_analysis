    Hear hear. This is the correct way to proceed: we can point to URNs
now, and we are all ready for experimental deployment today, and
standardization tomorrow. And we don't have to revise XML based on the
availability of URN resolution, crippling, in the meantime, those people
who need and are willing to implement custom FPI resolution now.
