I would like to point that at least one person on the ERB (me) passionately
believes that this viewpoint is totally misguided. If you do large-scale
authoring with nothing more than a parser, a simple file-based entity
manager, a text editor and the filesystem, then, yes, you would have
problems managing without external text entities.  If that's what you want
to do, author in SGML: you have all the authoring tools you need already.
The focus in XML should be on enabling the development of authoring
environments, and it is certainly possible to build a fine authoring
environment without any use of external text entities.
