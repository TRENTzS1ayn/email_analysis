James is correct; it is certainly possible to do this.  But SGML provides
a built-in, standard, nonproprietary way to go about it.  The way I sell
SGML in the corporate world is:

SGML gives you:
 1. a way to model the structure of your documents, and
 2. a way to control the authoring so they come out right, and
 3. a way to modularize documents for re-use and management, and
 4. ALL OF THIS IS STANDARDIZED AND NON-PROPRIETARY

It seems to me that if XML loses text entities, then #4 no longer applies
to #3.  I don't know - is this a fair price to pay for making XML 
lightweight and easy to adopt?  At the same time, James is correct that it 
is unreasonable and wrong to expect render-mostly network browsers to use 
the SGML transclude-and-parse semantics.  Is there an option-free way to
reconcile our goals?
