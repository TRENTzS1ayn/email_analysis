But note that general text entities *don't actually do point 3*.  General
text entities *ARE NOT REUSABLE*.  In fact, the only way to have re-usable
SGML documents, as James has pointed out, is to make them documents
syntactically (even if the objects may be semantically subparts of documents).

While external text entities are a useful convenience for single-person
authoring, they are not useful as a general mechanism for managing SGML
data as re-usable objects.  

Cheers,
