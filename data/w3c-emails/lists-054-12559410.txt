   This will only be useful if we pre-wire a tag into XML. I'm not averse
to this, really, as I agree that existing DTDs will be reworked. However,
it is a new mechanism, and it adds a funky tag that can't be redefined (if
this were not so a processor without a DTD might get a redefined tag of the
name "glyph," and choke). People are already used to the syntax
&mystery-glyph; The use of that syntax would now be an option that they
have to brew up themselves after understanding a new tag.

   These are not fatal objections, but I still prefer SDATA to this. Also
defining the tag, would mean defining the attributes for character
meta-data. I don't think we should enter that den of snakes now. Let's
reserve the [] syntax in SDATA entities for the future, and finish solving
the problem in XML 1.1 or 2.0.
