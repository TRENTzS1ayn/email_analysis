While James' point that entities are not necessary is valid, I agree with
Tim's (later post) that they provide the "vendor-independent" way to do doc
management. Pace, Eliot, I think that with the synchrony restriction they
could prove to be a lot more useful than SGML entities have proven to be.

I think the problem here is the assumption that the browser _must_ expand
the entity if it _can_ expand the entity. I advocate a different approach,
where a browser would have "transclude-if-convenient" semantics. So an
external entity reference might be rendered as an expandable link, like the
links in the old OWL product. The browser could automatically follow small
external entities, and link-ify large ones. This behavior is incompatible
with validation, but a non-validating parser would not care about this.

Since documents are parseable without a DTD, entities are too, so it's easy
to resolve an entity even after you have finished your first parse. You
will get better formatting if you retain the element stack + formatter
state variables in effect before unexpanded references, but even that is a
luxury.

Is letting the client program do what it wants (including just popping up a
link) enough freedom to make browsers easy?

No, it's not, I'm afraid.

You've got my idea, for what it's worth.
