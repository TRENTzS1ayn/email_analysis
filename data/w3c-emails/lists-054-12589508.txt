Why are they so bad for clients? The ERB has decided that enternal
text entities must be strictly synchronous with the document structure
after all, which would be one of the major hurdles. Without the
possibility of asynchronous nodes, it the purely linear parsing model
still required? I think it's possible to work around the issues.
