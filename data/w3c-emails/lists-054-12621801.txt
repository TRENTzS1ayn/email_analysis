On 30 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following
question.  A straw poll indicates the question needs further
discussion in the work group.

D.3 Should XML specify short-hand element declaration keywords (e.g.
%ANY-ELEMENT;) for element content in which any element in the DTD
is legal (same as ANY, but element not mixed content)?
