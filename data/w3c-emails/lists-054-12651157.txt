I think you may be right.

An XML parser intended for Web browsers wouldn't resolve an external text
entity immediately itself but rather would return a transclude event to the
application and keep going.  This would make it hard for a Web browser to do
validation, but that may not be a problem.

It would be easier to make this work if we disallowed references to external
text entities in attribute values, but hopefully people can live without those.
