I like this approach. The only problem with it that I can see is that
you would have to parse the external piece in order to get the formatting
straight since you don't know what the missing siblings/children are.
There is also the issue of missing IDs.

I really don't see any significant difference between entities and other
forms of transclusion--the semantics are the same only the syntax is
different.
