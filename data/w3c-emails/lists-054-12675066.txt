Er, I'm sorry if I'm missing something, but doesn't clause 7.9.4.2
(p. 335 of Handbook) restrict ENTITY/ENTITIES attributes to
data and SUBDOC entities?  I.e. isn't your conditional already met?
(I think we reaffirmed that XML will work the same way, on question
C.3 the other day.)

I hope so, because anything that would make this work more easily
while allowing external text entities is a good thing in my book.
