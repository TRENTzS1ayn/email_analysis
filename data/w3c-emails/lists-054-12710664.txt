Agreed.  When explaining external text entities to new SGML users, 
they invariably leap to the conclusion these are hypertext links.
They are usually disappointed when I explain these are not.  They 
then ask, why the extra features.  We dropped these from the IADS 
and IDE/AS designs for precisely this reason:  we were getting 
this functionality from the hyperlinks.  Wouldn't an independent 
link with a semantic of <get> do this job?
