O.K. It is now clear that in XML a document "without a DTD" means literally
that, and not just "parsable without reference to  its DTD". I think this is
unfortunate because I believe it will render XML a non-starter in the
marketplace.

I hope someone can prove me wrong by rebutting the following proposition (formal
mathematical proof not required):

XML without a DTD is no different from HTML extended by the ability to "add tags
and attributes" just by defining processing for the additions in a style sheet
(cascading or otherwise).
