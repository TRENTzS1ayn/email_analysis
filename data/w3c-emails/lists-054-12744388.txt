I agree with Robert -- multiple enumerations are desirable, but not worth
breaking conformance for. 

Another option would be to use the General Architecture "Lextype" declaration,
which is standardized:

<!attlist elemtype1 att1 nmtokens #implied att2 nmtokens #implied 
              lextype cdata #fixed "att1 YesOrNo att2 YesOrNo">

where "YesOrNo" is a lexical type name for which a model is defined in a
separate "lexical definition document".
