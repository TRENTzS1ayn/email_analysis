Just for the record, I never said any such thing. I just equated "DTD" to
"document type definition" to disambiguate the prevalent misuse of DTD to refer
to the external subset of the DOCTYPE declaration. 

In 8879, the term "document type" refers to semantics; a document type
definition only deals with the application of SGML to the markup of documents of
a particular type.
