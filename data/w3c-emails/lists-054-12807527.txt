Actually, it's the storage object, not the entity, and it isn't a smokescreen.

The parser sees *everything* in the entity, but several entities can be stored
in a single storage object. The storage object can contain things that aren't in
any SGML entities.

None of this is new; FSIs are just a new formalism for something we've always
had. See notes 1 and 2 in clause 6.1 of ISO 8879. [295:2-8]
