Maybe that's the problem.

In order for an external SGML entity to be ignored safely by the parser, it has
to be a document entity (or subdoc, which for our purposes is the same thing).
Therefore, if we restrict external SGML/XML entities to being referenced from
attribute values, we can have reusable objects (as Eliot has pointed out) and we
don't have to redefine the meaning of an entity reference.

<p>As is shown in the following text:<quoteref entity=ent1> ...</p>

Of course, "quoteref" is really a typed hyperlink, as is any "entity reference"
that a parser can safely ignore.

My conclusion: drop the optional entity references. We'll get them back in a
robust and fully conforming form when we add hyperlinking.
