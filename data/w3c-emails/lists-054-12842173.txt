Thank you Charles. This is a good clarification and is the way I
understand things (the best kind of clarification is one that agrees
with your position ;-)).

I should note that a *further* reason for both FSI's and MIME-based
storage managers is that email will potentially be an important
delivery mechanism for XML. Both FSI's and MIME are perfectly suited
for this.
