> I find the introduction of "optional features" in XML most unfortunate

I agree.

This was a major issue for HTML.  Content Negotiation for HTML variants
is not generally available today, two and a half years after the first
HTML working group meeting.

Clearly you can't use any optional feature in a document to be published
on the web if you have no control over the browser.  If you have control
over the browser and are starting with SGML, you can call +1 416 544 9000
and ask for Panorama OEM licensing :-)

If you can't use optional XML features, they are better off not being there.

Agreed on both counts (assuming you mean external entities)

That got thrown away with the decision to be SGML compatible :-)
