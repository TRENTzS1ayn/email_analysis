Since we are not allowing any new convenience features in DTDs (like mix-in
markup), we will continue to require the old parameter-entity methods for
creating extensions. This is a requirement, now, in my opinion.

I think that this is far worse for processors than external text entities,
because they must be followed for the DTD to be useful (i.e. we cannot
remove the serial dependencies as we have for external text entities).

   While it is sometimes useful to have external parameter entities, for
most projects one can live without them. On balance we should drop this, or
reconsider it in 2.0 in light of how hard it was to live without (and for
how many people it was hard).
