I'm dubious about this. See below.

This is exactly correct, except that XML allows you to create a DTD, and
HTML does not. Thus you have an opportunity to organize your tag salad,
once you realize that you want to keep your Garbazos from getting mixed up
with your Succotash.

Given the relative success of HTML and SGML in the marketplace of the Web,
I'll take my chances with a DTD-less option for XML.

I also thing that automatic DTD generation will be a useful tool to help
naive users develop DTDs by starting with example documents.
