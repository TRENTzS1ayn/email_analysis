I prefer this to any of the options we have discussed. We should eliminate
ID/IDREF altogether, add Lee's application convention, and generate
warnings for attbitues called "ref.whatever" whose value does not occur on
as the value of a "whatever" attribute elsewhere in the document.

We can add ID/IDREF declarations once SGML97 comes out. XML need never have
them, but the SGML import process will be able to create them
automatically.

Exactly! very nice!
