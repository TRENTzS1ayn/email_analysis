I just about vomited when the toxic synergies between case-insensitivity 
and 10646 repertoire became clear.  Making XML markup case-sensitive is 
clearly the *right* thing to do, but adds a lot of work for those who
want to interoperate with SGML and especially HTML.  Failing that, I
don't suppose there's any support for going back to 7-bit characters, just
for GI's and attribute names?
