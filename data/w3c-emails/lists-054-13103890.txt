This would be a *very good thing*, but it is just a subset of the
problem of comments in a declaration.  All that is really needed is a
formal specification for relating comments in a declaration to some
part of that declaration.  The problem with SGML right now is that in
the case of:

<!ATTLIST foo 
          -- this is ambiguous --
  name CDATA #IMPLIED

it is unclear what the comment is meant to apply to.  If there were a
formal way of determining what part fo the declaration the comment
applied to, it would be easy for the parser to return the comment,
associated to it's context.  This formal defintion could (easily?) be
part of the parsing specification for the DTD.

The reason parser don't normally feed back the comments is because
comments are ignored markup in SGML.  The only way to return the
comments is to return the markup, and even then, you are faced with
the ambiguity question I raised above.

I think it would be a mistake to define XML such that we lost
architectural forms.  I see architectural forms as realizing there
potential in exactly such an environment as XML is being designed for
(ie. dynamic data interchange between systems).
