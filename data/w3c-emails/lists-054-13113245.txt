But not enough to win out against "HTML with user extensions via style sheet".
To teach the value of "a logical tree of arbitrary depth" we need to teach the
value of structure and document types. This case is weakened significantly if we
don't require DTDs and offer the possibility of validation of all XML documents.

We needn't (shouldn't) require validation at rendition time, but there should
always be a DTD that can be accessed for editing and/or validation. Without it,
XML won't be a sufficient improvement on HTML to win a significant market.
