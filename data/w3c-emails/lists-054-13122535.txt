SGML text entities are parsed in the same context as the document that
references them and the parsed replacement text becomes part of the ESIS. Within
the ESIS, there is no indication that they existed as separate entities. 

If the declaration is not in the document, there is no way to identify the
entity, and therefore no way to assure that two different systems will use the
same replacement text. If they don't, there will be two different ESISs.
