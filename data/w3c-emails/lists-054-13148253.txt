This approach totally confounds the element structure with the storage of a
document. Element types describe the role that abstract classes of information
play in the document. Whether a given instance is reusable is a low-level piece
of metadata having to do with the optimization of storage management. Mixing the
two is far worse than "tag salad", it is "tag compost".
