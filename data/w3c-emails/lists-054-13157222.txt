And as Martin well know, it will. We started working on it at the last WG8
meeting.

However, the equivalent of "subdoc" with differing SGML declarations is easily
obtainable for XML by simply declaring a data entity as "NDATA SGML", then
linking to that entity via an attribute value. In my opinion, that is the *only*
way that XML should reference external SGML entities.
