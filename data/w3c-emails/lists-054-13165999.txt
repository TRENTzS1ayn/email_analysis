Well, while I'm on a role, let me clarify things a bit further. MIME is a
storage manager. FSIs are a means of identifying storage managers in an entity
declaration. So the two work together; they are not alternatives.

(Actually, the SGML Extended Facilities list two MIME-based storage managers:
MIME is a "container" storage manager, like TAR, and is used for normal entity
declarations. MIMETYPE is used to associate notations with processing, and
occurs only in external identifiers in notation declarations.)
