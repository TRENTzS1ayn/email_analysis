| As an aside, those of us like Lee and Gavin who are receiving the i18n
| material on this at the same time as the XML stuff have to look very
| hard at the messages to determine which camp they are coming from. The
| XML camp is only seeing a part of a three way conversation, so might
| miss out on some of the nuances of the situation, which includes the
| problem of sorting, matching characters that have been generated using
| accents + character pairs with accented characters, matching
| equivalents within 10646 code tables,....

That's why WG participants were selected partly in order to maximize
overlap with other standards efforts.  We're counting on you guys to
keep us informed.
