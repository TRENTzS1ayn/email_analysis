While I can agree with this, I do not see how or why we should specify
implementation behaviour as part of the syntax specification.

People said that external text entities would cause problems in
a distirbuted system. I showed one architecture in which a number
of the difficulties are overcome.

The decision of which should be used is a seperate issue.
