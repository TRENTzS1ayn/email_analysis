The need to specify lexical equivalence of strings is an important
capability missing from SGML. Rick and I've talked about this many
times.

This is why I suggested ISO 10646. using this we should be able to
do something like:

  <XML>
  <DIV LANG="en.uk">
  &english;
  </DIV>
  <DIV LANG="ja">
  &japanese;
  </DIV>
  <DIV LANG="zh">
  &chinese;
  </DIV>
  </XML>

and even if the entities are in different encodings, parse, and
process the document.
