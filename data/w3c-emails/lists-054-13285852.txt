Nope.  Users use software provided by vendors that don't have the option 
to ignore the standard.  Software makes or breaks the rules.  Bad
practice
is bad practice.  No undefined exceptions.  The programmer can apply it 
as_is_sensible, but without agreements honored and a means to verify
that, 
the situation becomes what it is for HTMLduJour.  I can easily find 
out what is HTML and what is NetscapeToday.

A fragment by definition is not a valid SGML document so why should
an XML fragment be? Or is it? Can someone define "fragment"?  I can
reset 
the doctype and parse within a subtree of a DTD-constrained instance.
So, is a fragment contiguous, or a set of disjunct elements?
