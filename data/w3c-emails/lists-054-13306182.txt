Stipulating that only valid XML documents may be interchanged is heavy handed 
and will limit acceptance. This requirement could preclude a variety of 
applications since it would effectively prevent the interchange of 
works-in-progress. Rather than exchanging documents in their "current state", 
some intermediate, "valid state" would have to be artifically created. We could 
specifiy mechanisms for going from invalid to valid and back again, or we could 
just let documents be exchanged.

This level of formalism isn't needed.
