The two aren't necessarily incompatible... If we allow <e/> we can also
allow <e> for empties if and only if they are declared. This is fine in SGML
too, since EMPTY elements can use NET-enabling start-tags just fine.

This way we get some level of backward compatibility to everybody. The
downside is that there are then two ways of saying the same thing; but it
does let us support legacy HTML data (given that the HTML DTD does the right
declarations), and let's us introduce the syntactic distinction for the
benefit of our posterity.
