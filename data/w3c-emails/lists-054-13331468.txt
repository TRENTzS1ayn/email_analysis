I think there is some confusion between the concept of referencing an entity,
and the SGML syntactic construct called an "entity reference". SGML has two ways
to reference entities: by entity references (&entname; or %entname;) and by
attribute values. Each method is used for a different type of entity.

Syntactic entity references refer only to integral and invariant parts of the
*source* document (which means they are parsed). Attributes refer to data
entities that an application can choose to include in the *output* document, but
never the source document.

Transclusions accessed via a general entity reference (meaning &entname;)
violate 8879.

Transclusions accessed through an attribute value do not violate 8879.
