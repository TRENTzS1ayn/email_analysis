If we took your point literally, Bill, it would require an XML processor to
accept any character string and make sense of it. There has to be some
definition of "input that an XML processor is expected to handle".

Tim has made the distinction between "valid", meaning "conforming to an explicit
DTD", and "well-formed", meaning "processable without reference to an explicit
DTD". An interchanged XML document has to be one or the other, not just an
arbitrary string.

For "valid" documents, there would be a DOCTYPE declaration with an explicit
external and/or internal subset. Such a document would clearly conform to SGML
as well.

As Eliot has pointed out, merely "well-formed" XML documents could announce
themselves and also be SGML conforming if they were introduced by the following
declaration:

<!DOCTYPE doctypename SYSTEM>
