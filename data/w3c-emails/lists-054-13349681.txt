I don't think I was as clear as I should have been. We seem to agree that only
"valid" XML and "well-formed" XML are of interest. (Documents that are neither
are broken.) We also agree that "valid" XML is just like valid SGML, with the
same kind of DOCTYPE declaration.

I am *not* proposing that there be an explicit "DTD" for merely "well-formed"
XML. I am proposing, as Eliot has pointed out, that there is a legitimate 8879
DOCTYPE declaration for the case where there is no explicit DTD, viz:

<!DOCTYPE DocumentTypeName SYSTEM>

If XML uses this to introduce a well-formed DTD-less document, it will satisfy
SGML conformance as well. Therefore, there is no reason to break SGML
conformance for well-formed DTD-less XML documents.
