Suppose the user doesn't include the DOCTYPE.  The system implementor 
puts that on their list of exceptions to handle and either whacks the 
users kneecaps with a "Foreswear bad XML" or says nothing and goes on 
doing what they will do if it is there but no DTD is specified.  What 
is the big deal?  OTH, tell them that the DOCTYPE is optional and they 
will never do it.  It isn't the laziness of the author that is at issue.
It is the laziness of the programmer and the conformance of the system.
Even HTML application users are learning it's a good idea to put the 
DOCTYPE in there.  The large numbers that don't says more about the 
levels of practicioners out there and the systems they use, not the 
validity of the practice.

What is the technical reason for optionality on this issue?
