I've been just watching the tennis match on this issue, and my allegiance
switches with every mail message. :-)  Nonetheless, one small comment...

Perhaps they're learning that it's a good idea to use the DOCTYPE
declaration because they're pointing to various *different* HTMLs.  A 
DOCTYPE declaration of <!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM> tells you nothing other
than (repetitiously) the root element's name, whereas an FPI at least
points you to a specific intended DTD.
