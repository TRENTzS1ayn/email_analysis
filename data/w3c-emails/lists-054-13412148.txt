I don't know which end of the court your leaning toward at the moment, but
here's another argument (in case conformance to 8879 isn't important enough :-).

Consistent rules are better than inconsistent ones. We can simply say:

A DOCTYPE declaration is always required. If there is a DTD, indicate that by
locating the external subset and/or putting the declarations in the internal
subset. If there is no DTD, indicate that by the word "SYSTEM" alone.
