If there is no doctype, we default to a tag scanner.  We note the 
solution is not robust when faced with infinite diversity in 
infinite combination... but it beats issuing a kneecap wedgie.
In IDE/AS, if the user does not specify a stylesheet, we 
use a default stylesheet that is rather ugly to look at in 
all but the simplest cases.
