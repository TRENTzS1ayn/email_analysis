Bil gave a great reason: This will not, in fact, be put in by users, thus
rendering the notion of well-formed XML documents irrelevant. Well-formed
XML documents should, therefore, _not_ be SGML compatible in this way, as
it will lead to a dearth of well-formed XML documents.

We should not try to impose any conditions on well-formed documents that
are not _REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR AN XML PROCESSOR TO PARSE IT_. The doctype
is not needed for XML processing, so it should not be in well-formed XML.
Valid XML arguably has a much greater claim on it for SGML compatibility,
even for things that could be done automatically; well-formed XML does not.
