As do I.  I also think it's the most practicable thing to do.  We
will never have less XML legacy data to worry about than we do now
-- so it will never be easier to introduce case sensitivity
throughout the markup language than it is now.

Let's go with them.

If we *have* to have case folding, which I strenuously dispute, then
the simplest fallback is to use the default case-folding tables of
the Unicode Consortium, which are not hard to get (they come on the
CD when you buy the book, nowadays, and I suspect they're even on
the net somewhere).  As the Unicode Standard Version 2.0 says
(section 4.1, Case, p. 4-2):  "In a few instances, upper- and
lowercase mappings may differ from language to language between
writing systems that employ the same letters.  Examples include
Turkish (... [dotted and dotless I]) and French (...).  However, in
general the vast majority of case mappings are uniform across
languages."

I don't think case-folding is essential to the utility or success of
XML.  Even if it is, though, I don't think it's more important than
internationalization.

Let's all take a deep breath.  Case-sensitive element names,
attribute names, attribute values.  We can live with that.  Element
names restricted to a subset of the alphabet (say, A-J, all
uppercase)?  I couldn't live happily with that, and I can't see
asking the native speakers of every language but English and Latin
to do so.
