I don't see any problem with this, as long as the external SGML text entity
doesn't change the parsing state. As David pointed out, the standard doesn't
address timing, just context. The external SGML text entity would have to be
parsed as though it occurred as a replacement for the entity reference. The text
following the entity reference has to be parsed as if it followed the
replacement text. The challenge will be to define (and enforce?) the
restrictions on a non-state-changing external entity.

On the other hand, there is no reason why a smart parser can't do anticipatory
fetching and parsing of entities invoked by an attribute value, just as easily.
In fact, it should be easier, as such entities establish their own parsing
context.
