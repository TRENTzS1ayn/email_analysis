On the other hand, we could get right down to business and describe
an XML document as claiming to be in a ready-to-validate state or 
not.  The full/partial business makes me uncomfortable because the ends 
are just degenerate cases of the middle, but stating that you think
something is ready to be validated is a useful piece of information.

(PI, not parment, right?)  People who are making ad hoc document
structures will not want to add a PI saying that the structures are
ad hoc.  It would make more sense to require documents that are 
"complete" to have a PI saying so, since saying so would buy more
useful processing -- namely, validation by recipients.  And since
much document exchange (I'm guessing) won't be for the purpose of 
validation by recipients, the PI can be left off a lot of the time.
