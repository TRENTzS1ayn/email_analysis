Can someone please prove that this is so? The distinction between an
"SGML comformant parser" and an "XML parser" might be a good one to
make. For the sake of argument, let's say we have an XML parser that
parses entity references. Can anyone show me a case where it is
absolutely necessary to resolve the entity before parsing can
continue (especially considering that replacement text would become
psuedo-elements and thereby not affect the structure much at all).
