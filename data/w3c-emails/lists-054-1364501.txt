We use a similar mechanism in our domain files (search here when 
all else fails). It also makes the use and implementation of 
link validator/verifiers easier.  Link validation is one of 
the gaping holes in Internet hypermedia which local intranet 
systems can't live with.  (No, I don't choose to always
"serve" SGML to the client; the DB solution is not applicable.) 
So, from the production perspective of working SGML hypermedia systems,
the strawman is welcome.
