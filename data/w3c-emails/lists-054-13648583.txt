I've not been explicit enough.

I think people will not include the doctype when it _does not add value_.
If I am not using a DTD, then a doctype is not valuable. For those people
who can live with well-formed, rather than valid XML, the doctype will not
add value and will not be included. A requirement that it must be included
on well-formed, but invalid documents will be ignored. More people include
the title tags than doctype tags in HTML becuase title tags add value, not
because they care about conformance. They will do what is necessary to make
things work, and resent requirements that are not necessary to make things
work. The value of doctype for valid XML (with a DTD) is not a question in
my mind, or I think anyone else's. Attempting to require people to say what
they are _not_ using, when it has no effect on parsing seems like a losing
proposition.

   End tags and attribute values have much better cases for the
restrictions we're putting on them -- in terms of XML processing, as well
as in terms of compatibility. I won't be surprised if many people start
using DTDs in order to get default attribute values, rather than to get
validation. We'll see.
