Or, we can avoid any feature that would make this distiction necessary. So
we have _no declarations_ or a _full DTD_. This is why I favor some
distinctive syntax for empty elements (any of the possibilities will do). I
can't remember what other sticking points there are to eliminating the
notion of partial DTDs.

Oh, yes, entities. If we allow transclusion semantics, browsers can treat
an undefined entity as a broken link, in the same way they treat a broken
grapic now... This is another reason I think that unresolved entities are
natural.
Or undefined entities can be an error in a DTD- and subset-less document.
BTW what is happening with the subset?

   If we need "partial DTDs" couldn't we implement them more nicely as
subsets to empty doctypes (which in this case would add value for the user,
by letting them declare entities). A subset without a DTD would be
well-formed, whatever declarations it contained.
