Yea, verily, yea!

Now the agonizing part: are !element !attlist, etc. upper or lower case?

I argue for lower case, given that studies of roman alphabet readability
dhave shown mixed case to be more distinctive, legible, and easy to read
than ALL CAPS TEXT. I have having to shout when I type tags....

Since the religious aspect of this issue is very large, perhaps comments
should be restricted to a single vote for preferred case... I could live
will ALL CAPS BUT I FIND IT UGLY AND HARD TO READ. I WILL NOT POST FURTHER
ON THE ISSUE OF WHICH CASE TO USE. I HAVE SAID MY PIECE. I'D STILL MUCH
RATHER LIVE WITH UPPER CASE THAN TRY TO DEFINE CORRECT CASE FOLDING IN
UNICODE, or implement it.
