I don't have the Handbook handy,
but a quick test with SGMLS indicates
that NAMECASE GENERAL NO requires keywords
to be UPPERCASE.  (This includes keywords
like CDATA, NMTOKENS, ANY, and O, as well as
<!ELEMENT...> <!ATTLIST...> <!ETCETERA...>).

For tags you can use whatever case you like;
it's only the markup declarations that are affected.

I'll vote "yes" to NAMECASE GENERAL NO (case-sensitivity).
