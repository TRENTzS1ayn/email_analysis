The case I have in mind is one, for a valid XML document, where an external text 
entity contains markup that would change the content model of the document 
instance based on parse-time inclusion versus use-time inclusion. I'm not a 
parser expert but suspect that we may have a problem with delayed parsing of 
external text entities in valid XML even if we preclude asynchronous entities.
