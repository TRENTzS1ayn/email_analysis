I strongly disagree about case sensitivity.  We have zero XML legacy
data, but a *ton* of HTML and SGML legacy data, as well as legacy 
coding experience (which weighs more heavily, I think).  NAMECASE
GENERAL should be YES in XML.

I don't understand the A-J analogy.  How can case insensitivity be like 
having a restricted alphabet, if the difference is only "case" (whatever 
that notion means) and not something more significant that makes the
thing turn into another character entirely?

Particularly considering that HyTime makes a distinction (if a weak and
conventional one) between !element and !ELEMENT, but also on the other
grounds Paul Grosso mentioned earlier, I'd hate to require a single
case -- particularly lowercase -- for SGML keywords.
