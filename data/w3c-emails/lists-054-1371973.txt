RFC 1874 on SGML Media Types defines both text and application
for SGML, with some language that may or may not be relevant;
the main idea appears to be to provide fallback to text/plain
from text/sgml.

This sounds like a conflict with the MIME specification and Unicode that
needs to be resolved, rather than hacking a (albeit, working) solution. XML
documents are by nature 'text', so possibly this is something that has been
already brought up in MIME discussions. Anyone? I was going to ask Glenn
Adams, but he *just* left for the night.

I have to agree with Jon that text/x-xml seems logical (ie., the choice
that people would guess).
