Because the SGML model for case sensitivity does not work in some
languages if the full alphabet is used.
If lower case v and w both turned into capital W in English,
in a case insensitive system, v and w would not be distinguished,
and vine and wine would map to the same string.
Hence <P ID="wine"> and <P ID="vine"> would be illegal.

Now, although v and w do not both map into W in English,
e and e acute both map into E in French, but do not do so in
Canadian French.  Hence, it would either have to be an error to use an
e acute in an ID in XML, or you'd have to face the situation that
two words as different as wine and vine might end up being collated
together and considered the same string after conversion to upper case.

Well, it shouldn't.

Yes.  Thankfully.  Let's get rid of this annoying case folding thing!
