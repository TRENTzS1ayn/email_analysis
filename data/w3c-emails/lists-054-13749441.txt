Sorry, I should have phrased that better.  What I meant
was that NAMECASE GENERAL NO only forces you to use
upper-case for SGML keywords; you can use whatever
case you like for element type names _if you're writing
your own DTD_ (of course, you have to use the same case
in instances as in the document type definition.)
