I cannot see any cases (with the API's I have in my head) when an
application could ever even know if the entity occurred (ie. the
tree the application accessed would be identical for all practical
purposes). I could see some differences in RE/RS recognition if we
follow SGML's recognition rules, which would lead to some differences
in tree structure, and this is another reason why I prefer the "no
such thing as RE/RS" approach...
