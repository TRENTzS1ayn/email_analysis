   I tend to agree. ESIS defines a minimum level of information required,
but I don't see that we should enshrine its flaws, especially since it is
non-normative. I am able, for instance, to get the EMPTY element
information trivially from YASP, and I'm sure it can be done the same from
SP. If XML requires emty element information, that will be an argument for
an ESIS+ option to NSGMLS to easily support conversions to XML.

    Arguments of the form "this is in the ESIS, we need it" should hold a
_lot_ of weight. Arguments of the form "We need this (or would like it a
lot) but ESIS doesn't have it, so we'll have to live without" are not
totally negligible, but ease of implementing such extensions (for a
reasonable SGML parser) should be factored in.
