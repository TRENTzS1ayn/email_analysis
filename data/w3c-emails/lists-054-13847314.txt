Just a quick comment:

Actually there is no difference.  The omnimark or perl script is no
harder or easier whether it works on empty elements or "full" ones.
It's not the SGML software and SGML users we have to worry about, as
long as there is a clear mapping.  It's the non-SGML users, or the
SMGL [sic] users, with their (our) Dirty Perl Scripts.
It's slightly easier to match <@IMG ALT="</>"> in perl than to match
<IMG A1="/>" A2='/>'/> but not much so, for what little that's worth.

Both <e/> and <@e> are compatible with both of these, as you mentioned.
