I would rather see then out than optional.

The notion that you *cannot* validate in a lazy-parsing model is
incorrect. It is a different model, yes, but not impossible (you'd
have to delay validation of certain nodes until a certain portion of
an entity had been resolved). 

I basically assume that any data that is being transmitted will
have already been validated...
