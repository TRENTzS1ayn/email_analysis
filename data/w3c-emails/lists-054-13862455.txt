Right.  And we didn't rule that out.  We just said that you don't *have to*
read external text entities unless you're validating.  Which, as you
suggest, a downstream browser likely isn't.  As for nuking external
text entities altogether, we thought that over seriously; there are just
too many people who see them as a sine qua non of a worthwhile authoring
system.
