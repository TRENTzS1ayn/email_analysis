Well, that's not what I intended. I have always advocated a first-line
approach that says that _all_ characters not in a tag or a comment are
significant, and part of the parse tree. This is a _simple rule_. Anything
else is a complicated rule, although I agree that the behavior Charles is
claiming would provide a much-less complex rule. But I don't like the fact
that we would have different answers about the contents of the document
depending on the processor. I suppose it's no worse than the current mess.

OK. You've convinced me. Now can someone check to see if the standard is
unabiguous enought about shortrefs and whitespace handling that this hack
will actually work? At least sgmls, nsgmls, and some of the commercial
products need to be checked.

We should still have two kinds; I think three is too many. We should simply
abandon the notion of ESIS-equivalent parsing. We have minimal parsing
(different ESIS), and validating. If people find that they want only some
of the functionality of a validating parser (e.g. whitespace handling only)
they will implement it into their minimal parser, but we need not have a
formal compliance level for that. We can delcare that implementing some
validation features in a minimal parser is _not_ an error in conformance.
This is very non-ISO, but quite IETF in intent, I think.

  Can we start interpreting "RE Delenda est" as a statement, rather than en
exhortation?

I am not a number. I am an undefined character.
