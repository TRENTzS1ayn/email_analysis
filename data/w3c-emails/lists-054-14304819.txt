Is this a problem?  If so, what?  If not, why are you raising it?

Sorry, my slip.  The note to item 0.2 may be misleading, since while all
the schemes mentioned are based on the reference concrete syntax, four
of the eight propose to ignore quantities and capacities.  They do not
propose an alternate set (unless memory fails me); they simply propose
to ignore their values.  Like the other four, therefore, they need no
concept of a difference between concrete and abstract syntax.

We are in any case not limited *at all* to the proposals summarized
in document DD-1996-0002; they may be regarded as straw proposals,
with the subtle difference that unlike a typical 'straw proposal' they
already exist independently of this group.
