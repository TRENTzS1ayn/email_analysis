I'm not sure that you want 9070 to be the normative text here.  We
looked into this recently and came to the conclusion that we would
rather stick with the 8879 description of FPIs because it allows the
(soon-to-be-standard) three-letter language codes, while 9070 (at
least on last reading) appears to prohibit them.
