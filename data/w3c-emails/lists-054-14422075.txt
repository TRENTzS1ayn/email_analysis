 Although, I have a fairly limited grasp on ISO 10646 / UNICODE Ver.
2 I do have experience encoding TEI documents in a variety of
unusual languages, and as such I strongly support Gavin's ideas.  I
believe that unless a strong case can be made to the difficulty of
implementation, standardizing on the ISO 10646 character repertoire 
and not a particular encoding of that repertoire, to be the best
choice. 

I agree with Tim Bray in that I do not want the  XML parser to be
responsible for encoding / decoding a particular character
representation, and as such do not want UTF-8 to be specified as its
internal format. As a matter of practicality, I realize that UCS-4
is not something that one would want to send across the "wire" and in
that sense specifying that UTF-8 be the the initial encoding for
transmission is fine.  (Although the Reuters encoding scheme that I
just read about in the UNICODE conference proceedings is very
intriguing.)  I also agree with Tim that a library of encoding
conversion routines that fuction outside of the parser would be very
useful in a reference implementation.

Let me also weigh in on the side of having all markup and content in
the same character set including GI's and attributes.

Finally, I am a little concerned with the partitioning of
functionality between XML and SGML.  In particular, if XML becomes
as successful as I hope, there may be strong reasons (i.e. product
availability / price) for not using SGML and making due with XML.  XML
therefore cannot rely too heavily on the availability of its more
functional parent to mitigate its own limitations.
