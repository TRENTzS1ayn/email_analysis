I note that the hypermail archive at 

http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Archives/Public/w3c-sgml-wg/

is kind of confusing and a bit hard to read.  For people just joining the
group, or who want to retrace the discussion on a particular issue, I find
the "thread index" to be a lot more useful - it's signposted from the page
above, or available directly at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-sgml-wg/threads.html

This is best read from the bottom up, using the 'Prev' links, and going 
back to the list when they (occasionally) peter out.

I've seen hypermail archives work better than this - are we doing something
wrong here?

Cheers, Tim Bray
