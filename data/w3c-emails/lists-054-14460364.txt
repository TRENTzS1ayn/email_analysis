This sounds good as long as UTF-8 is recommended or defaulted.  The
other issue is what to present at the parser's API.  Here to I do
not want to be restricted to a UTF-8 encoding because if I were to
write a parser in JAVA, a UTF-16 encoding would be more appropriate.
 Instead I view the parser proper as excepting UCS-4 on input and
output.  Encoding should be handled outside the parser in the storage
manager.
