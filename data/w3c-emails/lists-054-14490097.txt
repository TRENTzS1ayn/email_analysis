But how many times did it go into and out of the authoring tool during
its creation, drafting, modifying, editing, proofing, etc. before it
got put up on the internet for viewing.

First, comments are comments, and as Tom says, they are ignored by many
parsers.  Why be non-compliant with SGML for (what I perceive as) no good
reason?

Second, there are existing tools that use PIs as they were intended to
be used.  Why break them and ask them to use comments for what they
weren't intended?

Third, comments have at least as annoying "escaping" problems as PIs.
Do you know how often I try to type "--" in a long comment only to
have a parse error (unless I'm using Adept which tries to avoid this)?
The business about parsing -------- [that's 8 of them] in a comment
is certainly more of a pain than scanning text following <? for >.

Fourth, I still just don't get it.  What's so hard about PIs?

p.s.  My message header seems to indicate that Bill sent this only to me.
I hope I'm correct in assuming this was an oversight and that I'm not
breaching e-etiquette by resending this to the entire mailing list.
