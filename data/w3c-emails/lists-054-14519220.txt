Please, no; these save a tiny number of bytes, make it harder for
both humans and computers to understand, and for people who don't
already know SGML, have to be explained.  Also, on purely CS-theory
grounds, they push an XML parser over the edge from a pure automaton
to something that has to keep a stack.  OK, the cost of keeping a stack
is not high, but neither is the benefit of using </>.

The rest seem like good things for XML:
