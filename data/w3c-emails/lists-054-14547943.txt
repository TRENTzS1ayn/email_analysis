| Please, no; these save a tiny number of bytes, make it harder for
| both humans and computers to understand, and for people who don't
| already know SGML, have to be explained.  Also, on purely CS-theory
| grounds, they push an XML parser over the edge from a pure automaton
| to something that has to keep a stack.

And, to bring it down to the level that I'm used to working at, they
push a desperate human from a fix that can be accomplished in time to
meet a deadline with a five-line perl hack to one that can't.
