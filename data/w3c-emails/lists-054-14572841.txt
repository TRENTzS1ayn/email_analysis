Actually a tiny number of bytes can add up quickly in large files,
but I to am willing to do without </>.  What I would  like is to be
able to leave off the end tag entirely and have XML assume that I
wanted to close the immediately  proceeding element so that

<list>
<item>Item 1
<item>Item 2
<item>Item 3
</list> 

would be legal.  Doing this should be easy assuming that the EMPTY 
element problem is dealt with.
