This seems strange to me.  If you disallow PI's, people will use
Significant Comments:
<!--@PS beginpage-->
is just as powerful as
<?PS beginpage>


So you might as well retain PIs.

Some HTML systems use PIs today anyway, e.g. for server-side includes,
TeX -> DVI inclusion etc.

See the IETF html-wg archive.

Not at all.  SGMLdoesn't forbdg <?xxx &3901;> as far as I can tell.
Or does it?
