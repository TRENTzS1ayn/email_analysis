Which raises an interesting question, when XML is going in a direction that
it seems like WG8 is as well, should we (a) leap out ahead, or (b) wait for
them to do it.  

Tim -- to paraphrase Pogo -- we ARE them (look at the mailing list). 

I'm sure we can work together with ourselves to make sure that the 8879 revision
will have the necessary options so that XML can be defined as a valid "profile".
XML will probably occur before the formal publication of the revised 8879, but
not necessarily before WG8 has agreed to those design changes that XML might
need.
