I knew you know that, but the context of the discussion was whether comment
declarations couldn't do what PIs do. My point is, that's no improvement. If the
objective is DTDless parsing, the real problem isn't PIs but included
subelements. Without the DTD, there is no way to distinguish them from proper
subelements.

The net is that this is really a problem with RE handling, not with PIs per se.
