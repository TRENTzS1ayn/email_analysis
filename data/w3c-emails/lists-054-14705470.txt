To clarify, my concern in this posting was that XML be 
a strict subset that would not break the existing SGML 
tools.  I am completely in agreement with the simplifications
because that is how the tools our company provides work 
and have for the past six years.  Last night and this 
morning, I exchanged mail with Mr. Sperberg-McQueen and 
Mr. Bray.  I am comfortable with the results that this 
is on the right track.
