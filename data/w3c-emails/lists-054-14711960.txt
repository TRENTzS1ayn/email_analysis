I second that.  When doing conversions, we end up cleaning up 
a substantial mess because of minimizations.  I assume that 
one application of XML will be to have a very consistent 
target set for translating SGML sources into.  To do this, 
we often build ad hoc tools and these tools need simpler 
models.

So, I prefer not to minimize and to disallow mixed content 
models.  Our problems start where we have to allow for loosely 
formatted documents that a customer insists look on the 
screen as they did on the page.  This is where we usually have 
to allow inclusions for font changes, pushing text around, etc.

The other consideration is cost of teaching employees how to 
convert.  The simpler the target, the better.
