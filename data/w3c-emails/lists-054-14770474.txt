On the contrary, I think they are very necessary in DTDs. I try to avoid
them, but the inconsistencies in the current crop of tools force me to
use them. XML is not going to be able improve this situation in the least.
Tools will still have their quirks and many of those quirks will require
some subtle change to the DTD in order to compensate for them. Variations
on table models and equation markup are two such examples of things that
XML will not address and will continue to be a problem in the future.
