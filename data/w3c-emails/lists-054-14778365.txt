I don't think we have to directly.  As long as we are 8879-legal, I have 
no problems with filtering mechanisms here.  It is already the common
practice.
We can safely say, I believe, that XML was designed to enable efficient 
implementation and use of SGML online.  Mileage depends on terrain.  In
this
statement, all SGML applications are treated equally.  That is, XML
doesn't
favor or disfavor HTML, 28001, TEI, on and on.  We cannot go down the
path 
of ensuring backward compatibiity where application-specific features
have 
been introduced.
