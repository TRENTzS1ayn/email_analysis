Such a filter is no worse than the one you would have to write to remove the
end-tags from XML-EMPTY elements before sending them to a validating SGML
tool! You can't win with either approach, but I like the use of NET here
much better than the use of a (to me) unnecessary end-tag. Is keeping a list
of empty elements that you skip over the end-tag processing rules for such a
big deal for parser developers?

As for telling an exisitingSGML parser how to emit XML, simply set the -x
switch on Jade-lite and it will generate XML rather than RTF (if James
accepts this as a useful transformation!) or put in a <?Convert-to XML>
processing instruction *before* the base document element.

This I like!

Bang goes any chance of being able to use SGML tools to generate XML!
