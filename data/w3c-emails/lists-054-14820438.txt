HTML extends SHORTTAG attribute processing to beyond that of SGML (by saying
that unknown attribute names and associated values are ignored) for good
reasons. Attribute entry is one of the areas where users are most prone to
make typing errors (e.g. mistyped attribute names) or try to take short cuts
(such as leaving out the literal quotes or just entering a token value).
