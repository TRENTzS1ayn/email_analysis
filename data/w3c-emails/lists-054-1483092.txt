> What needs changing is the definition of MIME 'text/*' from 646 to 10646,

Note that MIME has to be backwards compatible with RFC822 by default,
and with existing mail and netnews gateways -- it isn't only used for
HTTP, of course...

Other applications get round this by using a MIME Charset: header, I think.

But I'm not sure how to get an existing or nearly-existing httpd server
to add Charset lines wiothout hacking it, unless you put the MIME
headers in the file and use .asis processing (where supported).
