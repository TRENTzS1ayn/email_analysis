I think that Martin has raised an interesting point here: Is it worthwhile
to pursue client-XML and server-XML? Rather than saying "you should use
Real SGML" should there be a variant subset of XML that is on the server
side with a clear and straightforward transform to XML for a client?
Server-side parsing could be slightly more complex to allow us to retain
more of the "hard" but really useful features like the two mentioned above
but still provide server builders with a formal benchmark short of "full"
SGML.

The two examples that Martin mentions are near and dear to my heart. Declared
content is, unfortunately, essential since we use CDATA elements for our
equations. We use TeX as the markup language since the current set of
equation editors just makes it so easy for people to create an equation
and literally copy via the clipboard straight into the document. I feel
pretty safe with CDATA since the likelihood of finding "</" in the markup
is infinitessimally small. Safer methods would seriously affect the ease
of use.

TeX is just one example of a foreign notation that is useful to stick into
your SGML document. How about Java? I haven't (I'm pained to admit) looked
at any Java code yet, but I would guess that it would have some character
combinations in it that would be recognized as markup in PCDATA. It would
make it tougher on the authors to have to change all of these "problem"
combinations every time that wanted to include a chunk of code.

I'm not sure yet whether I like the idea of client/server XML. Just thought
I'd propose a "divide and conquer" option.
