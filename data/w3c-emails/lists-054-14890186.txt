Well, I mostly agree -- but I think the grammar should allow unquoted tokens
for values (which, as Martin pointed out, is technically part of SHORTTAG in
SGML).

Also, if we do end up providing some kind of partial DTD for dealing with EMPTY
and such, we could easily enough support attribute defaulting, which is the
other
part of SHORTTAG I think is useful on pragmatic (though not theoretical)
grounds.

All the rest of SHORTTAG can be lost: NET, <>, </>, <P<Q>, etc. Though of
course "</>" can be done without a DTD, and is not too hard to explain, so
I'd say it's the least objectionable of the remaining gadgets.
