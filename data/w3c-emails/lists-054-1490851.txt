Thanks for posting that, Jon -- It's very informative.
A couple of questions...

If matching entries are based only on ownr identifier, N2C would
need to have a list of every ISBN used in an FPI, with corresponding
URLs, and also every registered owner.  This isn't the same as every
ISBN ever issued, if you don't mind it failing on obscure ones that
the owner had not registered with the orgnisation running N2C.
Right?

So how big would a CATALOG be of every SGML or XML public identifier
ever issued at Sun?  Isn't this likely to be more than a kilobyte?
I see problems with performance here.

Zero. :-)   I wonder how many FPIs have been used so far?
A million?  Ten million?  That's a major management problem.

It needs to be a more hierarchical namespace, so that noone needs
to manage the whole list.  Or, better, charge $5,000 to register
an FPI, and store only the new ones.

If I am not mistaken (I might well be) I think that CATALOG is only
processed once -- the DELEGATE entry (Panorama actually uses the
keyword CATALOG for that) isn't read multiple times, so this
wouldn't work.

These schemes are interesting, and I think if the difficulty of a
previously flat namespace for informal public identifiers is
surmounted they can probably work.  I also think that it would be
well worth reopening the CATALOG spec (sorry, Paul!) to include
such information in it, once it is shown to be workable.
