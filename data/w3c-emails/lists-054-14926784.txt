That does not seem to me a good reason (other than leaving out quotes, which
is not an extension beyond SGML SHORTTAG). If attributes are typo-prone,
that seems a very good reason to *report the error*. A friendly application
also has good reason not to crash or terminate after reporting that error,
but that seems to me rather a different thing than ignoring the error; an
issue of error recovery rather than of syntactic correctness.
