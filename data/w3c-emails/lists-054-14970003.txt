From the postings on this subject so far it would seem that:

1) MS INCLUDE/IGNORE is useful in a DTD.

It helps tailor a DTD for different development tool quirks (and version
control, and other things). However, it requires a parser to keep a stack
because the MSs can be nested.

2)MS CDATA/RCDATA is useful in an instance.

It lets you imbed TeX directly, for example (]]> hardly ever occurs anywhere).
As Erik Naggum has pointed out, it is safer to use an MS for a special parsing
context because there is a visible label. For XML, there is the added advantage
that you don't need to parse the DTD, as you would for a CDATA or RCDATA element
type.

So, if the above are deemed valid requirements for XML, we can simplify the
implementation of MS as follows:

INCLUDE/IGNORE is allowed only in a DTD and may nest.

CDATA/RCDATA is allowed only in an instance and may not nest.

TEMP is allowed anywhere; it is just a comment (or disallow it and save an entry
in the keyword table).
