Marked sections in instances for conditional display have another
problem: parsers resolve them before any downstream processors see
the instance, so you can't let a user (who's viewing an SGML delivery
form) dynamically switch between two views because only one view is 
left.  This is precisely the reason why DocBook now has "effectivity"
attributes; element and attribute markup can definitely take up the 
slack here.
