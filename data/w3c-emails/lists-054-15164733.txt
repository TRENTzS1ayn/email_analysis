Since Michael and I think we are saying the same thing, and Paul is
a smart guy, but we're not making him happy, Paul is probably correct that
the problem due to a different set of base assumptions.

Let's see:

 o I believe that a useful XML editor will require access to FULL MARKUP 
   DECLARATION - i.e. the functional equivalent of an SGML Decl & DTD.  This 
   point is open to argument, particularly given that commercial SGML editors 
   will let you edit with validation off, but I still believe it.

 o I expect that XML will come with a well-defined way to provide a
   Full Markup Declaration.

 o I believe that there are many things you can do with structured
   text that do not require Full Markup Declaration (search, display, 
   analyze).  We want you to be able to do those things in XML without
   having a Full Markup Declaration at hand.

I think that's all... does that address (at least part of) your issue, Paul?
