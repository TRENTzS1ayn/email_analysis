No, not really. As one who has tried to explain this intricacy many times
on comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html, I will rather immodestly claim to
know the *real* problem. Essentially, <OL compact="compact"> is a kludge.

SGML lacks the "boolean" datatype.

A boolean defaulted to false (by absence) is the concept many learners
*naturally* associate with this form of minimization. I'll also add that
no popular HTML browser actually groks the minimization concept: all of
them barf on things like <P center>, i.e. minimization applied to name 
token groups with more than one member. Judging from the source code I've
seen (and some that I've written myself) HTML browsers actually treat
things like ISMAP etc as boolean attribute names, i.e. a parse like this

%%
attlist :
        | attlist attr
        ;
attr    : NAME
        | NAME EQ VALUE
        ; 
%%

Allowing boolean attributes "solves" the practical problem, IMHO. And
anyone who says it will complicate parsing shouldn't write a parser:-)
