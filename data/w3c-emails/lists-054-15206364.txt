I'm not presently taking sides on this issue, but I do want to answer Tim's
question. Yes, you can have 0xfffe at the front of the *file*, but not in an
SGML *entity*. (Remember, an entity needn't be the only thing in its storage
object.) You could also, using the FSI mechanism,  define appropriate XML
encoding attribute(s) that would allow the XML encoding choices (whether two or
many) to be specified for any storage manager.
