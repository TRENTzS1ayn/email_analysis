Well, that would be the ideal, but this fallback to the big catalog in
the sky should be regarded as a "best effort", not a guarantee.
For one thing, there will be a large set of resources identified by an
FPI that do not have a URL.

Right. You don't want to do this sort of thing for on-the-fly
rendering of pages. You want to use local catalogs for that.
This sort of thing is only for when you have an FPI that
can't be resolved by way of the local catalog, and you are
willing to wait in the hope of getting the resource.

That can be accomodated pretty easily. bigcat.sgmlopen.org (or wherever
the "root" happens to be) could have a catalog with entries of the form:
DELEGATE -//U.S. Navy//CALS   http://www.navy.mil/foo/cals_catalog.socat
DELEGATE -//Sun Microsystems  http://www.sun.com/bar/suncat.socat
DELEGATE -//DOE//OSTI         http://www.osti.doe.gov/baz/ostifpis.socat

The root does not have to know ALL FPIs, it would need to know
of sites that make their catalogs available and the prefix that is
common to the entries in that catalog.

The US Navy might well want to split their CALS catalog into smaller
pieces, so it could have entries of the form
DELEGATE -//U.S. Navy//CALS//nuts-n-bolts
         http://www.navy.mil/stores/fasteners/nutscat.socat
DELEGATE -//U.S. Navy//CALS//paints-n-brushes
         http://www.navy.mil/stores/preservatives/paints.socat
etc.
Eventually one would stop being delegated to other catalogs and
would finally bottom out at a PUBLIC entry.
