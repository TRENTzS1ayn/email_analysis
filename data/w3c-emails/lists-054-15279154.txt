I didn't understand that, and I don't think that Clause #8 makes that clear.
Please consider this a request for an update to that document. I think that
it is an admirable goal, but as I said before, it looks like a lot of work.
Even the HTML spec references SGML, and HTML is a simple, fixed markup
language, not a meta-language (or "extensible markup language").
