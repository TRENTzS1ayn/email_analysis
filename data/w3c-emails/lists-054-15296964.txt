I have no problem with anything you say, Tim, and it addresses a lot of
what I'm thinking.  Except I'm not sure everyone agrees with you that
"a useful XML editor will require access to FULL MARKUP DECLARATION,"
and I'm still left with what might best be called "market positioning"
concerns as I mention in my response to Michael.
