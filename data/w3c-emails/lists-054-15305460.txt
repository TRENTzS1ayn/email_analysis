Paul, what is the difference between your first scenario and one in
*real SGML*
(gad, i disklike that phrase), in which an instance arrives with or
without 
a DTD, the author opens it in a text editor, makes non-conforming 
changes, then returns it without parsing it?  IOW, isn't that a 
process glitch and is actually the common case?  It is why we teach 
them to ensure two transmission sites are using the same version of 
a DTD.  SGML gets a black eye in this case only if the users aren't
really analysing the problem.

The case is different if XML explicitly allows dynamic instancing of new 
declarations in the presense of a DTD sent by the original author.  In 
that case, the user MUST return the modified DTD and notify the receiver 
that it has been modified if that modification requires adjustment of 
any device (database, filter, etc) that processes the information.
XML gets a black eye if the XML vendor doesn't tell the customer what
the consequences of using the dynamic features can be.  In that case, 
yes, it is a marketing/training problem.

Am I understanding you correctly?
