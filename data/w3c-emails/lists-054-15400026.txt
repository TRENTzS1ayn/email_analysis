Your "mixed content" paragraph is easily represented by using explicit
sub-paragraph elements (or, as HyTime calls them, "pseudo-elements"), viz:

<!element p - - (pe | a)+>
<!element  (pe | a) - - (#pcdata)>
...

<p><pe>Now is the </pe>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">time</a>
<pe> for all ...</pe></p>

I understand how RS and RE characters can be excluded from XML. What I don't
understand is whether, under those circumstances the following two cases will
cause identical data to be passed to the application.  If not, what data
character codes are passed to the application in each case?

Case 1:

<p>
Text of p.
</p>

Case 2:

<p>Text of p.</p>

With the "no mixed content" rule, RS and RE could be confined to element content
(that is, between elements) where they would always be ignored; they would never
occur in data.
