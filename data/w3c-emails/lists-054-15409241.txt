Sorry for the duplication for those of you who've read it elsewhere.)

We don't need to declare EMPTY elements. We can just declare (#pcdata) and use
explicit end-tags in the instance. We lose the ability to validate emptiness,
but that is minor compared to the benefit of simplifying DTD-less instance
parsing without introducing syntactic constructs that would be unfamiliar to
HTML users.
