I'm not sure I'm following all the intricacies of this discussion at 
this point, but I do think that compact=compact is a bit of a
strawman.  In this instance, the DTD was designed to optimize manual
input by taking advantage of (abusing? getting cute with?) one small 
corner of SGML.  A more self-explanatory and convenient design would 
have been something like spacing={"compact"|"normal"}.

And I agree it would be great to have a Boolean declared value for 
attributes, but this still doesn't get around cases like 
style={"compact"|"normal"|"wide"}.

I don't think it's stupid or counterintuitive to start requiring that
all "parameter values" (which is how most people understand attribute
values) be passed, in quotes, along with the "parameter name" that
they apply to, especially since attribute specifications aren't
position-sensitive.  It's straightforward and consistent to require
name="value".
