Well, this message beat mine into the hopper by about a minute, so you've
answered most of my questions. I'm a little curious about one thing:

   DELEGATE -//U.S. Navy//CALS   http://www.navy.mil/foo/cals_catalog.socat

Why isn't the second field quoted? Because whitespace is allowed in FPIs,
this seems to be a necessity.
