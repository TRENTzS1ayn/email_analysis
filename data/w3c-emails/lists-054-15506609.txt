... other good stuff

Your point about "if it just reads ASCII, it's not really XML" is well-taken; 
but setting the bar at a point which includes 8859 *and* UTF *and* UCS for 
basic  acceptance is I think serious infringement on our design goal #4 that 
says XML shall be easy to program.  Also, including 8859 but not JIS is
disturbingly Eurocentric.

Are there grounds for compromise between minimalism and eclecticism by saying
that (a) here are a list of encodings which should be supported, (b) entities
have to self-label with leading PI's, and (c) all XML implementations *must*
be able to read UTF8 as well as generate it? 

Second, might it be clever, for UTF8-encoded entities, to relax the requirement 
that all XML entities self-label ?  Not that UTF8 is morally superior or 
anything, but this would have the desirable side-effect of turning a large 
proportion of the SGML objects in the world into XML.
