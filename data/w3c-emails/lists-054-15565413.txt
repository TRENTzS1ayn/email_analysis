I have no problem with a canonical form, so long as it doesn't stop
people using other forms.

This would necessarily take 2 passes for validation:

Pass 1:
  Resolve entity references etc. convert to UTF-8, generate document.

Pass 2: 
  Parse document, generate document, compare results.

Though things like empty elements and RE/RS complicate this no end.
