This seems to represent a third requirement for XML's i18n support; is
that a plausible interpretation?  (The first two I see are 1 handling a
suitably large character repertoire, 2 allowing non-Ascii characters in
names.)  Is the requirement met by ensuring XML DTDs have a well-known
method for indicating language (and geographic language variant?) in
content, or will more information be needed than is carried by a LANG
attribute of the sort we know from TEI, from DocBook, or from the HTML
i18n proposals?

A fourth requirement?  Or should this be outside the scope of XML?
