I agree, but it is a problem which will not be solved by saying "all
XML documents *must* be in either UTF-8 or UTF-16". Such a statement
*will* be ignored.

This is precisely why I don't think it's such a big deal. If you send
notification to the server that you can only accept UTF-8, ASCII, or
Latin 1, and the server send you a SJIS document, the server is
broken. It should either convert the doducment to UTF-8 before sending
it to you, *or* send an error message.

  NOTE 1: In the future, language like JAVA will also give applicatons
          the option of downloading translators.
  NOTE 2: One of the primary reasons for requiring a single document
          character set is precisely such cases: the server can
          *blindly* (ie. without parsing) convert the XML data, which
          can be made *fast*.

I guess you can actually remember me arguing the hard minimalist path
some time ago... as weel as arguing for support for the TEI subset ;-)
