This is a hack, and doesn't help with *initial* parsing of the
document.

Autodetection also fails very quickly when faces with a number of
multibyte encodings. 

The only *correct* way to indicate the encoding (or BCTF) of a
document is to do so external to the document. To me, this means FSI's
*or* MIME labelling (the *.mim file format).

So far, all of the proposal I have seen could be easily handled by the
*.mim file format, in which case, no parser trickery is needed: the
storage manager would always unambiguously know what the encoding is.
