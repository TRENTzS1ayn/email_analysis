Is this a problem?  It's certainly easy to explain.

With the proper SGML declaration, they will also parse differently in SGML.

The SGML setup makes it easy to set markup apart with whitespace, making
it easily visually distinguishable.  This is good.  The price is that it
becomes difficult for ordinary people to tell when some white space is
actually data.  This is bad.  The trade-off is probably reasonable, but
XML need not choose the same trade-off.
