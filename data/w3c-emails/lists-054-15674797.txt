Yes, but I am not proposing that: the only thing autodetected is
whether the encoding is definitely 16-bit or not, for which you only
need to look at the first two octets (i.e. if one is zero valued).

(This is in context of a proposal I am putting forward: "baby SGML",
which is probably the most minimalising of the proposals. I 
think it is available on  http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/baby/,
and takes the tack "if we add constraints and rules to SGML generators, can
we make produce something that is easy to parse without a DTD?"  )
