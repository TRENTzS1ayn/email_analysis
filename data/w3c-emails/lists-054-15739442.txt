They may, though I haven't seen that prescribed for us anywhere.

The possible need for a new attribute type (declared value) with a
particular meaning, and the possible need for a new defaulting
mechanism, on the other hand, are clearly within the scope of this WG.

It seems to me that a new declared value for language/locale flags and a
new keyword for attribute-value inheritance from enclosing elements may
be worthwhile, even without reference to Asian languages.  If such an
attribute type also makes it feasible to handle the problems Rick
Jelliffe referred to, then all the more reason to provide one.
