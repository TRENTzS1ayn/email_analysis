I think it is a problem. It will mean that anyone creating XML with any of the
popular non-XML/SGML-aware editors will have to be told why he can't put tags on
a separate line from data. If XML allows PIs, you will also have to explain why
a PI can't be on a line by itself. (And so on for marked sections and inclusions
and comment declarations.)

You will still wind up trying to explain the equivalent of SGML's RE/RS handling
rules, but with the additional burden of forcing the user to implement the rules
himself.

The _only_ way to kill this pernicious beast is to eliminate mixed content,
which XML can easily live without.
