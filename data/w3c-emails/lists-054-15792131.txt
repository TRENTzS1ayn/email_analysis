Thanks Gavin. That's what I feared, so eliminating RE and RS characters doesn't
really solve the problem. Making it an "application convention" to strip some
whitespace just shifts the burden from a few parsers to all applications and
increases the chance of inconsistent treatment.  Better, I think, to eliminate
mixed content altogether as James Clark has proposed.
