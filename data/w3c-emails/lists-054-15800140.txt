ESIS takes pains to not distinguish empty elements from others. It signals the
start and end of every element whether or not it is empty. And if it is empty,
"ESIS does not indicate why it was empty; that is, whether it was declared to be
empty, or whether an explicit content reference occurred, or whether it just
happened to contain no data characters."

That is why we can safely eliminate declared content, including declared EMPTY
element types. In all cases, there is an equivalent valid SGML DTD for which
there is a document instance that yields the same ESIS. This is as close to a
round trip as you can hope to get when going from a rich representation to a
poorer one. You'll need a trivial transformation when generating the XML and
when getting it back, but there is no loss of ESIS information.

Best regards,
