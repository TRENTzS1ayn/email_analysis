That analysis is correct, but it would in my view none-the-less be a
mistake to go down that road.  It would grandfather out a huge
percentage of existing documents, and require huge amounts of
obfuscatory markup, e.g.

<p><vc>The</vc><ship>Gretel</ship><vc>lost to</vc><ship>Constitution
</ship><vc>in</vc><date>1966</date><vc>.</vc></p>

[vc for 'vanilla content']

Or are you assuming we are allowing tag minimisation after all?  I
thought it was out the door . . .
