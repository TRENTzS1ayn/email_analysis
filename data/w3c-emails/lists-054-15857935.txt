My pleasure ... now I'll try to show why that means that EMPTY is unnecessary.

He's tried to, but I think he is wrong.

I don't think so. The effective normalized (i.e., ESIS or semantic grove form)
of all empty elements, whether declared or spontaneously empty, is:
"<tag></tag>"
Therefore, a content model of (#PCDATA) is equivalent to a declared value of
EMPTY.
(There is a difference in validatability by an SGML parser, but that is not an
issue here ... and isn't much of an issue anywhere.)

Eliminating declared content (including EMPTY) and mixed content is all that is
needed to accomplish this goal. Translating from the SGML instance with declared
and mixed content to the XML without those things is trivial and is reversible
without information loss. The resulting XML can be parsed (but not validated, of
course) without reference to a DTD.

This solution does not in any way dictate the syntax of XML DTDs. What it does
do  is remove the need for new markup conventions or syntax in XML instances, or
the need to require XML applications to enforce conventions for RE handling.

This solution also has the significant advantage, described by Paul Grosso, in
that existing SGML tools could easily create and receive XML documents, and that
essentially all existing document types could easily be used for XML.

And yes, Eve, I think you are right in thinking this technique would work for
RANK, and possibly even DATATAG as well.

Best regards,

Charles
