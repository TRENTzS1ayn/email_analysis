The set of documents I would like to see "grandfathered in" is that set
defined in (valid) HTML. If an XML browser cannot read that set of raw HTML
documents that are valid according to the 2.0 DTD (or later versions) then
it will not be of much practical use, and will be ignored by the majority of
potential users. (We would still have the problem of the 60% of invalid
documents, but hopefully this situation will get better once standard WP
tools start offering automatic conversion to HTML.)
