I just don't think this is practical.  HTML relies OMITTAG (notably
for P, LI, DT, DD).  I don't see how we can possibly achieve our ease
of implementation goals if we support OMITTAG in XML.

I don't need to use an XML browser to browse HTML; I've already got
plenty of HTML browsers that do that just fine.
