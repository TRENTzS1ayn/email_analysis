XML should be easy for the person who is creating as well as the person
who is writing the tool that is parsing it. It's a lot easier to remember:

    All attribute values in XML should be written as name="value"

than it is to learn/remember:

    If the attribute has a declared value of CDATA, or if you need to specify
    a whitespace delimited set of values, or ... then you must use ..

You get the picture.

When I'm typing SGML, like Len, I let my fingers do what they're used to
(not that I have any choice in the matter anyway) and put quotes around
attribute values. When I'm typing HTML, I'm irritated by the fact that I
don't feel completely comfortable when specifying attribute values 'cause
I'm never 100% confident as to whether or not I should use quotes. HTML
parsers are just too fragile.

I like the simple approach: simple to explain, simple to remember, simple to
type, and simple to parse.
