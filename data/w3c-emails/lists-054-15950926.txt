Correct.

Does SP allow this?

I have never heard that "lines" are equivalent to "records". Many OS's
do not have "records" at all.

Again, who says that lines and records are equivalent?

What do you do if you *do* want a linefeed to occur there? It's just
as easy to tell people "if you don't want a space, you must start up
hard against the tag":

  <P>This is a paragraph.

Does SGML actually say *newline* or record end?

I do not think this is true if you have a *conformant* SGML system
that can accept and correctly use a declaration similar to XML.
This is probably the fundamental problem: many SGML systems are not
conformant in this respect.
