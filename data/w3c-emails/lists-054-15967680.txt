Yes (at least in the multi-byte version).  Do any others?

My understanding is that the term "record" as used by SGML means the
same as "line", in the sense of input line.  It's called "record"
rather than "line" to distinguish it from line in the sense of a
formatted, output line.  See clause 4.252 of the standard.
