[Sorry that this is a few days behind. I've had my head in the sand for the
last few days trying to get some work out the door.]

Maybe, maybe not. I think it's an issue about a particular type of data.
Whether the language makes allowances for it or the tool provides a good
interface to the language to allow for it is the question. Since some
current tools don't provide a good interface to SGML for this type of
data, why should we expect anything different from XML tools? If you take
away my escape hatch, then I'm stuck.

I think it would be foolish to expect any qualitative improvements in XML
tools over what we have now. There are some good tools, but there are a lot
of really crummy ones.

Charles suggested retaining marked sections instead of declared content.
This would work, but it takes away the opportunity to attach a notation
to the data. Inconvenient, but it would be acceptable.
