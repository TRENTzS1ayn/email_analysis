All SGML systems understand how to parse PIs, and all SGML systems
rely on the SGML declaration (or a hard-coded character set) to
understand character encodings, so I think Rick is right; the
file can be valid SGML, period.  The SGML system does not need
any understanding of the hack.

Since tags are clearly metadata in the broad sense of the term, I think
this thesis will have a tough time commanding universal assent in a
group full of SGML partisans.  At least, I hope so.  I don't object to
external metadata, but it is remarkably fragile and it is remarkable how
easily it goes out of date.  Internal metadata is perceptibly less
fragile and goes out of date less easily, in my experience -- probably
because internal metadata is there when changes are made.  Humans are
less prone to forget it, and programs are less likely to be unable to
find it for updating.

The longer this discussion goes on, the more I am tempted to migrate
to the Hard Minimalist camp.
