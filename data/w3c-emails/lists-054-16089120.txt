This is actually *not* true. SGML systems *cannot* parse the PI
declaration until they know the coded character set and encoding in
effect. The coded character set will be fixed, but the encoding not
(even in the minimalist case). As such, only systems that can, in some
way, derive the encoding, parse the PI. Rick's proposal requires some
part of the system to sniff at the head of the file to figure out the
encoding.

One more reason why this idea is BAD (Broken As Designed): email
gateways and proxy servers *may* convert the encoding of the document
blindly. Most gateways and proxies understand MIME headers, but very
few understand how to parse, and rewrite the entity to correct the
encoding label on the PI.
