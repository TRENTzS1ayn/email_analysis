As James Clark pointed out in an earlier posting, eliminating mixed content is
the only way to avoid the whitespace treatment problem.

It doesn't have to be that way. With a few fixed shortrefs, it can be no worse
than some of the  proposals for enriching tag delimiters. For example, all of
the following three equivalent alternatives can trivially be produced from
instances of arbitrary DTDs and trivially transformed without loss between SGML
and XML.

<p>/This is the 1st pseudo-element /
/and this is another./</p> 

<p>"This is the 1st pseudo-element "
"and this is another."</p>

<p>[This is the 1st pseudo-element ]
[and this is another.]</p>

Unfortunately, the existing proposals for handling whitespace don't  work (see
earlier postings from myself and James Clark). There are only two solutions that
do:

1. RE/RS handling a la SGML (or, preferably, a la the proposals for SGML97,
which simplify things considerably); or

2. Explicit tagging of pseudo-elements (as you so nicely put it; this phrase
conveys the idea much better since we are not actually eliminating mixed content
structurally, we are just tagging the pseudo-elements).

Best regards,

Charles
