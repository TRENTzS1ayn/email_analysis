The supplemental CATALOG, being separate from the markup, is perfect for

I don't think this meets my requirement because of the implication of
location in the URN.

I use FPI's for entity identification and the CATALOG for entity
resolution.  I don't think my needs are met if both are tied up into a
single mechanism.  If I want to use a URN for resolution, I would map
the FPI to the URN in the CATALOG.  To some this seems redundant, but to
me "urn.mitra.org" isn't an identifier, its a location.

>For example, using PUBLIC "urn:urn.mitra.org//Liam
Quin//bailey.dtd;version=3.4":  How would I override an XML processor
from accessing "urn.mitra.org" to give me the entity when I would rather
use a local file? I want to override this without having to get into the
file with my clumsy fingers and risk "breaking" something while I'm in
the file.

Good reasons for me to not include the resolution aspects of any kind of
identifier in the XML specification.  We are defining a meta-language
for document markup that identifies information in a file.  I've always
viewed SGML (and XML) as passive, not active.  CATALOGs are active. 
FPI's are passive.  A local URL is, in my opinion, active.  SYSTEM
identifiers are active.  These two very separate problems need two
separate, distinct but related, solutions, not a single solution that
ties both important concepts inextricably.

The tutorial I've been getting in this maillist about global URLs and
URNs leaves me the impression that these are very "active" things that
"impose" implementation on me, when I'm only responsible for marking up
my information.  I am more than willing to give you supplemental
information to work with my markup, but I do not want to hardwire
environmental client-side-resolution issues in my markup.

Great flexibility!  Just think, I didn't have to change my markup to
point into my URN cache.

But it would be needed, because the next day I may not want my catalog
to point into my URN cache (or anybody else's URN cache, or somebody
else pointing into my URN cache (I might be sensitive about that!:{)).

In my opinion, these are solving two different problems, hence, no URN
scheme would successfully grandfather FPI's.

I want my FPI's to be absolutely permanent if I wish, so my sacrosanct
document remains inviolable, yet I have the flexibility to work with
that document in any environment I have now, or have to work in in the
future.
