As currently discussed it would not be possible with XML - this gives me a
problem.

Yes, but if its a choice between viewing a few documents on XML, a huge
number on HTML and even more on SGML I'm going to stick with HTML/SGML and
forget all about XML. Unless XML browsers can reference and display HTML
documents they are not going to form worthwhile information management
tools! What I want XML to do is to provide me with all the good stuff (and
none of the sloppy stuff) that HTML provides while allowing me to extend the
basic concepts beyond the limits currently set by W3C.
