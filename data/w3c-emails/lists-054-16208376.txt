I completely understand focusing the discussion on on thing at a time.  The
problem with this is that some decisions will have larger ramifications 
when we go to discuss the use of HyTime or DSSSL.  I would rather not
be in the position of saying: "Well, since we don't require a DTD, we
can't use HyTime" or whatever.

We have only talked (e-mailed?) about parsing documents without DTDs.  What
are the ramifications of using a document without having parsed against a
DTD?  What happens with HyTime?  DSSSL?  etc.

We want useable information to come in the form of XML.  Is structured 
information useful without knowing the structure?

BTW, if we have a date to end the current discussion, that means we have
some kind of schedule.  Where might I find that?
