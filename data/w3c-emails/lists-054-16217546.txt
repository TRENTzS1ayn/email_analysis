A simpler way is (if scanning can be done by a single DFA, and if end-tag
ommision & #CONREF are not allowed, etc.) to simply scan through for all
end-tags: if an element has an end-tag it can be added to the list of
non-empty elements. Then, the document can be parsed by a second pass with
this knowledge: no trees and reparenting, or "list of empty elements"
required.  (Whether this is a good method for the kind of tasks XML is 
intended is another matter.)
