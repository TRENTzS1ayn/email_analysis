One more point: even for gateways smart enough to rewrite the entity,
you then lose security because checksums etc. will fail.

The point is that in your scenario, the entity manager must be smart
enough to sniff at the data to figure out how to parse it. With
MIME-SGML, SGML across HTTP, and other such things, it seems to me
that most XML entity managers will be supporting MIME anyway...

No.
