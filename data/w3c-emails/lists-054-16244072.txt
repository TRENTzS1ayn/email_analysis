<SOAPBOX> <!-- sorry, but the details mean nothing without common goals -->

I have not had time to study all the issues that this argument impacts,
however, I believe that if the results of our efforts are only used by
large publishers/corporations we will have missed an opportunity to 
serve the greatest need.

When I look around at of the information trapped on the web in
presentational markup, aka HTML, I get depressed.  When written, most
authors are only responding to the pressure to get a page on the web
and viewable with the browser de-jour.  However, later I need to make
better use of that information and am unable to because of the complete 
lack of non-presentational semantics.  Please, XML must be able to 
improve the value of the millions of web pages.

Do we agree with this goal?
