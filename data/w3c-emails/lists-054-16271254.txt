Could you post a reference for (or even better, summary of) the SGML97 
proposals?; I would love nothing better than to dodge the RS/RE issue in XML 
in favor of a WG8-invented solution.  

Clearly, there is a near-consensus here that the SGML RS/RE rules are "too 
complicated" (the quotes signal my lack of interest in arguing about the 
correctness of this perception) for use in XML.

I at least am very very VERY reluctant to give up mixed content and PI's
to work around the RS/RE problem.  In fact, this is the one area where, in
order to produce something truly usable, some of us, I think, might be willing
to live with being non-ISO-8879-compliant (ideally only for a while).  

If it's clear which way WG8 is going to go on this, it would be very helpful
to know that.
