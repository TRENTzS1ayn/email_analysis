I'm off to Japan for a week, so if I'm silent around here, it doesn't indicate
a lack of interest - depends on how good the Net connectivity is.

Just wanted to take the opportunity to say that I have been been dazzled by
the quality of discussion around here - I have seen long-held positions, 
including some of mine, change 180 degrees - I think we've all had the unusual 
experience of continuing to disagree with people while keenly perceiving
the force and reason of their arguments.  I think there's a solid chance
here to make something that will outlive us all.  Which is damn rare in
the technology professions.

Cheers, Tim Bray
