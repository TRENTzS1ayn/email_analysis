That pushes up implementation complexity, because there are a bunch of extra
rules. It also forces anyone typing markup to remember to put *something*,
however small, around every pseudo-element, which I find prohibitively
burdensome.

They only "don't work" if we choose certain decision regarding the
ultra-fine details of what constitutes compatibility. As a proof-of-concept,
we could state a rule of XML that whitespace is normalized for data content
(that is, removed entirely at the beginning and end of elements and
pseudo-elements, and normalize to a single space elsewhere). One can
certainly state the same rule as an application convention applicable to
certain SGML documents that choose to use it. Yes, the ESIS is a tiny bit
different, but it has no processing consequences because we state that the
semantics of XML documents prohibit doing any different processing based on
that tiny different.

Also, ESIS is not carved in stone here; we've said from the beginning that
we may have to add or subtract from ESIS slightly to get the level of
abstractness we desire, and on which we will define equivalence. Likewise,
we can keep mixed content but constrain it in some way so the problems don't
arise (the most obvious being to prohibit things like non-|* models, etc).
