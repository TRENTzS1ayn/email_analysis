This is my point. You *cannot* read the entity in unless you know the
coded character set and encoding. The entity manager therefore must
either understand the PI hack, or some other external mechanism (FSI,
MIME, etc). If the entity manager doesn't understand the PI hack, then
what's the point of having it?

I don't see the point in duplication. One way or another, you either
use the PI hack alone, or together with some other external labelling
method. In the latter case, the external labelling method alone
suffices.
