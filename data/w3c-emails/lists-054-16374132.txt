Oops, I screwed up on my blanket endorsement of Charles's statement.

First of all, I was speaking for myself that time, not ex cathedra.  I
will try to make this distinction clearer in future postings.  Second,
I was flat wrong in seeming to endorse the position that XML documents
should be optimized for size.  When I think of SGML on the Web, I
think in terms of fragments served out according to SGML Open TR9601,
and I assume that the server is smart enough to deliver appropriately
sized chunks.  Bob's initial impression was the correct one.  As our
discussion of end-tag omission makes clear, size optimization is *not*
a priority for XML.

Unless I speak directly for the ERB or am acting in an administrative
role with regard to the list, please don't take any statements of mine
as authoritative.  For our current position, refer to the statement of
principles.

Jon
