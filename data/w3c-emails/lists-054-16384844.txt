That may be biting off more than we wish to chew...

HTML 2.0 makes liberal use of end-tag omission, a couple cases
of start-tag omission, contains elements with CDATA, RCDATA, and
EMPTY declared content, uses inclusion exceptions, and encourages
omitted attribute name minimization.  It does disallow most other forms
of SHORTTAG minimization by application convention, and in "Strict"
or "Recommended" mode HTML 2.0 does not use CDATA or RCDATA declared 
content (though HTML 3.2 does), but still...

(FWIW, I agree with you that XML should be able to handle HTML --
not necessarily HTML 2.0, but possibly a similar, slightly stricter DTD --
but the general consensus seems to be that the cost of supporting
the necessary features is too high.)

More like 96% invalid from what I've seen...
