Ken Holman was confused by my example -- which wasn't clear to those who
have not followed URNs at all, I agree.  Sorry.  He said:

There is no implication of location in the URN.  That's why it's a URN.
The "urn.mitra.org" mentioned here is not a host, and is not contacted,
and is not the location of the resource.

It's a URN.

N.

not L.

If it is easier to understand, imagine, if you will, that I am asking
for a slightly different syntax for FPIs, with a hierarchy of organisations
who can allocate naming authority prefixes.
+//NA:US:CA:SUN:SUNSOFT:DIVDOC//DTD XXX YYY//EN
for example.

This would be easier to arrange for automatic resolution, easier
to administer and more robust.  Or so it seems to me.

Ignoring the misunderstanding about the domain name....
This is a real issue.  A lookaside cache can be called CATALOG if it
makes people happy, but that is all it is; you can have a cache for anything.

So you need a tool.

If we don't believe they will work, WE MUST NOT RELY ON THEM, and
cannot use them in the spec.  Period.  No hand waving.  No ``we left
that out of the spec hoping no-one would notice our whole plan was
built on a false premise' :-)

I don't follow this -- we are discussing the underpinnings of a
hyperlinking mechanism.  Whether you believe hyperlinking to be
grammatically male or female, active or passive, it still has to be
specified.  XML is not the same as SGML.  This sounds supiciously like
Conformance to Folklore to me.  Where in ISO 8879 are these active/passive
terms defined?  Where does this rule come from"

I am not sure if this is cynicism or genuine (sorry).

I _really_ don't understand that.  If you dont want to use the copy
of an FPI's text that's in your CATALOG, you know what to do about
it.  All I did was change the names, not the mechanism: it's still
an SGML OPEN CATALOG.

You can't have that.  You will already have to change your environment
to work with XML.

If FPIs are "grandfathered" as has been discussed, they become URNs.
Every FPI is then automatically and henceforward a URN.

So there is no point in saying that you want FPIs and not URNs,
because you can't have that.

If it is easier to understand, imagine, if you will, that I am asking
for a slightly different syntax for FPIs, with a hierarchy of organisations
who can allocate naming authority prefixes.
+//NA:US:CA:SUN:SUNSOFT//DTD XXX//EN
for example.

This would be easier to arrange for automatic resolution, easier
to administer and more robust.  Or so it seems to me.
