It seems like the two Pauls are agreeing that 

1. XML has to be easy for SGML editors (and word-processor add-ons) to generate
and for  arbitrary browsers to read. We needn't worry about XML-only editors or
dedicated XML browsers because there won't be any. 

2. The browsers need to be able to work without accessing a DTD.

Is that correct?
