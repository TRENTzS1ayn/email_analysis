    <p>Listen to my heart beat.
    <?DIRECTOR: audio on>
    And beat and beat and beat.</p>

If the required form of this in XML were either

<p>Listen to my heart beat.<?DIRECTOR: audio on>
And beat and beat and beat.</p>

or

<p>Listen to my heart beat.
<?DIRECTOR: audio on>And beat and beat and beat.</p>

then both SGML and XML would parse the document in the same way, no?
