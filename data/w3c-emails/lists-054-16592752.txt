I'm still holding out for

2'. The browsers (not the editors) need to be able to work without
accessing a full DTD.  Absence of optional information about content
model type implies absence of empty elements and uniform treatment of
whitespace.  Absence of optional information about attributes implies
no CONREFs or implicit defaults.

Servers which provide such information and clients who use it are
strongly preferred.  Servers which intentionally serve documents WITH
e.g. empty elements or absent default attributes WITHOUT the necessary
relevant information, and clients which do the wrong thing (as opposed
to politely declining to play) when BOTH ARE present, are strictly
non-conforming.
