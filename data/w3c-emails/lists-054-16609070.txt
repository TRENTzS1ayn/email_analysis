Just as hardly anybody ever changes their delimiter characters in their SGML
declaration (though it might be convenient), I suspect nobody would change
this "linebreaks declaration". So the default must still be extremely well
chosen because only 1 in a 100 people would know or care that the default
could be changed and only a small percentage of those would bother to change it.

And if users don't change it, browser writers probably would not provide
support for changing it (just as many SGML tools do not allow you to change
your delimiter characters).
