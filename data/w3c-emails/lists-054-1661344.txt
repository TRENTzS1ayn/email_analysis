I thought that was what I was describing. That is certainly what I am
trying for.

I'll be happy to answer any questions I can on alternative URN schemes.

It is not necessary to download the whole catalog. If the client is
"URN-savvy" it can issue a request containing the FPI it is trying to
resolve and the server is supposed to send back a "tailored" catalog
that only contains matching entries.

The %!uri substitution thing was to offer the same benefits to non-URN
systems.

Sorry to be difficult here, but let me turn the question around. Do you
know of any naming approach that demonstrates the scalability you want?
If so, point me at it and we can see about how to make it a URN namespace.
