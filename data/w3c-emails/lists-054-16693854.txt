Oh, I don't doubt it and it couldn't be any other way - not everyone
can rewrite the Web everytime they need a slightly different document
- I was referring to the "worst case".  In fact, the Web is pretty
much an example of that (shared DTD and mostly tweaking of 1
[Mosaic/Netscape] stylesheet).  My point was that XML will not
automatically make SGML as simple as HTML for either the browser or
document writer.  There needs to be a compelling reason to develop a
new DTD/stylesheet, which doesn't exist for Joe Homepage, after which
easy distribution can enter the picture.  I think SGML will eventually
push aside HTML for most Net applications.

I don't speak for Disney, and this message was probably forged, anyway.
