This is already part of the FPI syntax (except that they use :: instead
of : to assign subauthorities). It is also problematic to base resolution on
naming authority in the long run -- as names are supposed to persist, but
the control of a name may change over time: There's a URN problem
that is equivalent to the URL hell cause by the move from CERN to W3C.

So we have the infrastructure you ask for in FPIs already.

well, robust over a 5-10 year period anyway.

If I can hand-edit it (maybe with a nice tool, of course) then it's more
than
a simple cache, which is restricted to monitoring what's happening. As an
aside,
we should consider a way to label an XML entitiy with its FPI: This would be
a
one-sentence change in the standard if we were using something extensible
like HTTP headers, rather than processing instructions. This way we can
_have_
a cache, if we want.

This is the URN problem, and as has been said over and over: if you have
a name, and the SYSTEM ID is broken, there is no way in hell you will _ever_
be able to guarantee that the name can be resolved. However, if you have a
broken SYSTEM ID, you can look to the name for help, and if you have a
broken
name, you can look to the SYSTEM ID for help. This is redundancy in the
reliable-
system sense (good), not the authorial sense (bad).

Since FPIs already have this, maybe we need a real objection. And please
remember that guaranteed resolution is impossible for any kind of name,
which does _NOT_ make names useless.

The reason I am now backing PUBLIC as opposed to URNs in SYSTEM
is that the fallback strategy I outlined is not possible if we have a
single ID that is only a URN, and no URL. You may think of the URL
as a kind of "hint" but it lets people use names (and SGML tools) now,
while still be compatible with the future. And if URNs eventually take
off, the PUBLIC ID may become a quaint relic -- but if it takes a while
they will be useful.
