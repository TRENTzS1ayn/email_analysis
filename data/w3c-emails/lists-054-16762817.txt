XML on its own does not solve the browser problem.  The browser
writers are still faced with the problem of style sheets.  The reason
there are so many cheap HTML browsers is because it is _very_ easy to
figure out how to display HTML (well, for the most part).  DSSSL may
solve the problem, but it solves it in a rather difficult to
understand and implement way.  XML will be an easy sell to browser
writers if it comes packaged with a useful but simple style-sheet
mechanism.  DSSSL might work, if someone would write a good book about
it, or at least about DSSSL online.  Maybe Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) is an easy (quick and dirty) answer; I have not had a chance to
look into it properly.  There was a great deal of discussion about why
CSS is too simplistic a month back on comp.text.sgml, but it may be
"good-enough" for a first run.  Every one here seems to want XML tools
today, but we don't even have a DSSSL capable browser now, how many
months after the standard's publication?

I do not mean to cut down DSSSL.  DSSSL looks to me to be a great
possiblity, for the future.  A XML/DSSSL browser will not be able to
compete with a HTML browser in today's market though.  It will look too
slow.  It will definitely have a market, but it will lack a real
mass-market appeal.  (But boy would I kill for a good, extensible
DSSSL browser to play with... with some work on on-line display
extensions to the standard, you could use SGML/DSSSL to do everything that
HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, etc are _trying_ to do now.  Now that
would be fun.)

XML is one important part of the picture, and although DSSSL is one
way to help fill in the whole picture, I don't see it as being an
immediate answer.  No, I don't have any better ideas, and I would love
to be proved wrong. (This is one of those rare cases where I _want_ to
be wrong.)

-enjoy,
