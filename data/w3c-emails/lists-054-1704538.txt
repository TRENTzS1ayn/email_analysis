By saying "can simply use system IDs" are you implying that you would
always have a system ID even if you also had a public identifier?  I'm not
sure I'd want to require a system ID in all cases.

But of course nothing can guarantee the ability to find a thing in the
general case (i.e., a open system, e.g., the Web).
