I think that any document that is published on the Web should have system
IDs for all entities. That could be in an SGML Open Catalog if we make SOCAT
handling a mandatory default resolution mechanism, or inline, if we do not.
Lee is right to complain that there must be a URL somewhere, or else we are
just handwaving.

Within an "internal system", where a resolution mechanism is well defined, 
URLs may not be useful. I am not sure if there is a clear line between 
"published on the web" and used in an "internal system", but perhaps authors
should make that decision. If they want everyone to be able to read their 
documents, they must put URLs where the user agents know how to find them:
inline or in some widely-implemented catalog mechanism.
