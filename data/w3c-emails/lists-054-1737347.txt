What about for data content notations?  As many notations don't have
publicly accessible definition documents (which is what the external
identifier of a notation is supposed to refer to first and foremost), it's
seems unreasonable to require URLs for them.  (If this issue's already been
discussed, let me know--I haven't had time to go back and read all the
traffic since SGML '96.)
