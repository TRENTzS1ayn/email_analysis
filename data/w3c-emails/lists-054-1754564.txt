  I also agree with this. It's best to have a name and a location than one
only of each...

   We've been discussing entities, levaing NOTATION to the side for the
moment. On NOTATION, I think we need to be careful -- Wherever possible, we
should use MIME-types in harmony with the rest of the net -- whether we
also want to support FPIs on the same optional basis as we should for
documents is an open question. Their real use, it seems to me, would be for
private types, and since we have the x- mime types (though their use is
discouraged officially, I think) we may not even need them for that.

   For notation, I don't know that we need FPIs because that SYTEM ID (if a
MIME type) is already globally-unique and persistent, with a well-defined
naming authority: IANA.

   I think it would be a compatibility issue, more than anything. My
impression is that public notations are not very common, but I could be
wrong.
