I joined this list only recently and was not part of the original
discussion of SDATA. But wading in now, I do not see any significant
disadvantages to David's proposal, let alone any that would outweigh the
obvious advantages. Can someone fill me in on the arguments for the other

reexamined? 

Thanks,
