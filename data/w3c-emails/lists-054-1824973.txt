I believe our original reasoning against SDATA was as follows:

1. The mechanism for mapping SDATA replacement text to
characters/glyphs/whatever was not defined or definable.  This makes SDATA
entities inherently uninterchangable.
2. You could do everything you needed to do with SDATA by using CDATA
entities with 10646 character references (but this appears to not be true).
3. Leaving SDATA out significantly simplified the spec, putting it in
significantly complicated it.  Simple wins, as a rule.

Cheers,

E.
