| I joined this list only recently and was not part of the original
| discussion of SDATA. But wading in now, I do not see any significant
| disadvantages to David's proposal, let alone any that would outweigh the
| obvious advantages. Can someone fill me in on the arguments for the other
| side? And is there any procedural reason why this issue should not be
| reexamined? 

The technical intricacies are over my head, but the procedural
situation is pretty simple: the ERB examined this subject in great
detail and came to the conclusion that the SDATA mechanism as it
stands in 8879 is not specified well enough to be usable and that we
are not the right group to provide an optimum replacement.  Our plan
is to include SDATA on a list of items that we urgently wish ISO to
consider and to include it in XML when ISO has fixed it.
