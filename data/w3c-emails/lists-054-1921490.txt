I was referring to official disclosure of the ERB discussion: We do not see
ERB discussions except as they are revealed to us: and the original ERB
decision was taken before the long WG debate you refer to. There may have
been a brief post about a revisiting of the issue in the ERB: and it may
have been revisited, but this was not clearly apparent to me. I do
occasionally delete messages, so I may have lost one, though I generally
keep all the ERB decision notes.

   Certainly the discuussion was not invisible to me, just whether there
was a revisiting of the issue in the ERB, and the final rationale for the
ERB decision after that process. If I have missed something, I apologize,
and I tried in my initial note to leave that possiblity open -- with 1623
messages in my current file, missing, misrembering, or failing to find one
in a search is a constant possibility.

I'm not worried about Michael per-se: some people prefer uninterpreted
numbers to uninterpreted namespaces. Tim's posting did clearly lay out the
rationale for the ERB decision (as the rationale for the ERB decision):
whether this was the original discussion or a revisiting, post-WG brouhaha,
I do not know. If it was post-brouhaha then I submit my rebuttal, but I
will sit down and shut up. If that was the original decision, and it was
not revisited, I ask that it be re-examined. I'm sorry for not being
clearer about what I was asking in my first post.

Yes, but unknown characters labelled with strings may be user-intervenable,
even without a private arrangement between author and reader: a very common
case on the Web. Private use characters can _never_ work without an
explicit agreement between author and reader. I think this is not a new
argument, but it still seems knock-down/drag-out to me. One works better,
and the syntactic cost is almost, but not quite, nil.

Special pleading is a kind of loaded term. I'm arguing that we lay a
foundation for the general solution to be built, in the way that is most
compatible with SGML practice (and to some extent HTML practice, in that
people expect that "funny characters" are represetned by strings starting
with an ampersand). Certainly some method of associating string data with
undefined characters must be part of any real solution: entities are the
logical kind of SGML construct to associate it with. We could decide that
much without having to develop the technology to run glyph registries right
now.

OK. I'm sitting down now.
