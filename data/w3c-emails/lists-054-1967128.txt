Fair enough.

Perhaps, but what he said is that it's ANSI's business, and the
existing Unicode spec does not inspire confidence that they consider
it so.

Okay.

Only if you have read the Unicode spec; the (ahem) naive reader of

Surely a list of what is deferred to future consideration is appropriate?
It's not properly time-dependent but version-dependent (except in
the sense that all things are time-dependent).  But so far as I
can see, this is the only point on which I'd like such a comment.

I'm tempted to ask, which private-use characters?  But won't.
