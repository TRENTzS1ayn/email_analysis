If you use the private use area, then either XML must prespecify the
abstract character represented by the encoding, which is impossible
by definition as I see it, or XML must make these non-SGML character
numbers, which means they cannot be in the document directly but only
via numeric character references, or XML must permit users to change
(extend) the document character set.

You pays your money and you takes your choice; I don't think you want
any of the three.  ;-|
