Some members of the list probably are not aware of the SPREAD
public entity sets, which provide a standard mecanism for encoding
ISO 10646 characters. I am just (now) finishing the Unicode 2.0 
version. The Unicode 1.1 version has been available for ten months.
This entity set is unusual in that it has been examined by
East Asian academics, standards and industry people, and endorsed
by the CJK DOCP, which has a liason to ISO WG8.

I hope that SPREAD, or a version of it, can be included in XML.

In order to make sure there is no confusion about what SPREAD actually
proposes as far as names and numbers, here are some excepts from the
entity set. The first is the hub entity: the SPREAD entities are split
into blocks, so that only those needed can be loaded. 

The identifiers of the entities use the (hex) code number of the Unicode 
2.0 set: anyone who has a Unicode 1.1, Unicode 2.0, ISO 10646 book, or
the
Unicode 2.0 CDROM (I think), can look up the characters. The SDATA value
of the entities usually is the ISO 10646 name, except for Han ideograms
and Hangul syllables, which just use the recommended Unicode short form.

Next, here is the SPREAD public entity set for Han ideograms. These have
no 
useful romanised names, so the SDATA value just copies their number.

<!-- 
  This public entity set has the ISO 9070 formal public identifier:
  -//SPREAD//ENTITIES ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 (HAN)//EN    
-->

<!-- 
  There are of course a large number of Han ideographs.
  So they are not all declared as entities here.
  Instead you can define what you need: use the following template
  and replace "xxxx" with the HEX number you need for the character:

 <!ENTITY Uxxxx SDATA "[U+xxxx]">

-->
<!--
  POSSIBLE FORMAT FOR ENTITIES FOR VARIANT HAN IDEOGRAPHS

  The Han ideographs in ISO/IEC 10646 have been unified. If you
  require particular variants, you may use the following convention:
  append the standard two or three digit country or language 
  code to the entity name.  

 <!ENTITY Uxxxxcc SDATA "[U+xxxx, cc]">

  For example:
 <!ENTITY U5B81JP SDATA "[U+5B81, JP]" -- Japanese variant -->

  Standard affixes include:
      JP    Japan
      KR    Korea
      CN    Simplified Chinese  (PRC)
      TW    Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
      HK    Hong Kong
      SG    Singaporean
      VT    Vietnamese

  If you define entities using this convention, please be careful
  to put them in their own entity set, so that they are not confused
  with the SPREAD entities proper.

Finally, here is are the SDATA entities for a block for which there
are sensible names.

I hope this clarifies exactly what the SPREAD entities provide,
and what XML should provide to support them. They should be 
used whenever using numeric character references (to the
presumed ISO 10646 character set) are not appropriate, I guess.

I hope SGML Open vendors will think about providing the SPREAD
entities as part of their product distribution support material.
In particular, they may provide a convenient way to make 8-bit products
useful to Asian and Middle Eastern markets.

Personally, I think there are great advantages of having the
SPREAD entities as a fallback mechanism. Not the least is that
the identifier only is five characters. And you don't need to
resort to hashing or multistage lookups to go from identifier
to Unicode value.
