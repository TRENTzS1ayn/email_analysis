Rick's comment reminds me that since we do not have SDATA we have a
few follow on work items:

   + add private use characters to data (Thanks Terry!)
   + document that the ISO public entity sets (and SPREAD) cannot be used with
XML, or redefine equivalent entitie sets using the proper combination of
Unicode defined and private-use characters.
   + Check the status of HTML entities. I think all the original HTML
use numeric character references and will work, right? What about the
new HTML 3.2 entities? Sorry, I don't have the reference handy.
