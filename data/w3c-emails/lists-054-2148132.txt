There's one complication to this.  If there's no DTD (quite possible),
AND no way in the instance (such as with an attribute value) to indicate 
which is element content and which is mixed content, AND no stylesheet 
semantic that allows this to be controlled, how can the application layer
decide?  I'm guessing that DSSSL expects a document to have gone through 
a classic SGML parser first, which means that element content will have 
internal whitespace stripped.  XML documents might not undergo any such
treatment.  Somehow, the element-vs.-mixed distinction needs to be made 
in cases where it's critical for rendering or other processing.  Where is
the right place to make the distinction, if there's no DTD?  Is is the
stylesheet?  If so, are there any technical barriers to doing this?
