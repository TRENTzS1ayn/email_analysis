XML systems will not "all" ignore it. Some XML systems will ignore it. Just
as some XML systems will ignore my organization's or application's
processing instructions. Nobody seems to have a problem with processing
instructions, so why are public identifiers any more or less
dangerous/mysterious/useless? For now, PUBLIC identifiers are "addressing
processing instructions." At some point in the future they will be
standardized, just as some processing instruction syntaxes are standardized
(e.g. <?XML ).

These hooks give us room to experiment in the present, and room to expand
the standard in the future.
