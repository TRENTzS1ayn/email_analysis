Is this not the same as the current specification?

"In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use "white space"
(spaces, tabs, and blank lines, denoted by the nonterminal S in this
specification) to set apart the markup for greater readability. Such white
space is typically not intended for inclusion in the delivered version of
the document. On the other hand, "significant" white space that must be
retained in the delivered version is common; for example in poetry or source
code.

In element content, all white space (S) is ignored; validating XML
processors must not pass it to the application. Non-validating processors
which do not read the DTD must treat all elements as if they were declared
with mixed content; this will in some cases result in a different parse tree
from that produced by processors which do read the DTD."
