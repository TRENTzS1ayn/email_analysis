Can the allegedly technically competent participants in this forum
please stop what they are doing RIGHT NOW and review their mailer
documentation in order to figure out how to reply to the group,
just the group, not the group and the 3 or 4 other participants in
the current thread!?!?  This weather is heavy enough without getting
multiple copies of everything.  Thanks thanks thanks. -T.
