[Chris Maden:]

| If one is authoring XML and expecting that HTML browsers may be used
| with it, one should use a tagset that is a superset of HTML.

The name "HTXML" has been suggested for this (I can't remember by whom
now).  It's been suggested that the definition of an HTXML might be
useful somehow in helping people to get past the kind of transitional
situations that Murray has described.
