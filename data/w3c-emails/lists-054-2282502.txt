Using a MIME media type as a system identifier.

I think this is very sensible, although I would urge a list:
    <!NOTATION Graphic SYSTEM "image/jpeg,image/gif,image/png">

This would allow for content negotiation in an interesting and clean way.
It would mean
    I like jpeg no less than gif (and maybe a lot more)
    and I like gif no less than I like png,
    so send me the image in the first matching format in this
    list that you can, please.

Eliot mentioned that FPIs are used in Architectures (presumably
in the HyTime TC, which I think is not yet generally available); I
should point out that it may very well be necessary to use an entirely
different mechanism for architectures in XML, not just because FPIs
might not have the same semantics, but very possibly for other reasons
(e.g. no FIXED attributes), but that I don't think that matters very much.

I haven't comented on Eliot's other points, which are very sensible.
