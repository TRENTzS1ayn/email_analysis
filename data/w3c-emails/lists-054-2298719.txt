If you define comment as:

>    [92] comment = como, SGML character*, comc
>
>    <add>
>    [92a] simple comment declaration =
>                     mdo, com, SGML character*, com, mdc
>    </add>

you cannot say
>
>    No markup is recognized in a comment, other than the com
>    delimiter that terminates it.

You must change com to comc, or retain com in place of como and comc.
(I'm not clear that como and comc buy you enough to invent two more
delimiters, with their associated parsing contexts)

The following note does not make sense if you use como and comc to delimit
comments:
 
>    1. A com delimiter not followed by an mdc delimiter will be
>    recognized in a comment (in a comment declaration or other
>    declaration) but not in a simple comment declaration.

Then there is option B!

Why go to all this fuss: simply change com in XML to "*--" or, better still
"**", and then -- becomes legal!

How does this approach restrict XML to a single comment?

So now I can mix text with comments e.g.
<!*-- Here is a --comment-- with *-- and --* --embedded-- within it --*>
How very clever!

And won't work as it fails to make -- legal, which seemed to be the whole
point of this useless exercise.!
