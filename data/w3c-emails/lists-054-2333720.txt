The ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 18/WG 8 project 15.07.02.09.00 is creating ISO
TR9573 Part 9 regarding the use of FPI's for standardized notations.

.....

According to the draft of this technical report, the above example with
both PUBLIC and SYSTEM identifiers would be (long but meaningful and
derivable):

<!NOTATION JPEG     PUBLIC "ISO/IEC 10918:1993//NOTATION Digital
Compression and Coding 
of Continuous-tone Still Images (JPEG)//EN" "image/jpeg">

As I noted before (1996-12-02) there are embryonic efforts in SGML Open
to create a Technial Report for a method of specifying what to do in a
particular environment with notation data based on PUBLIC and SYSTEM
identifiers.  

It might be prudent to suggest the above method as an interim
interpretation until an XML revision can incorporate a meaningful subset
of the SGML Open TR.
