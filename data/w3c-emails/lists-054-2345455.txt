Since we made the broken decision on SYTEM IDs we should preserve the
brokenness on Notations -- FSI syntax should not be allowed one place and
not the other. I think this good idea should be deep-sixed for
compatibility with other SYSTEM IDs.

I could live with this, but given the extensibility of mime-types (the "x-"
prefix), and the relative paucity of well-known PUBLIC notation names in
the SGML world, I'm inclined to drop PUBLIC identifiers altogether for
NOTATION.
