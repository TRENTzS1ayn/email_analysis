Since there will _never_ be a single resolution mechanism, this is not sensible.

This straw man has been burned repeatedly.

But we have seen that not _all_ systems will ignore it. Just the ones that
you write, I guess. That's OK.

CATALOG has default places to look that extend trivially to URLs and
relative URLs -- this is another straw man. It is common to defer complex
mechanisms one needs to protocols that provide those mechanisms -- And
commonplace for schedules to be less-than perfectly aligned in such
development. More straw.

There is no _single_ mechanism that can meet the need to have multiple
mechanisms. This point has been rather frequently repeated.

I can repeat my quote from the URN list yet again, but I will let you look
it up: (Hint: it's short and starts with  "Mechanism independent")
