yay!

They'll get over it. "Mechanism independent" means that a requirement of a
specific mechanism is not productive. We _should_ suggest URNs and SOCAT as
possibilities and leave it to the market.

2 key points:
   1. PUBLIC IDs, if resolvable by a parser, should take precedence over a
SYSTEM ID. This lets people who want to count on naming do so...
   2. SYSTEM IDs must be required. This means that there is always _one_
resolution mechanism that can be tried even if you do nothing with names.
People with internal use of PUBLIC and active opposition to SYSTEM can just
put in an empty string.

Given the state of implementation and acceptance it would be foolish.

Please, no!

Since a mandatory resolution mechanism is an anti-requirement, I think this
is a bad approach.

3b* please:
   We suggest the two most likely, allowing for doing nothing, and require
a SYSTEM ID for those who find it disturbing not being able to tell if you
can resolve a name or not.

  [ Note that this is the real difference between URL and URN resolution:
you can tell that a URL is broken at time T, by trying to fetch the
resource and seeing if you get it. Given a URN, you can _never_ tell if it
is really broken, or you are just trying to wrong mechanism to resolve the
URN. ]

I think 3c is actively unhelpful, as it removed one of the key kinds of
flexibility that make URNs/FPIs attractive to those who find them
attractive.

FPIs probably will become URNs, with some kind of prefix. URN syntax is
already divergent from FPI syntax (and in the initial characters, too).
Maybe we shoul follow Keith Corbett's excellent suggestions:
   + FORMAL NO
   + URN, FPI both legal (I would add 9070 Object identifiers too, but I'm
a weirdo).

Keith's comment sums it up nicely:

Tim, again:

Acceptable.

Wrong, because it eliminates one of the reasons to _use_ PUBLIC.

>Input, please.

more than you want, I'm sure. You're welcome.
