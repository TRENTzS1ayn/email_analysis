The only case I can think of is an application that uses
HyTime or HyTime-like addresses for hyperlinks.  In order
for treeloc, pathloc, and most of the relloc forms to work,
the application has to know whether a sequence of syntactic
whitespace should be counted as a pseudo-element node or ignored.

Note that TEI-style XPTRs do not have this problem, so they
could be used instead of the HyTime addressing forms.

Another possible solution is to specify that SSEP nodes are
included in the XML grove plan.  DTD-less parsers would create
PELEMENT nodes in a few places where DTD-aware ones would create
SSEP nodes, but at least they would still count the same number
of nodes.
