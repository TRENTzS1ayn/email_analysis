Well, both of the two existing DSSSL style sheets in the world :-) are
written for SGML DTDs that are not directly XML compatible, so that's
not a problem.

Furthermore, if you use DSSSL with an SGML parser, you'll get SGML
whitespace rules.  Since we haven't discussed the use of DSSSL with XML,
it could do anything it liked...

So this, although a good point, isn't an issue for XML.

Yes.  And that's fine.
