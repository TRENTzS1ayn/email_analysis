This is already a necessity.  The 8879 rules don't eliminate any
internal whitespace, and they don't eliminate all leading and trailing
whitespace.  If I have a DSSSL stylesheet on top of an 8879 parser, I
am going to have routines to strip and compress whitespace.  RE
delenda est does not introduce a new pain here.

(I wouldn't strip whitespace if I expected the element to be
preformatted, but in that case, I'd just as soon that the parser give
me *all* of my whitespace, not *most* of it.)

If every parser passed all the whitespace, then all parsers would give
the same parse tree.

As long as we have DTD-less parsing, this is the *only* option that
will give the same parse tree.  Without a DTD, everything must be
assumed to be mixed content, and with a DTD, any heuristic that
distinguishes between element and mixed content will result in a
different parse tree.
