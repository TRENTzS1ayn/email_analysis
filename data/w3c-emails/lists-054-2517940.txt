You're going to have to do this for XML regardless of what rules we
settle on, since you can't guarantee that the receiving user agent
will parse your DTD.

And without a DTD, everything is going to be #PCDATA.  Unless we add
new delimiters, which I think will be prohibitively confusing to new
users.

That's just gross.  I can easily think of documents that I would not
be able to edit in vi or in xedit due to line or record length
restrictions.
