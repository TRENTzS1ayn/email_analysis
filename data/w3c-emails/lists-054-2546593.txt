This is not really true: the rules to eliminate unwanted whitespace
would not be overly complex, and besides, if you are really so keen on
doing exactly the same thing as current SGML tools, you can either:
   a) Use them by using the declarations for XML
   b) Add a validator/grove transformer that *requires* a DTD, and
      which will give you what you want.

Sure, but this has it's own set of (large) usability problems as
people have pointed out.

The easiest thing: use LISP syntax.
