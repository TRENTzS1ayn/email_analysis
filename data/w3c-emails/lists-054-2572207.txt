I have a really simple idea: if you want to keep absolute 
SGML compatability *and* allow DTD-less parsing. Why not write
a filter that will rewrite your instances such that they produce
exactly the same parse tree in XML and SGML parsers? It'd probably
take less time to do than the time spent arguing....

Right, and this corresponds to my use of the term "parser", though it
might also be close to traditional "scanners" too. SGML is
interesting because it has a parser for it's input stream, and another
parser for the grammar defined by the DTD...
