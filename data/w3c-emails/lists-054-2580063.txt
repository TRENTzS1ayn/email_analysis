Really? I've never seen it explicitly stated that this is true. Given
that SGML is largely silent about error-handling, and grey on a lot of
other fronts, it seems like this would be difficult to achieve at
best.

I'll confess that I quite often do not use a DTD at all during
document creation, simply because I find that in my writing,
DTD's are a nuisance. I generally *do* go back and validate my
documents, however, and in later processing, ignore it again.

Depends. At least all the applications will know *exactly* what
they'll be handed.
