I support Jean's position, that we leave -XML-SPACE in, and either
cut it back to one value (COLLAPSE) or expand it to three values
(PRESERVE, COLLAPSE, REMOVE), but change its meaning so that it acts
as a signal from the processor to the application, but that the
processor *always* in all cases passes all the bytes through to
the app.

Cheers, Tim Bray
