I like Jean Pauli's proposal.

I have two suggestions.

(1)
the space at *3*4 in

<UL>*1*2<LI><PARA><B></B>*3*4<I></I></PARA><PRE>foo*5*6bar</PRE></LI></U

may be collapsed to a single space perhaps, but certainly must not be
deleted, as otherwise the Book title in the B and the Institution in the I
(guessing at the meanings of B and I) will run together!

(2) rather than using an attribute called -XML-SPACE, which looks odd and
    perhaps even ugly, it would be better to have a PI that says
    the attribute TYPE=LIT on the element SAMPLE
    has this meaning:
    <?XML SPACE PRESERVE SAMPLE TYPE="LIT">
    <?XML SPACE COLLAPSE * TYPE="NORMAL">
