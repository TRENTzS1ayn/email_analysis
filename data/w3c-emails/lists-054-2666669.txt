Please! No more processing instructions! We've reserved some namespace for
XML, so let's use it, not multiply PIs. It's bad enough that we've got one
in the header, instead of a reasonable syntax. (Did the ERB ever discuss
the HTTP header proposal, BTW?) For a feature intended for ugly formatting
hacks, PIs are awfully popular, even among the 8879 strict constructionists
on the list.
