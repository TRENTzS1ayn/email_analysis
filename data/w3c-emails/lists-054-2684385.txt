When I endorsed the 3-states proposal I unwittingly fell into agreement
with the current proposal on a point where I disagree strongly:
   Initial whitespace, and final whitespace should collapse to a single
space, not disappear altogether. This is the way HTML browsers currently
work (try it in <td> in Netscape, for instance).

   I know this makes it impossible to ignore any RE after a tag start, but
there was never an argument offered to support that behavior that did not
beg the conclusion.... and otherwise, the whitespace folding now has two
special cases, at the beginning and end of the string...
