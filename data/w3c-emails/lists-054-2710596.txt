Look, an  application *has* to cut lines where it can and if there is a
long stream of text, it is going to cut it.

this is the issue: anywhere inside a -xml-preserve, a white space is
significant so the application
is not allowed to change them for pretty printing or cutting lines (the
term significant has to be defined 
but the long stream of mail on this precise subject prove that at least
the concept is real).
any where else, the application could do whatever it decide.
