Leading whitespace (any space between a start tag and element content) in
lists and tables in MSIE, Netscape, etc. is always removed, at least as far
as any installation I've ever seen. Trailing whitespace is collapsed to a
single space in accord with RFC 1866, which makes no statement whatsoever
about leading whitespace.

Only the end. Try running this fragment through your HTML browser:

<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Cell one.</TD><TD>Cell two.</TABLE>
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD> Cell one. </TD><TD> Cell two.</TABLE>
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>     Cell one.    </TD><TD>    Cell two.</TABLE>
<TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>
     Cell one.    </TD><TD>
     Cell two.</TABLE>

You'll note that apart from the first table (which includes no leading or
trailing whitespace), the last three tables are identically formatted, with
no leading whitespace in any, and all trailing whitespace collapsed to a
single space.
