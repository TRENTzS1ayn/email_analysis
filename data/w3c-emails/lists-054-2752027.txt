As you all know, we are planning to roll out XML-with-hypertext at the
Sixth World Wide Web Conference in April.  The official introduction
will be a report in the W3C activity track of the conference, but some
of you might wish to submit papers to the technical track independent
of the W3C report.  For example, I'm planning to submit my paper on
XML applications.

The original deadline for submissions was today, but that has now been
moved back to noon California time on Monday (December 16).  Papers
can be changed after submission up until February 21, 1997.  The theme
of the conference is "accessibility", so papers that relate to that
have a better chance of being accepted.
