If they cannot handle PUBLIC right now, then SYSTEM should be used

to include SYSTEM.  What happens when people start to find URN
resolution services to be useful and reliable?  Do they then
have to include a bogus SYSTEM value just to conform?  (Today
I found this PUBLIC placeholder:  -//asdfasdf//asfdsf//EN.)

And I meant to reply to your point, but forgot.  

 - why is order significant to correct resolution?
 - why does the XML spec need to specify the order rather than
    the user's configuration file?
 - why shouldn't the user have the option of trying both, and
    doing something further if the two results don't match?
