Well, this is what I'm really interested in. It is clear to me that the
non-validating parsers' whitespace handling will not really be useful for
mission critical data handling. When I care, such as in authoring tools and
databases, I will have to ask my vendors to supply validating parsers. I
need to know how whitespace there will be handled.
