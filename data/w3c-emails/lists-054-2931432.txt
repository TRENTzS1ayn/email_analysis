[Dave Durand:]

| We need to use -XML- in front of all attribute values, unless we
| change our minds on the attribute-value restriction.

We're working to see whether ISO can be convinced to change this in
8879 (it's backward-compatible with existing SGML documents).

| We need to document that the ISO entity sets will not work with XML,
| as SDATA has been eliminated, and either develop replacements, or let
| people know that they will have to develop them themselves.

I'd like to consider this in the time following the April Phase II
deadline.
