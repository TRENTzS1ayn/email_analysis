While I'll admit to being somewhat inclined to use mdashes in my 
writing--and have occasionally been caught doing so in an SGML
comment declaration--I do not see the benefits of being able to
put "--" in a comment as being so great as to warrant doing something
that is either particular complicated or different from what SGML
parsers do today.  When people start getting too concerned about
what they can put into comments, they are probably putting too 
much into comments, and should probably consider creating elements
in their DTD to hold the supposed "comments."

I think each time we propose changing XML's syntax from that which
is the syntax of the SGML in common usage for the last 10 years, we
need to ask if the preceived benefits are worth it.  In this case,
I prefer to leave XML comments as defined in the XML draft.
