The result returned by the default construction-rule shall depend on the
type of node to which it is applied: 

? for a node with a char property, it shall return (make character).

We would have to change that to: "for a node with a char property, it shall
return (make character), if the node is not entirely composed of whitespace"
or "for a node with a char property, it shall rreturn (empty-sosofo)."

We're presuming that the input to the stylesheet engine is the output of a
parser that doesn't have a DTD. So it must presume that all content is mixed
content (or make guesses!).

To be clear, I am using the definition of mixed content on page 320 of the
SGML handbook, any mix of data characters, elements and "other stuff" (pis,
comments, etc.). If that's evil, then SGML lends itself to nefarious purposes...
