   8879 in that respect.  This gives maximum flexibility to the user.

   As far as precedence of the PUBLIC versus SYSTEM id when both are given,
   the SGML Open technical committee had long discussions on this topic

I seem to have opened an inadvertent can of worms here, sorry. It's
not even the precedence which concerns me, so much as making sure apps
try the other identifier if both are provided and one fails to
resolve. I know this is an app issue, but I do feel the spec should
make the point that this performance is expected (trying the other),
otherwise we risk misleading authors and users into believing that in
providing both identifiers they are somehow improving reliability.
