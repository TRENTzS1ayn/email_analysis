I think you are absolutely right, Peter. Providing both *should* improve
reliability. I would say that apps that don't try both are not doing the
Right Thing (no matter what the spec says), but maybe there are extenuating
circumstances. After all, isn't it the job of an app to use all of the
information at its disposal to try to solve the user's problems? If a line
in the spec can clarify this situation, then I certainly support it.

On the other hand, I'm surprised that Paul says that the ordering issue is
contentious. If the reader has overridden a public identifier, shouldn't
that always take precedence over the author's system id, from his machine??
What is the counter argument?
