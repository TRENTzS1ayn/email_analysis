[Paul Grosso:]

| If we have defined the concept of well-formed XML precisely so that we
| can deal with XML instances without DTDs, then I suggest we refine the
| definition of well-formedness to include what we might call
| "normalized whitespacing." An XML document is well-formed (and
| therefore can be properly processed without reference to a DTD) *only*
| if it contains no (non-markup) whitespace that would be insignificant
| if it were parsed with reference to its DTD.

I rather like this idea, but what do you mean by "its DTD"?  There are
an infinite number of candidates.
