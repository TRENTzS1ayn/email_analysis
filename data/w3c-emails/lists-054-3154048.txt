[Chris Maden:]

| 3) A dichotomy between "DTD-ful" and DTD-less parsing will make any
|    sibling-based relationship difficult at best; this will affect some
|    TEI or HyQ based hyperlinks, as well as sibling-based stylistic
|    decisions.

Sorry to be so slow here, but what's the connection with sibling
relationships?  My idea of a well-formed XML document is one for which
there is just one possible tree structure; what's different about
sibling relationships if a DTD is provided?
