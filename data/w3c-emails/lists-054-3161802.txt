But a "complex" document in this case is any document with whitespace in
element content. Which is to say, probably most:

<LIST>
<ITEM><P>FOO</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>BAR</P></ITEM>
</LIST>

So if we go with a scheme of "required DTD downloading to handle 'complex'
whitespace", either XML will get a "rep" as a hard to use language where you
must type this:

<LIST><ITEM><P>FOO</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>BAR</P></ITEM></LIST>

or as a language where you must basically always download the DTD.
