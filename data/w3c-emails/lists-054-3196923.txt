Precisely what I would hope too.  That was one of the reasons behind
my earlier posting on this, part of which you quote below.

If whitespace is significant (i.e., contributes to the grove) in one
case (e.g., whitespace in element content that is not known to be
within element content when the DTD is not available and is therefore
considered to be significant) and not in the other (i.e., when the
DTD indicates the whitespace is in element content), then you will
have what HyTime considers to be pseudo-elements in the first case
and not in the second.

For example, consider:

<book><section><p>Paragraph one.</p> <p>Paragraph two.</p></section></book>

If <section> is known to have element content, then the <p> element
whose content is "Paragraph two." is the second child of <section>
whereas if the section has mixed content, that same <p> is the third
child of <section>.  A HyTime treeloc of 1 1 2 that should properly
address the "Paragraph two." <p> element when <section> is known to
have element content would instead address the " " pseudo-element
when <section> is assumed to have mixed content.

By "its DTD" I really mean by any one of its infinite possible DTDs.

In particular, a well-formed doc could never have whitespace that
could be significant in any possible DTD and insignificant in any
other possible DTD.  It could only have whitespace that would always
significant (e.g., in between two words) or that would always be
insignificant (e.g., an RE immediately following a start tag or
immediately preceding an end tag).
