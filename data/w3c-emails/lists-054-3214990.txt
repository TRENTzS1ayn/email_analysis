This may be true (depending on how lists or tables are "typically
formatted").  The way I would format a list or table or anything
else is:  only put blanks where I want them in my data and only
break lines immediately after start tags or immediately before end tags.

I would not want to see us employ such a hack.  The list could be formatted,
for example:

<LIST>
<ITEM>
...
</ITEM><ITEM>
...
</ITEM><ITEM>
...
</ITEM>
</LIST>

(Not sure what you mean here.)

I thought we had all agreed that validation required a DTD (and many of us
believe that authoring is best done in the presence of a DTD too).  With
the DTD, the validator/authoring tool can tell which whitespaces are 
insignificant and remove them.  Then, if necessary/desired, that tool
can insert REs after start tags and before end tags to break up long lines.
The resulting file would then be well-formed wrt whitespace.  Browsers
and other tools that handle XML without reference to a DTD would merely
assume the file to be well-formed and would therefore consider all whitespace
(except REs after start tags and before end tags) to be significant.
