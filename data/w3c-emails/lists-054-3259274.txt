Taking into account such rules as ignoring RE's immediately following start
tags or immediately preceeding end tags (some people seem to think this is
in the spec, I didn't look very hard, but didn't see it right off... but
something like that should be there), your summary is exactly what I mean.  

Whether a stylesheet is sensitive to extra whitespace/RE's is dependant on
the style sheet, but there are a number of HyTime location addressing
mechanisms which WILL break if pseudo-elements show up where they were not
there before (or disappear for that matter).  It has been mentions that some
TEI locators will also break.

I have no real problem with keeping the -xml-space attribute also.  I just
require that the parse tree for DTDless and DTDful parsing be the same,
which is what I believe David Durand meant when he said he required that the
"parse trees be the same."
