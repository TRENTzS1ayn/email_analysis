No, but maybe to the "third node" in an element. If a linefeed is a node,
your count will be different than if it is not. 

For instance, maybe you want a bullet on the "first" sub-element of a list
item (usually a <paragraph>, but perhaps occasionally a <note>). 

<UITEM>
<P>Foo</P>
<note>Bar</note>
</UITEM>

Is that node the whitespace before the paragraph, or the paragraph itself?
Despite the hand-waving about the "stylesheet can handle it", I think it
would be a constant annoyance.
