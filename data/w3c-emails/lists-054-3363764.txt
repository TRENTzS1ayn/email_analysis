In terms of Eliot's enlightening discussion, I would state my feelings
as follows:  I would like to define well-formed XML so that the pGrove
for any well-formed XML is equivalent to the epGrove against which we
apply our location addressing.  I'd like to avoid introducing an
application-specific epGrove in between well-formed XML and addressing
into that well-formed XML document.
