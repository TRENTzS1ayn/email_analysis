The ERB has been largely tied up with (1) WG8 liaison to try to patch up
some of our "for compaitibility" blemishes, (2) PUBLIC identifiers, and
(3) RS/RE.  I think we can now put these to bed; we will kick-start the
hypertext discussion the same way we did base-XML, with a list of 
design goals, and a bunch of debating points.

An error for validating parsers, I'd say.  Good point.

there should be a default.

1. Most apps do it anyhow.  2. Less is more.  3. If you leave stuff in, the 
application can always take it out.  But if you take it out, the app
can never recreate the knowledge of where it was. - Tim
