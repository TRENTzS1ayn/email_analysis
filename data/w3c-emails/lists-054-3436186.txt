Huh? I thought that Charles' trick was a way of mapping RS/RE to SEPCHAR,
not of handling whitespace in element content. Now I'm totally confused. Are
you saying that proposal 3 is that we should map all of the characters out
of the set of SEPCHARs? How does this break HyTime then? 

Or is proposal 3 "when parsing without a DTD treat all whitespace as
significant" and live with the fact that the parse tree is SGML
incompatible. That doesn't break HyTime, but it throws away any kind of
whitespace pretty printing.
