Such hyperlinking could be useful in solving a difficult problem:
alignment in multilingual texts.

That said, I still feel that 
   1) We are the "Masters of the XML Grove Plans (tm)",
   2) There are no DSSSL or HyTime systems based on XML that
      have a lagre user base yet,
   3) No matter what we do, many *existing* SGML systems will not be
      able to parse XML instances without (relatively minor) changes
      to said systems, 
   and that 4) we really do desire parse results to be the same,
   independent of whether we have a DTD or not,

that having all whitespace be significant still seems a reasonable way to
go. I can live with -XML-???? attributes as a standardised application
hinting mechanism, but feel it's not really necessary, and that
authors should never *assume* that it will always have the desired
effect.
