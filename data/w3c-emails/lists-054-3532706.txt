Can you please describe *exactly* what that means? At some points in this
discussion it seems to mean that whitespace is treated *exactly* like data
content (say "foo") with regards to validating XML parsers. So this:

<LIST>
<ITEM></ITEM>
<ITEM></ITEM>
<ITEM></ITEM>
</LIST>

is going to trigger an error (if LIST allows only items, no #PCDATA) just as
surely as this:

<LIST>foo<ITEM></ITEM>bar<ITEM></ITEM>baz<ITEM></ITEM>blam!</LIST>

At other points, there has been discussion of having a DTD-reading "filter"
remove the whitespace. Which seems to imply that the former would be *valid*
as long as the filter is applied before the validation takes place. In this
case, the grove which is being validated is different from the grove that a
DTD-less parser would use.

What exactly do you mean by "all whitespace significant?" The former or the
latter or something else?
