If you can define "SGML", I might agree with you. Fact is, that SGML
is a large number of incompatible languages anyway.

If you can define "SGML", then please look to see if XML is "SGML" as
you define it.

The point is that we are only using SGML features...

Really? Even in the face of *all* the tricks one could pull with an
SGML declaration?
