Not part of the *language* specification.

I do think we need pGroves and validator behaviour defined though.

>If so, does it really matter what the "parser" returns?

Yes, because it is the *foundation* of the entire application
architecture. If it is not rigourously defined such that it
is trivial to prove it correct, no other part of the system can
be known to be correct. I like foundations of stone, not sand.

I propose two: a "pure" XML validator, which does no transformation,
of pGroves and another "SGML" validator, that removes whitespace 
according to "normal" SGML rules.

I am not against whitespace removal at the application level, but am
strongly against putting such functionality into the parser for the
meta-language.
