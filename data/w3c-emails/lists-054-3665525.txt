  TEI (I can't speak to the HyTime TC) gets this right in that an
unlabelled number addresses Nodes (including pseudo-data nodes), but you
can also index labelled elements (2nd LI in this list) and that will not
break.

   But you do need to be able to address arbitrary characters, so the
pseudo-nodes should be addressible somehow...
