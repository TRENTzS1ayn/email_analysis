Yes, and that makes RE after elements significant in _all_ mixed content,
and insignificant outside it.

Bingo!

But -- it is compatible for mixed content (via Charles' hack). Not for
element content, but that compatiblity is impossible since element content
cannot be distinguished from mixed content without a DTD, in any case.  And
yes, it does throw out pretty-printing (or require some explicit
notification from the user as to the presence of such pretty-printing.
