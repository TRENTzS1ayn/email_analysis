There is a vital element missing here - the ability to address part of an
object that does not have an ID (or a name attribute if we are to fully meet
3.1) associated with it. If we are going, as claimed in 3.2 to "support
links into read-only material" we have to presume that the objects we are
pointing to have not been named in a reasonable way. Therefore we need an
addressing mechanism that can identify any part of any document. URL and ID
are not sufficient, either alone or in combination.

I would also argue strongly for letting a single anchor role point to
mutliple locations, which is not possible when you say "has multiple ends,
each of which has a role". Anchor roles can type location sets, just as the
ilink construct allows you to type links.

Incidentally, in the HyTime TC ilinks will become a deprecated form: the
extended HyLink architectural form will subsume their role and would form a
better basis for this work. (More on this later, if Eliot does not beat me
to it!)
