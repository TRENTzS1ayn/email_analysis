Martin, your contribution addresses two points in the MPRDV note, which could
either be identified by number (3.2sub2, 3.3) or name (addressing un-ID'd
objects, link-end to address sets.)  To achieve some sort of order in this
discussion, it would help if people would use the "Subject:" line to
support discussion threads at a level somewhat narrower than "Hyperlinks".

Cheers, Tim Bray
