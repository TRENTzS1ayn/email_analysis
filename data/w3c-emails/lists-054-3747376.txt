Per Tim's reasonable suggestion, I am breaking up my commentary message
into topical email-bites.

We don't have any link roles on the internet, at the moment... We could
grep through opentext or altavista for REV and REL attributes, but other
than that we really have only one role: "unlabelled-destination". I don't
object to this requirement, but I think it is content-free given the poor
infrastructure in place.

5.3 Provision for link explainers. This is a critical issue for multi-end
links, and not necessarily for 2-end links. You need a way to attach
explanatory text to each link end that can explain the meaning of that
link-end to the user. This is different from the role, as you may still
want an explanation of how a general role (like REFUTES, say) is relevant
to a specifc instance of a link.

   This is an old-fashioned, but tremendously powerful link-preview
facility for authors and readers.
