Per Tim's reasonable suggestion, I am breaking up my commentary message
into topical email-bites.

I would say that the behaviors are more determined by browser: for instance
(at least some versions of) Netscape would display ftp files that contained
HTML, rather than downloading. And nowadays all browsers can change their
behavior based on the content-type (or extension) of the file (regardless
of the protocol used to fetch it). My point is only to agree that we need
an <a> tag, but that the semantics of what it does are pretty inconsistent
and should not overly constrain us. Basically browsers currently guess what
was intended, since there is no link-type information at all.
