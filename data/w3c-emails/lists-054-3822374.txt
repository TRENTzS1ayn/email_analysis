It's not a tar pit (I don't think) when defined in terms of groves because
issues of character representation are resolved in the process of
constructing the grove because each character becomes an individual node.
Through the use of grove plans and, possibly, custom data tokenizers, you
can define exactly how you want the data you're addressing represented.

One of the things I *didn't* mention in my summary of TC changes is that
span locations are now more clearly defined because of groves.  

Cheers,
