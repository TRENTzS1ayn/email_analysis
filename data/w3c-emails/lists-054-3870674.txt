Web users stick to HTML - why should they change to XML if XML's linking
mechanism is no better than HTML's. Many of us web users are screaming at
W3C to improve linking so we can manage our links better, and so that we can
offer sensible hierarchies of possible information providers. If they don't
improve HTML soon some of us are going to have to find an alternative. It
would be nice if that alternative could be XML.
