HyTime has not changed in its fundamentals.  Appart from some 
much-needed design refinements, the only real difference between
old HyTime and new HyTime is the grove-based underpinings by which
everything (including DSSSL and SGML) are now defined.  But the scope
of application, what it does, and the way it does it, have not changed.

Cheers,
