I agree that this is so.  What I mean is that in all of the name 
changes, new descriptions, and the the grove-based underpinnings 
(which are needed), it is like starting over in ferreting out 
the details.  It isn't a bad thing, but I understand the frustration 
of some with this.

I welcome the paper you are working on.  After watching the HyTime 
process for some time, my intuition is that any attempt to do 
what HyTime does results in HyTime-Yet-Again.  So, as XML is 
a simplification of SGML to make it more friendly to the current 
Internet pipes (hollow logs instead of PVC) and base of application 
writers, a similar simplification of HyTime should do the job.

Umm... do we know what the job is yet? :-)
