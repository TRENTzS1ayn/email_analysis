which is another linking behaviour that the Web already has,
perhaps unfortunately.

For years now (that's eons in Web time) I've been complaining
that involuntary transclusion works against the interests of
copyright holders and dramatically reduces their desire to
make copyrighted material available inthe Web environment.

IMG was bad enough (from this angle); FRAMEs are dreadful
(from this angle).  I don't see any simple solution, and maybe
linking is not the arena in which a solution should be sought.

But if this group can find a way to construct links such that
the server of the transcluded object can detect that it's being
fetched for the purpose of transclusion, that would be an
immense win.  Awesome, even.

Xanadu evades this matter by assuming that everyone has already
signed on to a copyright protection and micropayment scheme.
The real world is, of course, different.
