If involuntary transclusion is not done on the client side it can be done on
the server side. On the current Web, the alternative is to download other
people's data. On a future web, the web server will probably do server-side
transclusion *for you*. It is probably in the copyright holder's best
interest to have it be done on the client, because at least they have a
mechanism for communicating directly to the reader. So I would argue that we
should put it in the XML standard.

The only solution seems to be servers who ask: "who are you, why do you want
this and under what conditions do you want it?"

I think that it requires usage-negotiation in the transport protocols, and
is not a linking issue.
