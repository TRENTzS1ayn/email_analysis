I'd feel happier documenting or teaching this if there was a phrase in
there to explain that "anchor" in XML is no longer restricted to the old
HTML sense of "jumping-off-point". Many millions of users have been taught
(or have assimilated) that an anchor is a location you can return to using 
the BACK button (and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else because it's a
quick and easy way to get the unidirectional dea across).

Is this a binary choice, or do we have some growing list of benefits
as the number of self-aware anchors grows (n --> N) ?

Probe 3: fine. Probe 4:

If this means binding a set of behaviours to (say) a specific set of
element-and-attribute combos by prescription in the spec, then I don't
see a problem. If it means "may" and "might" and "could" then I'm less
happy about it, as we would make it easier to lose Probe 2.2 above.

I think we need to be very explicit about the benefits that are achievable.
If we can't spell them out in the spec (that may not be the right place
for them) then we should have an Implementor's Notes document which does.

They can be solved at the technical level but require high-level 
enforcement (ie obeyable legislation).

I think that on the current Web "many" == "most". If there is a danger
that people will equate XML with "you can't just point at anything any
more" then there is a risk it will be ignored. Terry's arguments have
convinced me that we do after all need to cover the IPR topic in the
spec, but I don't know to what depth.
