The other prime benefit is that it can *easily* be defined to
be a special URL syntax (something I've noted a number of times
in the past):

   http://www.ebt.com/foo.sgml/1/1/2
   http://www.ebt.com/foo.sgml/chap=1/section=1/para=2

though we may like to use somewhat different syntax (ie. clearly label
the exact specification type, define the sub-document address as a
fragment ID, etc.). 

I've been trying to get something like the above adopted as a common way
of sub-component addressing (because it can be used for GUI object
adressing, OODB addressing, RDB addressing etc.)

The first version of DynaWeb had support for both the above forms
built into it...

These can also be expressed as heirarchical pointers.
