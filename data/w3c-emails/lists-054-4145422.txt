Point is that you can already do multi-ended links, and many other
things, using clever servers: no special markup is needed, just
special URL forms (in the area that is supposed to be opaque).

It seems obvious to me, but if we really *are* going to specify some
improved linking capabilities, we are going to end up specifying
processing at almost every level of the WWW (markup, protocols, client
& server).
