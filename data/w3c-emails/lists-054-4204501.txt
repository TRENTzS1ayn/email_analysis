Yes, of course.  As it's explained in the TC, refloc is a shorthand that
replaces explicit reference to the equivalent location address element.
Every refloc option has an equivalent location address construction.

Yes.

Yes.  I should have said "consist of" instead of "satisfied by".

Yes.  This is made clear in the text of the standard.  Reference to a data
or subdocument entity is equivalent to referring to an explicit grovedef
that names the entity as the grove source and uses the default grove plan
for the entity (defined either by the entity declaration or by the
notation's property set).

Yes. The message here is that all the shortcuts in HyTime are defined in
terms of HyTime primitives--there are no special cases or magic processing.

Cheers,
