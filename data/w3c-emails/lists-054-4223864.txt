Hytime-anchor is one way to view the matter.  But to many in our target
audience, <a name=foo> </a> is an anchor whether or not it's pointed to, 
and it isn't a Hytime-anchor unless it is pointed to.  

So if we say that "anchor" means "what Hytime calls an anchor" 
we will probably find it necessary to come up with a term 
to describe what "anchor" presently means to many people.  It is 
useful to have a term for anchors-the-author-provided-in-case-
anyone-wants-to-link-to-them.  

Now is <a href="http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/mprdv.html">foo</a>
a Hytime-anchor 
 - if Tim's server is down?  
 - if Tim removes the document?
 - if the URL were misspelled? 

And if byte range 1001--2001 in that document can be addressed, is that 
byte range (not distinguished by anything in the document itself) an 
anchor?

(I'm just asking; these are things that will have to be explained.)
