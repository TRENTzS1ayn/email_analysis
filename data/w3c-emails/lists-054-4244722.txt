How about "element with an ID"?

Which thing are you referring to?  There are two anchors here: the A
element itself and the object or objects addressed by the value of the HREF
attribute.  The A element is always an anchor because it is a contextual
link and therefore one of its own anchors.  I assume you mean the thing
addressed by the value of the HREF attribute.

The object addressed is an anchor as long as it exists (remembering that
URLs, in particular, refer to locations and not objects, so the anchor is
whatever object happens to be at that location--meaning that as long as
*something* is at that location it will be the other anchor of the above
link--this is where the subtle distinction between locations and names
raised in the URL/URN discussion comes into play--in SGML it's the
difference between addressing an entity only by system identifier and
addressing it initially by public identifier, or addressing a book by ISBN
or by physical location on the shelf.)

Yes, assuming the object still exists at the specified address.

No, assuming he doesn't put anything else at the same location.

> - if the URL were misspelled? 

Depends on whether or not the URL still addresses something.  If it does,
that thing is the anchor.  If not, there's no anchor and you have a broken
link in this case.

Yes, if it is actually addressed by a hyperlink.
