This is a good point and we shouldn't lose sight of it.  I tend to assume
that queries will be used for addressing, both because it's right powerful
and because the Web allows it today.  But Derek's point is well taken:
limiting our addressing power makes anchor-awareness much more tractible.

In my hyperworld view [sorry Terry] I assume queries are allowed and
therefore assume that there will be a class of anchors for which
pre-knowledge of anchorness is unknowable.  My impression is that Steve N.
tends to the opposite world view, in which all anchors should be (and,
ideally, must be) known in advance.  I think these two views reflect
focuses on different use scenarios, not fundamental differences about what
hypertext is or how things like HyTime should work.

Cheers,
