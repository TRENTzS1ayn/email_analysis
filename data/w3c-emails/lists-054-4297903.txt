Fortunately, you're incorrect in thinking there is a conflict between TEI
and HyTime.  There is not.

With the TC, HyTime processing can now be integrated with any addressing
scheme you care to support.  All you have to do is define for the HyTime
engine what sort of nodes you'll be returning, which you do by defining a
property set and creating the appropriate software to provide a "grove
view" of the data.  If you're not using a HyTime engine, then just do what
you would have done anyway.

As I've said in other notes to this group, this should be almost trivial
for TEI locators because they're both designed to address SGML documents
and well documented (and implemented to some degree by at least two
browsers).  This means that defining how TEI locators address groves, SGML
document groves in particular, should be very straight forward, and
adapting the existing facilities to support whatever XML needs shouldn't be
hard (it may already be inherent in those tools' functionality).

Note that HyTime would consider TEI locators to be queries, no different in
nature from any other query language you might want to use.

I am already on record as probably preferring TEI locators as a good syntax
for the XML target audience.  But the use of TEI locators in an
XML-specific, HyTime-derived linking and addressing architecture does not
preclude the use of other HyTime facilities, such as basic name
indirection, treelocs, datalocs, etc.

Cheers,
