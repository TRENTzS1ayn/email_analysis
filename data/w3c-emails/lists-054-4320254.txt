Good point, although there's no reason the HTML NAME attribute *couldn't*
be declared as an SGML ID--it has to be unique within the document.  Of
course, HTML  has a very expansive definition of what constitutes a name or
name start character...

But I meant "ID" more in the generic sense of being uniquely identified.
Certainly the NAME attribute in HTML has this semantic.

Note that an HTML-specific pGrove for an HTML document could use the NAME
value for A elements using the normal SGML property set because at the
property set level the attribute value is just a string, not an SGML NAME
(that's a distinction enforced by the parser before the grove is constructed).

So as far as addressing is concerned, the HTML NAME attribute is just as
good as an SGML ID.

I agree that the term "anchor" in particular is way
overloaded--unfortunately I can't think of any better term or terms to
disambiguate anchors as HyTime means them from elements whose semantic is
to be addressed as anchors.  Perhaps it's because I've too deeply
internalized HyTime....
