Er, no.  There is no requirement in RFC 1866 that A's NAME be unique within 
the document, and in fact the absence of such a requirement could eventually 
become a feature of HTML by facilitating n-ary links.  And HTML's 
definition of a name start character is exactly the RCS's.
                                             
So linking to <a name=foo> </a> is like linking to all elements with a 
particular value supplied for a particular attribute.  (Although today
in practice you get a link to only one of those elements.)
