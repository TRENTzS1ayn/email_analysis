In the following interchange with Peter Flynn --

| | directionality is implied: so "link end" still retains connotations of
| | "target" and anchor retains connotations of "source".
| 
| Well, connotation is in the mind of the beholder, I guess.  "Anchor"
| started out with a directional connotation (although I think with some
| historical investigation you might find some people who thought that
| "anchor" meant "source" rather than "target"),

I meant, of course, to say 'some people who thought that "anchor"
meant "target" rather than "source"'.

Which demonstrates what I was trying to get across...
