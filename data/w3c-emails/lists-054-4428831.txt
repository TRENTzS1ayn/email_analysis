I'm not in a position to answer any of the 20 or so questions in Len's
message :-), but his IPB (illustrated parts bulletin) provides the
paradigmatic example of a large class of real-life problems that a
significant number of people would like to see solved.  I think that
it would be helpful for purposes of comparison if proposals for link
methodologies would show how they intend to handle this case.
