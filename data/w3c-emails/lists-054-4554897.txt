A mapping of XML terms to HyTime is only required if XML chooses to expose
its derivation from HyTime in the spec.  At a miminum, I would suggest an
appendix that provides the mapping, or maybe a separate technical report
that shows how XML can be derived from HyTime.

I would prefer to just not use the term "anchor" at all.  I don't think we
need it if we agree to use "link end" in its place.  We can always say "an
HTML anchor" or "an identified object" or something.

Note that the Dexter hypermedia model uses "anchor" to mean the address of
a link end--it's a data object managed by the Dexter link management layer
(I think--I can go look up the relevant papers if anyone cares), not
something in the data linked.  So there's a third usage of Anchor that is
incompatible with either HyTime's or HTML's.

Ouch. Stop. You're hurting me.  

Note that HyTime does retain the term "link end", but it refers to the
union of the members of an anchor, the anchor description (nee "end term")
if any, and the anchor role name.  It's a data object that occurs in the
HyTime semantic grove but that has no direct syntactic analog (because it's
constructed from several different syntactic bits).

Thus, I think there's less conflict between "link end" used more informally
as Jon suggests and HyTime's use of the term than one might think.

Do I have to send a thank-you note?

Cheers,
