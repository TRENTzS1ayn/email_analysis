Ugh.  I didn't realize that.  I can see the benefit, although I would think
that 999 times out of a 1000 the intent will be to uniquely identify parts
of HTML documents, especially since none of the Web browsers I know of
support multi-object link ends (at least IE and Netscape don't appear to).

There is generally a distinction between a "label" and a "name", where
labels need not be unique (ignoring programming languages that use unique
labels) and names, which are unique within some name space.  I would argue
that HTML has confused these two and seriously undermined the general
concept of NAME with the NAME attribute of the A element.

Of course, since we don't have to worry about replacing HTML or even
emulating it, it's a moot point.

Cheers,

E.
