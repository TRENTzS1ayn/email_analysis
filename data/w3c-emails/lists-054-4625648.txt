I second this. For stage one we need to learn how to identify what it is we
need to link to and how to manage link definitions in a way that will
preserve them over time. (This latter will be the killer part of a good
linking mechanism.) Only when we have mastered this part of the problem
should we consider how to 'standardize' the behaviour of links.
