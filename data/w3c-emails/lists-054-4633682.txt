Everyone agrees that a data declared link is what we are after.
XML is SGML and SGML gives us no other alternative.  Selah.
I don't think you can avoid behavior for long.  At some point, 
implicitly or explicitly a link is used to do something.  If 
you embed it in the text a la <a href=, you have a goto.
Do we have to identify what we "want to link to" or the way 
we express a link given that XML is a meta language and there 
can be quite a few ways to express a link, none of which are 
without implementation implications?  As Eliot states, the 
grove concept was adopted because it provided a way to 
talk about a link.  So far, no one is offering any alternatives 
to that except to adopt TEI conventions.

So far, this discussion seems to have only two alternatives:
TEI or HyTime and HyTime is a standard which Eliot assures us 
is able to express TEI comfortably.
