Just to be pedantic: HyTime is a standard with which TEI can be integrated
comfortably.  TEI expresses itself and the interface between a HyTime
engine and a TEI engine is well defined in terms of the property sets,
groves, and grove plans both act on.

Without reference to Tim's original post, I think the issues are:

1. What syntax(es) to use for representing addresses?
   1.A HyTime location addresses (some or all) only (must include
       URLs as a query notation that must be supported, in addition
       to being used for entity external identifiers.).
   1.B TEI locators only
   1.C Some combination of 1.A and 1.B
   1.D Only in style sheets

2. How to bind addresses to links 
   2.A direct only 
   2.B Indirect only 
   2.C Direct and indirect

3. Whether or not to define links that can be completely independent.

4. What syntax to use to represent links (probably separate from 
   addresses).  Here the choices seem to be:
   4.A  SGML elements of the HyTime model without trickery (ID/IDREF
        primary addressing method plus indirection)
   4.B  SGML elements of the HyTime model with refloc/queryloc 
        stuff to make use of non-HyTime addresses easier for authors.
   4.C  SGML elements of some other model that can't be reconciled
        with HyTime (I don't think such a thing can be made, but 
        I won't rule it out).
   4.D  Define only in style specifications

5. What formalism to use in defining links and link types:
   5.A  Strict requirement of HyTime's linktype/anchor role model
   5.B  No required model (no need to define link types or anchor
        roles)
   5.C  Both 5.A and 5.B (be formal or not, we don't care).  Note this
        is HyTime as of the TC.
   5.D  Some other model that I'm not aware of

6. What base behaviors to define for links or link types, if any.

7. How to allow authors or users to define or modify link behaviors,
   if allowed at all:
   7.A Style sheets only (e.g., DSSSL language for describing link 
       behavior.
   7.B Attributes on link elements
   7.C Some other mechanism

Cheers,

E.
