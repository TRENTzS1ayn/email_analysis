Note that the Object Proposal does introduce unique IDs:

"OBJECT has the following attributes: 

ID 
Used to define a document-wide identifier. This can be used for naming
positions within documents for use as destinations of hypertext links. An ID
attribute value is an SGML NAME token. NAME tokens are formed by an initial
letter followed by letters in the range a-z and A-Z (no accented
characters), digits, "-" and "." characters. It may also be used by the user
agent or objects in the document to find and communicate with other objects
embedded in the document."
