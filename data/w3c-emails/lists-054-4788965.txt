They do so because the behavior of the link is implied
by its context and because the addressing is completely
contained within the URL.  The commonality is in the
use of URLs.  

So *purely* as a point for discussion, let me pose the 
following:

 The Web uses URLs (and to some degree, nascent URNs) 
 for link addressing.  Linking methods are expressed 
 mostly within URLs, and URL schemes are not necessarily
 tied to the data formats of the target entities.

 XML is specifically intended for use on the Web.

 Why should XML specify any mechanisms for hyperlinking
 other than those already in use?  

 How are XML agents to interoperate with other Web agents if 
 they do not confine their expression of linking semantics to 
 URLs (maybe plus URNs), HTTP headers (generated from metadata?),  
 and MIME types?
