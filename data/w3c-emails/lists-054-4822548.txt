Groves are directed graphs (not acyclic), but they can also be considered as
trees.  More precisely:

- A subset of the edges are distinguished as representing
"origin-to-subnode" relationships.  If you delete all edges other than
these, then the graph becomes a single tree.

- A subset of the "origin-to-subnode" edges are distinguished as
representing parent-child relationships.  If you delete all edges other than
these, then the graph becomes a set of disjoint trees: one of these trees is
the normal ESIS-like element structure tree; each attribute assignment (name
plus value) is also its own tree.
