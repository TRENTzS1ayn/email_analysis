For the record, HyTime's Bounded Object Set (BOS) concept was created to
allow an SDIF package to be created that would contain all the files
referenced in a group of related documents (e.g. for storage on a CD-ROM).
By definition XML as defined by the SGML on the Web team is not concerned
with creating SDIF packages of sets of documents, only in providing pointers
to files stored in their original storage locations. Therefore, I would
suggest, the concept of BOS has no relevance in the design of XML links.
