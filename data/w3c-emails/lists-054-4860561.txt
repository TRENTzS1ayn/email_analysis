I would say that some kind of grove specification is essential to XML.  The 
grove defines what is important from that markup scheme and what relationships
exist within the document.  It levels the playing field for applications and
insures that they "get it right"!  HyTime or not, we should define a
subset of the DSSSL/HyTime groves for XML's use.

As I understand it, groves will be making their way back into the SGML standard
in its revision.

Groves are not irrelevant--they are quite the opposite and extremely important.

If we do this now, we will find it extremely useful to extend what XML and
XML applications can do in the future.
