Indeed, I did not read carefully. You clearly distinguished between
suggestion and enforcement, and agreed that at the moment the former is all
we can do. But I'm still going to argue against stating these policies,
absent any way to enforce them and agreement as to which policies are
correct. I do agree with Martin that we need a way to identify document
groups whose correct interpretation according to the author's intention
dictates that they should be processed together.

All I was attempting to do was to falsify a weak example of why we need
these policies, by pointing to the stated purpose of this group.

This is their preprogative. We have no business, in my view, trying to
create new social mechanisms in advance of any workable social/legal
consensus on what is desirable. Never mind that we would be creating such
policies without a technical infrastructure to support them.

   Of course, personally, I consider such policies worthy of opposition
anyway...  But, if there were a set of mechanisms in use, and subject to
some widespread agreement, and support, then I would be forced to agree
that we should support them. But since neither accepted policies nor
workable mechanisms exist, I don't see why this is our problem.

People with contractual requirements will have to create their own software
that enforces them, and somehow ensure that only that software is used on
their data. This is not a change form the present state of affairs.

If support for such policies requires additional markup, it is easy to add.
For instance, the military (or some research organizations!) could add a
SECURITY="TOP-SECRET" attribute and ensure that their applications process
it correctly. But it's not _our_ problem, it's _their_ problem.

If you don't want home taping of your show, don't sell the broadcast
rights. If you don't want satirical linking or guided tours of your data,
don't publish on the web. You decide what policies you require, and what
the economic tradeoffs of those policies are. Since I believe such policies
to be unenforceable given current technology (aside from possible custom
encryption applets, which we will certainly allow), I don't see that this
is an issue for this group.

This doesn't bother me. If they can manage to develop open technology
through the IETF or W3C that supports them, then they can standardize an
application convention to support that, or add something to XML 2.0.

I don't think that even stating a policy that is technically unenforceable
is good for anything except maybe generating lawsuits. I don't see why we
need to worry about this.

SHTTP or variants may address this. Like most security issues this is
mostly related to transport and authentication. I don't see that we need to
address this, especially since there is no infrastructure in place that we
can be called upon to support.

If we can't guarantee reliable transport (and we know this is the case) the
only place that a copyright notice can be guaranteed to be recieved is if
it occurs early in the byte-stream of a document. Any provider can
construct a DTD that enables this information to be included at the
beginning. No link can ever guarantee such security because the network
might break before the link can be followed but after the data is
downloaded.

Now I can imagine encryption scenarios that would solve this (copyright
notice contains a key to decypt the document body), but since they are not
deployed anywhere, I don't see whay we should worry about supporting them.
We don't prevent such things, just remain silent.

If there's no effective way to acomplish an end, what is the point of
promulgating a bunch of rules and policies about that end. I don't
understand why we need to develop a new social structure and policy
language that is unenforceable for the forseeable future.

 This is just not our problem. Persuade me that we can do even one useful
thing with this information, in the lines of guaranteeing that it is used.

Add an "external link" icon to some of your links. Define two types of link
in your DTD. Add a uniform header to all your documents. Add a copyright
notics to all your documents.

We do need a way to specify documents that should be processed together if
they are to be viewed as intended. For instance, Martin's separate link
file scenario should be accomodated properly, as default behavior.

   Well, things are going dim around me too, but it's probably just too
much coffee...
