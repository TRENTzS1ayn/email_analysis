Even though David and I often disagree on details and use of terminology
(and, to a larger degree, the existence of HyTime as a "good thing", which
is, ultimately, a religious argument that cannot be resolved to anybody's
satisfaction), I do completely agree with David's suggestions here: they
are essentially identical to those I plan to complete just as soon as the
holidays and Evil Cedar Pollen Allergy release me).

I don't really care how the design is conveyed in the spec: architectural
forms, whatever, as long as it's clear and precise.

Cheers,

E.
