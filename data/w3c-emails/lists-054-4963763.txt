I agree about XML hyperlinking being comprehensible.  I'm not sure Eliot 
has completed his proposal.  I know he will try very 
hard to show this.  No doubt some positions are congealing.

I see in these discussions that some consensus points 
are emerging.  It seems likely to me that as the holidays 
are coming to a close, our illustrious editors will 
pull the issues into a presentation.
