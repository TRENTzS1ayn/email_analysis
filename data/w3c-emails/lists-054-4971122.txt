I agree.  I also point out that all of Dave's arguments 
which are in technical fact, true, are the same arguments 
used prior to PICS to prevent a serious technical answer being 
given to a serious social problem created by the management 
of that technology.  Content policy can be noted and enforced as 
well as anything else.  The beastie is just a machine. Whether with 
XML, XML link management systems, or other handlers, such 
enforcement of policy will occur.  Inevitable and irrefutable.

But not worth hassling with here and now.  Application conventions  
of consortium apps will arise in response to customer pressure just 
as PICS has.
