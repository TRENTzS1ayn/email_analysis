This only works if your read-only asset inherits the BOS of all the
documents in the chain used to reach it, or the BOS of a start point
document that covers the whole of a document set. What you are talking about
in the first of these is the browser's History list. But how on earth do I
know which entry in my History list is the one that contains the copyright
notice and any necessary disclaimers?

On the Web there is no guarantee that you will access a document via its
session start document. In fact, for any reasonably large data set you can
normally guarantee that you won't. So the question becomes "how do you
identify the BOS" associated with this page if it resides with the session
start document". What you need to do is to have a pointer to the BOS that
says "This Web page should be used with this BOS". (Isn't this the catalog
for the file set?)

How? The problem is which set of links should be used. If I annotate one of
your documents the session start document will point to my copyright notice.
When looking at a hot-link I have added to your document, according to your
methods, I need to know both who created the link and, more importantly, who
created the text being referenced. This is only possible if your page
contains a pointer to your copyright information and my link contains a
pointer to my copyright notice.

I don't see how this last would work if the locator for the copyright info
is stored as part of the read-only asset. Unique use of a license over the
web implies dynamic allocation of some information that needs to be
maintained by the browser in some safe way. This has to be done using some
form of cookie. Can cookies reroute locators?
