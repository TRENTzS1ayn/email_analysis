My definition is the same.  What will be needed is the definition 
of interpretation such that two XML systems do it somewhat the 
same way.  For that, we could use object definitions 
nicely, because it fits well with EAPIs and communicates 
to implementors precisely what is needed.  My feeling, and only 
that because I've seen no proposals, is that using DSSSL for this 
may be just as hard or harder.

For independent links, my concept is more like the catalog as 
an independent file (entity) which the document instance has 
a pointer to.  Easy to explain, easy to use, and already in use 
in exisiting applications for SGML and stylesheets.
