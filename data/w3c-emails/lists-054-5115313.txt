Already done.  *The* XML grove, no.  Is there such a thing, or is a 
grove for XML plus a grove and or grove plan for each XML application
needed?

o the primitives used to locate objects within it, traverse it, and
transform it, 

Primitives?  Need to clarify.  Functions?

o a way of grouping/ordering the primitives

collections?  sets?  lists? 

o a way of manipulating/interacting with the result of such primtives (
  or a group of them), and a way of binding primtives to nodes in a
grove.

Functions again?

As you say, and as I say to Tim, "most of us can imagine this and 
already have" in our existing systems, but not here yet.

Proposals are needed.  To get the credibility needed for acceptance, 
not only the spec, but appendices on implementation and/or working 
code will be needed.
