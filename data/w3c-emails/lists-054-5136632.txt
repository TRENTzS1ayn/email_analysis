Ok.  You may need to specify an origin (upper left, lower left, etc.).  

Now you have the sort of thing done in the systems I've seen with this 
exception.  The coordinates may not be in the calling document.  They 
may be part of the records of the image handler software.  The calling 
document may be calling a named region using a convention.  For example, 
a road map has border coordinates that divide the printed map into 
say, two inch square regions (the two inch is relevant only to the 
printing).  The handling software may use this convention to impose a
grid dividing the map into a set of squares.  The author "names" each 
square (named location), and the image handler keeps the association 
of name to pixel coordinates.  What the calling document passes is 
the name, perhaps the handler name, and a command string telling 
the handler to open up at the image zoomed to that region.

Right now, to do this sort of thing, we keep two different sets of 
independent links (e.g, structs).  One for the image handler's 
view of a document set; one for the SGML handler's document set.
What we need is for these to be one set.
