    Steve DeRose and I have strongly argued against this mis-feature of
HyTime many times. It is a pointless restriction that means that one
_cannot_ define multi-ended links where the number of linkends is defined
by the application. I thought that this was slated to go away in the TC.
(At least I hoped there was a chance that someone would want to represent
pop-up menus as multi-ended links). I strongly urge that we not adopt this
"feature" of HyTime.

    I expect Eliot to claim that the above is false. I do not believe  that
composite anchors (discontinuous selections) are the same as multiple link
endpoints, and so I do not accept the proposal that he is likely to make. I
also think that _for XML_ this will not work, as I think that discontinuous
link endpoints (HyTime (unrevised) multlocs) should not be part of XML.
They are a bit too esoteric for our audience, I think.

What is the syntax for this? In (uncorrected) HyTime, they are both lists
of IDs, in 1-1 correspondence, so you cannot "leave one out".

I really hope to get to read the TC soon, but I'd rather get a degree and
see XML on its way.
