We will have to define an XML grove (plan?) for DSSSL support, but there
should be only _one_ grove (plan?) for XML. That was the import of all the
RS/RE discussion. We want _one_ abstract syntax. The "benefit" of more than
one is the ability to handle SGML's confusing parsing model (which we have
already simplified) and the ability to mystify people with a bunch of new
terms for old concepts.
