Note that as currently defined (and implemented by SP), there are
defaulting rules for associating element types with architectural forms,
specifically, an element whose type is the same as a form in the active
architecture is taken to be of that form.  Thus, if we define an XML
architecture and assume that all XML processors use it, then, assuming
"ilink" is a form in the architecture, it is unnecessary to specify the
redundant architecture attribute.

I don't think this is punting--I think it's a natural way to solve the
problem. There's nothing that says you can't put the architectural
recognition in your style sheet (you can do it today with DynaText, albeit
inefficiently, by using the #DEFAULT style and having a buch of switch()
functions conditioned on form name for the relevant properties).

A style sheet is nothing more than a processor specification, after all.

So you would disallow attribute renaming? I suppose that's ok, especially
if we prefix all XML attributes with "-xml-".  Renaming is disallowed by
default--you can choose not to define a renaming attribute, and if you
don't, no way to rename.

I have it on my to-do list to create DSSSL style sheet that implements the
InfoMaster architecture.  Don't know when I'll get to it, but the basic
approach would, I think, be to replace the use of the element function with
a new function, archform, that checks the architectural form just as
element checks the element type.  I haven't had time to work out the
details of the function, but it can't be that hard.

Another approach would simply be to apply the style sheet to the
architectural instance rather than to the base document instance, which you
can do with Jade by using the -A flag to specify the architecture name.

Cheers,
