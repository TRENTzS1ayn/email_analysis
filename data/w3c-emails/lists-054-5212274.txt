In the HyTime model, these would be location addresses, not links.  I'm not
sure I understand the point of your comment: I thought my proposal was
sufficient (not that I was trying to propose a useful scheme for doing
image addressing--it was just a quick example).

Certainly the image map could be another document, e.g.:

<!DOCTYPE ImageMap SYSTEM "imagemap.dtd" [
 <!ENTITY image SYSTEM "http://www.ti.com/parts/images/foo.gif" NDATA GIF >
]>
<image image=image>
 <area id=area1 ...>
 ...
</image>

If I understand you correctly, the "name" in your discussion would be the
ID of the areas in the image map document.

Cheers,

E.
