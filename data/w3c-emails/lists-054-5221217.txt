yes.  Pixel addresses are absolute locations in concrete documents.

It is.  I wanted to point out what was missing.  As soon as pixel 
coordinates are separated from content, the origin is needed for 
complete independence, or the maintainer makes assumptions about 
the image notation handler.  IOW, sometimes, the notation declaration 
*is* needed and I am getting confused if the notation of the 
content type (e.g, the tiff, gif, VRML is indicated).

Can be, but it could just be a label.  Whatever, it is unique in 
some known namespace.

BTW, are you assuming the use of a URL resolver?  In the #prefix
convention, 
a lot of strings are appended to the locator, and that assumes one knows 
what strings are available. So, for management's sake, how does the 
example look if one is pointing out of a document instance into the 
independent link set document using a URL? Is it as simple as appending 
the name of the linkset document plus the  link id to the URL with the 
proviso that the linkset document handler knows to goto/gosub/spawn 
the target?  Sounds like a catalog.  From a management perspective, 
BOS management is catalog management and all the document instance 
needs to know is the name of its catalog.

"Stylesheet is a processor specification":  I like that.  Style is 
overloaded like everything else. That distinction is good where 
for some XML systems, they might not wish to also send a stylesheet.
