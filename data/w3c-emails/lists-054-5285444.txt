     "When at anchor here I ride,
      My bosom swells with pride!
      And I snap my fingers at the foe-man's taunts  ..."
   - Gilbert and Sullivan, "HMS Pinafore"

I prefer the last 6 lines of Goethe's _Torquato Tasso_, where the
shipwrecked sailor clings hopelessly to the very rocks on which his
ship has been wrecked :-) Perhaps the irony of this will not be lost
in the pursuit of backward compatibility ad infinitum...
