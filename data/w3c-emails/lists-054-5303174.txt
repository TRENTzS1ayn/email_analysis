Remember that DSSSL only defines the creation of flow objects--a second
process then interprets the flow objects into a final presentation.  It's
the methods associated with the flow objects that would determine behavior.  

DSSSL provides the Link flow object class:

<blockquote>
Link Flow Object Class

A link flow object represents a hypertext link that can be interactively
traversed, typically by clicking on the areas representing the flow object
and its content. A link has a single principal port, which can contain both
inlined and displayed flow objects. Link flow objects can be nested, and
the innermost link is effective. It has the following characteristic: 

destination: is either #f or an object of type address or a list of one or
more objects of type address. See . This characteristic is not inherited
and shall be specified. A value of #f is used for a nested link and
indicates that the contents of the flow object shall not be considered part
of the containing link.

Cheers,
