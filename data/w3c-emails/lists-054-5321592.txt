I like them too, but the case is not as strong as it is for ilink (which
has been spontaneously proposed many times in WWW contexts). Aggregate link
endpoints are not nearly as popular, so I think we could leave them out.
They also present display problems, particularly for the rather retarded
user-interface models typical of current browsers.

I don't see any terminology problem here. I just disagree that anchor roles
have to be fixed.

It's unduly onerous to require a static type declaration when they do not
have a fixed set of linktypes and roles. Strong typing is useful, but not
everyone wants it. If you don't want it, how can you turn it off?

What if I want to dfine distinct role names for each, but not in advance?
That is the feature request, and blusterung about link types does not
change the answer that you are giving "No, because _we believe_ that it is
not what yolu really want."

    So, HyTime is incapable of representing a hypertext system that does
not limit link types to a static list. This is not a limitation that we
should take over into XML. It is not a limitation that has been justified
either. I am _not_ questioning that strong linktypes can be useful, just
that they must be mandatory for what is supposed to be an inclusive
standard (HyTime).

   And the equivalent information (rev and rel) in HTML is not strictly
controlled in the way that you are asking. Nor are the HTTP Link: header
values. These might be relevant hypertext functions that XML would wish to
subsume!

This is truly unfortunate. The original design was susceptible of
improvement, this one is not. XML should define a mechanism for assigning
anchroles to the endpoints of an agglink, in that case, and maybe the
HyTime committee will see fit to include it.

In fact, I think the solution I proposed will still work, but just won't be
HyTime compatible any more, since HyTime is too inflexible to accomodate
it. Can we make agglink equivalents of both clinks and ilinks?
