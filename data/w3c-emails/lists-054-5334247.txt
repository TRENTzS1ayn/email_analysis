So they tell me.  I have to read the URL draft just received.

It is, I believe.  It comes under "gotta live with what is working".
Can't say I like the #hack.  How does this fit with the concept of 
separately storing queries so that they can be reused by multiple 
links in multiple documents? I want to point to a query multiple times 
much like a function is prototyped, then called whereever needed.

As to *available*, I am thinking about a scenario where the author 
is "blind" to the existence of multiple representations.  For example, 
the "graphic" in one system is a set of 2D drawings, in another, a 
3D model is used.  The author only knows they want to point at 
the "flywheel assembly view" so, in the first case, they have to 
locate a gif with inserts, in the second case they have to get a 
camera view.  What I want the author to use to link is the logical name 
for the part, e.g, the reference designator for the flywheel assembly.
Nothing so far indicates I can't use indirection for this.  Just 
want to point out it is needed.  Why?  Because I want to pick up 
the document and put it on a portable device not connected to 
the network.  I want the associations for the graphics on the 
portable device (might not be 3D capable) to be immediate and 
automatic.

Yes.

Good so far.

Ok.  The rest seems to work as I assume it would.
