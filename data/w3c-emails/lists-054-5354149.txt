I think I understand David's feature request.  We have certainly discussed
the issue of variable anchor roles at some length during the TC design, but
it was usually in a difference context which I don't think is as well
justified as David's.

I see also that this is a primary point of potential failure in trying to
design an XML linking approach that happens to also be HyTime conforming.

It would certainly be possible for XML to use the agglink form and then
define an XML-specific way to associate anchor roles with members of the
aggregate, but that would be a hack--it would be better to fix the design
at its core (which has been David's point all along, of course).

This will take some careful thought, but there might be a way to make it work.

I should point out that I think the new hylink syntax, where each role has
its own addressing attribute is much easier to use and explain than the old
ilink syntax, where you had to explain (and validate) the positional
correspondence between anchor roles and anchor addresses (complicated by
the fact that indirect addressing could obscure what was being
addressed--you didn't just count IDs in the linkends attribute value).  The
feature David wants would require the ilink-style addressing syntax with a
single attribute for all the link ends--a syntax that in my experience of
teaching HyTime is a difficult one for people to use.

Let me also ask this: do we agree that when we *don't care* about anchor
roles, that an aggegate link is sufficient?

Cheers,

E.
