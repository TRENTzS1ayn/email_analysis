Assuming that XML provides/supports/requires indirect addressing, then you
should be able to use the #name syntax to address a location address that
is a query, e.g.:

<crossref linkend="http://www.mine.com/queries.xml#all-basset-sites">
Basset hounds</crossref> are slobber monsters.

<!-- queries.xml: -->
<!DOCTYPE Queries SYSTEM "queries.dtd" >
<Queries>
<AltaVistaQuery id=all-basset-sites>basset+hound</AltaVistaQuery>
</Queries>

Cheers,

E.
