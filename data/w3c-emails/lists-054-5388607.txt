| Assuming that XML provides/supports/requires indirect addressing, then you
| should be able to use the #name syntax to address a location address that
| is a query, e.g.:
| 
| <crossref linkend="http://www.mine.com/queries.xml#all-basset-sites">
| Basset hounds</crossref> are slobber monsters.
| 
| <!-- queries.xml: -->
| <!DOCTYPE Queries SYSTEM "queries.dtd" >
| <Queries>
| <AltaVistaQuery id=all-basset-sites>basset+hound</AltaVistaQuery>
| </Queries>

Yes, assuming that you proclaim that it is part of the XML MIME
type that unqualified fragment addressing into XML entities points to IDs
(not controversial, but I think a necessary step).  And this
is a good start on a scenario.

So, what indicates the semantics of the link to the query?  It isn't
the HTTP method.   Is it the semantics of <crossref>?  What 
indicates whether the query shall be displayed per se,
the result of the query shall be trancluded (and in what 
format), or the result of the query shall be presented as
a menu list, or the most desireable (per some set of preferences)
of the list results shall be traversed to?
