Yes, that's my assumption.

In the HyTime model, it's the semantics of addresses in general: that any
reference to a location address is a reference to whatever the location
address addresses (recursed until you either get only non-location
addresses, reach the "reflevel" limit, or have a circular reference).  This
behavior of addresses is independent of linking (in other words, the same
address resolution behavior would result from an ID reference that was not
a "link" as we're defining it here).

                                                   What

That would be the semantics of Crossref and/or the refsub anchor role
and/or the data addressed by the query and/or whatever the browser chooses
to do.  The semantics could be defined in the XML link spec or in a style
sheet or some combination thereof.  Certainly XML could provide attributes
for hinting at the desired behavior if we felt that was appropriate.
