I have proposed something like this many times. I think a real
question here is whether to do it as a fragment (ie. the document is
the primary object) or a pure URL (the element is the object). I tend
toward the latter. What I proposed was a simple format:

   /foo.sgm/4/2/99                 - Child numbers
   /foo.sgm/chap=1/sect=2/para=45  - Typed children

This is easy to read, understand, and is useful for things like
addresses in OODB, and RDB as well.

Amen to that!

I was talking to someone who is planning to implement XML the other
daya, and there is already misunderstanding about what that PI should
do (ie. can it occur in places beyond the header, and if so, what does
it do?).

Headers are headers.... I guess my real avenue for promoting the *.mim
format is to write a *.mim storage object handler for SP....
