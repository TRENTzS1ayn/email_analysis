Playing the devil's advocate....

Assuming that link behaviour *will* be put out into stylesheets, we must
ask if we need any fixed forms at all (ie. the sylesheet can decide
what comprises a link, and what does not, and what the structure of
a link definition needs to be in order to be semantically interpretable).

I would say that for interoperability would be the main benefit.
