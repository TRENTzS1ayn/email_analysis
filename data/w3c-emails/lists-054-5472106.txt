But remember, if the anchor had been firmly attached to the seabed (the
place where anchors temporarily reside when being used) there would have
been no shipwreck - its only when they are moved from a known spot on the
seabed that you run into trouble. My point was that anchors refer to where
the link chain is attached to, not to the ship that let go of the anchor.
