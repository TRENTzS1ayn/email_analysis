Both: Firstly you are misusing the term HyTime BOS - as your other message
shows. (I think of what you are talking about as a Session BOS - which I
equate with Browser History - which makes much more sense of what you were
saying.) A HyTime BOS is a BOUNDED object set created by recursively (to a
controllable level) identifying all entities referenced from a particular
hub document. As such it is simply a catalog of all entities referenced from
a particular start point. You cannot build such catalogs for Web pages.

What I thing you are talking about was a record of _all_ the files
referenced during a session: a sort of history with embedded catalogs. This
is what I was referring to as an Unbounded Web Object Set (UWOS).

I think what David was talking about, and what I concur with, is a
restricted list of files: those that _must_ be accessible to make sense of a
particular document.

Let me put this in context. For the last 2-3 weeks I've been struggling with
maintaining a set of web pages for the European Commission. I have something
like 20 possible hub documents, which cross refer to each other heavily, and
also point out to many other source documents on the web. I can maintain the
links between my own sets with difficulty. One problem I have is that I have
to keep reordering my data as I split it up into finer fragments in an
attempt to ensure that I do not cover more than 20 or 30 standards per
section (delivered document). For example, I recently split the multimedia
section so that video encoding standards were listed seperately from control
standard. Checking that all of my pages referring to the original composite
file now point to the correct part of the split file is pain enough. How do
I let others pointing to my pages know I have changed them?

The real problem I have is with maintaining links to other servers. For
example, I point to the EWOS server for the specifications they create. This
month they have reordered their site,  putting a message at the original
site to tell people that the site has been reordered but not taking them
there. Now all my links to EWOS are invalid. I need to change all the links
in the 20 odd files. How the hell do I do this easily? I want my locators
clearly separated from my hub documents so that I can manage them.

I don't want people to have to access through the site's home page (which is
a 11 language selector) but want them to be able to start from any 'chapter'
of the site and then access any other chapter the site may be connected to.
However, I want the site's copyright rules made available to everyone
accessing the site, no matter which point they start from, and I want people
to be able to access all the information about using the site from any start
point. (I do this easily by having standard headers and footers to my
documents that point to the relevant location. This is no big deal, but
needs to be borne in mind for XML - where an equivalent of the proposed HTML
Banner is required for electronic headers/footers.)

The recording of the BOS of preceding documents in a viewed link chain as
part of the document's inherited history.

As the above scenario shows, link management to me is the combination of
link testing and link address maintenance. I want this subject on the XML
agenda at an early stage

This presumes that each document has a BOS associated with it. I was
presuming, following the HyTime model, that a BOS would only be created for
the hub documents of a site.

I presumed that if I went to a linked document I would inherit the BOS of
the document I linked from (otherwise how could I determine links in
read-only documents). If I followed a link from that read-only document to
another document I presumed I would have available to me the BOS suggestions
of the start document, the BOS suggestions of the read-only document and the
BOS suggestions of the new document. Is this not what you intended? Are you
now saying that only the latest set of BOS suggestions is in force? If so
how do you inherit links in read-only documents?

I could not presume this for my readers - they could have no idea of the
complexity of my document's links. I would need to put a warning up to tell
them not to try to resolve all the links in the set as they would never
finish the task.

The point is that what I want to do as an author is to specify a set of
"must know" documents and say that the other links are to be used on a need
to know basis.

See above. It is unbounded in the sense that there are no constraints on
where you have to look. You do not need to look for all links at all levels
up to a specific point. It is a set of objects in unbounded web space. (I
considered using Non-bounded, but could not pronoince NWOS!)

It is highly dangerourns if the requirement is, as in the HyTime BOS
definition, that you must identify all linked files to any level if no
constraints are applied. If, however, you are referring to just resolving
what you now call a Session BOS it is not dangerous.

This is OK if they do not have any linkends in my BOS, but if they have
linkends in the referenced documents BOS and that is inherited then they are
likely to be irrelevant. Again we seem to be talking about different things!

He should not publish an incomplete review!!!

This is the point of our misunderstanding. How can a user know whether he
should add it or not?

A user of a document set needs guidance from the author to know whether he
should extend his BOS when he does a specific traversal. My readers cannot
know the relevance of my links to future traversal possibilities until after
they have traversed them. As an author I could suggest that this set could
usefully be added. (For example, if they are referencing another of my hub
documents that is constantly referred to from this one I want to suggest
that they add the BOS as otherwise they will constantly be swapping BOS sets.)

I'm thinking in terms of recording History's (nested BOS sets) in the way
you currently can Bookmarks, to save having to regenerate them each time you
revisit the site. (This is important for my users, who will often want to
break off a session and return to it at a later date with all the BOS
information in place.)

Agreed, but I was hoping that a Session BOS would be reusable. You obviously
are not thinking along such lines, but might like to reconsider.

But wouldn't it be nice to ask AltaVista to search for all XML locators that
pointed to a particular electronic copy of The Gathering Storm? My wife, who
is a reference librarian, would just love such a facility to help her deal
with just the sort of query you have used to ridicule my idea above. The
point is that XML on the Web should allow us to overcome some of the
restrictions we find in today's unautomated world.

Yes, but publishers and information owners are only a small part of the Web
community. If you are saying that XML is only for publishers and information
owners then you better make this clear to the world upfront. Most of us
believe that XML has a wider potential. I personally prefer to think of the
web as a research tool. Thats how I use it every day.

You used the term HyTime BOS. By definition, therefore, you did say,
indirectly, "any file linked to any file that is referenced should be
recorded as part of the BOS."
