Great!

I agree that it is a much more fortunate and natural syntax for fixed
anchor roles.

Sure, in fact, I think we could easily make agglink work for both cases:
  Add back and anchrole attribute to agglink, and require that it contain
at least one role. Add a rule stating that if the agglink has more anchors
than anchor roles, then the last role applies to all the anchors whose
locations are expressed last. You can think of this as an "anchor model"
where the last anchor role has an implicit * on it. Of course it would be
nice if there were a way to to integrate this with the clink/ilink
distinction. One way would be to say the any content of an agglink is an
anchor like a clink's but if the content model is EMPTY, then it functions
link an ilink. I don't know if this kind of case-switching is part of the
HyTime meta-language, but it's not too complicated.
