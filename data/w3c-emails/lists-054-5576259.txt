   Experience with solely executable link specifications (Hypercard is the
canonical horrible example) has shown that it makes analysis somewhere
between difficult (got to read code to find out what it does), to
impossible (this is a turing-complete problem, and thus uncomputable, in
general).

   So I think we need declarations so we don't have to write analysis
programs to determine whether code such as:

   If (subroutine to determine that Goldbach's conjecture is true) then
goto document X else ignore click.

   is a link, or not!

   If we hve such computation links they should be a special case, rather
than the only case, so that common links are easily processable.
