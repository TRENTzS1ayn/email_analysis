Since we have gone to great lengths to enable an Explorer or
Navigator-equivalent to avoid processing DTDs, we can't afford to require
them for linking behavior to work. This is only my opinion, but it's sure a
hard case to make as part of a sales pitch. Same for the attribute values
-- the redundancy will be noticable, and make XML look foolish, when it is
in fact merely being punctilious.

   I was not suggesting stylesheets as the primary linking strategy, but as
a way for authors to deal with the practical facts of life. _I_ might be
willing to live with the attribute values, but I doubt most users would...
I think that we could even (if technically feasible) try to define things
so that link-style processing could not be invoked by markup if the
archform were not present _if a DTD were parsed_. The problem is that we
then need two processing semantics for identical markup: and that also
seems very problematic to me.

   I agree that having only code as the definition of links is a horrible
fate: you can't even gurantee whether or not something is a link, in that
case. As I mentioned to Gavin, Hypercard is the horrible example of a
system that made this mistake.
