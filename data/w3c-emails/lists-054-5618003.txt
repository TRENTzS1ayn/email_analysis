I definitely agree. I think nothing that has been proposed will actually
make things complex. The problem is that we have to rationalize all of the
(slightly) divergent models of the participants -- and that is more complex
than the actual proposals.

So far we really have agreed on the 80% (I think):
   clinks. (ordinary links), stored at one endpoint pointing somewhere else.
   ilinks. Links separately stored from both endpoints
   Multi-way links (an extension of both sorts of link) for annotation and
knwoledge representation.
   Logical document part addressing. Now that we have structured XML
documents, we want to be able to use that structure as an addressing
mechanism.

I hope these things meet those criteria. To make that clear, we will have
to show examples of how to solve problems with the new constructs, but I am
sure that that is easy and will happen.

It's a _critical application_ I think, because of the (erroneous)
identification of HTML and Hypertext in the minds of the world at large.

In practice they are very simple -- it's jsut a way to base processing on
attribute values. The explanations to date have concentrated on explaining
how to use architectural forms to describe markup. But in the XML linking
spec, we will only have to describe how to set attributes to make links --
the application of a fixed set of AFs to an arbitrary document.

   This should be a lot easier to explain than the general case. AFs are
becoming a very productive method of DTD standardization, and we might as
well use them.

I think we are moving to curb the eventual concept space to a small number
of easily definable items. I think we can avoid use of Hytime terminology
except where it is the best choice, and must define our terms clearly and
independently of HyTime in any case.

I think we are converging on that subset, and will be able to settle on a
subset of (possibly simplified) HyTime terms for XML linking.

but XML authors will, and implementers will

I have been using Tim's revised terminology, where an anchor is an element
introduced solely to be referenced. We should only care enough that we have
the words we need to write the definition.

> The will think an "anchor

Well, we could change the term to "jelly roll" for a tastier standard.

yes, I hope we introduce no more than we need to satisfy this need.

That's why I prefer the terms "parse tree" or "abstract syntax tree" to
"grove", "grove plan" and their friends.

Maybe we should be calling "locations", "addresses", and "queries", "pointers".

In practice, I think we will be OK as long as we don't have the terms
"locator", "location", "location address", "external location address
pointer", etc. all floating around with slightly different meanings.

 Or even a separate document, for those who need it.
