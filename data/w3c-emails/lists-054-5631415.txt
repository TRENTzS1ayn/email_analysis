Users are going to make these decisions on whatever basis they make
them.  Let me make this question a little more concrete.  "Do I want
to wait while this whole goddam recommended BOS is assembled, or do I
just want to see what's at the other end of this hyperlink, and to
hell with whatever may be linked to it by other things in the
recommended BOS?"  This is just like asking how a user can assess
whether to spend some unknown portion of his irreplaceable lifetime
traversing a hyperlink on the World Wide Wait.  Sometimes it's worth
it.  Sometimes it's not.  Usually such decisions are based on
extremely practical considerations, like the fact that a perfectly
good hot meal is getting cold.

So declare the BOS in a separate document that serves as the hub.
Sounds like that solves the problem, to me.
