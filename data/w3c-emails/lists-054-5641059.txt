Yeah, this didn't work.  The HyTime Technical Corrigendum does it
differently.  In the TC, there is a common data attribute that
optionally appears on each entity declaration which separately
declares for that entity how deeply to recurse.  There are a couple of
other features, too.

No.  I'm embarrassed that I was so unclear.  I was not proposing that
the BOS represents a set of intellectual property.  I was proposing
that an ilink (now "hylink" in HyTime) be used to express the fact
that document A contains the intellectual property notices that govern
documents B, C, and D.  The hylink can be in document A, B, C, D, or
E.  Whatever document the hylink is in must be guaranteed to be in the
BOS, or the application won't know about it and therefore can't
display the legal notices.  (That's where the BOS notion comes in.)  I
was also saying that any document which contains a link that is used
to traverse to another document is itself guaranteed to be in the BOS,
unless the user takes special pains to delete it from the BOS after
arriving.  So, BOS discipline can be relied upon to guarantee that
legal notices (and, needless to say, any other annotations) can be
made available from within read-only documents which themselves
contain no evidence that such notices/annotations exist.

There are additional details, but that's the fundamental idea.
