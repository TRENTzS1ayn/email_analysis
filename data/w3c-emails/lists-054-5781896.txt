Just to clarify the point: the only reason I can see for the distinction
between validating and non-validating parsers is that validating parsers
must resolve all entities *before* they can claim a document to be valid,
(one of the goals of parsing) whereas in non-validating systems, the chief
goals can be met without necessarily resolving all entities.

In neither case is there a limitation of resolving entities before parsing
can proceed beyond the entity reference, nor is there a restriction on
pre-fetching entities.
