Yes, but we are not proposing that XML be SGML conformant, just that an
SGML-comformant processor be able to parse XML.

Well, given the work that Steve DeRose and others in SGML OPEN expended on
finding all the state-dependencies in the SGML grammar, I believe him when
he says we _already have_ guaranteed that. Or do you have a context
dependency in mind tath we have not already eliminated.

I'm afraid the only thing I can say is that this would be a stupid
restriction: it is not enforceable by any processor, _and_ it would make
impossible many useful applications of XML on the Web, that will
necessarily involve databases and synamic document generation. It is the
responsibility of a dynamic document implementor to produce valid XML, if
they want to validate it.

What is the point of trying to make a rule that is easy to violate, blocks
useful applications of XML, and cannot be enforced by software?
