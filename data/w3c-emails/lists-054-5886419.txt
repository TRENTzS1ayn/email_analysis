I hadn't thought about it before, but it seems easier to add a little more
to the element declaration production (and corresponding pattern matching
regexps) than to require changing 99% of existing declarations to work with
XML.  It's only two additional two-character optional OR groups:  ([O\-],
S*, [0\-])?
