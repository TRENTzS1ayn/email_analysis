I realize it's a bit strange to allow no-op characters, but new XML DTDs 
simply won't use them.  The problem is not so much explaining these tokens 
to new XML users; it's making existing DTDs usable in XML.  I'm not
saying new XML DTDs should *require* this field, just allow it.

The difference between OMITTAG and SHORTREF is that pretty much *every*
DTD today includes the OMITTAG field, even if just "- -", partly because 
the SGML declaration (where OMITTAG is set to YES or NO) is a component of 
SGML documents as a whole, and DTDs technically don't automatically
"come with" their own SGML declaration.

For me, this definitely comes under the heading of deciding whether or
not to punish existing SGML users.
