I agree--no harm in allowing them.

However, note that 8879 _permits_ (but doesn't _require_) that that
parameter be omitted if the SGML declaration doesn't permit OMITTAG.

So, with care one could use the stripped DTD for XML and SGML under
some scenarios.  Although I can certainly imagine where one might
require an OMITTAG DTD as well, and in that case it would be convenient
to be able to have the omitted tag minimization parameter present and
ignored.
