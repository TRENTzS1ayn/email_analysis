Given that the current XML draft doesn't support
parameter entities, name groups for ELEMENT and ATTLIST
declarations, AND groups, content models denoting
mixed content where #PCDATA appears anywhere other
than as the _first_ token in a repeatable OR group,
inclusion and exclusion exceptions, and probably a few
others, it looks like XML-SGML compatibility will be
pretty much limited to document instances in any case.

Since most SGML users will have to rewrite their DTDs
to make them XML-able anyway, leaving out the omitted
tag minimization parameter doesn't seem like that big
a deal...
