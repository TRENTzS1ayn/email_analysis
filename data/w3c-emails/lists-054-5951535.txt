But rewriting them so that the content models obey the
restrictions is a one-shot thing, and then you can
continue to deal with those documents using the new
DTD with its new content models in both SGML and XML

The point of Eve's proposal is to avoid having to
continue to maintain both versions.  That to me
_does_ "seem like that big a deal...".
