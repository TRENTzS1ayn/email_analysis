Don't forget: you also have to expand all the parameter
entity references, replace things like:

<!ELEMENT (a|b|c) - - (long, hairy, model)>

with

<!ELEMENT a (long, hairy, model)>
<!ELEMENT b (long, hairy, model)>
<!ELEMENT c (long, hairy, model)>

and change things like:

<!ELEMENT x - - (a & b & c)>

into:

<!ELEMENT x ( (a, ((b,c) | (c,b)))
    | (b, ((a,c) | (c,a)))
    | (c, ((a,b) | (b,a))) )  >


Heaven help you if you're using something like
TEI, DocBook, or IBM ID Doc...

I for one do not relish the thought of maintaining
even a moderately large DTD after expanding all
the parameter entities...

Point taken, but I think it will take more than just
allowing "- -" in the XML grammar to make this feasible.
I could live without AND groups, but parameter entities and
the ability to specify more than one associated element
type in <!ELEMENT ...> and <!ATTLIST ...> declarations are
essential.
