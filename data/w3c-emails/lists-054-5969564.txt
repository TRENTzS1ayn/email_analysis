Often I find that even the DTD syntax is not powerful enough to express the
particular semantics and element-context linkages I want to express
elegantly (e.g. OOP-style "inheritance"). The solution may be to code in
something entirely unlike DTDs (for instance one of the instance syntax
languages we have discussed) and down-translate. Eve's suggestion would seem
to allow ONE down-translation instead of two.
