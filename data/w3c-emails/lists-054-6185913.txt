Note that the lower case mapping doesn't work for the various
forms of French -- as it notes.
Also, using lower case as the canonical form, whilst better than upper
case in terms of having more distinct symbols, is also not backwards
compatible with SGML.
I think that case sensitivity is easier to explain, works in all
cases, and can be represented by a confrming SGML declaration.

On the implications of case folding, I'd say ask Martin Duerst or
Glenn Adams directly.
