A syntaxctic entity refrence, as the discussion makes clear.

As far as the text says, no. What is not forbidden is permitted. Therefore
the requirement is wisely not made!

This makes some sense in a DP environment with fixed files for entities,
but not on the web, as I have argued before.

Entity attributes are not _included_ in the document however, so the
functionality of a normal entity reference is not provided.

They can create such systems on top of XML if it is useful. I do not expect
that anyone will be soe moved. We should defnitely not attempt the
foolishness of wagging our fingers at users and saying "naughty, naughty,
you used variable replacement text!" XML requirements are requirements for
the parser to enforce conditions. Ipso facto, we cannot make requirements
that we cannot enforce.
