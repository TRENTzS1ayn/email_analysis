I'm really confused by the assertion that parsing the SGML text produces
"the same data."  The same data as what?  If you exclude cases where
the entity is manually or automatically created/revised (you have to
have created the entity somehow, and once created, it might need to be
changed), then this is a tautology: It's the same data as itself.  What
am I missing?
