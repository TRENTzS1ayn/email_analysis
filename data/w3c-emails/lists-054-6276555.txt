Quick, before a final vote can go in, we would like to plead for both 
internal and external paramter entities.  The utility of these to a 
creator of modular DTDs is obvious.  Therefore, I need them, want them, 
would give them up only with regret.

May I please hear the other side?  ARE they (particluarly the external) 
very hard to build into a parser or perl hack.  Please be specific?
Is the objection to external based on Web resolving?

Is their presence a real problem for smaller, simpler implementations?
