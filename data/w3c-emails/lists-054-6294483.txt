I can't speak for Charles, but I interpret that part of 8879 to mean that
a text entity referenced twice in the same document should give the same
replacement text for both references during the same parse.

This sounds reasonable--so that one wouldn't have to keep re-downloading
the same entity every time it is referenced.

I recommend this much "staticness" is text entities.  I think SDATA is
the appropriate place for funny tricks.
