I just realized that my vote said "no", which I intended to mean "no
conref", not "no, we will have conref".  Oops.  Not that it affected the
outcome.  But I didn't want people to think I'm so tied to the essoterica
of SGML that I'd vote to keep one of features that precludes
declaration-less parsing.

One possible solution that might be worth proposing for SGML97 is a new
attribute specification syntax for conref attributes so that elements with
conref attributes are self describing as for XML empty elements.

Cheers,

E.
