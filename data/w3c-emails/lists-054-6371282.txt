I agree. Furthermore, I'm more than a little troubled by PI kludges of any
kind for parsing. In general, aren't PIs application level information? The
notion that a XML parser (as a potentially independent/separable
module/program) needs to peek into PIs, strikes me as just the kind of poor
design that motivated "Server Side Includes" or Javascript inside erstwhile
comments. OTOH, if we kept it clean, we'd still require (i) every
application to call back into the parser to inform it about a <?XML ...> PI,
and (ii) this round trip would have to occur before any further parsing. All
of this (in an effort to be clean) puts even greater burdens on the
app/parser interface/API; to take arms against this sea of troubles,
programmers *will* take the kludge short-cut -- and open the gates to all
sorts of PIs for parsers to peek into and act upon.

Blech.

Agree again.

This is the crux of the matter, IMHO.
