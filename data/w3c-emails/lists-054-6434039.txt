Oh.

Well, in that case, my interest in XML is considerably reduced.

In that case, the problem needed to be stated more clearly, I think.
Or mayby I am the only one who thought that the intent was to attract
people (and programmers) who do not today use SGML, and for applications
for which neither HTML nor SGML is used today?

In that case, you can delete this silly empty element nonsense.
Neither Netscape nor Microsoft will stop adding EMPTY elements just
because some hastily-designed SGML database report writing language
has a wired-in list of EMPTY elements.

I think we're all taking different drugs here.
