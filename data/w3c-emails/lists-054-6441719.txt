| Oh.

| Well, in that case, my interest in XML is considerably reduced.

Perhaps you should check out the W3C Activity Page that I keep
referring to:

| In that case, the problem needed to be stated more clearly, I think.
| Or mayby I am the only one who thought that the intent was to attract
| people (and programmers) who do not today use SGML, and for applications
| for which neither HTML nor SGML is used today?

The delivery of structured data to Web clients *is* an application for
which neither HTML nor SGML is widely used today.

Attracting HTML users to SGML is something that all of us would like
to get out of this activity.  That does not mean that it is the
primary goal of the activity.

There are a number of goals being balanced here.  They do not all have
the same priority.  Only one of them can be given top priority.  That
is the one specified in the activity statement.  The fact that one
goal must be given top priority does not mean that there are not other
goals.  It just means that they do not all have exactly the same
priority.

| In that case, you can delete this silly empty element nonsense.
| Neither Netscape nor Microsoft will stop adding EMPTY elements just
| because some hastily-designed SGML database report writing language
| has a wired-in list of EMPTY elements.

Now you're assuming that the intent is to grandfather HTML documents
again.  We don't care how many additional empty elements NS/MS wire
into their browsers.  The idea behind the strategy adopted by the ERB
is that it is possible to construct documents that will be XML
documents and HTML documents at the same time.  Adding more empty tags
to an HTML browser has no effect on such documents.
