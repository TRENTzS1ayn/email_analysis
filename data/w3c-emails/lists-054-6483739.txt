Mass delivery of large documents IS something that neither HTML nor SGML is
used for today. I'm pretty sure I can't acess Jon's Shakespeare collection
over the Web without downloading new, complex software (unless he is serving
them through DynaWeb, which is not affordable for many of us). If we could
easily create print and online versions of annual reports, manuals, etc., we
_would_ be able to attract people and programmers who do not today use SGML.

Again, the goal isn't to support HTML "du jour", but provide a smooth
migration path from HTML to XML for the short term. People will convert
their HTML documents into Extended-HTML (HTML plus their own tags) while
they wait for robust XML support, and then turn their XHTML into XML when
HTML-only browsers are a bad memory.
