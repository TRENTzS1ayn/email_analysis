I'm not sure about the "its easily understood" statement. 0646 row 20 has a
group of 12 "spaces", two of which are em-quad and en-quad and the rest are
named as spaces, including something known as a punctuation space. I suspect
that if we don't treat em-quad and en-quad as spaces, but treat the rest of
them as such we will be OK but I'm not convinced. Personally I think of
space of a defined width as being different from a separator, and what we
are talking about here is the use of spaces as separators in markup rather
than separators in data. I can't really see people entering
four-per-em-spaces in an attribute value, though I can see them trying to
enter a zenkaku space in a Japanese attribute value
