(1) the entire bible is only approx. 5 MBytes -- not exactly a large
    database.  (I don't mean to denigrate what Jon did, by the way, but
    it pales to insignificance in terms of size when compared to the
    Novell online documentation, for example)

(2) It's accessible today in Panorama; whether you call Panorama complex or
    not may depend on how much of the source you've seen :-) but it's
    certainly affordable!

I agree.  Of course, empty elements aren't related to that.
And neither is downloading SGML databases over the internet...

Then why wire in a list of HTML "du jour" EMPTY elements into
XML perpetuity?  The same program that converts today's HTML into XML
can change <BR> to <BR/> if it likes.
