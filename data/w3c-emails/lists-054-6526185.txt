My quick re-reading of the WD doesn't answer the following for me:

Is white space normalization done "before" or "after" entity
expansion.  In other words, if a text entity starts, ends, or consists
of white space characters, does white space normalization occur (1) for
consecutive whitespace within the entity replacement text and/or (2)
for the concatenation of the whitespace preceding the entity ref and
the whitespace at the beginning of the replacement text?  Likewise, if
a character reference is to a whitespace character (other than NBSP or
any other for which ws normalization is defined not to occur anyway),
does ws normalization occur wrt all the replacement texts?
