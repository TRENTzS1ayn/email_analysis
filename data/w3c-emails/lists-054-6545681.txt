Sure. But what if Jon wants to publish those to his Bible Study Group? Or
publish his Shakespeare collection to his Shakespeare scholar's collection
group? Do we expect them all to download Panorama? What about those that are
using terminals in libraries, or other people's computers?

If 
 a)Panorama were a standard part of Netscape or IE, 
 b)it had display mechanisms were based on standards (i.e. DSSSL-O), 
 c)it had performance on par with regular web browsers, 

then XML would be irrelevant. Simple SGML would still be important, but that
would be an ISO project, not a W3C one. XML should be ubiquitous (and thus
simple), standards-based, and fast (and thus simple).

They are related to that, through simplicity. If we can make parsing
simpler, we will get better browser support, and thus ubiquity. We will also
get better performance.

Because the ERB is _!NOT!_ interested in compatibility with HTML _documents_
but with EXISTING HTML BROWSERS! They want to be able to do this, in the
short term:

<P>This is an <ABBREV>HTML-like</ABBREV> document with <ABBREV>TEI<ABBREV>
style <gi>date</gi> elements, written on <date value='1980-02-21'>21 Feb
1980</date>. It also has a <ABBREV>TEI<ABBREV> header (though it is not
shown here). Thanks to the magic of <ABBREV>CSS</ABBREV> style sheets, and
<ABBREV>HTML</ABBREV> convention, the <ABBREV>TEI</ABBREV> tags can either
disappear, or be mapped to special formatting for existing browsers.
