I wish I had known that the entire reason for XML was a performance issue
in Panorama.  It would have saved a lot of people a lot of work.
If we released a Netscape plugin version of Panorama (that also worked in
MSIE), included DSSSL-O support, and made it faster, XML would be a
waste of time?

I don't actually agree with this, by the way...

It will only be ubiquitous if lots of tools support it.

True, I concede that point -- which is why I wanted to use a form other
than <e> or <e a=value> for all EMPTY element.  I don't see how having
a fixed list of XML elements that are EMPTY for all XML documents, such
as BR, HR, IMG, META, LINK and so forth makes things easier.  Your TEI
documents had better not use any of those GIs except as EMPTY elemnts...

What you show does not contain any elements, and for all your shouting :-),\
does not answer my question.

RFC 1866 says that unrecognised elements are ignored.
A CSS-based browser must treat all those elements as if they were not there.
It is not allowed to let you assocuate styles with them, and, if it
does, is buggy (albeit useful).
