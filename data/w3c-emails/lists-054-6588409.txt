Sure.  It appears I was mistaken about the intentions of the ERB with
respect to using existing SGML tools.  I'm sorry for the misinformation,
but I hope my early, relatively semi-private confusion (more private
than in front of hundreds at SGML '96 or thousands elsewhere) allows
us all to benefit.

I have heard it clearly now that XML is a subset of SGML, even if most
existing SGML will require some, admittedly minor, conversion to turn
it into valid (or well-formed) XML.

Is there anything else that needs to be done to your standard SGML 
declaration for a Basic document other than
DELIM GENERAL SGMLREF PIC "?>" 
and
NAMECASE GENERAL NO

and whatever has to be done to the character set description (and
ignore capacities and quantities) to get it to be sufficient (if
admittedly more than necessary) to allow an SGML parser to parse
valid XML properly (disregarding the RE/space detail)?
