This is one of a series of reports on recent decisions of the SGML ERB.

D.3 XML shall specify a short-hand element declaration
keyword (e.g. %ANY-ELEMENT;) for element content in which any
element in the DTD is legal (same as ANY, but element not mixed
content).

Decision: No.  Dissenting: DeRose, Hollander.

(Note: several members of the ERB feel that this should be dealt with
in the SGML revision.)
