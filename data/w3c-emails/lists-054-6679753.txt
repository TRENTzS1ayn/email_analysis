I'm quite glad, then, since case sensitivity was problematic for me.
Sorry, I must have missed that decision.  In that case, we can just

Of course, 8879:1986 doesn't break down all the options/features
in such a way that one could give a precise (necessary and sufficient)
8879:1986 SGML decl for XML, but it would be useful to publish the
sufficient and closest-to-necessary-as-possible-given-8879:1986 SGML
declaration for XML.
