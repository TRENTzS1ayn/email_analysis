In its meeting of Thursday, November 7, the SGML ERB decided that for
purposes of the XML 1.0 specification, the 8879 rules for case folding
in markup shall be extended by folding lowercase to uppercase
according to the Unicode mapping tables (see previous correspondence
in the WG for an exhaustive list).

Abstaining: Clark, Hollander.
