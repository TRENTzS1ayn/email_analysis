If it is possible to declare entities in XML, it would be unfortunate
if my file did
    <!Entity prod "SoftQuad HoTMetaL Pro 3.0">
and an SGML browser showed &prod; as I expect, but
the XML browser showed a Greek capital letter PI instead (the mathemtical
PROD symbol referred to by the prod entity).

I also have a file with a list of night clubs formatted as a list,
    <LIST>clubs;</LIST>
:-)

So I don't think this is a good idea.  If you can define any entitiy,
you should be able to change them all.  If you can't define them.
and will never be able to, it's not an issue.

If you want to represent predefined entities, either do it in a way
that is less likely to conflict, or stick to the accented chracters
in iso8859-1.

For example, using a prefix of sym for symbol and char for a character,
one would have 
    char.aleph
    sum.prod
and so on.  If the SDATA entities here are intended to represent glyphs
rather than characters (which is wht I suspect) then
    glyph.Aacute
isn't too bad.
