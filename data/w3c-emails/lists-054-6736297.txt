A few of the entity names are rendered on the Netscape 3.0 and MS Internet
Explorer 3.0 with suprising results.

A trailing ";" concluding an entity name for which there is a shorter
valid entity name prefix is retained as part of the text following the entity
substitution in Netscape.

That trailing ";" is discarded by MS Internet Explorer but the excess
characters are retained. 

In both browsers at least one substitution is for a wrong character:
&notin; is recognized by both browsers as &not   and either "in;" or "in"
is retained after that substitution for the not, a known entity in ISO Latin 1.

Cedilla; should be cedilla; 

What is the basis for picking up the Adobe symbol font?

Netscape retains the form of unrecognized entities.

Internet Explorer retains the prefix of unrecognized entities, discarding
the ";".

Adobe Symbol Font
===================
Only ones I found supported are:

                    keeps in; or in    keeps in; or in
