| A few of the entity names are rendered on the Netscape 3.0 and MS
| Internet Explorer 3.0 with suprising results.

I'm not surprised.  :-)

| In both browsers at least one substitution is for a wrong character:
| &notin; is recognized by both browsers as &not and either "in;" or
| "in" is retained after that substitution for the not, a known entity
| in ISO Latin 1.

That's actually correct at this point.  "notin" is one of the entities
that got approved at the recent HTML ERB meeting but is not part of
the HTML standard yet.  The entities on Bob's list that appear under
"Adobe Symbol Font" are not part of the current HTML 3.2 spec but will
be part of Cougar.

| Cedilla; should be cedilla; 

Right.

| What is the basis for picking up the Adobe symbol font?

The symbol font is supported on all the common Web browser platforms.

| Current anomalies in support:
| >ISO Latin 1
| >=======            Netscape 3.0       MS Internet 
| 
| &die; die           unknown,           ok
|                     keeps &die;
| 
| &macron; macron     ok but as macr     ok but as macr
|                     keeps on; or on    keeps on or on

They're right; this should be "macr".

| &degree; degree     ok but as deg      ok but as deg
|                     keeps ree; or ree  keeps ree or ree

They're right; this should be "deg".

| &Cedilla; Cedilla   unknown, keeps all ok+keeps la
| (should be &cedilla;
| as lower-case)       &cedilla ok,      ok
|                      keeps la; or la   keeps la la

They're right; this should be "cedilla".

| Adobe Symbol Font
| ===================
| Only ones I found supported are:
| 
| >notin              wrong symbol       wrong symbol
|                     keeps in; or in    keeps in; or in
| 
| >trade              unknown,           ok, as raised 
|                     keeps all          smallcap TM

Right, none of the symbol set is officially supported yet.

Thanks for your help with this, Harvey.
