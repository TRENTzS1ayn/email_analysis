I don't want anyone to think I'm trying to start a "but what about
my favorite entity" sort of discussion, and I'll be okay with any
decision, but by way of an FYI, here are by far the 4 most used entity
refs in your average Adept text document (not counting &lt; and &amp;
for escaping purposes as already covered in XML by earlier decisions):

&ldquo;, &rdquo; (left double quote and right double quote)
since Adept automatically puts in your standard (as
far as publishing goes) directional double quotes 
when the user hits the " key.  These two entity refs
appear in practically every document created by Adept.

&mdash;, &ndash; since Adept automatically puts in your
standard (as far as publishing goes) appropriate
dash type when the user hits the - key twice or when
they hit the - key between two digits.

The quotes are in "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Numeric and Special Graphic//EN"
and the dashes in "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Publishing//EN".  I note that
none of these four are in the set Jon distributed.
