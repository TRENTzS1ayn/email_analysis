I think this is useful.

None of these are in Latin 1 or the Adobe Symbol font (you can't substitute
the dash from Symbol for a GillSans-UltraBold dash anyway, of course).
But they are available on all major platforms, whth more or less effort
from developers.

But I agree that it would be good to include them.

Please don't specify the replacement text in the XML spec, though, but
only the UNICODE character and/or the intended glyph.  For example, I
might want double quotes to come out 4 points larger than usual --
not uncommon in magazine or newspaper publishing -- and I won't be able
to do that in XML by altering the "standard, fixed" entities.

I can do it using new entities that themselves include the
old ones, of course:
    <!Entity open-quote "<BIG>&ldquo;</BIG>">
in systems that are sufficiently smart.

I don't understand the point of being so careful about prefixing
all XML names with -XML- earlier, and now suddenly deciding to add
several screens' worth of fixed keywords that are not so prefixed.
I sense a severe case of Rapidly Encroaching Deployment Elegant Architecture
Reduction Syndrome -- RED EARS :-)
