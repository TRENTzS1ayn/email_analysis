Yes it would. As Paul Prescod has pointed out, IE and NS 3.0 can both accept
end-tags for empty elements. So XML-to-be-read-by-HTML-browsers can have
<img></img>. As you claim it is not an objective for XML to "grandfather"
existing HTML, there is no need to support <img> without an end-tag, and
therefore no need to pollute XML with knowledge of specific element types.
