| Correction: I think Jon meant to say 'as though declarations for the
| predefined entities are encountered at the beginning of the internal
| DTD subset.'  This makes all user declarations of those entities
| into *re*declarations, and renders them nugatory.

Sorry, I picked up the wrong version of this from my notes.
