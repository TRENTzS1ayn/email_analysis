(No matter where the REs are, the *document* would still be valid SGML. 
It's the *parser behavior* which would differ slightly from "XML 
processor" behavior...)

Regarding *writing* XML, it's certainly possible for existing tools
to need adjustment.  Most SGML-aware editors normalize things like
NET.  In order to write them out again, they'd need to be modified.
(Not that this is achingly hard to do.)

The problem is that only one NOTATION attribute is allowed on any
one attlist, and this would be a major invasion of the user's markup
design space.  (If 8879 were to relax this, it could open up a whole
new way to do architectural forms!)
