Yes, but which recommendations?  Sorry to be obtuse.  I don't see how
the W3C can usefully make general recommendtions about entity sets in
all languages -- they're not available in C, for example!  I'm not trying
to be awkward.  It is really not clear to me that a recommendation that
the W3C makes about HTML (presumably) should automatically apply to XML.

Earlier you said that the fixed wired-in list of EMPTY elements from
(an unspecified version of) HTML only applied in XML if the DOCTYPE was
HTML (and there was no DOCTYPE ... PUBLIC line), in order to activate
Kludge Mode.

Why does the fixed list of wired-in entity names work in all modes, and
not just Kludge Mode?

I don't have a problem with those names.

No.  I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.  I had two problems:
(1) introducing the Symbol names, seemingly from nowhere.
(2) predefining those Symbol entity names in such a way that they
    can't be overridden.  The ISO names were not intended to be used in
    that way, and are not suitable for such misuse.

No, but you shouted at me for daring to suggest that there were not
in fact millions of users for whom these names were part of the language.
What might or night not happen in six months has no bearing on that.
Netscape might demonstrate a browser with a million entity names in
it today, and thennot release it tomorrow.  Any company could.
And if they did release it, the markup might spread like wildfire or it
might be ignored.  We don't know yet.

Why?  Panorama will interpret such files over the Web today correctly,
using standard HTTP.  Or do you think the Web is HTML???
Or is this because they would be ignorant of unannounced private
demonstrations of what will be released in six months' time?  Calling
people ignorant for not knowing such things seems unreasonable to me.

I might have had less of a problem if I had used "eacute" as an example.
But I didn't.

It is my point.  Don't standardise on unsuitable things.
Well, as Vera Lynn might say, there are no angels treading here... :-)

Well, (1) I didn't know that and your announcement didn't mention it,
and (2) is Lynx going to be updated?  NCSA Mosaic on all platforms?
Or is ``all web browsers in the world'' actually only MSIE and Netscape
Navigator and any others written by fully paid-up W3C members?

I'm sorry if I seem like a peasant.  It's true that I don't know Latin.
I do not dislike entities, either.  I will try not to say any more on
this -- clearly I am out of place.  Sorry.
