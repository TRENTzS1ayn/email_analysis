I am not convinced. You can't just wire SP into a browser front-end and get
"SGML on the Web". It requires too much meta-data. SGML wasn't designed for
this environment, and it doesn't "fit". To get the performance we need, we
have to have a mechanism for signalling empty elements that does not involve
downloading the whole DTD.

In that case, we don't have to have a heated discussion of the issue,
because one way or another, the show goes on.

I don't know what you mean by this.

As far as I know, nobody is proposing any version of XML which is not SGML.
What is being proposed is encoding of new semantics within SGML compatible
syntax, which will require a post process to transform from the SGML
produced by most SGML tools to the SGML subset that is XML. It is still SGML.

Ever since I have been involved in SGML, proponents of it have used the term
"SGML" to mean "generic markup." When they (and I) describe the benefits of
SGML, they almost always describe it in terms of the benefits of generic
markup. So even if XML was an SGML-incompatible generic markup language, W3C
would be using _our_ loose terminology to describe their new technology. But
nobody is proposing that.

I dunno. I don't care. When it is in my best interest I will champion the
causes of big, stupid, nasty corporations. As you'll see in my tagline, I
like to encourage people to use Esso/Exxon or Texaco, because they are the
lesser of x evils. Microsoft and Netscape are the cable companies. We have
the content. We must conform to their content guidelines (no frontal nudity
or undistinguished empty elements!) if we want wide viewership. If we don't
want wide viewership, then we can just use our VCR (Panorama).

If you believe that full-blown SGML on the Web is feasible on today's
network, we can continue to work towards that goal. Standards compliance is
important, and I believe in it. But generic markup is important too -- more
important, in my hierarchy. Otherwise why not standardize troff back in 1986?

I want to make the generic markup Mass available to the laity. If that means
translating it out of Latin, and losing a certain connection to the past,
then so be it. It looks like the "translation" is going to be relatively
trivial (and, perhaps, non existant).

I think it is. Nobody wants to introduce incompatibility with existing tools
as a joke. My understanding is that fast, easy recognition of empty elements
is the ONLY reason for this new empty-element syntax. What do you think _is_
the issue?

Yes. SoftQuad tried. We tried at the University of Waterloo. In the end, we
decided to ship ESIS over the web. Panorama also requires a normalization
process, and STILL requires the DTD. You posit that a satisfactory product
can be built using today's network and today's processors without changing
the output of SGML tools. I do not believe it. I could be wrong. Even if it
is possible, that wouldn't make generic markup browsers ubiquitous, which is
my personal goal in this endeavour.

If NS and MS reject XML and ISO releases a competitor, then we have gambled
and lost, but lost only our time (which will SURELY be recycled into the ISO
work anyhow).

On the other hand, if NS and MS embrace XML, then we have transformed the
world's largest information system into a generic markup based system.
SGML-tool output can go through a trivial transform instead of an expensive
one. We can publish our documents without information loss to the ordinary
people who use the Web (as opposed to the "SGML community"). People with
thousands, instead of tens of thousands of dollars can publish generic
markup to this same massive readership. Users might start to demand generic
markup capabilities in word processors and "Web editors." We can "ramp up"
our style sheets from CSS to DSSSL-O to full DSSSL. We can deliver the "help
files" for our products in generic markup. SGML databases can be served on
the Web through a trivial CGI script.

"A Generic Markup Browser on Every Desktop"

I consider this a gamble with a million dollar prize and a 50/50 chance of
winning. And I suspect that most members of the SGML community (which, IMO,
is represented on the ERB) will be happy to take money from our new citizens
and do a good deed at the same time.
