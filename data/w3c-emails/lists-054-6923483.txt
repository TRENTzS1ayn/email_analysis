You didn't address this point, Eve.

Conforming SGML means that any conforming system will produce the same ESIS. At
present, an XML document is not conforming SGML.

True, but it is the parsing that determines conformance, and you haven't refuted
my point: XML at present is not conforming SGML.

Not at all. The notation attribute need only be attached to the document
element, as everything else is part of its content. Subelements can have their
own notations as well. This is certainly a smaller "invasion of the user's
markup design space" than the  use of dedicated empty element type names or
built-in entity declarations. And, it makes XML a conforming subset of SGML,
rather than a W3C competitor to ISO.
