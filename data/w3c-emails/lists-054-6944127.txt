So you will *wire* in a stylesheet and require Scheme parsing, and you 
will require the author base to become proficient programmers, and 
you will require the SGML industry to rewrite its applications and 
translate all of its large (Very Large, Paul) information so two 
browsers won't have too?

Excuse me, Paul; that's dumb on the face of it.  As for SP, no comment.
We aren't redesigning SGML here.  My thought was that we would try 
to see where we could do without features to get a better fit.  But 
it goes both ways.  I have no problem with <e/>.  That is trivial 
to fix.  You may find your government has more problems with it 
than we do.

Unfortunately, we must.  My feeling is that without some adjustment, 
credible members of the SGML community and ISO are being used to 
lend credibility to the incredible.

Every time a requirement to satisfy the requirements of the
international 
standards requires a bit of work, arguments appear that we don't need
this.  Every time we require an adjustment to HTML, we see silly 
kludges.  That is nonsense.  Again, I don't care about </e>.  But 
grandfathering tags from HTML, that is ludicrous.  It's bad design for 
the sake of politics and the personal and economic advantages of those 
empowered to vote.   You are willing to wreck the relationships of 
W3C to WG8, split the SGML community, dilute both markets, whatever, 
to keep your privileges and browser.  See Scottish history and 
a fellow named Wallace:  "a parcel o' rogues in a nation".

So, yes, I think this must be discussed now before this goes one 
step further.  This is the easy part of this design.  The next 
part is a lot harder.  Decide now so some of us can decide 
where we can best focus our own efforts.

See Charles' posts to Eve.  He says no.  He is the most credible
authority 
in this working group.

If it is a W3C competitor to ISO, it is a bald faced failure.

Your TV must be wildly different from mine.  None of those content 
guidelines are obeyed.  They are given lip service.  Pardon, but that 
I can get on any street corner.  I champion the cause of corporations 
when it makes good sense, technically or economically.  Otherwise, 
when they are wrong, they are wrong.  MS was not able to move the 
VRML community precisely because the self-interested yielded to the 
greater good, and because they valued the ownership of their own work.
The tactics of the Mafia don't work well when the store owners resist.

They tried.  But full-blown SGML is not what we are discussing. 
Otherwise, 
this work would not be needed.  I only object to grandfathering HTML to 
the exclusion of any other considerations.  I am reasonably pleased 
with the other decisions.  Truth is, in XML 1.0 I would be quite a bit 
more restrictive, but I yield to those who insist that IGNORE and
INCLUDE, 
parameter entities, etc. are of "great value".  In most cases, I am 
confident these individuals are protecting their own interests, but 
I defer on issues I can ignore.

A work for your deity might deserve more respect.  That is a personal 
decision.  But if you alter the word of God and consider that trivial, 
one might wonder about the depth of your worship.  Convenience in 
some things is mortal, not venal.  

Yet this is technology and legal, validatible agreements; contract law,
not holy canons.

Grandfathering HTML vs political suicide.  Not my term.  Part of the 
explanation for the ERB vote.

Try shipping markup.  Try NOT doing full blown SGML.  Try shipping
groves.
Try a lot of things, but don't claim because you couldn't do it, others 
can't.  I use a very simple form of SGML everyday.  It works nicely.
I did not say we would not change the output of SGML tools.  We just 
don't use a lot of features.

That isn't gambling; a gambler bets odds.  That is a rejected design.
It is a failure to implement.

No we haven't.  They have.  I doubt they will unless economics compels 
it.   NS shows absolutely no interest, and MS won't even do us the 
courtesy of participation other than voting their interests.

Only if we build one.  Don't expect it otherwise.

I don't gamble.  That is for suckers.  As for who the ERB represents,
they 
represent themselves and possibly their companies.  So do I.  They vote 
and that becomes the spec.  I don't.  Them's the breaks, but hey, 
no one has to implement the thing if there is another more compelling 
competitor.  As it is said, "standards are nice; so many to choose
from".

No grandfathering of tags.  That is an application problem.
