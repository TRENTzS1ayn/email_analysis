I don't think Len's last statement is entirely fair.  In Microsoft's
defense, Jean Paoli, who's SGML credentials are as good as anybody's on the
ERB, has not simply "voted MS's interests" (to the degree that they could
even be meaningfully quantified).  Jean certainly argued for design aspects
that would make creating Web XML browsers easier and that fit well with the
general architecture most Web browsers use, but I don't recall him ever
arguing for anything that was wildly in conflict with SGML conformance.  Of
course, as we all know, the opinions of one employee and corporate policy
may be very different.  On the other hand, unless Chairman Bill is looking
over his shoulder (which I doubt), in this venue, Jean *does* define MS
policy and I am satisfied that it is consistent with and supportive of the
general XML goals of simplicity and SGML conformance (perhaps biased a bit
toward implementation ease, but a bias that is both needed in the group and
that is understandable given Jean's background and current assignment).

Cheers,

E.
