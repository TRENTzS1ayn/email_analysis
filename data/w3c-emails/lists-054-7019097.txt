Perhaps, but it is accurate.

Fine Eliot.  You hear the discussions; I don't.  Let Jean defend his 
decisions on the working group list.  Count the submissions:  0.

I don't question his credentials.  I watched Microsoft's participation 
in VRML:  it took a brickbat to get them play fair.  Perhaps Jean is 
different, but his personality or credibility are not at issue.  The 
participation of his company is, a participation that should be, for 
fairness sake, up front and public.  The personal policy and the 
corporate policy may not be the same, but the personal policy is 
the one we see on this list.  I simply hold him to a higher standard 
because he represents one of the only two credible sources for 
WWW HTML browsers which are being heavily defended.  If Microsoft 
has plans or positions, enunciate them and this *gamble* takes on 
less risk.

Ok?  Fair enough?
