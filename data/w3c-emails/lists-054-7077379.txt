I don't see what the LINK features have to do with ICADD. ICADD involves
adding architectural form attributes to elements. You can do that with
ATTLIST declarations and be done (which several DTDs have already,
admirably, done). Most existing software can look at those attributes and
condition formatting or other representational characteristics based on
those attributes.

Insisting that vendors implement LINK in order to support ICADD is the
surest way to be sure no one implements ICADD, which I think would be a tragedy.
