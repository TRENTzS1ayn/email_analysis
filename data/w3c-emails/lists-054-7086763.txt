Because we have all agreed to bite the bullet here. SGML'97 has the
opportunity to fix this problem for SGML, but we can't wait.

This is not true. The ESIS definition is not normative text. The standard
itself is hopelessly ambiguous on the subject of what is and is not to be
produced by an SGML processor, defining only a syntactic acceptance
procedure (Exoterica's whitepaper on whitespace is quite informative in
this regard). You may _wish_ that the ESIS was normative text, but it is
_not_.

But I have. Except for the attribute value thing. But that is still
impossible to justify in the absence of minimization, and you have already
declared that you would be willing to fix in in SGML '97. If we lead by a
year, what's the harm?
