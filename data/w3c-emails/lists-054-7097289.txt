  I agree with this, and would strongly support overridable predefined entities.

  Of course, that means that a DTD-less instance with redefined entities
will produce different results. I expect people could learn to live with
this, since those who create XML DTDs will have to learn how, and that
learning will lilkely include the details about overriding. I am sure that
the issue of DTD-free processing is what drove the committee to the
un-redefinability condition.

Nor for an author providing tagged data over the WWW to expect that it will
be compatible with other tagged data formats over the web.

These two reasonable expectations conflict. We have resolved these
conflicts in SGMLs favor (DTD syntax) and in HTML's favor (entities) and in
new ways altogether (end tags). I agree about overriding, but the issue of
expectations is very complex.

Well, that overlooks the fact that the Adobe characters are _easy to
implement_ on Unix, Mac, and PC. They won't do it because it's a good idea,
or because people need it, but because the standard says to, and it's
almost no extra work to implement it. I won't hold my breath waiting for
integrals or summations though. The mathemeticians are unlikely to accept
any notation other than TeX anyway, and for reasons that are actually
pretty good.

The suggestion was that the XML entity namespace agree with the W3C HTML
entity namespace when the standards officially issue (in some timeframe in
the future). That is why the proposal is in advance of current practice.
