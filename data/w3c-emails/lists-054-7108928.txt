I think what needs to be done is to define a grove plan for XML.  Given
such a grove plan, it is then meaningful to say something like "using the
XML grove plan, an XML document parsed by an SGML parser shall produce a
grove identical to the grove produced by an XML grove construction process
using the same grove plan."

Note the connection to the syntax of the source: it's not enough simply to
have some arbitrary syntax from which you can construct an SGML grove: it
must be possible for an SGML parser to produce the same grove from the same
source.

For example, the XML grove plan can exclude the "ignored markup" property,
thereby stating explicitly that "ignored" REs are in fact truly ignored, in
the sense that they will never be available to XML processors operating on
an XML document grove.

This would certainly provide a more precise definition than "ESIS".

Cheers,
