This is emminently sensible.  Accepting the grove concept would
certainly 
make the other pieces we need to consider easier to specify as well. 
ESIS 
has been a weakly defined concept for some time and has not given us the 
required precision in many cases.  That is why we have heard the term 
"beyondESIS" or "superESIS" too often.  I think this also establishes 
a precedent that will serve the W3C members well in other applications 
and language work if adopted.

What are the objections?
