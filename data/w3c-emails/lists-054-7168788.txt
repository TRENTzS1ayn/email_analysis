I'm pretty spacey after a day of standards meetings, but I second what I
think I hear Debbie saying here. There is "whitespace" which composition
systems, as well as SGML processors, have traditionally thrown away. Then
there is space which is special and which I don't want any system to mess
with. To Debbie's list I add the spaces that are part of the rhetoric of
mathematics, such as the one before the "dx" in an integral. And what about
italic correction? That's space that sometimes the user adds, but that may
also be added by a good composition system like TeX.

I've always been uneasy about SGML's handling of space, which seems overly
fussy from certain programming perspectives but unnecessary and downright
confusing from a user-interface perspective. (Sitting through a couple of
hours of discussions about the character-coding parts of the SGML
Declaration is good for reinforcing the suspicion that we work hard at
making things hard for ourselves. Hearing some notable parser writers'
comments on their sufferings tends to reinforce that suspicion.)

A lot of screen displays certainly aren't good enough to reproduce the old
typographers' use of space, but I don't think the issue will go away. The
mathematicians continue to use TeX because of its capabilities for
typographic expression, in spite of the rise of WYSIWYG systems. After a few
years of MacTacky, we've seen a return to concern for well-designed fonts. I
suspect that concern for spacing will return, too, as display technology
improves.
