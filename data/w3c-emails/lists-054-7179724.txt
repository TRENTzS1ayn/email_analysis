Wow! It's utterly amazing how quickly a whole lot of hard-earned
credibility can disappear in one fell swoop! All of the sometimes
eloquent, frequently lucid, always opinionated technical arguments
in defense of this or that feature/exclusion/modification just became
compromised in one decision of extremely questionable value.

I wish I had the time to express my feelings completely about the state
of affairs, but I don't (perhaps the better for all of us). So all I can
say is: "I just don't get it." I hear and understand your comments, Jon,
but I think you're (the ERB) talking out both sides of your mouth.

I agree wholeheartedly with all of the disagreement to this decision.
It never should have seen the light of day. Perhaps that's why it didn't
until it became a "decision."
