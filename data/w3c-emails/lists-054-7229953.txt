A new working draft of the XML spec is now available from

   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/standards/xml/spec/xml.rtf.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/standards/xml/spec/xml.ps.zip

This draft is only going to exist for about 48 hours; a final version
will be made available Thursday morning.  It differs from the draft
published last week chiefly in a reworked treatment of names and in
the addition of discussions of entities and conditional sections.
There is also now a table of all the predefined character entities in
an appendix at the end.  Yet to come are a treatment of ambiguous
content models, some stylistic changes, and some organizational
changes.

Please check the list of WG member names at the back of the draft to
make sure that I have your most recent organizational affiliation.

Jon
