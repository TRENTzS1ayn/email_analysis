They are kludges in that they are short-term measures while we wait for the
deployment of ubiquitous generic markup browsers with features more like
those of SoftQuad's Explorer and EBT's DynaText - generic markup native,
Web-native.

I suspect that some form of smart SGML server will always exist, but it will
not always serve such "dumb" clients.
