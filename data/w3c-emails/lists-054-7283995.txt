Everyone receiving this message, PLEASE read the spec carefully ASAP.

I'm finding numerous oversights in the EBNF, and apparently
unintentional incompatibilities with 8879.  I don't fault the authors;
it's easy to overlook syntactic errors in your own work, especially
when working so quickly.  But I don't feel at all confident that I can
catch all of the errors, so help would be appreciated.  I saw no
extensive critiques other than mine on the previous draft, and don't
want that to happen again.

No undefined terminals so far, though - congrats.

I'll post a summary of what I've got before I leave work tonight.

-Chris
