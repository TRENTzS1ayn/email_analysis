Oops.  As someone has already pointed out, the v0.02 XML draft is
actually at

   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml.rtf.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml.ps.zip

If you poke around under the spec directory, you will also find
gzipped versions if you need them.
