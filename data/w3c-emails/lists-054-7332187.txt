Just a few comments on Cris' comments (but I have not been able to
read the new draft yet, sorry)

some time ago, since the current draft "CSS1" style system can't cope with
dots in element types.  I am not sure why this is relevant to XML, though,
or, if it is, why it can't be fixed in CSS1, which is also a W3C thing.

I agree; it was done for the sake of SGML compatibility (which turned
out to be lost by it) and because some people thought that they could
change all EMPTY elements in their documents but not escape whitespace.
I.e. for no good reason.  I agree that it is a mistake, but it pales
into insignificance besides other more recent mistakes, and isn't
worth fighting for.  My hope is that enough is learnt from XML that
the SGML revision can be useful to use instead of XML.

I think the idea was that you could add -XML-SPACE-"PRESERVE" whenever
you wanted the non-default behaviour, DTDs notwithstanding.  I'm not sure.
Certainly the syntax as given isn't legal SGML.  I'm not sure if it's
legal XML -- I can't read PostScript documents from here right now.

Note also that mandating that a system detect when a document is not
using the encoding and/or character set specified is not in general
technically possible.
You can't distinguish ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-7 without some fairly
complex AI algorithms, for example.  The wording needs to be changed to
say that the behaviour in that case is undefined.

True (there are some other cases of missing S I think, or were in the
previous draft).  The right fix (I think) woud be to get rid of S
altogether and explain exactly which delimiters separate tokens.
See the PostScript language specification for a clear example -- or
see C for another one.

It is harder to ensure full SGML compatibility if you do this, but I
really do believe it's worth the effort.  For one thing, it encourages
simple token-stream implementations.. :-)


Note also that this production makes the HTML DOCTYPE illegal in XML,
since HTML requires a PUBLIC identifier, so that there is no document
valid in both XML and HTML.  (see RFC 1866; I believe HTML 3.2 to be
the same in this regard, excvept with a different PI)

I assumed that was an error in the specification!
A third value, -XML-IF-DTD-WAS-GIVEN, might be a better default.

I fully agree, but it has been the source of bitter argument recently.
Since no XML document is a valid HTML document, and vice versa, it is
all in any case totally redundant.

I agree.

In SGML it may or may not be valid depending on the SGML declaration,.
If you add
    <!Element xref EMPTY>
    <!AttList xref idref IDREF #IMPLIED>
and
    <xref id="ECOLE">
you have a cross reference which points to a different element in Quebec
and in France! This is obviously a potential source of errors, especially
given the almost complete internationalisation otherwise.

You can't override the default entities (believe it or not -- it's a
design bug).  Apart from that nonsense, it would be better to allow
entity declarations in a document type subset, perhaps?
