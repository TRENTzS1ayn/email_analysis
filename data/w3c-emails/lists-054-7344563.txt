The only reason I could see for not allowing the entity overrides is
that it requires DTD parsing, and so a DTDless parse would come up
different from a DTD parse, and that's bad.  But if there's a way to
tell DTDless systems which entities have been overridden, even without
the actual definitions, then it's not such a problem.
