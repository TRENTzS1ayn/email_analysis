It *needs* to be fixed in CSS1. Using '.' to separate GIs in a hierarchic
context specification, as in
 
   X.Y.Z { foo: bar }

clashes with the fact that '.' is a name character. CSS1 should use
something like '/' instead. 

But will this be fixed? Nobody ever fixed the problem of CGI '&'s in
attribute value literals.
