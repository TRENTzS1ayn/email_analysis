Would /> be better than ?>?
I keep reading
<?XML ENCODING XXX?>
as meaning that that the value is in doubt!

But
<?XML ENCODING XXX/>
would match the EMPTY tag close delimiter, which would add some
symmetry without hurting anything, I think.  It would also help understanind,
in that <?XML....> is self-contained, just like <e>.

I suppose one could argue that <!-- xxxxx --> should have a similar property,
<!-- xxxxx --/>.
