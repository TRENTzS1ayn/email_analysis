I strongly agree. SGML is broken in this regard, and will be fixed soon. XML
2.0 can incorporate the fix. As Bob mentions, vendors will probably not
implement this restriction, so those that do not care about SGML
compatibility will probably never notice it. Those that do care will be glad
that validating XML parsers will not accept invalid SGML documents. This
restriction does not have to be with us forever -- only until SGML is fixed.
