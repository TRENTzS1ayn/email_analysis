Yep.

We could require that any entities that override the default set be placed
in the document subset. This would enable DTD-less parsing even if you
override the predefined entities, and would make it easy for users to pick
the names that they want. We can fix at least the hardwired entity-name
problem without much work...

   This is a _strong_ plea that we do so. I was the first to push for all
HTML entities as predefined defaults, but _forcing_ authors to use them is
_not_ cool.
