Ate least some of us who _agree_ with the empty element decision have been
resting, as it's pointless for _us_ to re-open that argument. Given the we
have had many go-arounds on the issue, I think it's harder to reverse,
since it's not like everyone didn't get their say the first time.

However, the entity-list issue is brand-new, since it was never discussed
here, and therefore the unanimity is a much-stronger marker -- No one on
this list, but not on the ERB, seems to be willing to defend the decision.
I think that we should strengthen my previous suggestiuon and require that
_all_ general entities must be declared in the declaration subset. That
will guarantee DTD-less parsing of any document that uses general entities,
while also removing the need to make predefined entities hardwired. It's
also 8879 compliant without any need for bogus Processing Instructions.

   I think you are definitely right.
