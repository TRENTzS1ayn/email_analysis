Although that new XML instance could be provided as a special
case output of some application, an objective I believe we should have is
that any XML application should make easy the inclusion of ICADD support.

Some believe that LINK is the way to include ICADD. By that argument, W3C
removed the support for the #FIXED SDA attributes from the HTML 3.2 DTD.

Getting support for LINK presumes that some external pressure,
such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, is sufficient to 
encourage vendors to supply support for the LINK feature 
that is not now well-supported. Such pressure has influenced
Microsoft, and Adobe in other areas of accessibility. I hope that XML will
facilitate inclusion of ICADD capabilities.

That appears to be needed, as a minimum. The support that 
goes behind it is also needed.

I believe that the LINK capability to support hierarchy-dependent
distinctions is important.

Being able to determine where one is in context is much harder
for someone who must depend on memory, without visual cues.

Also, when one uses search to jump to a pattern match, the
context of the result is not evident, without a means to
determine that context.

I believe Murray's experiments using LINK are an essential step
before any decision on how to bring ICADD up to date can be made.
At this time, we should not preclude the use of LINK from XML.
