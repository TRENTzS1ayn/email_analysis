While we're on the subject:

I still think versioning is probably the number 1 thing needed right
now.  A number of complaints with XML 1.0 can be glossed, if an XML
1.0 compliant processor knows how to recognize a more recent version
of XML documents.  If we don't specify this NOW, it's going to be
*extremely* painful to develop XML 2.0 in a way that won't break XML
1.0 processors.
