I'm still ramping up on these issues, but I would venture that XML offers a
much better solution than the current ICADD for those who need ICADD's
benefits.

XML is about sending intelligent markup that correctly models its data all
the way down to the client applications. So through style sheet mechanisms
(DSSSL, for example), couldn't a publisher provide those with disabilities
a much more robust set of guidelines, custom-tailored to the smarts of the
content set, to help those with disabilities differentiate parts of
documents? 

Doesn't the world of style sheets offer a far greater avenue for opening
access than hiding hints inside a DTD? Instead of just prefixes and
suffixes, a content provider could call for much more useful
annotations/transformations/inflection-changes.
