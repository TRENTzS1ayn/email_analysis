I quite like the amount of text in these descriptions. It _is_ important for
us to know what ideas were batted around, discarded, revived, etc.

I also quite like the decisions you reached. I think that most of the
earth-shattering concerns people had have been alleviated.

Finally, I like being cited. The ERB has permission to use my idea in
perpetuity as long as my name stays with it. =) (oh well, I tried)
