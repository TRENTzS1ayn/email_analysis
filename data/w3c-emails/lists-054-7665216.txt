Note that &quot; is a single quote, which does not occur in ASCII.
(many implementations include a single quote at position 39 instead
of an apostrophe, but this is in error)

The apostrophe is normally the same as an open single quote, but this
is not necessarily so.  Hence, &apos; is the correct entitiy for the
ASCII ' character, as far as I can tell.

I am very pleased with the decision to reduce the list of predefined
entities to a manageable number.  I'm not actually sure why any beyong
&lt; and &amp; are needed, although &gt; is good for symmetry.

The current situation is so much of an improvement that it seems almost
churlish to ask this, but why is &apos; included when it is not
recognised in plain text?
