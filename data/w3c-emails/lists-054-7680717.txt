Good.

Yes, I remember.  I have the archive.

It was also a good design in many ways.  Failure to participate 
publicly was the public reason for rejection, IMO.  Brutality in 
the private sessions was reported by those who were there.

True but not forgotten.  But for every major decision, a list vote 
was held and enforced.  It was as open a process as one could 
have hoped for.  Probably the only one I've seen of that magnitude.

The interesting thing is that there were several who were on board 
from day one and have been at work for a while now.  A self-chosen
group.  
VRML did not start that way. It was a list that eventually spawned
a VAG, also self-appointed but selected as well by the moderator.
Same results, different and open process.

This is a bit too important for such excuses.  Sorry, Tim, but a lot 
of us have brutal schedules.

Yes.

Interesting.  Self-appointed panic as well.

I didn't say there were.  You are making up things, Tim.  I point 
out that in the case of grandfathering HTML, you serve the economic 
interests of two corporations who are the only serious contenders 
in the HTML browser industry.   That is not conspiracy.  That you 
serve the interests of the HTML authors is also true, but this 
is not about HTML or any specific SGML application.  If it is, then 
it is time for many of us to go on to other more important work.
There are many SGML applications.   Your own feelings about that 
are clear and a matter of record.  So are mine.  We can leave it 
at that.

I am not attacking Jean.  I am saying, let microsoft make some 
contributions to this working list.  Otherwise, let the HTML 
justifications for bad design go because the owner of the 
application is not interested in contributing.

You are over the mark, Tim.  I am not sliming this process.  I am
objecting 
to it.

Take the obnoxious reading elsewhere, Tim.  You are talking conspiracy
and
that is a charge unworthy of you.  I am talking bad design being
defended 
by mediocre justfications, and noting that such things are being 
voted into the spec.  That isn't conspiracy.  It is poor judgement.
