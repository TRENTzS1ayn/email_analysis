Sorry if I wasn't clear.
&quot; is defined as [single] quotation mark in ISO8879:1986(e) D.4.3.1,
ENTITIES Numeric and Special Graphic, along with lsquo and rsquo for
open and close single quote and apos for apostrophe.

Joan Smith's book gives a squot as a single quote.  The standard doesn't
say which it is, only that it is a quotation mark, but the 10646 draft I
have uses QUOTATION MARK for a double quote.

I don't know which interpretation is correct, butif RFC1866 has quot being 
a double quote, we'd better stick with it.

I still don't yet see why we need an entitiy for it.  If it had been an
SDATA entity, it would have been useful for escaping markup, but my
understanding is that there are no SDATA dentities in XML.  But I'm
probably confused...

(I think this works for & because Ee isn't a NAME START character)
