It's not actually lost; any character can be escaped in a CSS selector
name.  According to section 7.2 of the CSS PR, 

'in CSS1, selectors...can also contain escaped characters and any
Unicode character as a numeric code...the backslash followed by at most
four hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F) stands for the Unicode character with
that number...any character except a digit can be escaped to remove its
special meaning, by putting a backslash in front, Example: "\"" is a
string consisting of one double quote.'

Does this suffice to address your concerns?
