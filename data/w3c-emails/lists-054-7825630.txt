The documentation I checked said it's a typewriter double quote,
ASCII x21 or whatever.  Unfortunately I can't remember what doc
that was; what's your source?

ISO 10646 and other ISO character sets uniformly use 'quotation mark'
-- which is what the comment in the entity set says -- for the "
symbol, and 'apostrophe' for the ' symbol, and 'grave accent'
(and possibly something else indicating its use as an open single
quote) for the ` character. That seems to me reason enough to
believe the &quot; should be treated as ", and &apos; as '.

providing quot and apos makes it possible for attribute values to
contain both characters; it also allows the user to choose which
delimter to use, if they prefer to use the same one all the time.
Strictly speaking, one would have sufficed.

It is recognized in literals and may need to be escaped there.
