Section 2.8 says that

   XML processors must behave as though every element encountered
   in the document had an attribute declared thus:

      -XML-space (preserve|collapse) #IMPLIED

Is it then legal or not to explicitly declare such an attribute for an
element, possible with the specification of a default value?  There's
nothing to suggest that it can't be done, except the provision in 1.5
about it being naughty to use a name beginning "-XML-" "in a fashion
other than those described in this specification".  And it does seem
to me that for documents with a DTD one would certainly often want to
be able to set a default in this manner in the DTD.
