Yup, that language could be improved.  What I think we
mean is that of course you can declare such an attribute for
some element (presumably #FIXED might come in handy) in your
DTD, and this would not certainly not contravene the language
about "using it for a purpose other than..." - or in a 
well-formed doc where you don't have a DTD, you could just slap 
the -XML-SPACE="KEEP" on any old start-tag you wanted to.

This should be made more explicit and straightforward. - Tim
