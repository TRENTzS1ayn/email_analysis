Good idea...

and the ideas preceeding this are even better. I like simple token
delimited parsing models (good for quick hacks).

Ahh, but a forest is but a tree of tree after all...

Quite! As I noted, if all whitespace is kept around, then the parser
output is the same regardless of whether one has a DTD or not. A
validator can do whateever it wants with that, and one thing might
well be to enforce SGML RE/RS handling rules, thereby producing
(assuming a valid document) a post-validator data structure exactly
the same as that produced by an SGML system. On the other hand, other
applications (formatters for example) could toss the whitespace as
they see fit.

Thank you ;-)

No. I wished to at least *allow* FSI's, though not as the normative
mechanism perhaps.
