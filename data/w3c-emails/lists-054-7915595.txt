No. It would be much simpler all around for interoperability if CSS1 abided
by the naming conventions of the Reference Concrete Syntax. In fact, insofar
as CSS1 has some (integral?) relation with HTML, I see no reason why it
shouldn't square with naming conventions legal in HTML.

Or are you saying that we should take something bog-standard and
gratuitously break it with an unnecessary escaping "convention"?
