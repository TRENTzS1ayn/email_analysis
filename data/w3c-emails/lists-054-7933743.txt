It is defined in 3.2.2. There is one spot where it seems to be used in a
different sense though, 3.1. You are right, there should probably be a
forward reference to the definition in 2.8.

I don't think that there is a system that is simpler than SGML which is also
100% interoperable with SGML tools. Making all REs significant certainly
wouldn't. Some SGML tools use them to format output to make it more human
readable (and I like that!!!).

What if you are using XML documents to create DTDs (as has been agreed is
reasonable)? The exact same problem afflicts people creating instance
parsers as it does those working with DTDs. Some whitespace is only meant to
format. If I were XML tagging this document, I would put <LEE> and <PAUL>
tags around our respective content, but I would still leave a blank line
between your contributions and mine for readability.
