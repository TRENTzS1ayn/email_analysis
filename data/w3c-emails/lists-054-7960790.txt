Okay. I think that the SGML spec intended for newlines to be REs (as people
have attested here), but I can use a different terminology.

"I don't think that there is a system that is simpler than SGML which is also
100% interoperable with SGML tools. Making all newlines significant certainly
wouldn't be. Some SGML tools use them to format output to make it more human
readable (and I like that!!!)."
 
Changing the terminology does not change the facts about current tools. EBT
uses these meaningless spaces and newlines all over their Website, both in
content that is obviously generated by DynaWeb and content which I presume
is created by hand.

It is an entirely aestethic argument, but it seems to be a pervasive aestethic.
