Well done.

Good idea.

The Technical Corrigendum (TC) to SGML on Extended Naming Rules (ENR) 
looks like it has succeeded. If so, there is now a legit SGML 
declaration possible for defining all those extra name characters,
if they are used. (EditTime editor already handles ENR/Unicode, 
if anyone is interested.) 

ENR TC is at    http://www.ornl.gov/sgml/wg8/document/1896.htm

By the way, if the XML data has been generated valid, am I right
in thinking a non-validing XML parser is completely OK with the robust
and 
simple lexical rule that a name is anything up to a delimiter or 's' 
(after entity references in (non-CDATA) attribute values have 
been resolved)?  If so, that should be made clear in the 1.0 spec,
since it drastically simplifies things for implementors. 

Also, I think the &u form entities should just have the "u" prefix,
not the "u-" prefix. I don't think it adds anything, and, potentially
add thousands of characters to any entity declarations.
