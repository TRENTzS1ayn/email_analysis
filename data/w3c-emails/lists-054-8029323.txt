Interesting, but not relevant to the problem that I am raising, which is
not to do with the _ordinary_ problems of internationalization, but the
ordinary problem of "nonstandard characters".

Inferior to "Private-use character #C023"?
That is even worse than "[Pound sign]", which at least gives me a 50%
chance of finding the right character. "[Sumerian Cuneiform GUL.2]" might
bemore  meaningful, too. Even "[Brantaku Lhatala]" is no worse than
"Private use character #C023"

Yes, but a table of even long identifiers at the top of a document is not a
cause for abbreviation (we are discussing entity definitions, after all).
And the point is not that they will _always work_ but that they are _never
worse_ than just a number.

We are talking about how a system should represent a character that is not
in Unicode for transmission on the wire. Mathematical symbols are proabably
the best non-scholarly example raised so far in the discussion.

    Well, then you haven't been reading the many arguments on this topic
very closely.

Yes, but that only works for a closed vocabulary of glyphs. I don't believe
that that is a closed set, ever has been a closed set in the history of
humanity, or ever will be a closed set at some future date.
