I don't want to introduce any more funny syntax for XML. But perhaps for
SGML 97 WG8 could make the distinction between element context and mixed
context syntactically clear.  Then a DTD-less parser and a human reader can
see where whitespace will be normalized and where it will not be.

<HTML {
<HEAD {
<TITLE "This is title text">
}HEAD>
<BODY{
<P 
"This is the document's content"
>
<IMG HREF="...">
}BODY>

<!-- Lots of meaningless whitespace that will be removed -->


}HTML>
