"Abstract"

"Extensible Markup Language (XML) is an extremely simple dialect of SGML
which is completely described in this document. The goal is to enable
[*]generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way
that is now possible with HTML. For this reason, XML has been designed for
ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML."

I would like to suggest a change of wording there. To me, "generic SGML" is
SGML conforming to the full range of features available in the SGML
specification (e.g. SGML without limitations not present in the ISO
standard). I would prefer "generic markup conforming to the SGML standard".
