Agreed.  Would XML ever contain VRML?  VRML x.x might contain XML. 
There 
were some long discussions on having a structured text representation
for 2.0.
HTML was considered, but it was decided that simpler text was preferable 
for the current systems.  We also considered that HTML was a particular 
text application, and that others might be needed or desired.

VRML 1.0 is ASCII.  VRML 2.0 is UTF8.

The definition is looser than is comfortable.  Isn't the notion of
notation 
stronger?  Text or binary seems weakly-defined.
