Personally, I think that the only strategy that makes sense here is
the full frontal attack: enable dsssl-o processing through plug-ins or
applets and insist that real XML browsers are browsers with dsssl-o
capabilities.  Remember, we have available a very powerful free DSSSL
engine (Jade -- see http://www.jclark.com/jade/) designed to be used
for exactly this purpose.  It's entirely possible to have not just one
but several dsssl-enabled browsers working by WWW6 if people with the
requisite Windows rendering experience pick up this ball and run with
it.  If "XML" becomes just "XML with CSS" it will be because we failed
to seize this opportunity while it was open to us.

I am willing to serve as a coordination point for efforts to develop
dsssl-o plug-ins or applets for demonstration at WWW6 in April.  If
you are working on such a thing and think that you have a reasonable
chance for success in an April time frame, please let me know and I
will arrange with the conference organizers for a demo session.

There is a genuine possibility here for someone with the right
combination of nerve and programming skill to create another
breakthrough like Mosaic.  If you are working on something and don't
want to blow your cover until an April rollout, you can contact me
privately and I will keep your work confidential until the conference.
