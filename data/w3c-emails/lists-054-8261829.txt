Isn't Jade written for full DSSSL functionality? Just as one of the chief
concerns of using SP in an application is the size of the code, wouldn't a
Jade-o or Jade-Lite really be what we need here?

If the compiled code for the stylesheet engine is an order of magnitude*
larger than the XML parser, then a simplified toolkit is absolutely
necessary if we expect dsssl-o support in applications.

doesn't include nsgmls.
