| I think that we are trying to decide that. It depends on our overall
| strategy. If Jon wants to get style sheet implementations by April, then we
| can't wait until too late to start discussing layout.

The default style sheet language for the W3C SGML Web activity is
dsssl-o (see the activity page).  We don't need much discussion of
that right now, but we do need some development if we want to
demonstrate this by April; that's what I was suggesting.

| Parsing and hyperlinking are relatively trivial (to implement) by
| comparison.

I hope you're right...

Jon
