[Murray Altheim:]

| Isn't Jade written for full DSSSL functionality? Just as one of the chief
| concerns of using SP in an application is the size of the code, wouldn't a
| Jade-o or Jade-Lite really be what we need here?
| 
| If the compiled code for the stylesheet engine is an order of magnitude*
| larger than the XML parser, then a simplified toolkit is absolutely
| necessary if we expect dsssl-o support in applications.

Jade is *not* written for full DSSSL functionality; it's not even
close.  It's dsssl-o with a few recent extensions.  But it may indeed
be necessary to cut it back in implementations.  The need to find out
is one of the reasons that I am trying to encourage some development.
