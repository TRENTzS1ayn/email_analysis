While reading Len's message, another thought came to mind.

A much stronger case could me made for DSSSL(-o) if a substancial portion of SGML vendors supported it in commercial products. User-defined markup languages (on the other hand) and even portions of HyTime have been supported in the open market for some time now.  This could easily make DSSSL seem much more risky to those driven by market forces than should otherwise be the case and create an obstacle where none needs to exist.
