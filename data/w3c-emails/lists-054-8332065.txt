[Len Bullard:]

| It would seem the first issue would be if designing 
| XML requires one to also design styles and hyperlinks.
| For SGML, those are separate issues traditionally.
| Why in XML are they not?

You cannot have a high-end delivery vehicle for the Web unless you have

1. Structure

2. Hyperlinking

3. Presentational semantics.

These have been our three explicit deliverables since we started this
activity.

Please read the activity statement.
