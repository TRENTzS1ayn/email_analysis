Jon cites the (charter? activity statement?):
>   <li>The specification of extensions and public text needed to make
   DSSSL (SGML's stylesheet language) work in an Internet context.
   </ul>

and in conversation last week with various folks about what
is implied by sending a document without a DTD, it was pointed
out to me that one could convey one's semantics through a style
sheet or an applet that interprets the documents (you might
prefer to send an applet for something like an airline
schedule marked up in XML).

Is it an implication of the <li> above, and the sentiment
expressed in this thread that dsssl-o is XML's style sheet
language (and not CSS) that an applet that handles the putative
airline schedule exports either a dsssl-o style sheet or a FOT
to the rendering application?  (Just asking.)
