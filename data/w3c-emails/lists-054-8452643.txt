I agree about URCs being fishy... still, we're only on the hook if someone
thinks they've solved the URC problem (which is a small worry for the near
future).

Well, they ought to be, but my point was that the sentiment against PUBLIC
could carry the day and we will still be alright (assuming that the URN:
prefix goes through). I mean from an SGML point of view URNs are SYSTEM
(because they're not native to SGML itself). I tend to agree that encoding
FPIs as URNs in a SYSTEM identifier is kinda weird, but then the whole web
is kinda weird...
