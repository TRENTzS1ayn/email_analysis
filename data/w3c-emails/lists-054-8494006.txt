I think Len is asking if it is technically or politically valid to *require*
conforming XML browsers to support DSSSL. If that is not our goal, then he
probably does not mind that we will refine DSSSL-O, "while we are all
together." I think that the quote that has us  a little confused is:
"Personally, I think that the only strategy that makes sense here is the
full frontal attack: enable dsssl-o processing through plug-ins or applets
and insist that real XML browsers are browsers with dsssl-o capabilities. "

Do you mean "insist as a set of users that this is what we want" or "insist
as a standards group that this is what is conforming?"
