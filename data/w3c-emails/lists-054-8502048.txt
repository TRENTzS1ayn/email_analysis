Yep.  The stylesheet builder noted that to me and I 
forgot to take it out of the file on the disk.  Duh!!

Ok.  What is the misguided part?  I usually don't find it good 
to write "union" DTDs because I end up adding too much unnecessary 
markup possibilities to get different structures in the same tree.
It's what I don't like about the tag bag structures we get from 
38784 legacy.  It confuses the user of the editor, fattens the 
files, and overall, just bloats the information.  Since DTDs 
are pretty easy to write and select in editors, I find it better to 
keep smaller sets.  Of course, most documents I have to use 
DTDs for are structurally more complex.

Yes.  OTH, if we fed several documents to such a process, I wonder what 
the results would be.

Yes.  We do a lot of conversion work here where we are asked as a 
primary requirement to preserve look (?#&#^$^) and create a hypertext.
Lockheed also has some very sophisticated automated conversion software
in Orlando (ACS).  Our experience is that the scanning is in some 
ways, one of the most mind numbing bits.  The technology is certainly 
much better than it used to be, but 100%, not yet.

Good idea.  IDEAS isn't a prototype, so it works well with the 
exception of having to comment out the <? ?> version statement.
That's an easy feature to add.  On another product, I found the 
file size was a problem in the 16-bit version and that was good to know.

And as I said, good reading.  Much better than most of what I see.

Thanks again.
