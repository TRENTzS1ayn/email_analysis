Ok.  But if I have to write a FOSI for XML, I'm going to take up 
knitting screen displays instead.

The intent is clear.  The reason is not.  Again, I support DSSSL.
I think it good to discover and elaborate as the work item proceeds
why other approaches may not or are not as effective as the one 
being worked.

Ok.  The sidebar discussions of CSS will be inevitable, but 
no recommendations have to be issued for it.  David Durand 
mentions in his post that it may be early to choose a stylesheet 
language, and the considerable work going into it by W3C members 
just as the IETF is working on URI/URN/URC pieces.  So, where 
we don't consider parallel work, we have to be clear as to why 
one is and another is not worked.  I certainly accept and welcome the 
DSSSL work item.  My personal opinion is pretty much the same 
as David's on the issues here.

I agree.  Because I wasn't involved in the discussion of the 
decision to stick to the schedule and not do these in parallel, 
please provide the rationale for that and the means by which 
hyperlinking is separated from the stylesheet discussion since 
there are concepts in which the two overlap.  How is that separation 
maintained?  That helps us understand what hyperlinking concepts are 
being worked.  In other words, a reply to a question on a design 
vote by the ERB of "oh don't worry, the stylesheet will handle 
that" will be unacceptable rationale.
