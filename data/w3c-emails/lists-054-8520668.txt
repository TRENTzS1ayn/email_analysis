I think a concise statement of the problem FPIs are intended to solve 
and a shorter primer of how they do that would be invaluable as well 
because otherwise, they really do look like an overbuilt lookup.

Because the URC came up in another post, I recall a lot of discussion 
on the syntax issues of using SGML for that.  Many of the arguments 
were based on parsing problems in SGML, the speed of value-pairs vs 
hierarchies, etc.

1.  Might XML help in the parsing problem of the URC?
    That isn't a work item here, but I am curious because 
    a lot of work went into the Dublin core, etc.

2.  Are the implementation problems of the FPI related to the 
    parsing difficulty, the resolution, interoperation with other 
    resolution components, what?  James? (saying it takes 5000 
    lines doesn't help me understand why it takes 5000 lines).
