That was not my point. To be sure, it is so difficult a problem that yes,
the Web was built exclusive of the solution. But stating something is
simply too difficult does not make it go away. And why it's considered
orthogonal to XML is beyond me. We wouldn't be having this discussion if it
was truly orthogonal. 'Orthogonal' seems to have become a popular way of
saying 'I don't want to deal with this.'

I have a rather simple argument, and nothing along the lines of the
manifesto you demand (and maybe others are willing to deliver):

    "I don't want to hard code a SYSTEM identifier in 10,000 documents."

Using even relative URLs (which doesn't really solve the problem, and
introduces others such as ambiguity) provides no level of indirection,
which is required for portability.

I just read Jon's plea for movement of discussion back in line with our
agenda, so until we revisit this issue (after hyperlinks), I'll shelve this
one.
