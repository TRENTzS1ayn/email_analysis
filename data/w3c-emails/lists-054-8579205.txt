True, except insofar as the syntax and structure of FPIs contributes to the
core issues of persistence, and global uniqueness. The administrative
requirements of "formal" names ensure these as long as you follow the rules
when assigning identifiers.

FPIs will someday be part of URNs (when they become real).

This is acceptable, but making the system identifier mandatory is a shame
given that it is the _optional_ FPI that is the persistent identifier. I'd
be happier if I could stop using URLs the _instant_ it was feasible.
Allowing URNs as system IDs seems a way to accomplish that.

   My XML parser can always implement catalogs by looking for URN syntax in
the sytem ID, and doing something sensible.
