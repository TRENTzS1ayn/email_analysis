Well, it's time to start the IANA registration process for text/xml.
The first step is to send a message to the discussion group that
reviews proposals for new media types.  My previous experience with
the registration of media types is zero, so I need the knowledgeable
members of the WG to help out here.

According to draft-ietf-822ext-mime-reg-03, rfc1590, and rfc1521, the
message that begins the discussion should look something like the one
I've appended below.  Please review and comment if you are familiar
with this process.
