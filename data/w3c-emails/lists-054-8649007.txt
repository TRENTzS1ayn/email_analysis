This might go  better if there was a magic number -- i.e. if there was a
way of determining that a file was an XML file by inspecting the first
few bytes.

<?-XML-

might be such a magic number.

(I assume that <?XML was an error, since PI targets are supposed to
be notations, but we don't want to invade the user's name space for
notations, so it would have to be -XML- instead)
