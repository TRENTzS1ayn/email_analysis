I'm glad you're thinking of this, Jon, but isn't it premature
to register the MIME type before the spec is finished?

If a MIME type is needed for demos, let's use text/x-xml until
both linking and style sheets are settled.  It would be 
reasonable for the recipients of the request to ask "what
about security considerations for linking and style sheets?",
to which we perforce have no answer yet.
