This is solely a request for clarification; private responses
are fine.

What does [2] Character include that [3] BaseChar excludes?
Or, what is a short description in plain language of BaseChar?
Am I right in imagining that unassigned code points are
excluded from BaseChar?  What is a correct SGML declaration
for XML?

Repeat:  this is solely a request for clarification; private
responses are fine.
