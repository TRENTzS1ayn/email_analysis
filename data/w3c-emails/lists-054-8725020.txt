Interface specification.  We struggled in MID on the idea 
of logical vs explicit behavior in the widgets.  It is easy to
just say, three radiobuttons, and most people will know what 
you intend it to do.  OTH, if you say, pickOne, they do as 
well but rather than radio buttons, you might have three 
big birds hollering at you and you pick one and they fly away.
It is almost funny after a while and the reason Dave Cooper 
had the More Meta Than Thou posters made.

There are problems just labeling it behavior but it 
is a place to start.

Ok.  This phase is quite hard to do without a notion of implementation 
and further definition of system design instead of abstract markup.

Locations?  Resource resolution?

Semantic linking?  Reference types for linkends?

Scripts, protocols, light (internal) vs heavy (java, etc) languages.
These seem to come up often.  The behavior problem has been 
discussed many times.

I think this is a good idea.  Behavior is tricky and a more 
religion-riddled topic you won't find in computer science.
This is tough.  Probably half of the WG has been involved 
in a project that set out to define this in a *standard* way, 
so there are lots of ideas, and lots of compromises ahead.

sigh... another winter here by the sliding glass doors...

happy thanksgiving! all!
