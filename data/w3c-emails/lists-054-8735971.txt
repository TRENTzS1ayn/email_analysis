[Murray Altheim:]

| I just read Jon's plea for movement of discussion back in line with

| shelve this one.

I was asking to defer the discussion of stylesheets.  FPIs actually
belong to the current draft, and what some people are requesting is
the reconsideration of a previous decision.  So this discussion is in
order here, though its resolution may turn out to hinge on decisions
that we will be making about linking mechanisms.
