Not so. The W3C Addressing/Activity page describes how it is already
possible for one domain name address to point to multiple IP addresses. So
domain name resolution is *also* sometimes a many to one, one to one, or 
one to many mapping. That this process is currently difficult, and underused
is a bug in DNS and DNS systems, not in the basic DNS problem space.

So I don't see  how these are opposites. In my message I should have said
that every document has *at least* one actual location, instead of "every
document has a location."

The same is true of machines. If DNS does not allow me to set up a machine in
Tokyo and Johannesburg with the same name a one in California, to serve the
same information, then DNS (or DNS implementation) is incomplete.

I don't understand that at all.  URLs point to *one of* the locations of a
document. That isn't a misrepresentation, it is just under-powered technology.
URNs will point to all of the locations of a document, but in the end, they
will resolve to URLs, just as domain names resolve to a particular IP 
address (Paul ducks) of potentially many that may be bound to a particular
domain name.

Am I still misunderstanding you?
