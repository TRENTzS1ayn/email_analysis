At SGML '96 an informal discussion led to a technique that conforms to ISO 8879
as it is today, but causes whitespace to be handled almost as requested on this
list, but without the funky attributes.

Whitespace would be handled as follows:

1. In element content, all whitespace is ignored.
2. In data content, all whitespace is preserved.

The SGML technique for accomplishing this result has two steps:

1. Declare a new SEPCHAR function character in the XML concrete syntax, using a
character number that is not expected to occur naturally.  Call this "newsep". :
2. In a shortref map used by the document element, map RE to NEWSEP. 

That's it. If you're unhappy with SGML's built-in whitespace handling, you can
use this technique today. If we choose to use it for XML, it will be simple to
explain, easy to implement, and totally conforming.
