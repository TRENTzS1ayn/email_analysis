[Terry Allen:]

| ISBNs precisely do identify classes of identical physical objects.
| The paperback and hardback realizations of the same text (nonphysical
| object) printed exactly the same way commonly have different ISBNs.
| Furthermore, sloppy publishers sometimes do not change the ISBN of a
| book when they issue a revised edition.  ISBNs are about the worst
| possible illustration of URNs.

You're right, that was a terrible example.  Legal citations might have
been better.
