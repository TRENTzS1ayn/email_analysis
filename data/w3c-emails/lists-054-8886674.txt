    Unfortunately this does not work for XML, as it is not possible to tell
the difference between mixed content and element content when parsing
without a DTD.

   It also unfortunately requires throwing away a character code point.
Especially for 8-bit character sets, that might be a high price to pay.
Isn't there some chance that we could get a way to specify the behavior
wanted rather than an arcane workaround? I want to be able to turn off
RS/RE handling, and turn all whitespace into SEPCHARS without having to
make arcane restrictions on what other, non-whitespace, characters can
appear in a document. Is that too much to ask?

   Also, it's not clear to me that RS/RE are visible to shortrefs at the
beginning of an element. I thought SHORTREF applied to document data, not
ignored characters, but I could well be wrong, as I have avoided delving
into the mysteries of shortref (like why a shortref cannot include the
letter "B").
