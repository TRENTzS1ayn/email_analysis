Ah, but it is interesting how many real world examples of URNs you 
can come up with regardless of how usable they are.  Please, do
philosophize
on with some more illustrations.  How are URNs and SGML catalogs 
related?  What happens if an SGML catalog contains more than one 
of these kinds of examples?  How and where does a URN begin to 
break down?  How does the URL make this less likely to happen?
A URN is cited in VRML now.  I will get the text and post it 
for comparison after the TurkeyFestFever ends later tonight.

BTW, just in the translations provided, I can show where two 
books have different contents.  The printed copy of the Quran 
has a chapter called "The Booty" whereas the text Jon provided 
calls this "The Spoils of War".   So, physical? Are translations 
different objects logically?
