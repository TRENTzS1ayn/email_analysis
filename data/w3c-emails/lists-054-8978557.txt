There are simple principles at work. A URL is chosen based on where a
document is located. Sometimes people want to give documents more permanent
names. Within a closed system this can be done through FPIs. I suggest the
following wording:

"The PublicID is optional.

The Literal that follows the keyword PUBLIC is called the entity's public
identifier. It is a persistent name for the entity. User agents that have a
mechanism for resolving persistent names may use the public identifier to
locate the document. Other user agents may use the system identifier."

This is a simple "hook" for people who have solved the persistent name
problem within a particular system. SGML systems already support this hook,
of course. When Web systems have a global resolution, we will be ready. We
can register an FPI: namespace and register our documents within it.

It doesn't cost us anything to allow those who use public identifiers, or
who want to give it a shot to have a syntax for doing so.

Within some (many!) systems, FPIs meet all of those goals.
