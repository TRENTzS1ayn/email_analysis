I have my own ideas about how the standard is supposed to be used.

My point was that you can make your own publisher prefix without
getting permission from, or paying an annual fee to, a naming
authority.  Any corporation or trademark owner can use their
intellectual property rights to assert control over the use of their
name in an FPI, not just companies the size of Sun.  FPIs can in
practice serve as unique identifiers in the absence of naming
authorities.
