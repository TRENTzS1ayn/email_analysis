No, we don't. SunSoft Press has one, and so does JavaPress, but not Sun Microsystems Inc.,
or SunSoft or SMCC - our publications (the ones you receive when you buy a Sun workstation,
or by special order) do not carry ISBN numbers.

In what way does "-//SUN::SUNSOFT" deviate from the standard? I would think
that a deviation from the standard would be to use "+//SUN::SUNSOFT".

But let me put this another way. We really want to be able to start our
FPIs with "+//SUN::SUNSOFT".  How do we accomplish this? What authority
is there today to register this?  "Real soon now" doesn't quite cut
it.

Oh please. In what way is the string "SUN::SUNSOFT" common pasturage in the age
of trademarks?
