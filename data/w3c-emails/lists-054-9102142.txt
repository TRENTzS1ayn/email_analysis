I don't know what the drawback is, either, if the content of PUBLIC
is defined as something to be resolved as a URN.  However, why change
the existing SYSTEM syntax when you can presently have both (in SGML):
                                                    
<!doctype para public "-//Davenport//DTD DocBook V2.4.1//EN"
"docbook.dtd-or-some-url-pointing-to-it"
[
<!entity pcont public "-//Solipsist//ENTITIES filler//EN"
"pcont.txt-or-some-url-pointing-to-it">
]>
<para>&pcont;</para>

That allows me to write, today, references that can be resolved
either way, and will let me avoid having to retrofit all my XML
when the XML spec accepts URNs, as it will surely have to if it
is to be useful on the Internet.
