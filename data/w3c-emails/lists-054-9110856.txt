And how would an optional FPI extension to the syntax change that?

The Web's FPI mechanism under development is explicitly designed to support
namespaces like "FPI:", and to "grandfather in" any existing namespace
(phone numbers, license plates, ISBN numbers, FPIs, etc.) In other words, we
can put Public Identifiers in the standard today, or put an identical
construct in a year from now, and in the meantime, the people who are
already using them in the SGML community will be without them, for no good
reason.

All I am asking for (and I *think* that this is what other are asking for)
is a "hook" for public names, not a standard for how to resolve them.

I am not trying to redefine addressing on the Web. FPIs are for use *off of*
the Web. They are for internal systems, and inter-company systems, for user
groups and application groups. Every document that is published on the Web
should have URLs with the FPIs.

I'm not sure what is so special about the next six months, but I highly
doubt that an extra paragraph in the spec about an optional, non-parsed,
black-box-string, ignore-it-if-you-don't-understand-it string would slow us
down much. Think of it as an "addressing processing instruction".

>On FPI, I hope we punt.

SGML punted on FPIs 10 years ago. It made them optional, and made the
mechanisms for resolving them optional and system-specific. That was the
right decision then, and it is the right decision now. The fact that people
are using them successfully is evidence enough that they are right, and
there is *never* a case where the existence of a public identifier makes the
parsing or use of a document harder.
