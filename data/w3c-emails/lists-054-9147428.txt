We agree! We can use roughly the same language as for comments:

"Comments ... are not part of the document's character data; an XML
processor may, but need not, make it possible for an application to retrieve
the text of comments. For compatibility, the string "--" (double-hyphen) may
not occur within comments."

"An XML processor may, but need not, make it possible for an application to
retrieve the collapsed or removed whitespace."

The situations are equivalent. Whitespace in element context is there for
the benefit of those reading the source, like comments.
