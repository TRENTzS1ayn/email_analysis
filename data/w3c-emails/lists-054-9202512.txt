Of course, when you discover that the European division of
Sun Life's software division has been using SUN:SUNSOFT as an owner
identifier for several years, you'll wish there had been a registry, and
all the trademark lawyers in Washington couldn't win you that battle :-)

This is why the ISBN is used.  I'm not sure whether it will be a problem
in practice that an ISBN isn't very obviously hierarchical, so that FPI
name servers may each have to know about the entire namespace.  Is there
any further hierarchy than publisher, private-space?

At any rate I agree with Charles here that you should not try and invent
your own standard.
