In the interest of moving forward:

  1) A single coded character set ISO 10646 should be used.
  2) The primary encodings (required by all implementations) should
     be UTF-8 and UCS-2. The may be auto-detected.
  3) Encodings other than these are allowed, in which case, an
     external mechanism must be used to indicate the encoding.
