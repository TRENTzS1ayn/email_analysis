Requiring partial DTDs is the first step on the slope to requiring DTDs and 
greatly complicating XML for everyone. How will validating XML parsers 
distinguish between partial DTDs and full DTDs? How will authors know the 
difference?

Having said that, this approach has merit and I'm undecided on the best way to 
handle empt elements - other than to say it should be simple, easily understood, 
and accpetable to the masses.
