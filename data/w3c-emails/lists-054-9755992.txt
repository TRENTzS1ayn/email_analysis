On the contrary, it is both defensible and surd.

There are strong differences of opinion on the suitability of SGML for
representing  things other than documents. There is a thread on c.t.s regarding
a DTD for personal identity which has evolved into a general discussion of the
use of SGML for data modeling and other non-document things. (N.B.: A document
*type* is very different from a document.) There has been no mention of XML or
DSDs on c.t.s, so I'm sure you'll be amused, even if not (as you should be)
chagrined at Piercarlo Grandi's posting, which I've excerpted here. In
attempting to show the absurdity and indefensibility of using SGML to model
things other than document instances, he trots out the worst example he can
find: using SGML instance language to define document types. It even looks like
a DSD:

That's not true, since document instances aren't affected and most (all?) XML
documents won't even be transmitted with DTDs intact.

XML can start with core SGML for its DTDs, since the primary focus of XML will
be on DTDless instances. If there is a real demand for an alternative DTD
syntax, we can add DSDs to SGML97 and then offer them in XML2 as conforming to
8879.

What really is indefensible and absurd is to risk the growing and successful
market we have on an unproven alternative whose merits are highly controversial.
