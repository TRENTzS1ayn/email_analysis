<e></e>

because:
1. It represents what appears in the ESIS.
2. It makes it obvious to the reader that the element is empty and that it has
ended.
3. It is the same treatment for all elements -- another contributor to
simplicity.

For conformance, the XML DTD will need to declare "e" as:
<!element e (xml.empty.element.type?)>
instead of:
<!element e empty>
