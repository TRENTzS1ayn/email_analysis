I disagree.  To me, particularly when editing manually, this looks like
an insertion point for text or other efforts.  I don't have any 
problems spotting an *attribute container* unless it is end tagged.
If minimization is not allowed where content is possible, and any tag
without content is defacto, empty, then why should I need the </e>?
Although it is an application convention, formatting braced information 
is sufficient to see the structure of an instance. Yes, they walk off 
the right side of a page, but when I see the container tag, it is
obvious what it it.  So obviousness is not necessarily the case.
I agree, it is the same treatment for all elements, but IMO, it adds to 
the reader confusion.

Small point, and not worth big debate.
