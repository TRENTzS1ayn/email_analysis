While the average case time may not be "severe", the worst case behavior may be 
and therefor cannot be ignored. 

If an empty element is inserted high in a document instance (say an <A> within a 
high-level <DIV> in HTML 3.2), the emptiness of <A> cannot be inferred until the 
enclosing element is closed - or the parser performs lookahead. Either way, 
processing is delayed and application complexity increases.

I might trade speed for complexity but I'd hate to lose speed while increasing 
complexity. Bad tradeoff.
