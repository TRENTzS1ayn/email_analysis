Agreed that is a bad tradeoff.  Forcing lookahead isn't good, and
maintaining a stack seems to be undesirable for the PERL hacker.
It appears though, that this is still a case where the absence 
of the DTD bites, and perhaps the </e> is the best tradeoff.  
Thanks for making it clear, Bill and Lee. 

Get ready to answer this same question a few hundred times 
a year.  No matter how we explain it, the <e></e> looks redundant 
for an EMPTY element and a lot of SGML hackers are taught not to 
do it.  It will be a tough habit to break because from the 
author's perspective, not the parser programmer, it looks like 
YetAnotherReasonSGMLIsUgly.

Oh well, my drummer is ugly but he has good meter.
