I think this is the right approach, with a moderate extension of the
list of properties of well-formedness, to allow for defaulted and CONREF
attributes, possibly mixed content model (note this is challenge to
the 'just use the normal declaration' strategy, although I suppose
<!ELEMENT foo - - ((#PCDATA|foo)*)>
would do.), possibly other things.

To recapitulate something I said a while back, if the declarations are
NOT there, a conforming application can do whatever it likes,
e.g. with respect to empty elements (which can and should on this
account remain as simply <E>) report an error after treating the
element as normal, but if the declarations ARE there a conforming
application must make use of them.

What this amounts to for specification/documentation purposes is
identifying a core and a set of (independent) extensions.  The core is
unequivocally processable without any declarations, but for each
extension type there is a required accompanying declaration type.

Oh yes, I agree with Martin that the single root requirement is too
strong, all we need is 'all text in elements'.

I like the idea of propaganda in sigs -- here's mine:

Reference concrete syntax means just that:  NO NEW SYNTAX
