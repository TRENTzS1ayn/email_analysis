Isn't the problem even worse than this?  You don't just to figure out that
empty elements are in fact empty, you also have to figure out that non-empty
elements are not in fact empty. The first time I see a chapter tag, I can't
tell that it is not in fact an empty tag until I see its close tag.  So
either I can't start displaying the chapter until I have got the whole
chapter or I have to assume initially that every tag is non-empty and be
able to go back and reformat when I discover one that's not.  This just is
not going to work.
