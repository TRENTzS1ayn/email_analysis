But it is working.  It requires the DTD and in cases for systems that 
already do SGML as hypermedia, it has required a stylesheet where a 
DTD was not used.  I see the point of avoiding lookahead that it adds
complexity, 
but in fact, empty elements are used successfully and they work.  In the 
cases I'm thinking about, IDE/AS and IADS they don't format as they 
load, but many of these documents are considerably bigger than the 
average Web page and the performance is acceptable.  I think you
overstate.

The <e></e> looks worse than <@e>.  It is consistent, but intuitively
wrong.
As I said, do as you will, but be prepared to explain it repetitively.
