Bear in mind that the design principles aren't completely
comprehensive, and in the course of detailed examination may not even
prove to be completely consistent.  They are intended to convey our
current priorities.  One of the reasons we are having this
conversation is to expose the implications that these priorities have
for specific design details and conversely to explore the ways that
design realities may force us to change or clarify the priorities.
