In every SGML system I have ever built, setup, or used, I have *never* used
system entities.  It will always lead to trouble.

I would support banning them, but would concede to allowing them.

There is a third type of entity to look at:  system default.

System default entities are a lookup by name.  They are not very good
for interchange but are excellent means for achieving system independence
in a document without having to declare the entities explicitly.  The
reason why this is good is that in a internal publishing system, you could
have thousands of entities (I have a client who has over 10000 separate
language entities).  In their internal use of entities, to declare all the
possible entities that a document *could* use is practically speaking
impossible--the parse of the document would take a *very* long time.

In my opinion, there are three to decide on:

1. System entities (Explicit system ids--non-transportable).
2. System defaulted (Lookup by name).
3. Public entities (Lookup by public identifier).

2 & 3 are covered by the SGML Open catalog format.

In SGML open, 2 is:

ENTITY foo "blah"

3 is:

PUBLIC "-//Someone//DTD Something//EN" "somewhere"

We should also embrace the concept of Formal System Identifiers.  This
would allow a document to push transport issues into the environment (catalogs)
instead of being embedded in the document. 

For example, an HTML HREF could be:

<A HREF=DocumentFoo>Foo</A>

and the catalog entry could be:

ENTITY DocumentFoo "<URL>http://mydomain.com/documentfoo.html"

Of course, there's a little more to location-independent linking than the
above.  (See the HyTime Clink and Nameloc.)
