| I am surprised that nobody has remarked on the woeful absence of
| discussion of the entity management problem both in our goals document
| and here on the list.  So... let me as usual advance the minimalist
| position:

Entity management hasn't been mentioned because that discussion has
been scheduled for a separate phase of design immediately following
the November draft.  The discussion, when it occurs, is expected to be
complex and probably rather heated.  Please defer all further
consideration of this question until after the November WG meeting in
Boston.

Jon (as Chair)
