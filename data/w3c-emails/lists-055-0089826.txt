Seems reasonable.  Note that the draft is to be updated, partly to allow
(from my awful memory) INSTANCE, and partly to change the fiename to
catalog.soc
and reword the case insensitivity requirement so that it is actually
implementable on filesystems where a file probe or directory list are
either expensive or prohibited (e.g. common on the web).

So check on the draft status and refer to the latest version if it's passed
in time.
