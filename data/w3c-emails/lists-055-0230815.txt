The processing instructions used by Panorama to include style sheets and
navigators are generic enough that they could easily conflict: STYLESPEC,
NAVIGATOR.

I agree with Steve and Charles that the initial "PI keyword" is,
semantically, a notation name.  We could even propose a new public text
keyword for use in notation declarations: PROCINST, e.g.:

<!NOTATION Panorama PUBLIC "-//Synex AB//PROCINST Panorama control
instructions//NE" >

While I think PIs are a poor (if easy) way to do what Arbortext does, I
think Paul's argument that PIs exist and thus excluding them would cause a
lot of pain is a good one.  In the abstract, I agree with Martin that PIs
should be restricted to the prolog.

Cheers,

E.
