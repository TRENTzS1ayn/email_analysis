As you just demonstrated, you are forcing the author to both remember the rules
and implement them himself. They are not simple rules; if they were, we wouldn't
be having this discussion.

That isn't my proposal, Bob. My proposal is that data always be "quoted", just
as in programs.  The author does *not* have to know about mixed content (in
fact, mixed content won't actually exist). White space within quotes is data;
other white space is ignored.
