I think they are pretty straightforward:

 In data content:
  1. If an element begins or ends with a newline [not entirely
     accurate, but this is what people see], the newline is ignored.
  2. Newlines inside markup are ignored.
  3. All other newlines are passed on.

I could be convinced to drop #1 to make it even simpler, but I'd like to
keep it if possible just to reduce the amount of inconsistency with SGML.

My fault. I missed that point. That does diminish my disagreement with
this proposal, not enough to agree with it though. I'd prefer to leave
out the "quoting."
