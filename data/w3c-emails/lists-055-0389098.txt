(The discussion so far has focussed on RS/RE handling, but there
is also a problem with separator characters _other_ than
record-ends in mixed vs. element content.)

There's one more rule (which is the important one):

  * disallow separator characters in element content

This is because things like:

<a>
<b>blah</b>
<b>blah</b>
</a>

have different meanings depending on whether A has mixed content or
element content.  The record-end after the first </b> end-tag is
significant in the former case, and is ignored in the latter.

If A has element content, the above would have to be written like:

<a><b>blah</b><b>blah</b></a>

or

<a
><b>blah</b
><b>blah</b
></a>

instead.

Yes, as far as I can tell.

Charles' proposal is similar:

  * restrict PIs and comment declarations to element content
  * disallow mixed content
  * disallow inclusion exceptions (or perhaps, disallow
    included subelements in pseudoelement content).
  * require data content to be delimited

The chief difference is in the second and fourth rules.

With these restrictions the RS/RE/separator character rules
are even simpler:

  1. Delimited separator characters are data.
  2. Undelimited separator characters are ignored.
