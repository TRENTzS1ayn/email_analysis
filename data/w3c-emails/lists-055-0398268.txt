One concern to me is that this proposal will be _subtly_ incompatible with
existing tools. The user will want

<P>Foo</P>

The editing tool will output

<p>
Foo
</P>

SGML/XML parsers will interptet that as

(P
"
Foo
"
P)

We will have to make it VERY clear that although XML _looks_ like SGML, it
is actually subtly different. If we are going to do something incompatible
with SGML, I prefer the eliminate-mixed-content proposal. It is sufficiently
different that nobody will think that XML is SGML and it allows authors to
use whitespace to organize their text (which was the original goal of the
RS/RE rules).
