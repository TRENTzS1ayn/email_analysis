This last disadvantage could be mitigated if we provide two syntaxes for for
pseudo-element tagging. An SGML-editor friendly one like this:

<P><C>abcdefgh</C><EM><C>ijklmnopq</C></EM></P>

and a a typist-friendly alias like this:

<P>"abcdefgh"<EM>"ijklmnopq"</EM></P>

As long as XML consumers are either XML or SGML compatible, they should have
no problem with either syntax.
