This is a bit misleading since we're discussing a markup language rather
than a programming language. The only markup language that I know of
that uses the "quoted-text" model is MIF (Maker Interchange Format).
DSR (Digital Standard Runoff) does require that *most* markup be at the
beginning of a line, sort of the inverse of the quoted-text proposal.
