Applications already have this burden though, Charles. I'd expect any
browser to collapse multiple whitespace characters into a single space
unless I directed that I want "verbatim" formatting. Even with the quoted-
content model, I'd expect this behavior.

I'm sure you'd see a lot more errors with quoting. Even when programming,
forgetting to put a closing quote on a string is probably the most common
error that I make.

Unless you treat the content of the quoted text as RCDATA, I think you'd
also get a lot of strange looks from new-to-XML typists when you tell them
that you can't put elements inside quoted text.
