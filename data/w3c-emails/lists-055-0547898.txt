I assume that the purpose of this restriction is to make it somewhat
possible to limit author's abilities to modify centrally-defined
declaration sets.  If that's so, then I think we should keep the
restriction in XML.

The issue of whether or not this is an appropriate restriction should be
left for the SGML revision, I think (I personally think it's not a useful
restriction, but it's largely a matter of policy, not a technical issue, so
we probably shouldn't argue it here).

I think this would be a good thing (assuming we allow mixed content at
all).  SGML effectively requires this anyway, so why not formalize it?

Yes.  Exclusions are, with very rare exceptions, a bad thing, causing much
more trouble than they're worth. Inclusions, while expressing a useful
semantic, also cause more trouble then they're worth and require DTD
processing.

How much does AND complicate validation? I've seen some statements to the
effect that it complicates it quite a bit, but I have no way to evaluate
these claims.

I think AND expresses a useful semantic, so I would say keep it unless the
validation cost is too high.

>* Should XML allow nondeterministic content models (11.2.4.3)?

Again, how much does this complicate validation? I'm not ambiguity expert,
but could the problem be solved simply by stipulating that a token is
always matched to the first place in the content model it can match,
without lookahead? 

Cheers,

E.
