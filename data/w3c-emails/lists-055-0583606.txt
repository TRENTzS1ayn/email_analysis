While I firmly believe in SGML's complete separation of storage from
semantics (and thus, believe that there should be no required restriction
on the alignment of elements with entities), requiring alignment of
entities with elements in XML is probably a useful simplification that does
not introduce any incompatibilities with SGML (in the XML-to-SGML direction).

These are mostly useful for doing short reference maps (although they could
be useful for doing markup examples). I would have no objection to dropping
them.

I'm not sure what this question means. There is no ENTITY END *character*
in SGML--it is a signal from the entity manager to the parser.

Retain. SGML text entities have no meaningful existence except as
fragements of SGML document strings, therefore it cannot make sense to
refer to one from an entity attribute.  

I would suggest that XML should further restrict NDATA, (external) CDATA,
and SUBDOC entity references to ENTITY attributes.

Hmmm. Good question.

Such references would make processing of XML documents with SGML tools
impossible without preprocessing.  It would probably be useful for SGML to
allow hexidecimal numeric character references, though.

Don't you have a hex-to-decimal calculator? :-)

Do you mean that XML should *allow* ENTITY attributes for notations (also,
IDREF(S) and NOTATION)?  I would say yes, because it only affects the DTD
and it's something that will almost certainly be in the revised SGML.

Cheers,
