Charles, didn't you once describe a bunch of impending changes to 8879
in attribute definitions? Could you elaborate on the pertinent ones here?

I'd suggest that we stick within whatever changes Charles feels will be
in the revision to 8879. I'm comfortable with "jumping ahead" here as
Tim put it. If anything additional is needed, then let's try to stick with
a meta-DTD approach wherein some of the attribute names are significant.
I would love to have more than one ID on an element for example, but we
could also add "XML-id" as an attribute name. An SGML editor would have
to understand the semantics of the XML meta-DTD to really validate the doc,
but at least it wouldn't preclude the use of a stock SGML editor.
