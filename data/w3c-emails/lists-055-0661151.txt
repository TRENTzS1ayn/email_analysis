I'd like to see NAME, NUMBER and NUTOKEN retained, but could live without
NMTOKEN and the plural versions. (NAME is important as it is the only way to
get over the problems of non-unique IDs!)

As long as the names are remappable I have no problems. My objection is that
id has a different meaning in some languages - is does not mean identifier.
Similarly a German may prefer DING to ENTITY or ZIECHEN for NOTATION. Why
force XML markup to be in English? (We are becoming xenophobic in our
discussions!)
