I can't see any difference between defining ~ as a MSSCHAR and defining it
as an Escape character (given that we have no short references to decode the
strings shown above, and will therefore rely on application conventions to
define the escape mechanism). Incidentally, I prefer the tilde to any other
escape character.

Yes please
