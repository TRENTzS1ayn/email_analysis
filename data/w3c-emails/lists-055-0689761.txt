11.4.1 refers to data entities, which are only associated with Entity
declarations. It does not make sense to allow an entity to reference another
entity, either directly or via an ID. As the notation of the entity has to
be specified after the NDATA keyword it does not make sense to have a
possibly conflicting notation attribute.
