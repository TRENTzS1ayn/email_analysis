I disagree strongly.  It seems to me a huge gain, in writing the spec,
in reading the spec, and in implementing the system, to have one syntax
for data and metadata to the extent possible.  Eliot is right to say
that writing the meta-DTD is hard (I did one); and that most of it is
a straightforward mapping from DTD syntax into SGML; and that DTD
syntax is more compact than SGML for this purpose.  I disagree, however, 
that it would be unsatisfactory or brain-dead.  As for the design-by-committee
problem, we have that one anyhow, like it or not.

Of course I am biased in favour of the metalanguage unification because
I went through all the work of doing it, in MGML.
