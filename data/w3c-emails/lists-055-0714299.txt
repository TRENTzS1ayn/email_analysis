You *can* turn an &-constraint into a regular expression, but you get
very fast (Steve said exponential, I'm not sure that's precisely true,
but it's fast) increase in the size of the regular expression. Supporting
this would have added significantly to the size of the MGML parser.  I'd
say lose it, it can be lived without.

Yes, it substantially complicates the parser.  It turns out, as Peter Sharpe
explained to me, you can do a clever trick while turning nDFA's into DFA's
to spot these; but it's not obvious to our target XML programmer I think.
Still, changing this would be a pretty egregious conflict with 8879.
