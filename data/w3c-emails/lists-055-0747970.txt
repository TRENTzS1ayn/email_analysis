The difference is that MSO and MSI remain as data characters, whereas the
shortrefs simply become the characters, which can be declared as CDATA
entities:

 <!ENTITY srLT    CDATA "<" >
 <!ENTITY srAMP   CDATA "&" >
 <!ENTITY srESC   CDATA "%" >
 <!ENTITY srLSBRK CDATA "[" >
 <!ENTITY srRSBRK CDATA "]" >

 <!ENTITY pseudoE "</pseudo>" >

 <!SHORTREF XMLmap 
       "~<"       srLT
       "~&"       srAMP
       "~~"       srESC
       "~["       srLSBRK
       "~]"       srRSBRK
 >       

Note that this markup is used to process XML as SGML--it isn't need by XML
itself, which simply defines the escape sequences as escape sequences. 

Cheers,
