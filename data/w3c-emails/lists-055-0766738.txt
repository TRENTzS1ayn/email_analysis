There are several cases where it *does* make sense. For example, with
formal system identifiers, I can indicate that one entity is contained by
another entity (container storage manager). Thus, the contained entity
needs to refer to the container entity, which it can do most naturally with
an ENTITY attribute. Who are we to say when it is or isn't meaningful to
relate one entity to another using data attributes.

Another case would be relating a graphic to alternate forms of itself by
refering directly to those entities with data attributes.
