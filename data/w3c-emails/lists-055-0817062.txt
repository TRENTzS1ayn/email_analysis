I think we're all pretty much in aggreement that using SGML markup for
representing a document type is probably a good thing. What Charles and I
are saying is that XML is not the venue to do it because the design must be
done with a degree of care that would make the effort take longer than we
have to do the XML design.

There are a lot of different ways such a thing could be done and a lot of
subtle implications of doing it.  It's not even a certainty that it is a
good thing in the long run.

I certainly apply the principle of representing non-SGML things with SGML
(i.e., my DTD for VRML), but it's easy to it unilaterally and for your own
purposes, as everyone whose already done their own DTD for DTDs has
demonstrated. Doing something that will satisfy the requirements and
constraints of a user base as large and varied as the SGML/XML/HTML
community is a very different matter.

Cheers,
