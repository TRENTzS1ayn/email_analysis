Michael, I hear you saying that, given an XML document without its
declarations, there exists a set of SGML declarations that will allow
my SGML parser to generate the same ESIS as an XML parser.

However, if someone sends the XML declarations, I should no longer
be free to develop an arbitrary DTD with which to edit the document,
so if I am going to use an SGML editor to edit this XML document, I'll
need to convert the XML declarations into an equivalent set of valid
SGML declarations.

Therefore, my question/concern is:  if we allow in XML content models
that are not allowed in SGML and I receive an XML instance *with its
declarations*, is there a simple algorithm to convert the XML
declarations into SGML declarations so that I can process the document
with my SGML tools?
