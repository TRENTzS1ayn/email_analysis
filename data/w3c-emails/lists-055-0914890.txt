I guess it isn't exactly relevant, but in case anyone wonders
why I don't want to get too hung up on grandfathering HTML, 
here is a verbatim from the HTML Reference at the Microsoft site
delimited by the asterisks:

***********************

!

specifies that enclosed text is an author's comment.  Any text 
between the lines will not print.  You can include multiple lines 
of text between the start-tag and end-tag.

Example

<! This line of text, enclosed in an HTML page, will not display.
This second line of text will not display either.>

**********************

Sigh...
