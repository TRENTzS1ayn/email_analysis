Thank you for providing that excellent summary.
Please consider posting it to comp.text.sgml too;
it deserves a wider audience.

And... now that you've put it that way... the RS/RE rules
don't look all that hard to implement after all...

Right before that it says "An RE remaining *after replacement
of all references and recognition of markup* is treated as data
unless...", &c, so in the production:

'character reference', 'entity reference', and 'short reference'
are never seen by this "phase" of the parser.   (A quick test 
with SGMLS confirms that record-ends after references that
expand into data are not discarded).

I believe that RS can also slip through when it appears
inside a processing instruction (productions 44, 45,
47, 48, 50, and 51...).  

(I only know this because it crashed Cost once...)
