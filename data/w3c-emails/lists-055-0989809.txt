I might choose somewhat stronger language but I agree with the sentiment.

Since we're having such difficulty with RS/RE, I propose declaring that they do 
not exist. If XML doesn't specify records, then there are no special rules to 
deal with their starting and ending points - end of problem. RS and RE are 
anachronisms and are not necessary to specify a markup language.

What are the errors/problems with this approach? I recognize that 8879 
compatibility may be lost but what else is wrong? I'm looking for substantive 
technical issues with David Durand's "one record proposal".
