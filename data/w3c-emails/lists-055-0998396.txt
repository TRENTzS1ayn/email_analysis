There is no desire here to grandfather existing HTML, but, given the fact
that Microsoft IE already does stylesheets, and Netscape says they will too,
if they just start applying style attributes when attached to non-HTML
tags, then we are VERY VERY VERY close to being able to send generic SGML
to 50 million desktops *as they sit* and get good results.

Thus, the potential gains would be enormous if the following, given an 
appropriate DTD, were valid XML:

<p>The verbal leitmotif "Listen to my <IMG SRC="heart.jpg">heart 
beat" is sprinkled throughout 
<A  HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com/LA/VgerLa.html">Laurie Anderson</A>'s mid-Eighties work.</p>

Whatever has to be done to achieve this and retain the maximal amount of 
RS/RE handling and 8879 compliance, we just have to do.  Otherwise we're 
wasting our time.

Cheers, Tim Bray
