The point is that if we are using HyTime links then we need an entity
declaration that can be used to name the link source for a chain of links
(we don't want to repeat the same 1024 character URL hundreds of times, we
want to give it an id in a well controlled namespace). This is how HyTime
works. That entity declaration will contain the URL of the page we want. If
you have links to more than one point in that page this method is more
efficient than having to respecify the URL on each link. (Otherwise there is
an unnecessary overhead.) If the same URL is referenced by multiple
documents it should be stored in a subhub BOS that can be referenced by all
documents that refer to it. Seems to me that this helps URL management
greatly. This is the real bugbear of existing web applications.

But this would make the use of link sources for link chains impossible. Link
chains are one of the real gains that HyTime has to offer. If we drop them
from XML we are dead. Without a formally defined sources in the BOS you
cannot have a start point for the chain.
