Well, if it _requires the entity reference,_ then we should not use HyTime.

No, it would make the use of link sources _optional_. I don't have a
problem with using entities -- after all we want the advantages. But we
cannot have a solution that requires entity delcarations to make simple
links. We need to provide the same simplicity people have now, though we
can add complexity, where it also adds power.

I like chains, but my inclination is to keep them short anyway... Like 1 or
two levels. This also means that we don't have to explain to browser
manufacturers how to implement cyle-detection in their link-following
module.
