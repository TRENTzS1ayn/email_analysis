I think it is outside the scope of this work to define what the expectations
should be for an XML editing tool.  I don't think that experience or wisdom
exists in this group or the world at large to understand that question, let
alone write it into a standard.  My personal bias would be that if there
is no DTD, all the tool could possibly do would be to test "well-formed-ness",
i.e. no syntax errors nor mis-nested elements.  If there is a DTD, the
problem is well-understood.  Trying to adduce grammars from instances is
very far from easy and of questionable utility.
