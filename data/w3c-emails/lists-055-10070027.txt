It doesn't require an entity reference.  Using my proposed scheme, you
could use a queryloc to contain the URL, e.g.:

  <urlloc id="bookrev">http://www.drmacro.com/bookrev</urlloc>
  <P>
  See <link linkend="bookrev">my book review site</link> for
  a draft introduction to HyTime.

I don't know what Martin means by "link chains". This is not a HyTime term.

If he means "location ladders", then you can have location ladders without
requiring entity declarations (although the use of entities would be the
SGML/HyTime recommended method).  If he means "location paths" (a location
address that addresses other location address elements), then entities have
nothing to do with their support.  If he means "a series of links where
each link (except possibly for the first and last) share link ends with two
other links", then again, supporting that sort of structure is completely
independent of how the link ends might be addressed.

Cheers,

E.
