I have put the WG mail for the month of December out on
sunsite.unc.edu in files named 9612a and 9612b:

   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9612a.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9612b.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9612a.gz
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9612b.gz

You can also use HTTP to retrieve these.

As usual, I cannot guarantee that I received everything sent to the
list, but these files contain everything that I did receive.  The W3C
archive for this group is publicly visible, so you are free to share
these with anyone who might be interested in our transactions.

Jon
