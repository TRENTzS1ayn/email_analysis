You're darn tootin' it's important.  It's the only way we can hope to have
the power of HyTime with the convenience of things like URLs and TEI locators.

Certainly you can do this (it's the whole point of the refloc facility).
But I was trying to satisfy Martin's requirement for a re-uable ID
reference to a URL.

I think the #-sign hack is a reasonable solution.  A similar facility has
been proposed for the SGML revision (but not designed to the point where we
are confident in the final sytax) where you can combine an entity name with
an ID to do simple direct cross-document ID references.  I think the #-sign
hack is consistent semantically with this proposal: in both cases you're
binding a name to the object that defines the name space.  The only
difference is the way you name the name space (entity vs. direct URL
reference).

Cheers,
