Okay, Let's say I'm Jane WebMeister.

Does the "one record proposal" mean that this:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Is going to generate a parse tree with many newlines in it, which will 
probably choke a parser that _does_ use a DTD, because <TABLE> is element
content?

If so, I far prefer the quoted-delimeter proposal that removes the RS/RE
without sacrificing the author's ability to reorganize their XML source
using whitespace.
