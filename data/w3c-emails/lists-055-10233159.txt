The general architectural name remapping feature lets you map content to
attributes (and visa versa), so you can easily have this form of URLLoc:

<urlloc id="bookrev" href="http://www.drmacro.com/bookrev"/>

Which, in HyTime, would be declared like so:

<!ELEMENT URLLoc  EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST URLLoc
          ID       ID    #REQUIRED
          HREF     CDATA #REQUIRED
          HyTime   NAME  #FIXED "queryloc"
          notation (URL) #FIXED "URL"
          saimpsrc NAME  #FIXED "implicit"
          HyNames  CDATA #FIXED "#CONTENT HREF"

The "HyNames" attribute is mapping the content to the attribute named "HREF".

HyTime uses element content by default for things that might naturally be
attribute values for two reasons:

1. To avoid syntactic limitations on attribute values (length, primarily, 
   which I suppose isn't a problem with XML with effectively unbounded
   quantities).
2. To allow subelements (for example, dimspec, dimref, and markfun elements
   in extent specifications, which are nominally lists of integers).

HyTime uses the concept of "resources" to categorize those element types
that are only used by reference (and therefore, whose content, if any,
would not normally be displayed, certainly not at the location it occurred
in the source).

Cheers,

E.
