My experience is that browsers change more often than servers. Depending on
server-side features is probably not feasible in the short term. While I
would gladly install the latest and greatest browser just because it gave
me access to some XML files, most system adminstrators would not install
a new Web server so easily. They are a little more flexible with
CGI, but even getting a new CGI widely installed would be a challenge.

Anyhow, your requirements do not seem to have anything to do with client-server
negotiation. Why not SPAM the document *once* and serve it to everybody,
DTD aware or not? That leaves the author in control instead of the web
server/system administrator.
