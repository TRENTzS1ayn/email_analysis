I'm not sure what you mean by "do Hypertext entirely via attributes".  I
was only referring to using attributes to map arbitrary element types to
architectural element types recognized by XML browsers (e.g., the linking
and addressing elements defined by the XML Link spec, whatever it ends up
being).  The only other choice is to define all the hyperlinking behavior
in style sheets, which is fine, but requires shipping the style sheets with
the docs (or otherwise defining the association of styles, possibly
pre-defined in browsers, with documents).

Note that the architecture mechanisms defined in the HyTime TC include
defaulting rules that causes elements whose element types are the same as
architectural forms to be assumed to be those forms (lacking more specific
information).  Thus, an XML Link spec that defines a set of architectural
element types will be usable *without* explicit mappings if authors simply
use the same element type names in their documents.

Thus, if XML accepted the default architectural mapping behavior, you would
need the mapping attributes only when your element type names differed from
those in the architecture.

Cheers,
