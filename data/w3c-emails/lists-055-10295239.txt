Note that the architecture mechanisms defined in the HyTime TC include
defaulting rules that causes elements whose element types are the same as
architectural forms to be assumed to be those forms (lacking more specific
information).  Thus, an XML Link spec that defines a set of architectural
element types will be usable *without* explicit mappings if authors simply
use the same element type names in their documents.

Thus, if XML accepted the default architectural mapping behavior, you would
need the mapping attributes only when your element type names differed from
those in the architecture.

Okay, I see what you are saying. However, wouldn't differing element type names
from those in the XML-Link architecture be the norm rather
than the exception when existing tomes of SGML are being XML'ified for WEB
delivery?

Is requiring an XML Browser to retrieve+process the DTD in order to map 
element type name "FigRef" to "alink" a bit onerous?
