I suppose it depends on any defaulting rules XML decides to define as part
of its general semantic architecture (which it will presumably have,
although we haven't discussed it explicitly).

It would be simple enough to say something like "lacking a DTD, XML
processors shall associate the first specification of an -xml-arctype
attribute encountered in a document to all elements of the same type that
do not exhibit an -xml-arctype attribute." (Where "-xml-archtype" is
whatever attribute we choose for naming XML-defined architectural element
types. 

That seems like a pretty intuitive behavior to me.

Cheers,

E.
