Not necessarily.  This is one area where there are big benefits 
to translating this part of the legacy data.  Having the URL 
at the base of all of the hyperlink schemes means we do this 
anyway where needed.  There really isn't that much complex 
linked information in SGML tomes.  Simple links have been 
the norm for some time.  Easy score for XML/SGML.  We all benefit.

IMO, XML would do well to define both architecture and 
standard instances.  Adopt TEI if that is what you 
want but element types are what the SGML-speaking world 
understand.  Adopt a set by affirmation:  conventions for 
XML linking will catch on like a grassfire.  SGML folks 
always try to steer clear of generic coding, but it is 
the way SGML works best.

Not the first time.
