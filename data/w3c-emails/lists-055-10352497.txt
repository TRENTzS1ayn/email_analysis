I didn't think XML supported #CURRENT!

Incidentally I finally woke up to why the idea of having urllocs in separate
files gives me headaches:

1) We have yet to say how I identify which set(s) of urls I want associated
with a particular file (hopefully I can list more than one such file)

2) If I want any of the files listed in the urlloc to be in the
applications' BOS or catalog I still have to convert them to entity
references as unless we have a special type of BOS/catalog for XML such
references won't be exportable into these environments.
