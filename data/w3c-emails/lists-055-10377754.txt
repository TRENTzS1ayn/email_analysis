I assume you mean "which set of URLs I want associated with a particular
document".  You could declare the documents containing the URLs as entities
in your Hub document or just use another URL to refer to the URLloc
document--your choice.

You have to be careful when you use the term "BOS"--only the HyTime BOS is
solely determined by the entity declarations in the hub document.  The
"application BOS" can be determined by any mechanism, including reading tea
leaves or looking at URLs.
