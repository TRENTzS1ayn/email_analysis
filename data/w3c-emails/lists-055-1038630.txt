I agree with both Michael and Tim on this issue, but it seems that the
most difficult part will be to decide what to do with the declarations
inside the doc's internal subset. 

For external DTDs, no problem, I'm only concerned about the instance. But
since the internal subset is part of the instance, how can you make it
a valid SGML document with declarations in another syntax? It would seem
that you would have to make *all* declarations external, including those
that are instance-specific. However, you're still stuck with referencing
the external declarations in such a way that an SGML parser can parse the
reference and know what it means.

Unless you assume that preprocessing is always required to get an SGML
document.
