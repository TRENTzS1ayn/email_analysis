That's exactly what I meant.

Again, exactly what I meant.

That's the idea.

I think this is a perfectly reasonable solution: it's essentially what
Panorama does with it's "web" files, which are nothing more than a set of
ilinks and their attendant location addresses, plus a little
Panorama-specific metadata.

I don't see anything in this proposal that would limit the ability to do more.
