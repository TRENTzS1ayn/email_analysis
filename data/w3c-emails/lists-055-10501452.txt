But it doesn't--the mapping can always be in the instance (possibly on
first occurrence of the mapped element types as discussed earlier).

This is really just a form of "DTD summary".  How is it different from:

<!DOCTYPE MyDoc [
<!ATTLIST (FigRef,Xref)  -xml-link NAME #FIXED "alink" >
]>

Assuming that XML allows multiple attribute list declarations for element
types? (This ability is currently provided in the extended meta-DTD syntax
defined in the HyTime TC and is on the fast-track for addition to SGML as
part of the upcoming revision, if not before.)

Cheers,
