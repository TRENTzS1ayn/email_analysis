I'm not sure there can be one. Hopefully there will be a way of identifying
an author generated set of documents that must be accessible to make sense
of "a document" associated with each XML file. This is then augmented as you
go through a particular link within that file by the "required reading list"
for the file accessed if that is an XML file, otherwise it will remain in
memory as the current "essential reading history".

At present they are supposed to follow chains ad-infinitem. (In practice
they don't). With XML they can just follow the chains the author has
specified as being required, looking in those documents for any further
"required reading" documents.
