Okay, now I get it (I think)!. If I want my doc to be useful to DTD aware and
non-DTD are XML browsers I can do this:-

<!-- First occurrence of figref element
<figref -XML-LINK="ALink">
blah
...
<!-- Subsequent occurence of figref -->
<figref>
blah blah

DTD-aware XML tools can ensure that the -XML-LINK attribute matches its
#fixed value in the DTD. Non-DTD-Aware XML tools can pick it up on the 
first occurence and can infer it for subseqent figrefs. Right?
