No cries of "heresy!" from me; I think that using PIs to
control or at least enable architectural processing is a
very good idea.  The only alternatives I can think of
are (a) #FIXED attributes (requiring XML UAs to retrieve
and parse the DTD in cases where they wouldn't otherwise
need to); (b) prefixing every predefined element type
and attribute name with "XML-" (gaaah!) or (c) stomp
mercilessly on the authors' namespace with every new
revision of the spec.
