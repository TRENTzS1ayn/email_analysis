This sounds suspiciously as if it would be impossible to point at
a link (or perhaps I mean to point at *an address*) in order to talk
about it, without slipping past it and landing at what it's pointing
at.  How on earth will I ever be able to write the definitive
cultural critique of hypertext with extensive discussions of the
linking practices of Kimber, Durand, and Allen, if every time I point
at Eliot's links I get an Altavista query for basset hounds?

Surely there's a HyTime way around this problem?
