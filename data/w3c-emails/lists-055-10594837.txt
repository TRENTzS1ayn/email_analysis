That's my fault.  Something I read, either in Lou's summary or the full
spec led me to believe that only elements were counted for tree addressing.
 But Steve D. and you both pointed out it was a mistake.  I appologize for
any confusion I may have caused.

This means that TEI and HyTime both use the same default grove plan (at
least more or less, if not exactly).
