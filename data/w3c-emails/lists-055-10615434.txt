There is a "use/mention" problem inherent in indirect addressing.  One way
around it in HyTime is to use the "reflevel" attribute to limit the depth
of recursion--once you've passed it, you just get the elements. At one
point we discussed adding a "locloc" (location address location) element
just for this purpose, but decided it wasn't necessary.
