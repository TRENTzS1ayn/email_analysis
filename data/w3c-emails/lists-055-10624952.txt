Exactly! While I like the idea of defaulting tags (because it will appeal
to Joe and Jane HTML) I can't stomach the namespace pollution. It's more
complicated to describe, and it's the kind of thing that, if you ever
forget it, and use a tagname like alink, it will bite you. If you're a
conscientious sort, and use DTDs like you should, you might even miss the
problem altogether, since it will only fail in the absence of a DTD that
does _not_ declare alink as the AF.

   And if you think that last sentence is confusing, parse it carefully,
and observer that all those negations are necessary.

   This seems like a gotcha that is just waiting to waste people's time.
