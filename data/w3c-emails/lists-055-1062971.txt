I think this is an irrelevant point.

A parser creates its own parse tree.  A parser that puts newlines in the
parse tree (presumably as text nodes) will have them, and this will in no
way affect a parser that does not put them there.  THe parse tree is an
in-memory structure.

In any case, ``Jane WebMeister'' is probably a human and has no need to
look inside the software at the parse tree.
