I hadn't realized that distinction.  Given that, it does make sense, I
think, to allow TEI extended pointers or something like them after the #.
If understand the implications, we'd be saying that for the mime type "xml"
(or x-xml, I suppose), that stuff following the "#" is interpreted as
either a single ID reference or as some more complicated address (at least
for TEI, you can distinguish the two as TEI locators would always be
enclosed in parens--right?

Cheers,
