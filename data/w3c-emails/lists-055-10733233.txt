MSM has pointed out to me that "working document set" is confusing, since
unlike a real working set, the working document set is expcitly declared
rather than deduced by the system.  He likes BOS better.

   Since the HyTime BOS may not be what we want, and Application BOS is not
well defined, I propose that we are discussing how to declare the XML
Bounded Object Set (XML BOS), and what it should include. Hopefully we can
settle on that realtively clear term, and just stick to arguing about what
is in it, rather than what to call it.
