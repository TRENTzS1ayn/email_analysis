This is the case precisely.  There are some variants in which more 
is added to the link attributes for particular systems, but the 
example above is the case I recognize as ubiquitous, or 
common practice.

As you note, the construct is in use in many more document types, so 
not only the HTML authors but SGML authors everywhere would be getting 
the same news.

A system identifier is typically a pathname.  So is a URL despite the 
RFC protestations to the contrary ('looks like Unix..smells like
Unix..').
However:

URL-reference = [absoluteURL | relativeURL] ["#" fragment ]

is a much more powerful semantic.  It is also compact and
well-supported.

Note that formally, the reference information specified in a fragment 
is not part of the URL, but is "used in conjunction with a URL.  The
format
and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media
type 
of the resource reference by the URL.  A URL reference that does not 
contain a URL is a reference to the current document.  In other words, 
an empty URL reference within a document is interpreted as a reference 
to the start of that document, and a reference containing only a
fragment 
identifier is a reference to the identified fragment of that document.  
Traversal of such a reference should not result in an additional
retrieval 
action." [draft-ietf-URL-syntax-00] 29 Dec 1996.

Simplicity is preferred.  What I read of the URL suggests the choice 
of scheme and "which notation handler cares about THIS *fragment*" 
is all the wiggle room there is in this assignment.
