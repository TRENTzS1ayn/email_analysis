This might work ok -- even something as simple as "here are the required
element types and attributes, and you can add any more you want, which have
application-specific semantics" -- which is trivial to do with architectural
forms.

One useful source for a list of what to include in one's links is a paper
Victor Riley did in the NIST hypertext standardization conference
proceedings -- still available from NIST (I'll try to dig up the document
number or get an MR copy from victor to post).
