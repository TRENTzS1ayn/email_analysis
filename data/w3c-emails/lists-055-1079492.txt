I agree and I see the sense of it.  I just don't want to go down 
the path of trying to keep up with and adjust to all of the variants
that DO produce gratuitous incompatibilities with extant SGML basic 
practices such as the odd comment structure I posted yesterday.
I feel that the browser wars are becoming a rice grinder of beta hell.
That is competition, and we all understand it I think, but I don't
want XML to be the rice too soon.  It appears from here that that 
has made life for the HTML WG and W3C members difficult, and 
the users as well who are now having to choose the platform and 
stick with it.  As you know, in VRML where one language and 
one syntax exist, the scripting issue alone is forcing the same 
decision.  So while, yes, it will also happen in XML, no doubt, 
as far as possible, the base language design should be pristine.

Otherwise, I'm also in favor that HTML -> XML should be 
pretty painless especially for authors.  Where they can make 
the transition almost invisibly, everyone wins.
