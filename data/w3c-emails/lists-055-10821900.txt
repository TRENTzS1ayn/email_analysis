HyTime considers links and locators to be seperate constructs.  locators are
pass-through in that if you point at it, you are effectively pointing at
what it points at (ad infinitum).  hyperlinks are normal SGML elements in
terms of pointing at them.  If you point at a link you are pointing at the
element which defines that link.  (whether the element "knows" it is the
definition of a link is another question....)
