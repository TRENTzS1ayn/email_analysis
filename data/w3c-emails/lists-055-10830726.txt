[David Durand:]

|   I'm spending a lot of time deleting duplicate posts

I heartily agree that it's annoying to deal with duplicate posts,
especially after repeated requests from various quarters asking people
to stop replying directly to the person making the post.  I find that
it takes me less than ten seconds to readdress my reply to the list
and put the name of the person I'm responding to at the top of my
reply.  Are we all such quick thinkers that an extra ten seconds to
address a message properly really takes away from the time we have to
compose the message itself?
