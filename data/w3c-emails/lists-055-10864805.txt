My objection is to the use of Bounded in the name. In the HyTime BOS the
rules for drawing the boundary are clearly defined. In the XML case they
cannot be, and if author control of OS definition is allowed, as I pray it
will be, the boundary will be so fuzzy it will simply consist of a set of
points in the docuverse. I would prefer XML Required Document Set or some
such term that gets away from the idea of a boundary.
