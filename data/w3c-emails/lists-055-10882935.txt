Not true. I have two web sites - one supplied by an ISP (which is the way
the majority of users have to work) and the other a large intergovernmental
server that is located in another country altogether. Like many governmental
services in Europe this service is outsourced, in this case on a 4 year
contract. There is no way they are going to change their hardware/software
this century!! I want to use XML before then!!!
