Not really, but I see from a little later on that there's still a
misunderstanding.

Yes.

No. Only an occurence of a required-for-processing AF instance pulls in
other documents. That is the real difference between the HyTime BOS, which
follows all links to some fixed level of recursion, and the XML BOS that I
am proposing, which pulls in only documents explicitly requested by the
author.

They are like raisins in a pudding though.

No, the above misunderstanding makes this secnario possible, but on my
scenario, the author has control as long as she does not make someone
else's document "required-for-processing".

This is a matter of strategy. If I've got a series of glossed text examples
with complicated alignments between them, I can best control my links by
having a little bundle of ilinks associated with each example. If I am
using ilinks to annotate an entire file, I might prefer the single "ilink
bunch" proposal you started with.

We can only enable good organization, not require it, unless we think we
can formally define all the reasonable uses ahead of time.

My proposal enables that as well, but does not preclude internal ilinks,
which have a suprising number of uses. (graphic callouts, for instance).

I don't think that the general solution is fragile, when understood
properly. And I think I gave two nice examples of places where separate
ilink files might be inconvenient.

You are right that any strategy that follows links will cause trouble in
one of two ways:
  1. each link will have to be labelled with whether or not its destination
is XML BOS-augmenting. I think this fails the complexity test.
  or
  2. We pull in too much stuff, including things written by others that
might uncontrollably bloat the relevant XML BOS.
