And especially when the technology exists to remove the headache. This is
not a publicly accessible list -- and we could surely adapt to working to
get private replies, as far as I can tell.

It takes me probably less time to perform the action, when I remember it.
But I usually forget, so I have to try to remember, and then remember to
check my out box again before I tell Eudora to transmit the mail, and then
I still forget sometimes.

I also find that it just annoys me a lot to have to delete the extra posts,
which no doubt contributes to my overall level of spleen.
