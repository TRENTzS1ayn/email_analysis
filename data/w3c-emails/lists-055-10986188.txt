   I have not just hinted at it, I advocate it as a way to allow proper
processing of links by browsing applications, which are our prototypical
example of an application that does not need a DTD. And of course, with a
different notion of stylesheet, other forms of application processing than
browsing might also be accomodated without a DTD.

   If you want to _analyse_ link relationships, then I think a requirement
to fetch the DTD is reasonable. What I really want is to use architectural
forms and default attribute values, but not require authors to put
defaultable attribute values in their instances for the benefit of
DTD-challenged applications. XML browsers will almost certainly require
stylesheets anyway, so that adding linking to the stylesheet allows link
behavior to be preserved, in just the case where _all_ you really care
about is behavior.

   No application should have to analyze a turing-complete script to
determine if it invokes link behavior or not. There must always be some
_declarative_ way to determine if a random piece of markup is a link.
