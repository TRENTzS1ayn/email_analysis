I either did not state my case clearly (which, looking back is true), or I
miss understood something.

I completely agree that links must be identifyable without a DTD.  That is
not what I am talking about.  This is also where my understanding becomes
fuzzy.  As I understood it, the idea was that there were provisions for the
stylesheet expressing behavior of the link.  If this is limited to user
interaction behavior, then I am fine.  

The point of my original statement was to remind people that links exist for
reasons other than just hot-spot user navigation.
