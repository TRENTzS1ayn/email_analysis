Ss far as I can tell, all architectural form proposals will require adding
attributes to elements. If we don't want to put them on every single
element we will have to put them in the DTD. If we let the first occurrence
set a default, we have introduced a serial dependency of the sort we
intentionally avoided in the definition of the XML language.
