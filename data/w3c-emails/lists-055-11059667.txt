   two reasons:

    1. Many processors (like browsers) don't need a DTD to do most of their
work. Forcing such processors to fetch a DTD via HTTP is not going to fly.

    2. Sometimes authors have legitimate reasons for not wanting a DTD. For
instance, in drafting short documents, or during document development, or
as an initial stage of DTD development (by creating example instances to
work from).

   In general, I'm personally coming to the belief that a DTD is a good
quality control, and consistency tool, _when that kind of consistency
matters_. But sometimes it either doesn't matter, or it's not worth
deciding too early.
