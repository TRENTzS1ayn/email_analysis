   Yes...

   I'm not even that dedicated to the notion of allowing "recursive"
inclusion of documents in the BOS. I have like it for two reasons:

   1. It is a natural answer to the question "What happens if my companion
has a companion?"

   2. It makes it easier to implement the kind link management structures
that Martin and Steve N. seem to want, by allowing a document serving the
function of a "BOS directory" to be shared between individual documents.

Indeed!

Fer sure.

Yes, exactly!


I am not a number. I am an undefined character.
