This is a statement wanting a proof or explanation.
I don't dispute it, but we need the rationale.
XML DTD designers can choose to aggregate links if they 
wish.

A database for ilinks is how we use them in most systems.
What that database is, is up for grabs and probably 
shouldn't be deeply detailed or we will be adopting 
an implementation, not a standard.  I am not concerned 
that we might break existing processors since none exist.
