[Michael Sperberg-McQueen:]

| I think there are several reasons to expect DTDs might be unavailable
| for some documents:

[etc.]

This is probably implicit in Michael's excellent summary, but allow me
to add that DTD-less documents can also play a useful role at the
intermediate stages of document editing and in the creation of
structured documents from unstructured legacy data.

The idea that SGML documents might be useful in the absence of a DTD
can be a bit shocking at first but is a lot easier to swallow if you
have spent some time working with products like DynaText that require
a DTD only for entity declarations and the identification of EMPTY
elements.  After a while, one begins to consider the DTD a production
quality assurance tool rather than something needed for document
delivery.
