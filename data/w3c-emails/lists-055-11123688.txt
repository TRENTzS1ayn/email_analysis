Thanks for the list. I'm glad to see that someone else is

I didn't ever think the idea was reprehensible: on the contrary I'm
much in favor of it, and going on current user perceptions of
Web/HTML/SGML/XML, I do expect the vast majority of documents to be
DTDless for a very long time.

This is why it is crucial IMHO that XML (and other SGML) browsers come
with complete copies of all the popular DTDs and character entity
files. Obviously we can't force browser authors to do this, but my
guess is that most authors will prefer to use an existing DTD -- if
they use one at all -- rather than design their own, and it could
reduce bandwidth hugely if local copies were used. There would need to
be some kind of updating mechanismn, but that's a job for another day.
