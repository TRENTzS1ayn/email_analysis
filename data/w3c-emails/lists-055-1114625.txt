Nothing, really, but I'm a little concerned about this:

<TABLE><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2<
/TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD></TR></TABLE>

Which is quite unreadable. If you put newlines in, then according to the
"document is a single record" proposal an XML parser would interpret them as
significant (since it can't know element content from mixed content without
a DTD). What is a table-displaying application to do with all of the "data"
between table cells and rows? It will reject them as invalid, one expects,
and spit up the document (though it validates okay). Or should the
application enforce an internal rule that "data is allowed between table
cells and rows, but only if the data consists entirely of newlines." Ugh.
That's what Charles meant about requiring every application to deal with the
problem.

Sorry, I'm not subtle enough to understand the difference between 2 and 3.
How can we define all REs as "significant" without treating them as "data
content" or reintroducing SGML's RE complexity.
