The Web Acronym Server (http://www.ucc.ie/acronyms) says:

   BOS 
       Balance of System [used in photovoltaics to refer 
                          to all hardware except the solar cells] 
       Basic Operating System 
       Boston MA
       Business Office Supervisor 

So I added "our" BOS. Sorry Bert :-)
