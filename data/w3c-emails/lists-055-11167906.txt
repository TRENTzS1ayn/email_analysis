Hmmm. I think the problem is mostly that the *intermediate* rungs of the
location ladder can be scatted, not that the end can be far away. But your
point that perhaps the problem can be isolate is a good one.

What if we simplified HyTime location ladders by insisting on the convention
that in XML-LINK documents, all ilinks and all of their subordinate rungs
must be together in a reserved header element (I don't care whether we
reserve a GI or just an architectural form name in this case). Then you
don't have to parse entire documents just to get their ilinks, and you can
simplify/accelerate your implementation a tiny bit by knowing where to look
for some things.
