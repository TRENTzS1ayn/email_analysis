this is only *sometimes* true in HyTime, because <clink linkend=chatper37>
is a perfectly valid hytime link and locator in one (though, technically,
the term 'locator' is not used in HyTime -- only 'location address element').

again, mostly but not *quite* true: they are only pass-throughs (by which i
take you to mean indirect) if you don't say otherwise. if you set reflevel=1
you don't get indirection, just as is true for the analogous TEI construct.
As soon as you introduce a notion of indirection at all, it ends up
necessary to provide a way to bound it.
