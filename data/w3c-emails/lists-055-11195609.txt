Any solution that does not require every single element to explicitly
declare its semantics will introduce a serial dependancy, including putting
the architectural forms in the DTD. If I hyperlink into the middle of a
document and only ask for an element or entity from that document, that
element or entity is dependant on the doctype declaration from the top of
the document.

Could we solve this problem without a bunch of redundant information (in
either the DTD or the document)? For instance:

<MYPROPRIETARYLINK -XML-HYPERLINK="http://www.foo.com/entity1.ent">

This attribute both declares the XHyTime role of the element and does the
actual linking.
