Given that the ability to group links or location addresses is inherent in
having a generic markup scheme (because you can define any grouping
mechanism you please for your document types), I think the question is
"should XML Link *require* that links and location addresses be grouped?"

While I personally like to group my location addresses most days (for the
reasons Martin cites) there are days I don't.  I think it would be unwise
to define requirements that aren't strictly necessary in order to ensure a
workable system.

For example, when documents are small, there's no effective difference
between grouping at the top and spreading, so why require the authors of
small documents to group?  For large documents, people will presumably
design their structures so they perform well in the intended delivery
environments--I don't think we need to legislate obvious design strategies
if they are not of universal benefit.

I can see a benefit, for example, in having an easy-to-recognize signal
that says "there are ilinks in this document" or "there are bi-directional
alinks in this document" so processors need not parse every document in the
"BOS" looking for links.  

Cheers,

E.
