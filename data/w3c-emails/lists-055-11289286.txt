That's a misrepresentation of my point of view and of what I've
written.  I don't want to forbid all annotation functionality to the world,
I want only to be able to control how my documents may be annotated and
transcluded, in those cases where I have a legal right to do so.  And
in this I have plenty of company.

On another point, "XML BOS" is no help at all.  Hytime invented "BOS";
let's let BOS remain a Hytime term and avoid having to explain how an
"XML BOS" differs from a Hytime BOS every time we use the term.
