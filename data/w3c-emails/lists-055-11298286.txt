No misrepresentation or offense intended. I think I had a mild
misunderstanding (I thought at one point, that you were opposed to
annotation without a mechanism for controlling it), coupled with a tendancy
to type faster than I think.

   Hey, I already tried that tack, but BOS seems to be sticking. While it
may be confusing to use BOS at all, we must qualify it, if we use it. If
anyone else has a better term to suggest, I'm game, but neither of my other
suggestions (companion documents, document working set) met with any
general acceptance.
