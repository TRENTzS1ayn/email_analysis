I asked recently and was told that BOS was being used in the HyTime
sense (by Peter Flynn, who had me look it up in his acronym server).

Well, when I have finished catching up (I _think_ I just finished reading
about RS/RE) I'll understand which HyTime terms are being used to
imply full HyTime conformance and syntax and incomprehensibility to
most mortals, and which are being used loosely by people who find the
HyTime terms useful.

For now, I'm unable to follow the discussion, so I'll keep quiet.
With all my fingers and toes intact! :-)
