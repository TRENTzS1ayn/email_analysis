That's correct.  For what it's worth, SoftQuad Panorama can display SGML
tables with newlines between the tags, even if PCDATA is allowed there.
It isn't particularly hard to implement, as far as I can see.

Try making P a Panorama table and B a table cell in an HTML file... :-)

Note that a parser without a DTD also can't use SHORTREF to interpret quotes.
