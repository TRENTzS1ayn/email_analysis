Yes. Internal SDATA entities, in this starter proposal, don't exist at all. They
are the kind that typically occur in mixed content. External SDATA entities,
like all other external data entities, are parsed *out of context* and should
only be invoked by an attribute value.

The ISO character entity *sets* are external entities, but the entity
declarations within them declare *internal* SDATA entities. They would have to
be redeclared as you say if we are to exclude internal SDATA entities.

This proposal only dealt with entities. I haven't seen any sentiment to abolish
character references. I would support keeping them. (Obviously, we have to if we
are going to exclude internal SDATA entities.)
