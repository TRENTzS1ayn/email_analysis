This sounds like a good approach, as long as the XML spec
also mandates some form of declaration to enable specific
architectures.  IOW, predefined element types are OK, but
we should make sure that documents are only interpreted
with predefined semantics if the author explicitly asks
for that to happen.

This may not seem like a big deal if there is only one
predefined element type ("use any GI you like, as long
as it's not ALINK") but if, as I suspect, there end up
being many different XML sub-architectures each with its
own collection of forms, protecting authors from unforeseen
nameclashes will be important.
