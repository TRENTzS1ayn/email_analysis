Fair enough.  I also see that my statements about not needing the full
syntax were not as clear as they could have been.

This could be made HyTime (or rather, AFDR) compatible simply by saying
that the *virtual* XML SGML declaration includes:

APPINFO "ArcBase=XML"

Which maps the name used for the "ArcBase" declaration to "XML".  I should
have mentioned that before.

By the rules of "architectural markup minimization", by default, elements
are automatically assumed to be the form that matches their elmeent type
names in the absence of an explicit attribute (you can turn this off if you
want to, although it's usually what you want).
