No.
At least not as you have taken the point. Eliot was scolding me for
assuming that his example of how HyTime does things was a suggestion about
how XML should do things. It is still our task to decide what syntax will
be required, and what it is "reasonable" to infer.

I still disagree that we should be saying anything about APIs, except in
the context of style sheets. Markup is for declarative, structural
information. Stylesheets are for declarations of formatting or other
processing behavior.

This means that syntax errors in form elements can silently turn off form
processing. This is even worse than getting form-processing errors when
using a doucment without its DTD.

We are going to need the stylesheet anyway, why not go there in every case?

There is nothing that is too complex for a stylesheet definition.
Stylesheets are for attaching operational semantics to the structural
relations given in a document instance.

   I still think there is no reason to pollute the namespace. If users want
form semantics, and we decide that these function should _not_ be a part of
general XML stylesheets, then they are free to use HTML, or the HTML-in-XML
DTD and stylesheet (which simply says "use HTML").

   I don't see any problems with putting forms into DSSSL style sheets
though. The hard part may be putting forms into CSS -- but I think we can
burn that bridge when we come to it.
