I agree with this -- the AFDR facilities for which <!NOTATION...>
declarations are used are probably not needed for XML, and the
less authors are made to type the better.

I don't see how we can make the magic incantation any
shorter than that (and I firmly believe that *some*
incantation is necessary).

But if this is really seen as a problem, how does this
sound as a compromise solution:  In the absense of any
<?XML-arch ...> declarations, an XML user agent shall
process all architectures that it is capable of processing.
If one or more <?XML-arch ...> declarations are present, an
XML user agent shall not process any architecture that is not
specified.

IOW, an author can use <?XML-arch...> to explicitly specify
which architectures the document uses, or can leave it out
to indicate that it (at least potentially) uses every predefined
XML feature.  [Since the latter option is IMHO the moral equivalent
of using a one-size-fits-all DTD, I _personally_ would not want
to go this route, but there are plenty of current HTML users who
would no doubt prefer it.]

This is of course all based on the assumption that there
will be more XML-based architectures in the future; if
hyperlinking is the only semantic we plan to predefine,
I'd be perfectly happy with "use any GI as long as it's not
ALINK."
