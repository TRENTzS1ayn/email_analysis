Given a better definition or term for stylesheet, I might agree.
However, this is the ONLY community I am aware of that uses 
the term "stylesheet" for anything other than formatting.  There 
will be a problem if DSSSL is the only legal way to handle 
XML processing engines.  XML will be excellent for applications 
that don't know a DSSSL spec or engine exists.  As I noted earlier,
DSSSL and HyTime are on equal footing with regards to widespread 
adoption and implementation.

API *standards* will appear ad hoc. That isn't a problem really, 
because acquisition specs will cite products by name and where 
available, ISO number.
