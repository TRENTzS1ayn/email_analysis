Even the temr stylesheet is disposable in the above. What I really mean is:

"Markup is for declarative, structural information.  Formatting or other
processing behavior is declared externally to the document."

   DSSSL is the only processing standard that this group is comitted to
produce. I stringly believe that we need to address CSS, and a way to pass
markup structures to Java applets via some kind of CSS and DSSSL bindings.
But that is not an argument for the moment, I think.

   Even though we may not standardise anything other than DSSSL, we are
certainly not preventing other groups from doing so...
