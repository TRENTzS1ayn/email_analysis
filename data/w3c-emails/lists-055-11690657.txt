That is how I would see it.  The designers of JavaScript and HTML 
see it otherwise.  So that is one proposed restriction that will 
break the HTML model pretty cleanly away from XML as well as it's
handlers.

Ok.  I am not sure many people understood the implication of a 
commitment by the group to DSSSL bindings to Java applets.

1.  Getting DSSSL support will be as hard or harder to get
than HyTime support.  

2.  Java is a very slow object system.  Active X controls are more
efficient if 
less secure.  

I think the implementation of an Active-X control 
for XML used in conjunction with a Visual Basic framework will 
be rather nice.  Better than the RTF control anyway.  Something 
similar to Peter Murray-Rust's CML application.  But that is 
just the application engineer thinking.  Almost everything 
people *hate* about SGML or think they hate, is there in 
XML, so selling it based on a simplification of SGML won't 
be very successful.  An application is always easier to sell.

Every other day, I get a phone call from someone who states 
that in their informed opinion, the only thing SGML or XML 
are good for are print applications.  So, when we use a term 
like stylesheet, we are predisposing some to accept that argument.
That is why I mention it.

Certainly.
