I've never figured one out.  In fact, as best I can tell, once you
realize that (1) characters aren't bytes, (2) the concrete syntax
specification is supposed to be dealing with the interpretation of
characters as markup, not the representation of characters in the
system (which at best is under the purview of the document character
set), and (3) the document character set isn't the same as the
syntax-reference character set, the prescribed interpretation of
shunned characters is at best nebulous.
