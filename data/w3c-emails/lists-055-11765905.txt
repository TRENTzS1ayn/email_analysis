Groves provide the ability (availibility) to allows applets to access a grove
or the current grove (document).

Unfortunate, but true.

Hmmm, I'm seeing as-good-as or better performance with *some* JIT compilers
in *some* cases.  This means the technology is catching up.  Besides, Java
means everyone can play--not just people who but their operating systems
from Microsoft.  Don't get me wrong... NT is my *desktop* system.

Application development environments are extremely important.  Currently, we
have two XML specific parsers written in Java, we have SP which does it
all, we have Jade, we have Techno Teacher's HyMinder grove implementation, and
(when I release it in *beta* real soon) we will have SEng/DSSSL environment for
SGML and DSSSL written in Java.

We have some good application-oriented engineering going on that should allow
mortals (not-people-on-this-list) to develop XML applications.

We need.....   the killer app!

What is it, beyond everything that you and I and everyone else wants out of
XML, that will demonstrate to the whole world what XML is about and that we can
each put on our respective web servers?  A Java applet that does something
with XML?  A Jade/SP/Thingy that does something cool.

We need something simple that will demonstrate *why* others need XML.
