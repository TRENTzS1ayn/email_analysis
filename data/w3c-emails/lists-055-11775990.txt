I tend to agree, and that's why I hope for CSS support as well... I
actually hate CSS, but the momentum should probably be redirected, rather
than ignored.

   Active-X is a vendor-dependent, platform-dependent closed system. I
certainly hope it will die. I also think (and hope) that
architecture-dependent software interfaces are doomed to slow death.

   One another front, I will only use an "operating system" from MS when
hell freezes over. So I'm perhaps a bit biased, since I expect Active-X to
do nothing for me.

   But the vendor-neutrality issue is a better reason than personal onus
(and sufficient, too).

Maybe we should use a new term like "processing specification"? If we are
generalizing the term stylesheet to the point that people at large will not
understand the concept, we should find a new term.
