I suppose it depends on our vision of what XML is supposed
to be.  If we want to sell it as "something like HTML, but
extensible" then there probably isn't a problem with predefined
element types; XML would provide a sort of "starter tag set"
that authors could extend at will.  However, if we want to sell
it as "a simplified form of SGML" -- with the emphasis on
"Generalized" -- I don't think there should be _any_ predefined
element types.

(Predefined architectural forms are OK, and I think even
necessary, but in order to allow authors full freedom of design
they must be able to specify which, if any, predefined
architectures they want to have enabled.)

This is a different situation:  the Unix shell and the C language
are programming systems which include _as part of their definition_
a library of predefined, user-accessible operations.  SGML _explicitly
refrains_ from predefining any element types, so if XML is to be a
subset of SGML it shouldn't predefine anything either.

However, after re-reading the "Design Principles" document
DD-1996-0001, I can't tell for sure what XML is supposed to
be -- a simplified SGML (which has been my assumption), or
an extensible HTML-like language for Web delivery.  If it
is to be the latter, then the namespace issue is probably
far less important than what I've made it out to be.
