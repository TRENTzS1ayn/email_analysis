Sorry, but I'm going to have to blow the whistle on this thread.  Our
charter as a W3C activity is to develop a language for a class of
applications that HTML isn't designed to handle.  It is *not* to
design a replacement for HTML or to extend HTML (certain unfortunate
statements in the trade press to the contrary notwithstanding).  As
some people have put it, we are working on SGML--, not HTML++.

When we get done, we will have a media type text/xml that will be used
for certain things on the Internet and a media type text/html that
will be used for certain other things on the Internet.  Under the
current charter for this activity, these media types are not competing
in the same problem space.

All things change, and in the fullness of time, our charter may expand
to allow the discussion of XML as an alternative to HTML (or even
allow us to discuss ways in which they might fruitfully interoperate).
But under the current terms of our activity, discussions like this one
are out of order.  If you wish to continue it, you will have to do it
on some other list.  I will be pleased to provide the email addresses
of the current WG members (as I have on a number of occasions in the
past) if anyone wishes to form unofficial lists for the discussion of
topics that are outside the current scope of this activity.

Jon
