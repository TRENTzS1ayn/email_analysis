Everyone seems to be ignoring Michael's immediately preceding posting, which
contains all that an XML user will need to know about RE handling, so I'll
repeat it here:

> RE is insignificant
>(i.e. not passed to any downstream application, not part of the
>XML grove plan) when it occurs in any of the following patterns:

>  start-tag nondata* RE
>  RE nondata* end-tag
>  RS nondata+ RE

>where non-data is defined this way:

>  nondata ::= comment declaration
>             | processing instruction
>             | character reference
>             | entity reference
>             | entity-end
>             | marked section declaration
>             | included subelement
>             | short reference
>             | shortref use declaration
>             | link set use declaration

For the record, both James Clark and myself agree with this statement, which is
both concise and formal.

Michael then went on to provide some examples:

>The element Q contains no REs in any of the following cases:

>  <q>
>  Listen to my heart beat.
>  </q>

>This is the simple case:  RE adjacent to a start-tag or end-tag.

>  <q>
>  <!-- sound track is silent -->
>  Listen to my heart beat <!-- --
>  ><?DIRECTOR begin: audio>
>  and beat and beat and beat.
>  </q>

>Here rule (a) takes care of line 1, rule (c) of line 2, the comment of
>line 3, rule (c) again of line 4, and rule (b) of line 5.

>  <q><!-- sound track is silent -->
>  Listen to my heart beat.
>  </q>

>This is the one case I can think of where the first RE is not
>actually adjacent to the start-tag.
