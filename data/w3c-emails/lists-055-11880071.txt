I'd sent a private message to Tim a little earlier with one point. I also
prefer all lowercase to uppercase, but given that we may want to identify
the &U- as Unicode, I thought keeping the 'U' uppercase would help as in

    &U-babe;

Also, since Unicode is a trademarked name it seems to make a bit more sense
to keep it uppercase, and it also differentiates the rest of the entity
name ('babe') from the part that doesn't change ('&U-').
