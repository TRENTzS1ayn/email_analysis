I'm amazed.  The Unicode Standard 2.0 says on page 1-5 that
the Unicode value of a character "is expressed as U+nnnn,
where nnnn is a four digit number in hex, using the digits
0-9 and the letters A-F."  Considering that we don't want
non-SGML apps to have to do case folding, if we are
to prefer one form, how can it not be all-caps?
