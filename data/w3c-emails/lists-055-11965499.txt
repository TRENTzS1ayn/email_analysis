What, me want entities? If I could get away without having to use the
entities I would. What I want is reusable IDs to the container parts you
correctly identify.
My only reservation was that I was not seeing host1 and chain2 as being
valid HyTime. If you say they are I am as happy as a sandboy - (whatever
that may be):-}

For those that don't want to use entities is there any way we can do this by
stringing together attribute values?

(Incidentally Eliot, this was exactly the point I was talking about that
resulted in your private message asking me to explain the need.)
