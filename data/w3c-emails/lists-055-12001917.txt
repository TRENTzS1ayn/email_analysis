I wasn't picking out HoTMetaL particularly here, only the fact that their
menu matches the URL spec correctly.

A) We have agreed that there will need to be unmanaged URLs created by copy
and paste
b) An intelligent system should easily be able to break the copied URL into
manageable components for storage in the link manager.

The majority will not know, or care, how to manage their files: they simply
cut and paste unmanageable strings that have no meaning as far as they are
concerned. Only people who know the problems of managing URLs will need to
worry about them being broken down into their logical components, just as
only those who care about the structure of their text files will need to use
SGML/XML. For the morons HTML will suffice.
