I'm not sure what you mean by "stringing together attribute values".  Do
you mean the values of attributes specified on different location address
elements (as in David's example) or attributes specified on the same
element.  If the latter, I'm having a hard time seeing the management
benefit, although I could see the benefit in separating out the different
semantic components of a URL string (except that, as has been pointed out
in the "URL editing dialog" subthread, it may or may not be useful to
provide that for a syntax as simple as URLs).

There is no HyTime-direct way to say that you want an address to be cobbled
together from a variety of attributes on the same element, but as I've been
saying with stultifying frequency, you can always define a "query" that
will give you the effect, however twisted such an approach might be.  If
XML Link wanted to include four attributes for decomposing URLs, it could
certainly be made understandable to a sufficiently-functional HyTime engine
(e.g., one that supported arbitrary SDQL queries or their equivalent).

Cheers,
