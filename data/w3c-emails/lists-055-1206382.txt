Use the 10646 private use zone.  We'll have to find some way to specify the
meanings of code points in the private use zone (maybe XML needs an
SGML-declaration equivalent that can do this); but with SDATA entities you
equally have to find a way to describe their meaning, so I don't think you
lose much by junking them.
