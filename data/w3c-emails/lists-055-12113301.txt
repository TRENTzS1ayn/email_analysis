Consider that there are multiple hub-capable languages on 
the internet.  More are being added.  Most support URLs.
That is granted.  However, things can be more complicated 
than HTML (a specific application).  VRML (another specific 
application) allows for links with multiple URLs.  These 
are used to declare precedence to the VRML browser 
for a set of targets.  XML is not an application:  it 
as is SGML is a metalanguage.  So, while we can always 
use or recommend application conventions, we still are 
left with either

1.  Define a way to define links (meta)
2.  Define the links (application).

Decide what the requirements are.
