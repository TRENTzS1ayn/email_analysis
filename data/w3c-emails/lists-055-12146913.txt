While I believe that there is merit to your proposal, I do not think it is fair to say 
that anyone is suggesting that XML link should always be as utterly umanagable as 
HTML's. Entities, for instance, provide URL component reuse (though not as flexible as 
your proposed version). XML will probably allow indirectable links. XML will probably 
allow independant links.

In my mind, the benefit to your idea is that, the link "base" can be in a different 
document instance (as I understand it). Will this have real-world value, though?
