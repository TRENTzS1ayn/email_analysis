 A symbol that is not in the character set would be like any other graphic; use
an external NDATA entity. That gives you an opportunity to declare the notation
explicitly (and data attributes for it), which SDATA doesn't provide.

Remember that SGML has never required a separate file for  external entities.
With Formal System Identifiers, we can now formally specify when we are using
container Storage Managers that let multiple entities occur in the same storage
object  (e.g., TAR, PKZIP, MIME).

If you don't like using external NDATA for this purpose, we could agree to allow
internal SDATA entities in XML. If so, we would probably want a convention, such
as the one proposed for PIs, that would identify the notation for the SDATA
entity.
