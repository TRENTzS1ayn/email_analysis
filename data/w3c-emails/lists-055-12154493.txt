      I'm done with this thread. I think we don't need additional syntax to

   disagree on the final solution.

I'm listening and I agree with David. Priorities as I see them are

   a. provide the ability for it to be possible to create a
      well-formed XML instance that can be dealt with by existing HTML
      browsers (or with very minor mods to allow browser makers to
      claim some degree of XMLness - it may be important
      marketing-wise for them to be able to say this);

   b. provide the ability for conformant XML instances to use much
      more sophisticated facilities, at the penalty that these will
      only work with four-wheel browsers.

(I don't happen to believe that we need to provide for badly-formed
instances.)

At some stage soon we are going to need a lucid and explanatory
middle-ground document which explains what we are doing (and why XML
is A Good Thing) for the consumption of webmasters and webmistresses
who don't have the time or knowledge to go through the spec in detail,
and it should include an even shorter and even less technical summary
for the use of managers who simply want to be persuaded that this is
something they need to ask for.
