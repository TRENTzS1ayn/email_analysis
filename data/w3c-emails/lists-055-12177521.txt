However, for some schemes the selector is not _completely_ opaque.
For any scheme that uses the "generic-RL" format defined in RFC 1808
"Relative Uniform Resource Locators" (including http:, ftp:, file:,
and, I think, gopher:), user agents can decompose the selector into
network location, path, parameters, and query components; and the
path component can be further decomposed by splitting it at each '/'
character.

I think that the Formal System Identifier definition was also
designed to support relative locations in a way that's compatible
with relative URLs (viz. the SOIBase attribute).

Martin, would it serve your needs if instead of providing a
mechanism for specifying URL components separately, XML
allowed system identifiers to be specified relative to
some base identifier, a la FSIs or the HTML3/HTML+ "base"
attribute?
