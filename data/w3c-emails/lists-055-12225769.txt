Yes.  Acknowledged.  This wasn't posted at you, but to be
clear because even if not explicit, from many postings, 
it is easy to imply even where the implication is mistaken.
HTML is ubiquitous, but not limiting.  I expect to be 
using it for a long time as I am a Microsoft user and 
developer and they are on public record for saying "we
recognize the HTML is the backbone of the Internet".
Since I don't choose the bricks for the house, I can't 
complain about the mortar.

True, but they are also likely to be familiar with SGML and IMO, 
that is where many early XML adopters are likely to come from.  To 
me, this means that <a href= name= etc. should be expressible 
in XML *without change* just as the VRML examples must 
be expressible, but not without change (VRML is syntax-tight).  
The resistance will come from the other 99% of the world's SGML users.  

That is not my point. 

I only wanted to demonstrate a URL-capable language that does 
different things with the URL, particularly the use of the 
parameter fields or #hack and including a script as the value of a URL.
Also, I note the more difficult hub-capable languages are 
being defined and in use, so segments of the WWW author population 
are capable of much more complex authoring languages.

True.  When selling it, that will be Item 1 at the top in 24 point
Arial.

This is absolutely the case.  I'm going blind reading them but I 
was already going blind.  Age.... :-)

Yes.  Without knowing the full range of implications of the URL, MIME, 
the http protocols, etc., it is not possible to know where baby and 
bathwater part company.
