Given that nobody other than myself seems to be interested in indirect
links, and that for direct links the only form that is getting any support
is that of an opaque string, I ask myself whether the XML community has any
interest in having multiheaded links? If so:

What form would a multiheaded link take? A concatenated set of opaque
strings embedded at the reference point in the text?

If I want to point to a number of points in the same document do I have to
repeat the full location information for each one?

If I want to reference the same set of points at another point in the
document do I have to repeat all the information for each link at that point
as well?

If there is some mechanism for using a short form of addressing how will
this work when my multiheaded link needs to point to 6 places in this
document and 6 places in that document?

How can I say I want this bit of the text linked to the same points that
that bit of text in this document and that bit of text in that document
point to?
