Sure. We don't want to allow zenkaku space in the header because it
will complicate parsing of the header, though this will make it
easier for Japanese users to make illegal XML files.

I have seen many Japanese users accidentally put zenkaku space into
places where it was illegal according to the SGML declaration they
were using. They got many erros that were *hard* for them to
understand.
