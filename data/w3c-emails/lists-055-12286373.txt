You could have fooled me.  All we see on the list is the squabble, 
not the work underway, which I suppose we all sanction once 
presented.  Not a good way to run a list, Eliot.  Not at all.

It's a pity that doesn't become more apparent to the list members who 
are not members of the ERB.  A more open process is wanted and needed.

I did not say there was.  I have said this does not appear to be 
the case.

You are putting words in my mouth.  It is already crowded in there.

Great.  Put up a draft of a design we can all read and contribute to.
Otherwise, shut down this list, open a company, sell a product 
and compete with it.
