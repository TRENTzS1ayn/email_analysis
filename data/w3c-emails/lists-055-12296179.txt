This work only started as of last Wednesday's meeting, following the
holiday hiatus when the ERB could not meet.  I don't know what the editors'
schedule is, but I would expect to see a draft pretty soon.

My proposal has been out and available for a couple of weeks now, yet
there's been very little direct comment it on it here in this list, which
surprises me.  I expected to see either a counter proposal or some comment
on the proposal itself.  Given that this was a proposal by a member of the
ERB and that, in the absence of any other proposal it would almost
certainly be taken as the base for any ERB-defined design, I don't see how
the process could be any more open at this point.

Cheers,

E.
