I wanted to be quiet, but this is a gross misrepresentation of the state of
affairs. The claim is that you have a syntax (entity references) that will
give you the indirection that you want. While it's not elegant (it's
actually kinda yucky), You have not presented anything that you can do with
one syntax that you cannot do with the other.

The issue of the locsrc is a different one, but if we can include an
equivalent of the "BASE" attribute (and I think we should), then we can do
the entitized equivalent of locsrc without the additional implementation
overhead of locsrc.

You may not be winning the argument about syntax, but I've seen no-one
dismiss your concerns about enabling link management (by _some_ mechanism).

As Eliot and Len pointed out, this has not been in significant question for
quite some time.
