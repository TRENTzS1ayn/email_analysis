I think that it is important to make the distinction between indirect links
and indirect link *components*. An indirect link is just a link which points
to a link, which points to a link, which points to an addressable object.

You have proposed a mechanism for link components, for "roping together"
address components from different parts of a document so that one component 
can change without others breaking.  We all agree this is a good idea, but 
are not sure if it belongs in XML. I wonder if it can't be accomplished as a 
particular semantic of regular indirect links. Instead of "go to this link and 
then follow it", it would be "go to this link and then prepend it to the 
existing one and follow the new link."
