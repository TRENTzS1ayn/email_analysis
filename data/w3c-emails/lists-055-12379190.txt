The character repertiore is fixed, though we are allowing different
coded encoding as input, which are to be translated using the
appropriate BCTF/decoder into a set of bit combinations.

Yes.

SGML is silent on this issue, I believe (we went through this for
HTML, and I invoked this silence as a way for saying older browsers
would be conformant with the HTML I18N draft).

I think we could make this a reportable error (not a fatal error).

A more interesting question is what to do with characters that do not
appear within the character repertoire we have defined...
