I consider this a serious flaw in the spec.  If the declaration's
character set changes, the interpretation of numeric character
references will also change.  All XML documents must be parseable with
a single SGML declaration.  I don't believe that this is difficult.
There may be entity managers that can't cope with a document whose
encoding is not identical to the document character set, but I
consider that a limitation of the system.

I don't believe so.  All the markup characters can be recommended in 8
bits - unsupportable data characters would have some fallback behavior
when the document is translated from its native encoding to an 8-bit
encoding.  There would be data loss, but it should not be silent.
