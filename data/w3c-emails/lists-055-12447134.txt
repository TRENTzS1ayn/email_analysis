You're right.  We're taking too long to get the strawman out.  Sorry.
Following on the proposal, I expect some numbered lists of votable
items to bring structure to the debate.  I will say, however, that the
unstructured debate has been very substantially enlightening, at least to me.

One thing on our side; this is going to be shorter than XML.
