I don't remember the examples, but we should have the possibility of
separate address elements (I think eliot and I both suggested it, and I
think Eliot did as well). Given that, you simply need to use separate
address elements (each with its own base). This is one reason to enable
such indirection. And since it runs in the "forward" direction from the
link, it's easy to code.

Pointing to an element with an ID requires first searching for that element
and resolving it, before interpreting the link (a step back before the step
forward, as it were). Entity resolution is something people already have.
Relative URL resolution is something they already understand, and
implementors also have the (trivial) code to implement it in hand.

   And, I'm not sure that it buys us _that_ much.
