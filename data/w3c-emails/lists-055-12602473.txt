(I hold no brief for the mess Dave is concerned about, and have no
intention of defending the URL RFCs ...)

One of the problems here is the wooly, Hydra-headed concept of "resource."

URNs offer a way to communicate "better URLs," and to avoid binding
that information with the document as originally served.  I think
any attempt to get the full effect with URLs will be unsatisfactory,
but it should be possible to get a partial effect, which is all you're
asking for.

RFC 1808 isn't ambiguous on the use of base URLs beyond what it describes,
it just doesn't deal at all with them.  (Or am I missing something?)
Not that that observations helps answer your (legitimate) questions.

This is a matter of defining semantics, and it might be best
to do it at the level of MIME type.  For any given DTD, you should
be able to specify that an element holds this information; for
HTML it could have been one of the values of META or LINK, but
that horse is out of the barn and the barn's burned down.  For
XML, this could be one particular link semantic communicated by
means of an attribute the value of which is (one idea) an FPI
or URN pointing to a well known description of the meaning of the
attribute.  It doesn't have to be done with BASE, and if I look
out into the driving rain long enough I can begin to think of 
circs under which I would want different BASE and PREFERRED ADDRESS
values  (I say preferred addresses because the same issue arises
for URNs.)

RFC 1808 does define precedence of BASEs derived by different
means, so at least there is no ambiguity here.  But here's where
that wooly monster "resource" bites me hard.  Are you concerned
that a different document will be fetched when the user clicks
on <a href="#loc"> than the one he already has, if BASE is supplied?
If so, why?  the combination of base and fragment ID was created
by the author, perhaps deliberately.  Or are you concerned that 
the same document is identified by the browser as two different
ones?  

NB:  RFC 1866 appears to indicate that in the above case
(<a href="#loc">) one doesn't use BASE:

7.4. Fragment Identifiers

   Any characters following a `#' character in a hypertext address
   constitute a fragment identifier. In particular, an address of the
   form `#fragment' refers to an anchor in the same document.
