Forgive me for diverting the attention of the group. I intended the 
discussion about base merely as an example of the issues that Elliot 
has so clearly articulated.

I too have no intention of defending or attacking the RFC or any web
practice except as necessary to better understand the needs that will
drive the decisions of this group.
