I'll let other members of the ERB correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe
our assumption, in fact the whole purpose of this exercise, is to enable
the creation of *XML parsers* that are much simpler than SGML parsers but
define XML in such a way that it also be processed as SGML without change
(to the instance at least, it may be necessary to create a DTD or modify
the XML DTD).

We want this to be done by an XML parser for the same reason SGML has the
record end handling rules--so applications don't have the opportunity to do
it wrong.

Cheers,

E.
