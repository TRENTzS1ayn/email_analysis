[Paul Prescod:]

| If we follow the formatting analogy to its conclusion, linking would
| be done by a processing specification, (stylesheet) just as formatting
| is.  Which would mean that linking behaviour is part of our next
| section, not this one. (Maybe...the definition of stylesheet is vague
| enough to do it now or then).

Mightily as I have striven to keep the discussion of stylesheets out
of this phase of the Activity, it is apparent that we can't step
around the question of whether link behavior should properly be
specified in stylesheets; we will have to confront this issue before
we can finish a link specification.  But to maintain focus, it should
be considered later as a separate question.
