I half agree and half violently disagree.  Maybe it's just the
wording.

Yeah:  often there *is* no canonical address stuff should be
retrieved by:  if you're on the East Coast get it from the site in
North Carolina; if on the West Coast, from the Petaluma site; if in
Europe, from Oxford; if ...

It seems to me that what one needs for deduping is a unique
identifier:  i.e. an (F)PI or a URN.  Would the problem of deduping
not be solved just by allowing a doc to say 'By the way, this is my
FPI'?

Or have I misunderstood?
