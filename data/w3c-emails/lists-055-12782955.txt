I need to be sure it happens, and mapping behavior to some label
on a element is only one way to do it.  There is more than one SGML
way to skin a cat.

And in response to Jon's clear statement, I certainly don't want to 
forbid him from taking this approach, and there is nothing in XML 1.0
to prevent him from using it, but I don't want to be *required* to use it.

Put another way, I need to be able to bind link behavior to my document,
and I want to be able to describe relationships  that do not map
to behaviors.

That is the rendering of the text  content of the link, not the 
behavior we were talking about.

If part of my document's text is included through a link, *and the
document is being displayed*, the included text must be displayed when 
downloaded so as to display the full text as I intended it, complete 
with safety warnings, etc.  Else I can't rely on my data format to
convey my content, and the XML format is useless for practical
purposes, however interesting it may be for hypertext theory.

It doesn't display any link behavior or the underlying document to 
the user, however.

They have to distinguish beween traversal and inclusion links, else
they can't represent the  document properly, even in outline.  Note 
that we don't have text inclusion in HTML.

Your site link map is not my XML document.
