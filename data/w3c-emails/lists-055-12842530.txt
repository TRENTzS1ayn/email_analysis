Eliot:
| All we're saying is that we don't want XML's link representation scheme to
| be *limited* to behavior-only links.  We also recognize two facts:

What you were saying is that you want to specify a set of relationship
labels.  I think the taxomony of relationships is orthogonal to the
mechanism for using them, and competition among different taxonomies
should be encouraged, hence XML itself should not specify a
taxonomy.
  
You have not given a single example of a label you want to specify.  
Please do so.


Regards, Terry
