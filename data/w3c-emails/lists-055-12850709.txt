Eliot, please reread this thread and contemplate how the Web
works now, successfully distinguishing traversal links from inclusion
links.  Practical requirements are real and successful systems
make it possible to implement them.

But you can't *ever* do this with SGML or XML or any other generalized
format unless you control both the server and browser.  Even on the Web I
can change almost all aspects of the presentation of the pages I get,
except for that stuff that's in an opaque format (controls, graphics, java
scripts, etc.).

If you want this level of control, downtranslate the XML to PDF and use
Acrobat or do what Microsoft does and use SGML to construct closed CD-ROMs
or define a specific protocol for delivering information that must be
viewed exactly as intended (e.g., IETMs).

No generalized data representation scheme can *ever* guarantee behavior of
any sort--that can only be done by defining the specific presentation and
delivery system and then ensuring that end users have no facility for
modifying any part of the system--in other words, unless the data is
delivered as a single, opaque, unconfigurable black box, all bets are off.

Asking for the above is like expecting a security attribute to prevent
people from looking at data they don't have clearance for.  

Cheers,

E.
