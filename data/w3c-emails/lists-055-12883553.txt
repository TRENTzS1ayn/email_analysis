While discussion continues on the issues raised by Eliot's post, allow
me to pose a parallel but simpler set of questions.

Assume that some syntax has been specified for labeling the
relationship between link ends.  Consider the following incomplete
list of relationship types, lifted directly from existing proposals
for HTML standardization:

   PARENT
   CHILD
   PREVIOUS
   NEXT
   IMPLIES

Is it possible to agree on a basic list of such types?

Is it useful to agree on a basic list of such types?

If such a list were defined, would it be better to restrict the labels
that could be applied to a relationship to the choices on the list, or
would it be better to allow additional labels not on the list to be
applied on an ad hoc basis?

Jon
