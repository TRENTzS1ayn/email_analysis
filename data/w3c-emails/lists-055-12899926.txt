This one is neat.  It can be a pure arc, but in practice it 
is goto or gosub parameter.

No unless you intend as HTML did, to define an application 
language.

Utility is a characteristic of the domain of the requirements.

No application language based on SGML contructs has succeeded in 
restricting the addition of tags or attibutes to the language unless 
it is a *dead* language.  That is why most SGML applications
interoperate 
at the level of portable, validatible files.
