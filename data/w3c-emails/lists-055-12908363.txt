If I want to willingly override your "link behaviour specification" 
 to make your document not behave or look right, how is that any different 
than doing the same in a stylesheet? What if I define a stylesheet that
displays "IMPORTANT-NOTICES" in 0 point font. The effect is the same. Your
text is lost, it is my "behaviour specification" (stylesheet's) fault.

I think you have convinced me that we should predefine a "Legal" link type (or 
link type attribute??) that says that the legal meaning of this document 
changes if the link is not followed. That link attribute could be applied to 
both the stylesheet and the "link process specification" in your example.

That's right. So it may ignore the link behaviour specifier, just as it would
ignore a stylesheet. I think that that is a good argument for keeping those
behavioural definitions external to the document.

And without a stylesheet you can't represent the document properly, even
in outline, either. Footnotes become "inlined". Index entries get inlined.
Meta-information looks as if it is part of the title. Etc.

I meant my site link map to be a visual tool that surfs a website and
builds a map of it, using/displaying as much or as little of the semantics of 
the site as I ask it to.
