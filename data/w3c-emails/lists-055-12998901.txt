Finally Terry has said something sensible on this topic. (Since Terry
usually is sensible, this is less a surprise than the argument about link
labels).

Defining link types is as hard as defining a universal DTD. A lot of danger
there. I'd rather stay out of it. didn't Murray Maloney's list get up to 40
types or more? I think Randy Trigg's thesis had 150 or so, but I don't have
it available to check.

On the other hand, a non-binding annex of useful names for common links
might actually help people to understand (and thus use) link types.

I'm thinking something like maybe:
   internal-reference
   quote-external work
   cite-external-work
   footnote-or-annotation

That list may already be too long, but as a list of suggestions it might be
useful, and not as perniciously processing oriented as Len's "gosub".
