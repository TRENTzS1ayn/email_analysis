Another category of link behaviour is "transclusion" or
"simultaneous presentation" linking.  For example,
HTML's <IMG SRC="..."> can be thought of as a transcluding
contextual link; and HyBrowse can be configured to transclude
the contents of an ilink anchor at the point where another anchor
appears (useful for inlining annotations, etc).  Other types
of links could specify simultaneous presentation, e.g.,
"whenever the user lands on Section 2.3, display Figure 4
in a pop-up window and play the audio file xyzzy.wav".

With these types of links traversal is automatic, so there's
no notion of presentation/state before/during/after traversal.

Agree!
