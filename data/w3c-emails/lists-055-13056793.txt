Ding!  Thank you!  I've been hunting for a good
word to describe this sort of link, and "get"
is just right: short, Anglo-Saxon, and to the point.
Much better than the polysllabic obfuscatory Latinate
terminology I've been using up to now.

Wait a minute... I thought the whole premise of the XML
effort was that the architectural foundation of the
majority of Web applications -- HTML -- is not powerful
enough to enable the kinds of applications the SGML community
would like to see.  Or does that premise only apply to
HTML's fixed tag-set and not to its (admittedly primitive)
hyperlink mechanism?
