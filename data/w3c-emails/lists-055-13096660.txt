I believe a more accurate answer here is that the majority of Web
applications only lex the documents, and therefore don't build parse trees
that would enable more complex link relationships. This design decision may
have been the result of the assumption of broken HTML markup and/or the
inability of the programmers to create something as complex as nsgmls for
WWW that could also provide error recovery. A whole lotta error recovery.

Spyglass, Microsoft, Netscape and I'm sure most other Web browsers couldn't
respond to a request to jump "within element with ID 'a25', to third child
of type 'P' within the second child of type 'LI'" if you held a sharpened
potato to their heads. And this ability is precisely (for me) one of the
exciting promises of XML links.
