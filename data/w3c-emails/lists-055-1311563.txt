For SGML, should this rule be applied after OMITTAG inference?
For example, in:

    <!doctype test [
<!element test - - (x,y,z)>
<!element (x,y,z) O O (#PCDATA)>
    ]>
    <test>
    <x>content of x</x>
    content of y
    <z>content of z</z>
    </test>

the REs before and after "content of y" are ignored,
even though there are no syntactic start- and end- tags
matching the above patterns.

Also, an RE immediately following the start-tag of an EMPTY
element is not discarded:

    <!doctype test [
<!element test - - (#PCDATA|e)*>
<!element e - O EMPTY>
    ]>
    <test>
    asdf
    <e>
    qwerty
    </test>


Perhaps "start of element" and "end of element" would be
more appropriate than "start-tag" and "end-tag"?
