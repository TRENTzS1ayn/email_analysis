I obviously interpreted differently what Terry wrote. I understood him
to mean a document X, part of which is composed of the whole or part of
some other document Y, eg
 
   X
   para of mine
   para of mine
   <--------------- para taken from the middle of another doc (Y)
   para of mine
   etc

Obviously it is possible to do this with only browser control: just
it's inefficient in bandwidth to have to get the whole of doc Y, only
to drop some of it on the floor. And I thought invisible transclusion
was evil, anyway :-)

   No generalized data representation scheme can *ever* guarantee behavior of
   any sort--that can only be done by defining the specific presentation and

Right, but I didn't think we were trying to do this anyway. We're
developing the infrastructure to allow browsers to extend their
