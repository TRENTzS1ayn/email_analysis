Same as buying a chainsaw and throwing away the instruction book, then
claiming you didn't know it was dangerous to try to hold the blade
while it was running.

   I think you have convinced me that we should predefine a "Legal"
   link type (or link type attribute??) that says that the legal
   meaning of this document changes if the link is not followed. That

Ping. Get-Rich-Quick scam #97. Your lawyer has been notified :-)
I like the concept but the terminology frightens me.
