| Another category of link behaviour is "transclusion" or
| "simultaneous presentation" linking.  For example,
| HTML's <IMG SRC="..."> can be thought of as a transcluding
| contextual link; and HyBrowse can be configured to transclude
| the contents of an ilink anchor at the point where another anchor
| appears (useful for inlining annotations, etc).  Other types
| of links could specify simultaneous presentation, e.g.,
| "whenever the user lands on Section 2.3, display Figure 4
| in a pop-up window and play the audio file xyzzy.wav".

I note that you have described the link behavior by describing the
presentation.

| With these types of links traversal is automatic, so there's
| no notion of presentation/state before/during/after traversal.

Then what the user sees and what the system sees is static, so
A1=A2=A3 and B1=B2=B3.  That wasn't my point.  My point was that once
you've completely described what the user sees and what the system
sees, you have described the behavior.  There isn't something else
left over.  My claim is that if there is some aspect of behavior left
over, then you have not completely described what the user sees and
what the system sees.  Behavior is appearance: that's all there is,
there ain't no more.*
