An implication of the ERB's current RE/RS proposal just posted by
Eliot is that extra spaces within the text of a paragraph (for
example) would not be collapsed by this rule (though of course they
could be by the application).  So people who have gotten into the
habit of prettying up their source by indenting text (for example)
will have to unlearn this habit if the receiving app isn't set up to
collapse the extra spaces.

Personally (speaking now only as the five-line perl hacker and someone
who has to teach this stuff in two-day extension courses), this is
fine with me because it's so incredibly easy to explain: you want
spaces, put 'em in; you don't want spaces, leave 'em out.  But I
thought that this aspect should be made explicit.
