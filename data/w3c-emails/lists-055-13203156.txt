A SYSTEM identifier is _always_ non-protable, because I am not _required_
to implement any semantics for SYSTEM identifiers.

Eliot's query was about a potential SGML feature. So I answered in terms of
SGML. Actually, in SGML there's a bit better case because of FSIs, but even
there, it's thin. In XML I think the case is worse, since a URL is
well-known to be a transient thing.

But as this is not an XML issue, we should abandon it.
