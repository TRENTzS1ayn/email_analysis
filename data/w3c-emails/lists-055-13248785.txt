No.  Read Eliot's earlier posts on the subject.

The addressing mechanisms who are defining?

Nope.  I think is easier to implement a declaration on an attribute 
that hints at behavior than to drag a DSSSL spec through the Internet.

Nope.  I think a gosub is a gosub and a goto is a goto.  State space, 
not user interface.  Read the MID documents sometime.  Altering the 
documents to get rid of optional attributes is not exactly rocket 
science.  Even SGML, nor will XML enable us to do what you claim 
can be done.  We change them everytime we rehost.  With SGML, 
we change them a heckuva lot less.

Yes, and VRML has done both already.  You should study it and 
understand what frameworks are, how they work, and why they 
work that way.  Now.  Today.  Not ten years from now.

So you say.  But that is yet another religious assertion.
