See Fundamentals of Data Structures... just so you and the
guy writing the parser can have the same conversation.

Good.  A Table of Contents is a terrible thing to waste.

No magic, David.

Could be.  It's a nice safe academic position.  Hell on someone selling 
systems though, and hell on those who have to use them.  HTML won 
because it was easy.  Some folks have made that point to me too 
many times to forget it.

XML is about a standard syntax for enabling designers to write 
quick and dirty application languages and parsers.  XML stylesheets do 
not exist, nor do they have to.  You want them to, and you want 
them to be something you like, but I am not bound by that nor is XML.
At least, not yet.

Goto(label).  Considered pretty weak even in C.

Right.  So?

No doubt about it.  The trick will be to get a user who never had 
to write a stylesheet before to do <font></> to do it now:  for the
cause.

Two blank eyes stare back from under the hood of the robe of 
academic theory.  They see... a 1970 database where a millenium 
object-oriented system should be.  The poverty...ahh, the poverty.
