I think we need an XML public discussion list, at least for a while. I
think this has worked well for the TEI. I'm not sure when such a thing
should start though. Once it has, every piece of XML literature needs to
have the address blazoned on it though.

That Q&A from the conference was excellent and should certainly be on the web.

This list is not the place.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I've dropped comp.text.sgml, except
for occasional peeks every few months or so.
