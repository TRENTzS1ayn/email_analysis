My only problem with this is that this is something new, just for linking.
IN XML I do _not_ have the ability to say how something is displayed, but
not what it means.

I can run my documents through a random element-renamer and tell the
browser that the stylesheet is required, but then I'm still at the mercy of
the browser.

This is easy, and is supported for everything but is likely to be unpopular.

Again, how does one propose to enforce this. We don't offer the option in
markup for text display, because we can't. Why do we _need_ to offer it for
linking.

I agree that it would be nice, for some applications but it's a requirement
that is made almost unenforceable by generic markup. It's even
unenforceable in Acrobat, if you're willing to pick through the file and
try to mangle that. Though acrobat has such a small level of abstraction,
that it is _very unlikely._

It seems to me that 4 is what we need to specify, and what we have already
agreed to specify for document formatting. We allow people to use special
broswers or DTDs to achieve goals 1 and 3 by enforcing additional
semantics, but we cannot require such behaviors from general XML
processors.

If this is true, then I have radically mis-understood what we can (and
intend to) offer in the non-linking display of documents. How could we
enforce a display discipline on top of a generic XML parser? I can see how
we can enable publishers to write XML-using software that dopes such
things, but it seems otherwise opposed to the whole purpose of using XML.
