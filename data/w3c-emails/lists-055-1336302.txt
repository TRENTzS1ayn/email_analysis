This is another thing that becomes moot if whitespace normalization is
an application convention instead of a parser rule.  For non-verbatim
elements, spaces can be normalized (in the grove of a DSSSL engine, or
before rendering in a simpler browser), and they can be preserved in
verbatim elements.  I think it simplifies a lot to define it this way,
but I'd love to hear counterarguments.
