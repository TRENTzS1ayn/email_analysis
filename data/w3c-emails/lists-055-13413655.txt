I certainly agree on principle with the idea of a shared link vocabulary,
but I was under the impression that we would specify the link syntax as an
architecture and supply the hooks to allow document authors to use their
own personal (eg., non-English) language for links to that architecture.
I'm just against creating a somewhat arbitrary-length, bounded list of link
types and putting that in the normative part of the XML spec. Maybe an
arcform attribute could actually be the linktype name. Dunno. I don't quite
understand how there could be an architectural meta-stylesheet (or
'behavior-sheet'). Maybe this is something we could develop.
