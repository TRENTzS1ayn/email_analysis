Do you mean this as stated, or do you mean all sequences of white space
consisting of RSs, REs, and spaces are collapsed to a single space?

I'm not so worried about the RE's that migrate around PIs at the moment.

What I'm hoping for is that--discounting the case where the relative
order of the PI and the RE affects the resulting display--when the user
likes what they see presented by an "XML browser" and they then bring
up an "SGML browser/viewer" on the document, they'll see the same thing.

I don't know how much to weigh cases such as:

<p>He was <em>over- </em>sensitive.</p>
which would come out in XML as:
He was over-sensitive.
and in SGML as: 
He was over- sensitive.

At least if the XML were "XML-normalized" to strip ignored spaces, then
the result would be handled the same by both XML and SGML parsers.
