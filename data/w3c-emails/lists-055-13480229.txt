I agree on both counts.  I would *definitely* prefer multiple attlists,
so I can add archforms to elements.  That would require an SGML
improvement/change... but it would be a very interesting one.

If we can't have repeated ATTLIST specifications for a given GI,
using processing instructions does work, and we do have software
that does this -- Panorama has a processing instruction that activates
the content of a given element, or the value of a specific attribute,
as a URI-style link.  Without suggesting that we use the same syntax,
would it help if I explained the functionality?
