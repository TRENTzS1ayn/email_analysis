Before anyone picks me up on my stoopid mistake it should be a ? and not a #
in front of the SDQL query, giving it the form:

german_refs='http://www.developer.com/docs/de/index.html?SDQL(match (element
term) "Schwarzwald")'>

(Shows the advantage of having the machine generate the query rather than
the user, who is prone to make syntactic mistakes!)
