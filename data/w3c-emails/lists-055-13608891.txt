No one said it was hard to implement.  We've all done that.
I say:

1.  You cannot eliminate applications from XML that do not use it 
in all cases.

2.  In cases where you do not eliminate it, a pure indirect system 
requirement is fruitless.  XML has the power to make a pure indirect 
system possible; I doubt it has the power to eliminate them.

I do not believe all linking is a rendering issue but we don't 
have to debate it any longer.  I see the shape of the thing and 
am not concerned for XML 1.0.
