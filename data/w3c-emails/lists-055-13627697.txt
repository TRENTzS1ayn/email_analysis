| 3. Note that one of the areas remaining undecided is: what do we call
| this puppy?  In the draft, it veers amusingly between being called XHL
| (Extensible Hyper Linkage) and XHA (X. Hypertext Architecture),
| depending on who wrote the section; Jon Bosak always says "XML-Link",
| but I don't know if that represents an opinion.

I would like to keep "XML" in there somewhere as a marketing ploy to
build name recognition for a suite of integrated (albeit separately
usable) standards, but that's just my opinion.

| I *think* [Jon, shout if you disagree] that this would be an area to
| which the WG could usefully turn their attention, during the very
| short time before we start to emit large numbers of votable items in
| Michael's A., B., C., style to provide a structure for the meat &
| potatoes debate.

Sure, as long as it doesn't distract from the rest of the discussion.
Perhaps people who have an opinion on this could simply state it and
try to avoid protracted interchanges.  The business of naming will be
decided by the ERB, and they will remember brief statements better
than long debates.
