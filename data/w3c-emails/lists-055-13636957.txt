XML works fine.  The issue of separation is one for the normative 
text.  I think expressing the idea that this is an integrated suite is
important to understanding the overall intent of XML and its flexibility 
for implementors.  The WG has provided a set of specifications that 
taken as a whole, describe an integrated design for applying generalized
markup to Internet hypermedia.  The separability of the components 
of the specification enable each implementation to be effective within 
the required environment.  Thus, an implementor can plan for a stable 
migration to the entire suite, choose a valid subset for a particular 
requirement, or implement the entire suite.
