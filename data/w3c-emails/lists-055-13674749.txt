I've written some moderately detailed comments below (I hope not too much)!

I think it's an excellent first draft.

I think my first comment is that I have a real problem with the
terminlogy.  I know it's very HyTimesque to talk about a link end as
being something that's not actually in a document, and also to talk
about link ends as having anchor roles.  But only anchors can have
anchor roles -- obviously :-) -- and link ends ought to be what
you find at the end of links, when you follow them.

I think (from the definition) that a locator could be called an address.

What is the difference between an explainer and an anchor role, except
that one is a name and the other can have more that one word in it?
Why isn't an explainer called a caption or a title??

7] If bi-directional isn't apt, use multi-directional.

8] an in-link link is not inherently one-directional (that term is not
defined, by the way) -- if two ends are in the same document, it is
clearly traversable in two directions.  HTML inline links are not
generally considered multi-directional, if that's what you mean, although
if you had a link database (ala HyperG) they would be.

9] out-of-line links
   SoftQuad Panorama uses ilinks in web files, and yet does not have
   what most people would think of as a link database, so I claim that
   "does not make sense" is incorrect.

  It is also incorrect to say that out-of-line links are required to support
  multidirectional traversal (although they may make it easier to manage!)

2.]
An XHL Link is too hard to say.  XLL (X Link Language) would be better,
although I still like MultiLink or PowerLink :-)  [but that is a separate
thread.  I just wanted to point out that it's hard to say]

2.1] The example needs to be
<A -XML-XHL-="ALINK" -XML-XHL-URI-="http://...../">link</A>
if you follow the no-resered-names rule.

For my own point I think the prepended hyphen is silly and adds nothing,
but it's there now.

2.2] "If the document is an XML document" -- wouldn't any other kind of
document be out of scope??

3]  It might be interesting to think about multiway in-line links at
    least a little.
    <link to="xxx" from="yyy zzz">
    You probably need tools to manage this in practice...
    We'll sell them :-)

Can you give an example showing how the HTML REL and REV functionality
(implemented in e.g. Lynx and NCSA Mosaic 3) is grandfathered in?
That would help me a lot.

I would be much happier wiith parameter entities or arch forms than some
of these element names.  I think element names starting with a hyphen
are really odd.

<!Entity % -XML-THESE-ELEMENTS-ARE-LINKS "HHREF LINK">
or something.

3. "compatibility with existing practice"
The only XML documents existing in the world were written by Jon Bosak as
examples.  There _is_ no current practice.  If you mean to make it easier
for HTML people to use it, say "for simplicity" or "for convenience"... 

Why does -XML-LINK lack REL and REV?

4.5 If the TEI patterns are not included, why are they given in the appendix?
Actually I think they are good, but only if they use either standard Posix
or Unix regexp syntax, so that C and Java libraries are readily available.

The proposed TEI addition to point to attributes sounds interesting.
Could you (Steve?) expand on it?

Thanks.

Overall this is an interesting draft.
