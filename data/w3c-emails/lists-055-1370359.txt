   I like the consistency and simplicity of these rules, but the lack of
any way to have a "verbatim" element is a fatal flaw. Pandering to typists
is not a good idea, but removing useful functionality for the sole sake of
preserving compatibility is far worse. I still have not seen any reason
that we ever _need_ to ignore a linend character in an element. Given that,
I oppose ignoring them all, just so that we can preserve SGML's bad habit
of ignoring some.

   C showed us the way almost 2 decades ago: '\n' '\r' are whitespace, and
characters _like any others_.

RE delenda est.
