"Link" is fine (the only word we all seem to have settled on :-).

"Pointer" is fine, too, though "address" might be better: Is a pointer
potentially made of a chain or relative addresses, or is an address made of
a chain of relative pointers?

"Target" tends to imply directionality, and it seems useful to have a term
for "link ends" that has no such implication.  Then you can use "source"
and "target" (or "destination") to define such terms as
"bi/multi-directionality," and to discuss link traversal behavior
intelligently.  I'm not crazy about "link ends" because it sounds weird to
talk about "source/starting/jumping-off *ends*," but everything else I can
come up with is just as weak: "link locations," "link points," "linked-to
places"...  Sigh -- maybe "target" is best.

(Not to mention the fact that HTML's <A NAME=> breaks this proper sense of
"anchor.") I agree with avoiding the scarlet letter.  Do we even need to
have a term for elements that are explicitly supposed to be link ends?  Can
we just call them "link end elements" (or whatever we settle on for
directionless targets)?
