I like Jon's terminology, agreeing with most of the comments following.
Regarding pointers and addresses, I would think the latter to be more
understandable, given:

...is an address made of a chain of relative pointers. An address seems to
me an opaque string, similar to a URL.

My knowledge of TEI is rather minimal, so I wasn't sure if he was asking
the manner, or the current usage of TEI extended pointers expressed as
URLs. I was thinking we might borrow from the Web a "#" character and try:


HREF/IDREF="http://www.foo.com/mydirectory/index.xml#ID%20(a25)%20CHILD(2%20
CHAP)"

Since there's no way around escaping the spaces, it's going to look ugly
unless we collapse all spaces something like:

    HREF/IDREF="http://www.foo.com/mydirectory/index.xml#ID(a25)CHILD(2/CHAP)"
