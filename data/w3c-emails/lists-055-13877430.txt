Gavin responds:

| We've already shown some different possible syntaxes...

| with the pointer as part of the URL itself (David
| and I had a length debate about these recently!!).

I think one and only one syntax should be chosen (preferrably by
the TEI folks rather than the SERB).  Then it should be ascertained
whether existing servers (no arguments about software that
doesn't exist, please, or at least take them to another thread
I can ignore) can deal with such URLs.  If they can't, cut
TEI pointers out of the xmllink spec because they won't work.
If they can, require TEI pointers to be expressed as URLs and cut 
TEI pointers out of the xmllink spec (except for a reference
to the separate specification of how you URLulate a TEI pointer)
because it's not necessary to talk about types of URLs.


Regards, Terry
