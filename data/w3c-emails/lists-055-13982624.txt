I'm sorry to have missed this point (4.3, number 8) first time around.
This is unacceptable, and the rationale, "... may not be appropriate
for other applications, in particular document browsing," is 
unconvincing.  How can you browse a document if you can't see it all?
How can you expect people to use a markup scheme if the results are
undefined ("yeah, sure, you can use entities, but that text may
just turn up missing")?  As this makes entities essentially useless,
why not get rid of them altogether?

And how is this compatible with SGML?  

(I will not engage in any discussion about whether an author
has the right to expect the integrity of his document to be
repected by an comformant application; if you want to take that
view, please change the subject line so I can ignore you.)
