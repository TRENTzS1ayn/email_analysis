   I like this, and agree. The hard issue that I'm worried about is the
fact that transport mechanisms sometimes mess with line encodings and thus
change the byte-sequence. This is an entity-management question, but given
the realities of email, for instance, I get nervous about assuming that \n
will not mutate into \r\n. This has been the only reason I can see for
RS/RE as defined. I never thought that ignoring initial withespace in
markup was anything but confusing... It wasn't until I had to spend a
couple of hours with the handbook that I even claimed to understand the
rules... That seems too high a price to pay for "convenient formatting",
especially when there is the angle whitespace in brackets solution:
"<p
>this is a paragraph with no initial or final whitespace</p>"
