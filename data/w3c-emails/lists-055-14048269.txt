Noting the recent inquiries on CTS about what is XML and
why should one care, such a discussion should be easy to 
start.  When Peter originally posted his announcement 
about CML and his applications, I encouraged everyone to 
look.  The use of the tree object and the windows for 
different processing of the language was excellent.
This approach is used by some VRML editors to very 
good advantage (e.g, V-Realm Builder).  Visual Basic 4
includes a tree object (outline object) with Add Item 
methods that should work well.

So, yes, moving this XML As Applied thread to CTS 
would be most beneficial IMO.
