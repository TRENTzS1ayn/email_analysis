Comments are supposed to be text that's meant for the eyes of source-file
readers, and not legitimate document content that's temporarily not
supposed to be output.  "Commenting out" text in various markup languages
is sometimes achieved by "comments" (especially where that's your only
choice) and sometimes by "ignore regions."  For example, in troff, you can
use .\" or .ig, but as in SGML, .ig is much more appropriate for both
practical and, uh, philosophical reasons.

So I'd argue the other way around: Comments are not IGNORE marked sections,
and using them to ignore blocks of document content constitutes markup
abuse.  So there. :-)
