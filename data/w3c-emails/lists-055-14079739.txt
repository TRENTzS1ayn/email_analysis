To the eyes of non-SGML software types, SGML comments are kinda weird cos they
are constructs of the core language. In many programming languages they
are stripped out by the initial lexical analysis phase.

The upside of stripping them out during simple minded lexical analysis
is the shear simplicity of it. The *downside* is that language processors that
Read/Write the language loose the ability to re-create the comments on the
other side.

This raises the question - what are the constraints on XML aware applications
when it comes to parsing->processing->writing XML. Is there something along
the lines of a (much simplified) DSSSL Null Transformation???

A related question, in SGML two docs are considered equal if they produce
the same ESIS stream. Will there be a similar concept in XML? Kinda
useful in checking that an XML application interprets the document
structure as intended...
