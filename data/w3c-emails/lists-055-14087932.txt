[Hehe] Terry asks:

   I'm sure the SERB had good reasons for the new comment syntax,
   but it certainly isn't simple and some of us will have to explain
   it to skeptics.  Could we have a very short statement of what
   was wrong with SGML comment syntax that the XML comment syntax
   fixes, and why the XML solution was chosen?

It wasn't symmetric and I got the feeling that to sell XML to the
programming community (who have to write the s/w), comments have
to look like /* God intended them */
