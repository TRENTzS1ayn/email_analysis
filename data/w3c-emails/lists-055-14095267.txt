   | What I said, Documentation, documentation, documentation.

   Yes, we're all for it.  Anyone want to put together an XML FAQ for
   starters?

I suppose I asked for that :-)  And I'm knee deep in writing a book,
but what the hell, it'll fill in the hours between 4am and 7am...

Suggestions for FAQs to me with a subject line: XML FAQ

Now, what DTD shall we use for the FAQ...?
