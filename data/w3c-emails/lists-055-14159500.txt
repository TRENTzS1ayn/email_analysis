It doesn't say so, so I assume not. Nor does ENTITIES seem that it would be
useful in this case.

I think so, but the language should be changed.

We have also considered allowing references based on any attribute value --
this would be nice, but would need to be defined first.

I don't think that this matters, actually. If the system identifier
identifies an XML document, then it presumably can't contain a '#', or it
contains a # with some fancy XML-linking query semantics, so that the IDREF
is applied relative to the result of following the pointer. Leading entity
name seems to mean that the entity name is first in a string like:

"Foo#id"

With the entity declaration
<!entity Foo SYSTEM "http://www.bar.com/bletch.xml">

Did I get the example right?
