I think I'll take a chance in speaking "for the TEI" in saying that the TEI
does not try to specify such processing details. Michael can correct me if
I'm wrong.

Well, we have to talk about XML clients (and they don't exist), or else
there is nothing to say.

We are specifying semantics for applications, not servers (The upshot of
the long discussion, I thought), so that TEI locators can work by
definition. The effective algorithm for implementing them on a client is
easy, even if it may be inefficient for large, prooly designed XML
documents.

If we use fragment specifiers, we can define them to do whatever we want,
and it's not a new URL scheme, but part of the XML media type, if I
understand the prior discussion. I think that we want to, and that we can,
come up with a solution that works without placing requirements on anything
other than the XML application.
