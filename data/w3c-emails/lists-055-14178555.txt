And it should be defined for each of the closed list of addressing modes
that XML supports. I think we need to decide hwo things are going to work,
so that we are guaranteed that and XML link in an XML linking document can
at least be parsed, and its pointers resolved, by any XML linking
application. If people need to extend XML-LINK they can make an extension
and use a new architecture (and steal whatever they need from ours, if they
want to).

I think it should be crystal clear what is and is not XML-LINK, and that
extensions should be clearly OUTSIDE the spec.

I think it's supposed to refer to the previous element in the location
chain (if the processor happens to implement indirect location pointers)

If we need locsrc at all, then it's worth having this. But I think we can
probably do without locsrc.

This should be cleared up by making explicit exactly what addressing
schemes are supported, and how base addresses or whatever work with each.
We should not have to worry about random new address scheme unless and
until they are integrated into XML-LINK.

They should simply not be allowed in documents that claim to conform.
Otherwise we have blown the no-options requirement out of the water by
adding an infinite number of undeclared options for addressing mechanisms.

   I think we need 3 basic types:
   + URLs, as currently used.

   + Structural addressing, i.e. some method of navigating within an XML
document that has a single URL.

   + A way to use SGML entities and IDs for linking (perhaps mostly for
compatibility with the SGML world, perhaps because the options it offers
for management via entities are usful in their own right).

If people need something else, they should use something other than XML
linking to meet their needs.
