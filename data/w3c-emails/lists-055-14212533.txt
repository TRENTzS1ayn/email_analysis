(Quoting me):
| My personal vote goes to this syncretic list from other people's
| suggestions:
| 
| link: bag of pointy bits.
| pointer: a pointy bit with a suit on (so it looks more formal)
| referent: Something you get to via a pointy bit

Even though "referents" sounds exactly like "reference"?

Jon
a very good point. I was thinking that pointer referent is clear, but
the plural is confusing. Maybe target is better after all. Link-end
works for me, but I don't think of ropes, since links are now part of
my primary ontology.

    Just so long as it's not anchor!
