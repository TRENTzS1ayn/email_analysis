I think it's not as bad as you fear.  Few successful clients will
be insane.  HTML makes display of the entire _document_ optional... :-)

The idea behind the decision was to allow lazy evaluation -- e.g. a
browser could show an "entity" box until you double click on it.
But this was done before we discussed hyperlinks at all.  If you have
links that support optional transclusion, you don't need this feature.

I think this is fine.  Note that for an undefined entitiy (the original
example) you don't actually know whether it's external or not.  This
wording hence can only (I think) apply to defined but unreachable entities
where a DTD was given.
