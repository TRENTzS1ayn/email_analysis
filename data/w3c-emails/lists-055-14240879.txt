For a reference/referent/target/comefrom/landing zone,
I still prefer "active region" or a "zone".

A link end can be a target, but it can also be where the
archer places his feet, both the golf tee and the hole, sometimes
both at once.

For an annotation, for example, it's not really a target,
but just a region of interest.
