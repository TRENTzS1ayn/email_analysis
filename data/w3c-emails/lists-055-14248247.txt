Quoth Gavin:

But I think there is a flaw, as this will not match
<!--**-*-->
as it's interpreted as folows:

>    "<!--*"([^*]|("*"[^-])|("*-"[^-])|("*--"[^>]))*"*-->" 
      A      B     C         D         E              F

This isn't actually a good thing to try to do with a regular expression.

For what it's worth, I tested this with perl (OK, so I'm dirty, but I'm
barefooted too, so that's OK):

perl -n -e 'if (/<!--\*([^*]|(\*[^-])|(\*-[^-])|(\*--[^>]))*\*-->/) { print; }'
