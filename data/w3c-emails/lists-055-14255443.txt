No.  Using *-- as COMC would require SGML comments to look like
<!*-- stuff *-->

Existing SGML systems will use -- to delimit comments, and it is pure
happenstance (to them) that all XML comments start and end with an asterisk.

In fact, banning -- within comments until the TC passes is sufficient,
since *-- contains --.  After the TC passes (I hope!), it is only necessary
to state that comments don't nest, so tht --* cannot appear within a comment,
since an SGML system can then handle the new syntax.
