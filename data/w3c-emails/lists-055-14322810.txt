No - it's not well-formed.

> <HTML>
> <HEAD>
> <TITLE>Hello World</TITLE>
> .
> .
> <P>Your IP address is <SERVER>write(request.ip)</SERVER>
> <SERVER>write("<p>Last time your were " + client.oldname + ".")</SERVER>

Assuming <head> and <html> were closed properly, there is a <p> opened
within <server> that was not closed.  I think that what is desired is:

<server><![CDATA[write("<p>...")]]></server>
