No quarrel with the reply, yet this will be the sort of example that 
will raise hell at the XML conference.  It is existing practice 
supported with some expensive code and product marketing.

We need to ferret out these jewels.  Otherwise, the comment 
"anything you can do with XML can be done better with 
server side HTML" will be heard often.  It might be pointed 
out that where data is *lively*, this approach works 
for small bits of data.  When the data is writBig, and 
spread all over the place, this ancient rewrite script technique, 
gets very hard to maintain and expensive.  We built precisely 
this for CASS using the Context scripting language.
It still works but no one can maintain it any longer.

While this is legal, if it breaks the common 
server-side scripting paradigm, we have to be ready to explain why 
a lot of people should be rethinking their practice 
and their acceptance of a WWW norm.

Chris's <![[CDATA looked right to me.  Just looks ugly to 
the programming community.
