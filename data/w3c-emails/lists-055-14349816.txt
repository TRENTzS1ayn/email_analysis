Len asked about a document...

> <HTML>

No, it needs to begin with the XML processing instruction.

> <HEAD>
> <TITLE>Hello World</TITLE>
> .
> .
> <P>Your IP address is <SERVER>write(request.ip)</SERVER>
> <SERVER>write("<p>Last time your were " + client.oldname + ".")</SERVER>

There are two <P> elements here that are not closed.  This is not well formed.
It is not valid SGML either, unless SERVER has a CDATA content model or
unless < is no longer MDO :-)

In general, HTML files will need to be filtered to become XML files.
The transformation is simple, and has been discussed at length on this list.
