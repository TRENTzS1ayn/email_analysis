Yep.  Now, what is the short sweet clear language that tells 
the executive why he must require his programmers or IS specialists 
to switch to this when what they have looks a lot like this 
and is working?  What do we say when he says, "But my browser 
vendor says this is 'stupid', slows down the system, and they 
will never support it"?  How do we convince him that it is 
worth the extra money and considerable risk to move off of 
working platforms onto other platforms just to get closed 
tags, obscure syntax, and fatter files?

Not kidding. That example above goes to the heart of what XML does and 
can bring to the party, and the mood of the host.
