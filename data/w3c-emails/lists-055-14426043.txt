Len, XML is not a replacement for HTML.  It is a way of using SGML over
the Internet (see the Activity page).

We already know that existing HTML doesn't work as XML.  That decision
was made on day one.  It's no use telling me to present this in detail
in San Diego (why San Diego??).

Syntactic HTML compatibility is not consistent with the other requirements.

Incidentally, your example wasn't legal HTML either.  It works because
the server doesn't actually ship it, so it is a totally unfair question,
as you well know.  You might as well say that the perl
print "<P>";
is not legal XML.  It's not legal FORTRAN either.

I think this doesn't belong on this list -- do we need an alt.lang.xml?
