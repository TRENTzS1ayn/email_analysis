I think we don't have to. See below.

You are certainly right about the mood, but there is also a lot of
frustration with fixed tag sets, and there is fortunately alternative markup
that is nicer and easier to explain:

 <P>Your IP address is <SERVER>write(request.ip)</SERVER>
 <SERVER>write("&lt;p>Last time your were " + client.oldname + ".")</SERVER>

Sorry I missed the syntax error the first time I read it... I agree that
this is a bit inconvenient, but I think people will be willing to put up
with this to avoid entrapment in the straightjacket of HTML.

All you need to say is that < is a delimiter and needs escaping whenever it
does not start a tag.

I don't know why (or if) Eliot prefers CDATA.
