Read the announcement for the conference.  "..HTML doesn't do enough..."
Can the routine.  This IS a competitor to HTML.  Weazel word the spec 
and the pages and the speeches and the glad handling any way you 
like: it is a competitor to HTML.  Replace it?  Not a chance.  Not now.

If GCA is going to have a conference about a spec which is *really a set
of recommendations* before 
the damm thing is two thirds drafted, invite the executives and their 
staffs, generate publicity, then maybe some advance preparation about 
potential questions is in order.

Never said it was.

It is an example from the LiveWire Developers Kit.  It is an example 
of the technology of a major member of the consortium.  It is an 
example of how folks do right now what many want to do with XML.
It wasn't meant to be a fair question?  It is an honest one and 
it elicited the honest response:  fatten the file with more 
markup and syntactic stuff needed to isolate the inline scripting, 
and hey, it's XML.  It points out exactly what we will have to
explain to people who haven't a frigging clue what <![CDATA[ 
is or why they should care.

Fine.  I'll take these questions to CTS.
