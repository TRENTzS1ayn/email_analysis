That's good. It is also exactly what I was told when 
I first showed the HTML\WWW design to HyTime folks.

Ok. Two solutions.

They aren't frustrated.  They are extending them as fast as they 
can based on the technology they have established and the 
market base they have.

It will be fun to watch someone explain to an executive with a masters
in 
business and a company to run what "escaping a delimiter means".  He 
needs a reason before he bets the farm on a technology harder to use 
and more expensive than the one we ask him to "escape".

It was the first thing that occurred to me too.

Anyway, if this is to be carried to CTS, time to do it.
I was hoping to post a few counter examples here first for 
comment before setting off too many firestorms over there.
On the other hand, maybe it is better to light a fire 
where light is wanted.
