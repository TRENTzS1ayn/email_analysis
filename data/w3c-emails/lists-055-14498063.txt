Quite.  There is no rule engraved in stone that every aspect and restriction
of the language must be captured in the productions.  That which can without
terrible complication should (8879 probably erred the other way) but there
is no point in evolving more and more complicated productions except as an
academic exercise.  I too vote to kill this track.
