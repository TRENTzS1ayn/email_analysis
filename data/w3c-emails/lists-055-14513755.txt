May I point out that one of the problems I've commonly seen in HTML is that
people have a tough time understanding that HTML anchors may contain both a
NAME and an HREF, so they may be both a referent/link and a
reference/target. Assuming that XML links will be at least as functional,
calling one end of a pointy thing a target may be a limiting statement, or
require some kind of qualifier.
