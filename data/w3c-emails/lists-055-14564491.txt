Note: On this item, the ERB is leaning towards using the terms link, with the 
obvious meeting, pointer for the pointy bits that point at things, and for
the 
third term, what the current spec calls anchor, the ERB is contemplating 
link end, end, and terminus.

For the time being, and in order that Jon can read this without getting 
headaches, the spec has been adjusted to use link, pointer, and terminus.

1.4.a What do we call the container used to hold the bits that
 point at other things?  (in current discussion: link)
1.4.b What do we call the bits that point at other things? (in current
 discussion: pointer)
1.4.c What do we call the things that are pointed at? (in current 
 discussion: terminus)
