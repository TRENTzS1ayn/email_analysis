I need to review MGML, but I think this would be great, as I too feel the
desire for a meta-DTD everytime a write one. Unfortunately the one time I
tried to do one, I did a project-specific one, and so I still don't have
the general tool that I need. I agree with Eliot that we might get some
things wrong, but the risk of getting something disastrously wrong with
this group is slight, I think. And the goal of easy implementability should
steer us away from a lot of tempting problems, I think.

Sentiment seems to lean to allowing them in DTDs. DTD subsets are an open
problem. These could also be handled by the conditional inclusion mechanism
for instances, if we align the two syntaxes...

I wouldn't die for this, but I would love it. The contextual rules are just
too hard to remember on the fly. And, as James has noted they are another
little convenience that the parser has to care about. I'd rather we end up
with a language where we could have a real split between lexical analyzer
and parser, and eliminating d.i.c. seems to aid that.

This breaks for strings like the following:
 \&entity;\
  Actually I favor the proposal, but we shouldn't expect magic for existing
SGML instances if we accept it.

Yes. I'm inclined even to remove system IDs altogether (even formal ones)
and leave them only in CATALOGs.

Sure. I can see no rational justification for multiple comments in a single
comment declaration anyway. I'd rather be stronger and allow '--' in
comments except when followed by '>'. Otherwise the single comment nature
of the markup will make the no '--' rule even harder to justify...
