> Should links be expressed as SGML elements?

As opposed to natural language recognition (see that web site with all
the pictures of cream pies)?  Yes.  As opposed to other forms of
SGML markup?  The markup most suitable should be used.

One doesn't say,
shall I drive a car or a tractor?
but rather,
which vehicle is most suitable to plough my field?
