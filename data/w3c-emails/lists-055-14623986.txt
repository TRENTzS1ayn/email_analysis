Just a friendly reminder:

In the discussion of link draft items, please use the header provided
in the post that sets forth each item to be discussed.  If you need to
break down an item into smaller pieces, give them separate subject
headings that indicate precisely what they are.  If you introduce a
new subject, start up a new subject heading.  Only in this way will
the editors be able to manage the discussion.

Also, you will substantially decrease the level of irritation among
many members of the WG if you will take a few seconds to make sure
that your reply is not redundantly copied to individuals but is posted
only to the list server.

Thank you, and we hope that your flight is an enjoyable one.

Jon
