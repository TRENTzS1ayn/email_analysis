I have revised the initial XML-Link draft at
 
 http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/link.html

It now uses pointer where it used to use link-end, and terminus where it
used to use anchor.  Had to change a few things in consequence, an
Anchor Link is now a Terminus Link (TLINK), and the END element became
POINTER.

Jon should now be able to read it pain-free.
