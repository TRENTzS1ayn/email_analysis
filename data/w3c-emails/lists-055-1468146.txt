Yes, that is true, but on a practical note, I cannot see that we are
heading for wide acceptance if we rule it out. I was not the first on this
list to raise the issue of vebatim-style elements. This is not going to
help us make our case to the currently unconvinced. We are taking a common,
reasonable, well-established usage, and making it impossible, solely for
compatibility with a feature of SGML that isn't popular, easy to explain,
or widely understood.
