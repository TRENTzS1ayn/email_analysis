The ERB decided not long after the November XML rollout that it was
time to register the text/xml MIME type.  Since then, I've been
gloomily contemplating the small pile of information I've accumulated
on the process for registering a new media type with IANA and coming
to terms with the realization that there's no way that I'm going to
get to this any time soon.  So I'm asking for volunteers.

Here's your chance to cover yourself with glory and become one of
those heroes who have their names cited in perpetuity in connection
with an IETF RFC.  If you are interested, please send me email.  I
will keep this open until the ERB meeting next Wednesday morning; if
we get more than one volunteer, the ERB will choose from among them
and possibly form an editorial team for this purpose.

Jon
