Not true, if I understand your point.  The reference concrete syntax does
not specify the digits as name start characters, but XML is not using the
reference concrete syntax and few useful SGML tools do not allow variant
syntaxes (and therefore will allow you to redefine the name start
characters) [The only one I can think of off hand in Panorama, which
doesn't read SGML declarations at all and simply provides a longer name
length automatically.].

Thus, adding digits (or anything else within reason) would not make XML
documents incompatible with SGML systems in general, although it might with
particular tools (for example, adding "_" to name start could thoroughly
confuse ADEPT*Editor, which uses "_" as a "reserved tag prefix"--not a good
implementation choice in retrospect). 

Cheers,

Eliot
