Well, unless I was doing it incorrectly (which is certainly possible), I 
couldn't get nsgmls to accept digits as namestart characters. I changed
both LCNMSTRT and UCNMSTRT to "0123456789" in the DCL and it produced 

    nsgmls:html32.dcl:48:15:E: digits assigned to LCNMCHAR, UCNMCHAR,
        LCNMSTRT or UCNMSTRT: 48-57

If this is an error I'm making, a correction would be welcome. If I'm not,
and nsgmls is operating in conformance, and my last perusal of the SGML
Handbook was not in error, I believe this may be not only a requirement of
the RCS, but of 8879 in general. Again, I bow to those with greater experience
in these matters.

But I do think you understood my point, which was that XML is slated as
"SGML on the Web" (although I see now that some would prefer to ignore that
aspect) and that 'conformance with SGML' (XML-Lang sec.1.1) was not simply
a matter of raw conformance with 8879:1986, but with the intent that
existing tools would be able to process XML documents with little or no
modification, ie., that XML was a 'subset' of SGML, not a 'variant' (to use
DocBook's terminology).

It still seems a mistake to deliberately break conformance with existing,
conformant SGML applications when it is so simple to add or strip an alpha
prefix in an ID. How far XML strays from conformance will affect the extent
to which existing tools must be modified, and how modifications to those
tools may break conformance with existing document sets.
