See sections 9.2.1 and 9.3 of 8879 (pages 344-346 of the SGML
Handbook) and section 13.4.5 (page 464 of the Handbook).

Section 9.2.1 defines what can be a name start character, which is
upper and lowercase letters and the uppercase and lowercase name start
characters.  Section 13.4.5 states that a Digit cannot be an uppercase
or lowercase name start character.
