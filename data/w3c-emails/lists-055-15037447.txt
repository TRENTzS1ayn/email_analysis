Tony,

This was my take from the Handbook as well, but I'm assuming when someone
like Eliot replies, that there must be *some* way around it; I just couldn't
find one. Eduardo and I talked about this, and it seems pretty hard-wired
into 8879, even if a lot of people don't like it. The idea of not being
able to have what is essentially a numeric type (ID) not be able to contain
a completely numeric value seems somewhat strange. Like my Sun ID# is all
numbers, my SSN# is all numbers and dashes, etc.
