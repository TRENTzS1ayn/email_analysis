It is important to remember 

a) SGML was about encoding *documents*. Thanks to its success we now 
have a broader idea abuot what a document is than we did when it was being
designed. IDs in documents tend to based on textual names of things, not
numbers.

b) SGML's ID rules are quite flexible compared to most programming languages.
(Michael Sperburg-McQueen pointed this out to me).

The rule might be annoying now, but it is not "strange" if you look at it 
with a sense of history. It isn't too hard to work around even now.
