My guess is that: 1) digits cannot be name start characters
so that numeric character references (&#123;) can be 
distinguished from named character references (&#ABC;); and
2) element names (id values) are NAMEs because every other
kind of name is a NAME (element type names, entity names,
document type names, attribute names, etc.).
