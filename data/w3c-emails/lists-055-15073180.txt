They shouldn't but if they do, then the lack of a normative
reference makes sense.  It means XML is not SGML and will continue 
to diverge in all probability.  That is bad news.  Some of us 
now have to go to customers that were paying attention to 
XML and say, "no, another hustle without a business case". 
Hopefully what has been learned here can now be applied to 
SGML and HyTime to get an ISO version that will be conformant, 
testable, stable, etc.

That is the right process for sure.  

The ID can't be a number dilemma has been a nuisance.  I'm 
not sure why it is there, but it adds a step to document conversions
I've done because instead of using the paragraph number which 
is probably there, I have to add in an alpha.  
But it is just a nuisance, not a showstopper.
