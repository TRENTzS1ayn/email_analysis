Reason 1 sounds a lot like the reason given in beginning programming
courses for why names cannot begin with digits in programming
languages like C and Pascal.  I think the reason as given is
persuasive; the parallel to similar rules in other formal languages
is also persuasive (and may historically have been a factor).

As for the rest, I'm with Rich Jelliffe:  this is something for the
SGML revision (sgml++) not XML (sgml--).  Lobby your WG8 members if
this is something you want.
