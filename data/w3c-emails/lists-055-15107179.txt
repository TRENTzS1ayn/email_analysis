I forwarded the revised SGML declaration to a mailing list, which 
is for XML discussion in the Japanese language.  Ishikawa-san and 
Nicol-san made comments on the declaration.  We believe that 
the declaration should reference to UCS-4 rather than UCS-2.

The current proposal says:

>     CHARSET
>         BASESET 
>             "ISO Registration Number 176//CHARSET
>             ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 UCS-2 with implementation 
>             level 3//ESC 2/5 2/15 4/5"

Ishikawa-san pointed out that the latest version of Cougar (which 
is not publicly disclosed yet) adopts UCS-4 as below:

>
>   CHARSET
>            BASESET  "ISO Registration Number 177//CHARSET
>                      ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 UCS-4 with
>                      implementation level 3//ESC 2/5 2/15 4/6"

Ishikawa-san spoke with Francois Yergeau, Bert Bos, Vincent Quint
and made sure that Cougar will use UCS-4.  Ishikawa-san argues that 
Cougar and XML should be able to handle the same set of characters.

Nicol-san also pointed out that character references will become 
complicated if we adopt UCS-2.
