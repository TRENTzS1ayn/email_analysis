This is the same situtation as with HTML and SGML, right? In neither of
those would the parser collapse spaces. In either of those, spaces in a
verbatim element (like <PRE>) are retained.

Just as in HTML or SGML, the author will have to know their application to
know if "prettying up" is allowed in a particular element or not.
