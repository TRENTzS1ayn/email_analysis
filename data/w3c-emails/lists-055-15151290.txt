   It seems odd to me that we are going to add complexity to help
   people who need to publish databases but remove complexity required
   by people who need to publish large, complex documents adhering to
   large, complex DTDs. Aren't large, complex documents with large,
   complex DTDs the reason we are *here*? 

No, that's what "full" SGML is for. The ethos of XML is simplicity,
isn't it? Much as I love Parameter Entities, they're just another
complexity to explain to the implementors.
