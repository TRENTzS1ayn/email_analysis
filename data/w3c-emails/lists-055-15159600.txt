I don't believe the simplicity of XML is inconsistent with
large, complex documents. But I don't expect that those
large, complex documents will fit into the web context without
at least a little bit of engineering effort.

Information providers who want to preserve their investment in SGML
should expect to do a little bit of work to interoperate
with the explosion of dead-simple XML tools and clients
that I expect to see.

It's not like large complex documents are a square peg and
XML is a round hole, but the folks with those large documents
should be prepared to shave off the corners a bit.
