i've no gripe with the PEs being there.  that is for the
implementors to wrestle with.  my stance still is that for 
the first round we encourage simple dtd designs.  i know 
that for those who have complex dtds that is a stone 
cold hassle, but why don't we give it a trial and see 
how people react.  again, in or out, i am sanguine, but 
a simpler first round seems prudent.  so i have to 
agree with dan on this.

after a long time of watching dtds, with reasonable 
certainty we can expect them to complexify.
