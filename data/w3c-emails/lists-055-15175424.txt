No. The ethos of *HTML* is simplicity. The ethos of XML is simplicity
married to expressive power, otherwise why bother? HTML is already
simple. If it isn't simple enough we could roll it back to HTML 2.0.

mechanism for managing repitition in the schema is the hole then jamming
one into the other sounds more like chopping than "shaving."
