Expressive power in any syntax/semantic melange comes in a variety
of forms. Expressive power can be increased by adding
extra *syntactic* constructs. This has been the SGML way. New concept ->
new syntactic construct -> new parser. On the other hand,
expressive power can be increased by allowing *existing* syntactic/semantic
constructs to be combined. This, as I understand it, is more like the XML
way.

In programming languages the spectrum has something like Scheme on
one end and Ada on the other. Scheme has remarkably few syntactic constructs
and yet packs a hell of a powerful punch.

Less is more == Scheme == XML == Parser in a week == lightweigth == web friendly

This was trashed out at length some weeks ago and I argued against PE's
as they are a subtle blend of syntax and semantics. As I understand the
decision they are now purely syntactic constructs for WF. Sounds good
to me.
