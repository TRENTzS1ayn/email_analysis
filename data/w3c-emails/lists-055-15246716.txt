This is an exception - I would not take it

Thats it. An application receives all PIs.

This depends on the processing model of the application.
It should not be part of XML-LANG.

It is also an implementation detail. But XML-LANG says
that there is a PI target. So Pis can be passed to an 
application as "pi-Nodes" having a Generic Identifier 
(which is thie PI target) and "#pcdata" which is the "char*"
in production 18.


>4. Are the PI targets (names) case-sensitive?

Case sensitivity was discussed recently in the context of IDs.
As far as I remember IDs are case sensitive. XML-LANG says nothing
about Names being not case sensitive. So I think PI targets 
should be case sensitive also. .
