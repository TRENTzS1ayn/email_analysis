Why can the doctype itself not be considered a module?

True but it goes a long way toward first pass 
implementation simplicity and as stated, "training wheels" 
DTDs.  I don't find PEs hard; just rugs for hiding 
domain messiness.

However, I like Dan Connolly's suggestion about functionality  
beyond "pastie thingies" and think that should be 
considered before a final decision about PEs is made.  
This may be a very golden opportunity.
