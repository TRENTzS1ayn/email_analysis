The reductivist in me says altogether, but I shrink at the prospect of
writing a DTD completely without them.  I guess I don't know at this
point.

It's been my experience that PEs are a lot more useful on the "right
hand side" of a declaration than on the "left hand side" (sorry to
mangle the terminology -- you know what I mean).  In fact, I consider
the latter somewhat obfuscatory.  Does this make any difference to
ease of implementation?
