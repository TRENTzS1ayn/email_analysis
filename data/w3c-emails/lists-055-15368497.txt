Yes.  Without doubt.

Yes. Most of them good, I think.  Most of them premature perhaps.

Yes, but that's the editor's problem. :-)  I'm the one

I can't say much about the virtue of it.  I can say that when a tool 
can't do the job, others succeed it.  We have to be sure what 
we need to do with a tool before we make it, or we have to take 
a tool we've made and modify it to do what we need.

Then document it in those terms.  Make it clear that any 
typing implied by PEs is understood to be outside the 
current spec.
