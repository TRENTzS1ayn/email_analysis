Hi there.  I got this address from Keith Corbett at Harlequin.  I hope
I'm not intruding.

I've been looking at the XML spec in considerable detail.  I have a
few comments/complaints/questions.  Where would be a good place to
send them?  Keith suggested this list, but I thought I'd ask first before
dumping a bunch of stuff in and then finding I was abusing the forum.

At this point, I would say I about 5-10 issues, each of which can be
described in text about the size of this message.  I may not want to
send them all at once, but rather to dribble them in one at a time over
a small number of weeks.

FWIW, I had a list of things I hated about SGML when I once tried to
write a parser for it.  XML seems to have addressed nearly all of the
things that were on my hate list for SGML, and for that someone deserves
congratulations already.  ... But there are these few lingering details. :-)

Thanks for your time.
