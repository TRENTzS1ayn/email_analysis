It's b.a.d. (Broken As Designed), occassioned by an initial specification
failure to locate the FRAMESET element in HEAD. 

The MSIE interpretation (NOFRAMES content is renderable only in a "No
Frames" display context for the document) at least finds some use for
what started as a fifth wheel. Usage according to the MSIE semantics
"breaks" Netscape.

(The historical absence, BTW, is actually restricted to the Mosaic-oid
implementations. Ever since the FIG element in the HTML+ Discussion
document there has been *some* notion of conditional inclusion based on
principal and alternative semantics for an element, only some browsers
never got a Round Tuit.)
