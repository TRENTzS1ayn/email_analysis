| This list is bloody near impossible to read and in danger of buckling
| under its own weight, and unless some of the people learn the basic
| net skill of replying to the group, not just hitting "reply to all",
| so I don't get two #!$^@ copies of everything in a thread I may have
| originated 3 months ago, I will ask the chair simply to remove them.

You know, I'm so sick of this behavior and of people's arrogant
disregard of all the polite requests we've made to change it that I'm
ready to agree to this.

We can't reliably change the list machinery, and if we could, the only
alternative would be to have messages go by default to the list.  This
sounds like a big improvement right up to the point where you
accidentally mail something to the list that you intended to be
private, and then you see that it's really by far the worse of the two
alternatives.

I takes me, using a completely primitive vt100 mail tool, less than
ten seconds to change the To: line so that my replies go to the list
and to put the name of the person I'm quoting at the beginning of my
reply.  If you're not willing to put this much effort into your
postings then either they are not worth sending or you are not worth
having on the list.

We do in fact have a process in place for removing people from this
list.  I agree with Tim that it's time to start using it in the case
of people who deliberately conduct themselves in a way that creates
unnecessary work for the rest of us.

Jon
