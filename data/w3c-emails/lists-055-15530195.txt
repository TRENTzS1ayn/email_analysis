Specification?

I understood NOFRAMES to be what is displayed by browsers that do not display
frames or choose not to do so right now. As long as the browsers share 
semantics it works fine. You point out that they don't always. But isn't that
the job of XML-Style? Conditional display seems as easy as 

(element FRAMESET (empty-sosofo))

to me.
