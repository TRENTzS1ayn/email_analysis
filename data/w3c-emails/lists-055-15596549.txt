Yup. Sometimes clumsiness in syntax can be a correct disincentive:-)

Moreover, conditional inclusion shouldn't be confused with dynamic scoping
or control of "content" (the difference between #ifdef and if (...).) For
markup, we're basically talking about an equivalent of querying, whether
this be preprocessing by the server or postprocessing by the client.

Finally, the basic problem with using MSs to kludge this is that SGML's
default of INCLUDE for status specification is in the way (otherwise the
common {something=>true,nothing=>false} type of fail-soft behavior could
be built in.) Nevertheless, I'll throw yet another syntax suggestion into
the pot:

  <![ %cond1; [ ...
  ]][ %cond2; [ ...
  ...
  ]]>

(i.e. MSC-DSO closes a MS and opens another one. Wouldn't quite work on
the older systems though.)
