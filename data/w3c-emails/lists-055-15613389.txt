| Some of us are extraordinarily busy. I get over 200 email messages a
| *day*,

If you're looking for sympathy, you came to the wrong place.  I get
that many messages, too.  A lot of us do.  We manage to maintain a
certain level of consideration for other people anyway.

| so I can guarantee that at times I will not edit headers.

The key question is whether you occasionally forget or whether you
have a deliberate policy of creating duplicate copies of your
messages.  The former is understandable; the latter is a conscious
decision to trade off a few seconds of care on your part for a
considerable amount of overhead on the part of those of us who have to
maintain mail archives.

| If you believe that I have nothing worth contributing to the group,
| remove me now.

Our process doesn't work that way.  Section 2.1 says:

   Members of the SGML WG serve for the life of the WG unless they
   withdraw from participation, are withdrawn by the W3C member
   organization that appointed them, or are removed by an absolute
   two-thirds majority vote of the SGML ERB.

You have to be enough of a pain in the butt to justify our taking the
time to go through this.  What Tim's posting made me realize is that
some people are being inconsiderate enough that I might actually
entertain such a proposal if he were to make it.
