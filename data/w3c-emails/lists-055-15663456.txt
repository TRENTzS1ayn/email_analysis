How many copies of Marion Elledge's GCA announcement did 
you receive?  So far, delete has been sufficient.  I'd 
say most of us get around 200 messages a day.  So much for 
seeing The Lost World.

Or, as Murray says, to give the sender the advance of a few hours 
to reply.  Still,  if one is still on the CC list or the 
main mail to after three months and no replies, that is probably a 
little lazy.  I usually remove everyone but the list and the 
sender.

And some folks could decide to pound you half to death in a 
parking lot one afternoon, and so it goes.  ERBness stops at 
the voting booth.

I am a PIA, but not a violent one.  Threats are bad for our mental 
health and in a world where people torture children to death, 
blow up buildings in the name of The American Way, set fire 
to grandma's apartment, torture a man with a steak knife 
for his ATM number and $800, and on and on through the 
daily litany of human pain, deleting emails doesn't seem 
to be worth this.

On the other hand, I for one will be more conscientious.
We have things to do.  This isn't one of them.
