Umm... no functionality is lost without them.  Some ease of 
maintenance goes away.

But since the majority appears to want them, and they aren't 
hard to implement we are told, I've no objection to them 
being there.  I prefer fewer features because I think the 
odds of a first season hit are better without the big show 
number in the first act.
