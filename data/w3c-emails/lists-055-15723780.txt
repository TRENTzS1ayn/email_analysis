It seems to me that people's needs vary not just from application to
application, but also within an application. For instance the logical
replacement for <FRAMESET> is (IIRC) <BODY>. But the logical replacement
for <FIG> would be some other block element. This takes us back to the
venerable concepts of DTD and validation. Even if XML-LANG *provided*
"generic" conditional inclusion facilities, I would advocate against
using them. Is there someone out there willing to stand up for them?
