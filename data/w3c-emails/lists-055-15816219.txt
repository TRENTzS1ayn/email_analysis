On XML-DEV we have run into a problem as to when a document should be validated,
particularly if it contains a (possibly partial) internal subset.  Rather than
reproduce or crosspost the concerns here, it may be useful for WG/WRB members
to read the recent discussions on

http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev

IMO this is an issue which the ERB should consider.
