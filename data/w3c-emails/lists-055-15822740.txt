This is a *partial* crossposting of material from XML-DEV which seems 
sufficiently important that I am bringing it to the attention of the WG.

[... Discussion deleted, but available on 
http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev> ]

Discussion centres on whether a 'parser' reading a 'document' with a (possibly
partial) DTD can/must/may validate it, and what happens if it cannot.  As an
example, does the string:

<!DOCTYPE FOO SYSTEM "foo.dtd">

imply or require any action.

Does the string
<!DOCTYPE FOO [
<!ATTLIST FOO CDATA BAR "BAZ">
]>

imply or require any action.  Is it markup? May/must it be passed to the 
application?

[...PeterMR proposed ...]

> All parsers (i.e. tools that take XML documents and apply the criteria in 
> XML-LANG only) should state their attitude and behaviour to WFness and validity.

> The possible options include at least:
> - nsgmls-like.  Full validation is the only option.  Any non-valid

> - Lark-like (at least V0.88 - I think there is another coming).  No

> - NXP-like.  Validation can be switched on or off by the 'client'.

There have been several replies and I believe that the discussion is one on 
which the ERB/WG may wish to take a view.  If that view is "Silence!", I shall
obey :-)
