I just want to note that this is a textbook instance of begging the question:
The definition of "true content" presupposes that RE after markup should
not be significant (the core of the confusion around the SGML RE rules).
With that defintion in hand we can quickly come to the conclusion that
SGML's RE/RS rules are necessary to return the true content.

Why should initial whitespace be hidden fromthe application in XML. We all
agree that we can put the CR _within_ a tag, so where's the problem?

 And if we are willing to forgo that one convenience, we can even be
compatible with 8879, since it is the entity manager that decides whether
RE exists and goes to the parser.

   I know that changing YASP to process this correctly would take about 10
minutes. I'd be surprised if it took longer for SP. This is an
incompatibility we could all live with.
