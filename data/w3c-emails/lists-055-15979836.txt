Arjun Ray pointed out that well-formedness _can_ in fact
be checked with a single pass in the presence of conditional
marked sections.  If element boundaries cannot cross
marked section boundaries, then changing an INCLUDE MS
to an IGNORE MS cannot make a WF document non-WF.

A further simple restriction on the content and context of
conditional MSs can also make one-pass validation tractable.
