My apologies for misconstruing your note.

I believe so.

If we preface it with a DTD, it can also be a valid document instance:

 <!DOCTYPE wellformed [
 <!ELEMENT wellformed (empty+)>
 <!ELEMENT empty      (#PCDATA)>
 <!ATTLIST empty
           x          CDATA       #IMPLIED >
 ]>
 <wellformed>
    <empty, x="foo"/>
    <empty, x="bar">now empty is not empty</empty>
 </wellformed>


The form <e/> is required for all elements declared EMPTY.  It is not
necessarily required for all elements which happen to be empty -- but is
certainly well-formed XML and will be valid SGML after the TC allows the
'sole-tag' (<e/>) form to indicate an element with no content.
