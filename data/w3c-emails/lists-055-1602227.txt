Actually, Paul, some systems have been doing this for some time.
Taking a simpler form of SGML and using it in "DTDless" ways 
has been done even without requiring a hardwired browser a la HTML.
One of the real nice things about XML will be that with just a 
nip and tuck here and there, some of these products will support 
it and we will be able to field them at low/no cost given that 
the decisions made in the next and final phases are well made.
