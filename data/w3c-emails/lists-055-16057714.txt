I might start an avalanche down on my own head, but I'm not sure I
agree that notations are so narrowly defined.  In fact, I'm not sure
notations are so well-defined at all.  I do not see why a notation name
couldn't refer to a namespace.  

Certainly a notation declaration associates a notation name to any system 
literal including a URI--that seems unarguable from merely a syntatic 
viewpoint--and I don't see why one couldn't use this mechanism to make a 
namespace id to a URI that defines that namespace.
