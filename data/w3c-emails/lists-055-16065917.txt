What Paul said.  If it's name spaces that are desired, the *sole acceptable
solution for the Internet* in light of current development work is URNs.
A prototype implementation for the name space for RFCs (more complex than
you might think) is currently in draft stage.  

If some other approach to whatever the real problem is is desired,
*please* write up a formal list of requirements couched in language
of appropriate technical complexity *and* construct a document describing
scenarios in which the desired functionality is to be used.  All else,
especially via email, is a waste of time.

I've read Martin's and Andrew's replies, but I'm using Jon's
message as the base for my comments.

I'm not sure I see the need to discuss behavior or even "meaning"
at all with respect to namespaces.  While a DTD (or namespace)
can include (usually non-machine-readable) semantic information,
that isn't standardized and doesn't need to be part of the
standardized solution to XML namespaces at least for the first
pass as far as I see it.  For me, the namespace issue is more
just how to indicate for any (element or maybe attribute) name
from what DTD/namespace it comes.

I like to think of the "namespaceid" that (per some syntactic suggestions)
might precede the gi name (with a colon separator) as a sort of notation
name.  Then, a declaration such as:
<!NOTATION namespaceid SYSTEM "...{URI or FSI}..."
or
<!NOTATION namespaceid PUBLIC "...{FPI}..."
(to show it using 8879 syntax, though the same thing could be accomplished
using other syntaxes) would map the namespaceid into the namespace. Given
that FSIs can point to an or group of storage identifiers, that would seem
to give us the "pointing to multiple namespaces" capability.

I see no need to semantic axes to the namespace issue.  I don't see
why semantics can't be orthogonal to the "from which DTD(s) or other-specified
set(s) of declarations did this name come" question.
