Not formally, but my sense of notations is that they declare handlers
for 
types of information.  The sticking point has been that is a role
reserved 
for MIME.  Several times Eliot has given examples of how this can be
mapped.

Can a notation declare these types externally for routine use
internally?

Is it possible to use a notation to declare a DTD formally?  IOW, can 
or should a notation declare an SGML/XML DTD within the DTD of another 
application?

I have to read up on URIs to be sensible here.

Ok.  Does a namespace have to be universal? Does the DTD declare a 
namespace that is local?  

Provocative and maybe dumb:  Is it better to handle the issues of
namespaces 
in the DOM?  If so, does the DOM handle namespaces for VRML or only 
for W3C markup applications?
