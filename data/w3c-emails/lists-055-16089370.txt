| documents in XML, rather than maintaining them in Full SGML and
| down-translating at publication time.  That means I need an XML DTD for
| validation, etc., all the things Len mentioned.

It might be easier to build a reliable SGML>XML translation tool,
use only SGML DTDs, produce SGML instances, and filter to XML.

| Web requires nothing more than copying files into the appropriate
| directories.  If XML were crippled by losing parameter entities (and
| external text entities, if some people have their way), then publication
| on the Web would continue to require down-translation, as it does now.
| That would be a lost opportunity.

Agreed entirely; I would be inclined to down-translate instance-to-instance.

Understood, but it is a response from an ERB member, and that's all
I ask for.  Thanks and good luck.
