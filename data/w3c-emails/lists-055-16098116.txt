| will be changed more or less as follows:
| 
|   An XML processor must always pass all characters in a document
|   that are not markup through to the application.  An XML processor
|   which reads the DTD must distinguish white space in element content
|   from other non-markup characters, and signal to the application
|   that white space in element content is not significant.

Irrespective of the merits of the decision, which it will take some
reflection to absorb, please define the technical terms for all
the flavors of XML processors the spec defines and use *only those
technical terms* elsewhere in the spec (just like the BNF).  That
means that "An XML processor which reads the DTD" should be emended
to "a validating XML processor", "any XML-compliant processor", or
"any XML processor", depending on what is really meant.

The target audience for this spec shouldn't have to figure out
what kind of XML processor reads DTDs, because half the time he'll
get it wrong.
