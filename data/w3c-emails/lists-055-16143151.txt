Well, all I can say is that this flies in the face of any sensible
protocol design.

I do not think this is true, but this is beside the point ...

This is not true in all cases. Also, saying "have not" is not equivalent
to "could not": If necessary information is missing, some infrastructure
for specifying it is needed, not a kludge to get around the problem.

I have almost given up on WWW I18N...
