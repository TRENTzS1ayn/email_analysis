Or might it not be better to constrain your DTDs so all conforming documents
are also Well Formed XML?  Then you don't need to filter, and you're always in
XML land unless you really need to validate.  We've always had the assumption
that validation will be required far less than WF.

If we take this approach we can split the DTD issue into 2 pieces:

1) DTDs for generating and validating documents
2) The DTD subset needed for WF checking and other processing (but also still
sufficient for small, simple DTDs - with training wheels)

There should be a deterministic means to translate 1->2.

The first kind of DTD is mostly server-side for generating documents.  It would
only be transmitted to the client on request.  It is not required to conform to
the MGSW (maybe we should say WF in a week, Valid in a fortnight) and can
include all the bells and whistles a DTD designer needs while remaining in the
WF category (i.e, no SHORTREFs).  Since we're keeping the XML lexing model
simple, this would still be a lot easier than a full SGML DTD parser.

Obviously document producers have different requirements than consumers.
Does making this distinction help?
