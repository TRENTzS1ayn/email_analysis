That's all I think something like the XML spec would have to say.  All
other typing (lexical or otherwise) is an orthogonal issue that might
be addressed by some XML-data-typing spec, but that is true for both
the old fashioned single namespace DTD as well as the multiple namespace
problem, so let's not mix data typing issues with namespaces issues."

Thank you, Paul.  That states the essential point concisely.
