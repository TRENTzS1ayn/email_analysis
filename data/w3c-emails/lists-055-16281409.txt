In this whole web/SGML excercise, I regard the web as an
SGML system (with entity resolution equivalent to URL
resoltion). So as long as the universe of discourse is
the web, URLs as system IDs are reliable.

XML is intended to be interoperable with systems that
exceed the confines of the web, and public identifiers
can facilitate that interoperability. (They can
provide redundancy within the web as well.)

But if the web is your only target, URLs are all you need.
