I am in sympathy with the separation of content (what something *is*) as opposed
to how it behaves/is rendered/etc.  However I went ahead and implemented JUMBO
according to XML-LINK970406 and here are some observations:

JUMBO does not use stylesheets, but does use the ACTUATE and SHOW attributes and
finds them quite useful.  [I suspect that JUMBO is oriented towards the DOM
approach.]  Therefore to provide them some layer more general than stylesheets
is required.

4.1 SHOW/EMBED suggests that a tree from a remote document can be embedded as
part of the document in which the XML-LINK appears.  With ACTUATE="AUTO" this
is not a stylesheet mechanism, but a way of combining components of documents.
I have got excited about this, and am building this feature into CML as it
is a useful way of combining fragments from more than one DTD.  Maybe I'm being
naughty in doing this, but I wouldn't like to be deprived of it.
