I would bet that many applications already do. The point is that it has to
be done somewhere. The application is the only one that really knows if
the whitespace is significant since it is the one that read the stylesheet.
Personally, if I didn't write the parser, I'd rescan it's output for
meaningless-as-defined-in-the-stylesheet whitespace anyway.

Not in your DTD. It's part of the stylesheet.
