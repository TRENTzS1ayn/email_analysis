I completely and very strongly agree with Rick.

Fortunately, the current draft assumes the idegraphic character 
representing digits as ideographic characters rather than digits, 
right?

I found that  [#xFF10-#xFF19] /* Fullwidth digits */ 
are allowed as digits.  Since the compatibility zone has 
no place in markups, this should be removed, anyway.
(I should have noticed this.)
