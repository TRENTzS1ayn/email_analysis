Top marks!  Good Matthew.  One view is that 
we deal with documents for which validity is established once and 
is always true.  Another are that we see an instance in process and
realize 
that the emitters and consumers of that instance are modifying it and 
that they transform by a set of rules err,,, styles..err.. processes.

That I guess, is why the spec calls them XML processors.  "-)

WFness and validity are just states of the instance.  It can be 
both and not.  It depends on what the processor needs it to be.

Some stupid questions:

What are the implications of transforms to namespaces?
Does the instance have a namespace?  
If an instance is transformed, is it a new namespace, is it 
in a new namespace, does the transform affect the namespace?

Looking at Rick's proposal to chain the notations, does 
that chain a set of documents which prescribe the notation, 
or the handlers required on the system to process the 
notation?  Yes, they are just identifiers.  What do they identify?
