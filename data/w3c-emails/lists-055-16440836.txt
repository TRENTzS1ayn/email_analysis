Actually, that is precisely how the MID specification 
indicates a "known" processor which the preparer of 
the document is indicating will work.  It was convenient.

Hmm.  It is an odd place to put it, I grant you.  Would you 
preferred it to have been in the instance?  If you wanted 
to move the information/data naming the processor or processor 
type, and you don't have MIME, how would you do it?

It indicates the type of a processor/handler.  End of story.
How does that get registered? IOW, VRML/JAVA have CLASSPATH:
will XML have some equivalent for that?

They do both, but they don't indicate data types, but name a 
document that defines the data types.  Correct?  So in that 
sense, they are in situ, only names.  One is the name of a 
document; the other is presumably the name of a processor 
that the DTD emitter *says* handles whatever that document defines.

How useful is that pair of names in that form?
