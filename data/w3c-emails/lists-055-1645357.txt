At first, I was going to say that this was a poor example and suggest
that you considered most of the programming reference books on your
shelves, but then I realized that it isn't so bad. The only difference
is that I think you're assuming that someone typed your example. We have
hundreds (thousands?) of tabular ASCII report options in various
software products. The documentation for that software naturally contains
samples of those reports. I just can't picture myself promoting a
language that requires people to go in and add markup to these examples.
I don't think I could even convince myself to use such a language.
