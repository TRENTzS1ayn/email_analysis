[Tim Bray:]

| In recent news, Netscape has submitted to W3C a general metadata
| framework for distributed information resources.  The data model is
| the interesting part, but the syntax is XML.

Allow me to belabor the obvious and point out that this Netscape
proposal, taken in conjunction with similar proposals from Microsoft,
means that XML is going to be the language upon which Web management
will be based.

We're in.
