I disagree with this, James. I think the likelihood of someone inserting
markup into a "verbatim" element that would trigger the ignore-this-RE
rule in SGML is very, very small.

With SGML, the intrusion on elements of this type in our data has been
minimal. Even in PCDATA, the need to replace '<' and '&' is rare and
we never have to replace '>'.

But why the mention of spaces? I thought these were left unscathed.
