For the stylesheet you could used the new #ALL identifier, but for all your
other notations you definitely would not want to. You can only attach link
notation processors to valid link elements. You can only attach CALS tables
notation processors to elements that conform to the CALS table model
(presumably ones whose names are qualified using CALS::)

The XML-lang notation applies to the SGML declaration as well! Is it enough
to reference it as part of the DOCTYPE?

That must be a text based-semantic that is indirectly associated with the
table element as that is the container for the columns. (This type of use of
SEEALSO as referenced in TC2 is invalid and needs challenging! Its not SGML
declaration dependent or generally applicable to all associated doctypes.)

These constraints must be specified before the DOCTYPE is processed (if it
is). The safest place to specify this is in the SGML Declaration, which in
XML's case is fixed, and is automatically presumed, otherwise the xml-lang
stuff has to go in every Doctype statement.

This one is interesting. Can you by pointing to the XML spec from an SGML
declaration force that declaration to conform to the rules about SGML
declarations specified in that spec? I'm not sure whether this is valid.

I see this is enshrined in the draft text for TC2, but want to know why -
what's wrong with pointing to a meta-DTD?

OK, I admit NOTATION must be used here:-) (The non-Java coffee I made last
night obviously wasn't strong enough to keep me awake!)
