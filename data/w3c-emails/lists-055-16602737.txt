Right. This has nothing do do with a language spec. as I said earlier.

Right. The other important thing is that if the range of encodings
accepted is limited to those used in a local sense, one should be able
to build a processor/parser optimized for that particular case.

Right. I suggested to Tim earlier, in the context of the DOM, that the
DOM shopuld only specify that characters are stored in a "string". The
actual implementation of a string should be decided by the application
architecture (i.e. a JAVA application would use String, a C
application would use wchar_t* etc.)

I think we have a few issues with the declaration, but other than
that, the only issue we have is deciding which coded character set to
use in the SGML declaration for XML. As I said before, I think ISO
10646 is better for this.

One again, encodings are *not* an issue for XML-lang.
