I don't see a need for date arithmetic in browser style sheets (which is
the kind of thing that would make date validation essential).

I can imagine that a document might like to present dates in one of several
formats, and convert them to a common format for display, but this is
hardly essential for most applications. You don't need to verify PCDATA
unless you intend to invoke some sort of data format dependent process on
it. I think we could live without this verification (or implement it in
rendering code, eg. via applets).

I'm _not_ saying it's useless, but pointing out that in actual practice we
get by without PCDATA validation today (at the cost of custom coding it
when we do need it). I don't see why a "stripped down" SGML _requires_ this
feature, when SGML doesn't require it. I also don't see special web-related
issues here that wouls mandate the inclusion of such a feature. I'm not
even sure that we know what restrictions are needed. Some think regexps,
for instance, would be overkill, others have pointed out that many
constraints are not easily expressible with regexps. It would be a nice
feature, but we all know how to live without it.
