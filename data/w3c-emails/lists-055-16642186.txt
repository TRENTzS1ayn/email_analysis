There is about a month of discussion in the back archives of this list --
it echoes, point-for-point, about 4 years of the URN discussion. We decided
to allow PUBLIC, and need not revisit that. I don't remember whether we
will link to FPIs via URN syntax or to URNs vi FPI syntax -- but it doesn't
matter, which way we do it, either way we will be using the relevant ISO
and Internet standards to create a feature some will not happily live
without.

Just for yucks, I'll note that the URN/FPI registries can be independent of
software, and many will be. Domain names may be potentially so, but in
practice, an expired or reassigned domain name's old organizational binding
is not readily accessible.

But this is not important, we already had _all of these discussions_. Read
the archives if you care, and much joy to you in the reading.
