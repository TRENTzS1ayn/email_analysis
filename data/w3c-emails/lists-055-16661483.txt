Since URIs include URNs, FPIs will be included.

Sounds like semantics to me.

So, we throw out the notion of validation? sounds liek a high price to pay,
particularly since all we're doing is indentifying an element with some
persistemnt external identifier so that we can do some kind of specialized
processing. Sounds like an architecture to me.

Or multiple architecture attributes -- same effect, but we don't have to
change the specification by one jot or tittle, just document the convention
for those who care (e.g. the PICS folx).

The null addition is the smallest one possible, and seems to do the job.
