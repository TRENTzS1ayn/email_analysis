Charles, I agree with your proposal except for this. Numeric character
references don't work since you can't reliably predict what glyph will be
displayed for that value.

What is wrong with the SDATA entities anyway? Is there an alternative
suggestion such that you can use a symbolic name for the desired glyph
so that the application can then use whatever font is available that
contains that glyph?
