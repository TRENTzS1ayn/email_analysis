Yes - I'm very conscious of this since it represents the borderline in
my own case (native JUMBO does not read and DTDs - it can, however use
NXP and other parsers).  The choice seems to be:
- DTD parsing is too complex for some of the intended implementing
community
- different parsers will produce different output with little or
no understanding by a large authoring/reading community
- some brilliant solution suggested by the WG/WRB

I favour 3; and can (possibly) accept a set of rules [If your DTD contains
X then it must be parsed, but not if it contains Y...]  Whatever the solution
it must not allow different ouptuts that are opaque to the redaer and change
the intent of the author.

I hope not, but I'd have to reluctantly agree if that was the price for correct
document processing.

Although the WG/ERB cannot require it, there is always the third:

of course we don't have to worry about writing a parser because there
are several top-class ones already written that have no license restrictions
to our use, that track the standard (so we don't have to rewrite our parser
with each spec), and have the confidence of our customers.
