Don't confuse the presentation order I chose for pedagogical reasons with the
order of importance for the uses of a DTD.

That paper was originally published in 1981, when data bases were in their
infancy and Don Knuth hadn't yet made text processing a legitimate subject for
computer science. (In fact, when I prepared it for the standard I had to do a
global change from GML to SGML; see footnote 9.) In that environment, it was
easier to explain a DTD by showing some easily grasped concrete uses of the
information that it contains. Tag omission is an especially good example for
this purpose because it emphasizes the distinction between tags and elements.

There are good reasons for XML to work without a DTD (at least for browsing and 
other read-only applications), but the structure of my paper isn't one of them.
