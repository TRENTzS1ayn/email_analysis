I don't see much difference between a character number and an alphabetic symbol.
Both ultimately have to be mapped to some character semantic, and thence to a
glyph. But that mapping should occur in the style sheet. 

If you want to use symbolics, use the existing ISO character entity sets and
remove the SDATA keyword, since the entity text isn't system-specific data. (I
originally intended those declarations to be templates for real system data, but
no one uses them that way, I've been told.)

But I'm happy to leave the resolution of character set issues to those more
passionate about them than I. I only proposed eliminating internal SDATA to
simplify entity declarations and because, unlike external SDATA entities, there
is no standardized way to  specify a notation. Of course, we could adopt the
convention that I (and others) proposed earlier for PIs, but that would still
leave us with a special kind of internal entity, and I think that XML should
have all its internal entities resolved.
