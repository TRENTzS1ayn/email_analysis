>(mainly paragraph 2) why I believe that view to be mistaken.

Right, and I replied to that message earlier. It seems to me that
this is a matter of subjective opinion.

It is a fact that many, and perhaps even most, modern operating systems
do not even have the concept of line seperators, except as applied
to certain devices. TTY drivers are what implements the line-oriented
display features of UNIX: the file systems have no concept of this.
MSDOS, and windows follow the same path. As David has also pointed
out, even on the Mac, there is no such thing as "line" or "record".

The concept of "line" is even more poorly defined than "record", and
in most cases is an application convention.
