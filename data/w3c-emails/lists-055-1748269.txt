You're not a bit confused. You're just pointing out what none of us wants to
face up to -- there is a strong element of wishfulness in our plans for HTML.

Not a chance! Because:

RTF is available on every non-Unix system (and maybe on Unix systems too.)

She has no idea of the size of her files.

She doesn't know what structure is, nor does she care. If it looks right, it is
right.

We might create an XML that is more portable and device-independent, but more
widely supported than the flagship application of the world's largest computer
company ... pure fantasy!

Not important ... she'd rather have the latest vendor goodies. (Consider the
experience with Netscape and HTML.)

I think the sooner we abandon the fantasy that anyone but SGML users will want
XML the sooner we can focus on designing a viable language. Here is my
reasoning:

1. No vendor with a dominant market share will voluntarily adopt a standard that
will open his market to competitors. 

2. No users will press a vendor for XML support except those who already
understand the value of a structured,  renditionless information representation
-- in other words, SGML users.

3. They won't get that support unless we make XML absurdly easy to implement.
That means a delivery form of an SGML instance with no tricky parsing,no SGML
declaration, and no DTD.
