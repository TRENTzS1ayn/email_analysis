No, the rule is that an RE *caused by* markup is not significant. By definition,
markup is that which is not data. Data is the true information. Therefore, an RE
that wouldn't be there if some markup weren't there isn't data and isn't true
information.

To put it another way, you should be able to remove all the markup and get
exactly the same data as when the markup is present.
