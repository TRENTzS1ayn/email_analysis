The point of Charles' True Information spiel is that the application should
never see data that has not been normalized according to SGML/XML's rules.
If a data character (such as a newline under the banish RS/RE proposal)
occurs in element content, it should be an ERROR, and in an SGML parser's
interpretation it will be. So an SGML-based application (i.e. Panorama) will
report an error (if it supports remapping RS/RE).

That's why RS/RE must either remain as it stands or must be banished from
element content and replaced by a convention like this:

I didn't mean that you would put it in the DTD, but in the DTD documentation
(i.e. the TEI Guidlines or the HTML Specification). As I said, this just
shifts the burden from the hundred of us here to the thousands out there. I
prefer the two other proposals that make whitespace handling consistent
across XML-applications.
