My understanding from the conference call is that we decided that we only
needed to collapse RS/REs--spaces we could leave alone, except as specified
in rule (1).

Using NSGMLS style output (and ignoring attributes):
(ROOT
(DS
-WFMD-AA, WAFE MAIN DRAWER
)DS
(Q
-1.0000
)Q
(DWG
(USES
(REF
(Q
-6.0000
)Q
)REF
(REF
(Q
-8.0000
)Q
)REF
(REF
(Q
-36.0000
)Q
)REF
)ROOT

There is *no* uncollapsed space in the example because, unless I've gotten
it horribly wrong, all the white space falls under rule 1.

Cheers,
