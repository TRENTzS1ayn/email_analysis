Then SGML, HTML and XML aren't for you. 

The first SGML document I ever saw was a report about R&D.  There was a
declaration at the start,
<!Entity D "">
that made the document parse.... :-)

But you'll probably need to do a better job than that.  So you'll need to
add markup.

Quoting spaces is no harder than quoting & and <.

If that's not feasible (and I know that it isn't always feasible), you may
have to stick
to text/plain.
