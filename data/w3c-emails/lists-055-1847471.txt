So you beg the question in another way. The issue is _why_ we should treat
the RE as markup rather than data. Since there is no _requirement_ to
include an RE after a tag, why _must_ it not be significant. I've shown how
you can trivially add line RE and whitespace as needed to pretty-print your
text without the RE ignoring rule.

   Other than pretty printing, why should that information not be
significant? I would appreciate a user-level justification, not a another
"true information" comment that pre-supposes that whitespace after markup
must be insignificant. The requirement that it be insignificant is the
issue at question. I don't see that the rule gains us anything of
importance, but I could be convinced, given an argument.

  One consistent proposal that would make more sense to me would be to
_require_ tags to occupy a line by themselves. The RE would always be
there, and would always be ignored. This guarantees that it's easy to
explain as well. (I don't think people would like it, though).

   I keep thinking about a bug I was told about where a database was driven
by the ESIS, and later spat out the markup without a CR after every tag.
For some elements with several REs at the beginning they would thus lose
one _significant_ RE on every check-in/check-out cycle. They had to put an
RE after every tag to make things work right (or they would have had to
hack their parser to inform the application of the "non-significant"
whitespace).
