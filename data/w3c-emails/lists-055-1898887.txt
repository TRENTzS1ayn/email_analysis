Consider the following example where I represent ALL RE's with @:

<chapter>@
<title>The Title</title> @
<p>Here is paragraph one containing a bunch of gratuitous REs@
@
@
@
in the middle of it.</p>@
<p>Here is paragraph two containing a bunch of gratuitous REs @
 @
 @
 @
in the middle of it.</p>@
</chapter>@

a.  If 1 and 2 above are the only rules, then does that mean that the
space and RE between the title and first paragraph are significant?

b.  Given the clarification of rule 2, then all of paragraph one's REs are
collapsed to a single space, but paragraph two contains " @ @ @ @".  Then,
I assume rule 2 says each @ gets "collapsed" into a single space resulting
in "        ".  Am I understanding this correctly?
