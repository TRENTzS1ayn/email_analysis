What about (where '@' denotes an RE and '.' denotes a space):

    <aaa>@
    ...<bbb>XXX</bbb>@
    ...<ccc>XXX</ccc>@
    </aaa>@

The RE and space characters preceding the CCC element
are not deemed insignificant by rule 1, whereas an
SGML parser would treat them as such if AAA had
element content.
