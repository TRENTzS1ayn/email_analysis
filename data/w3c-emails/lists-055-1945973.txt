I'm sorry, but I don't see how you've arrived at this conclusion. SGML 
works quite well for us. I can use CDATA elements to contain the examples
and have yet to run into an ETAGO that has caused a problem. If there is
an ETAGO in the content, then there is a corresponding PCDATA element
so that we can markup the ETAGO (and any EROs or STAGOs that we now have
to be concerned about). All of our tools support some form of verbatim
formatting. So, it works just great.

Somehow I think the frequency of spaces is slightly higher than occurrences
of '<' and '&'.
