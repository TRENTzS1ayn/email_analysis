If so, we should think hard about the internationalization issues. As Gavin
pointed out, it may be unnecessarily heavy handed of us to require a Java
applet to convert to UCS-2 (or worse, UTF-8) in order to pass a few bytes of
data to a Visual Basic script (which will process it as ASCII, reconvert it
back and pass it on to a database engine).

Perhaps we should err on the side of flexibility in this
internationalization issue.
