Sure I could picture it. It's always in the back of my mind as an option
should XML turn out too strange. With OmniMark in my back pocket and the
tremendous potential of Jade round the corner, I feel strangely secure.
(By the way, shouldn't we all chip in and take out an insurance policy
on James?)

I had such a thing in mind way back when I suggested "client/server" XML
as an option. Didn't get much interest, though. I kind'a wish it were a
viable option though since it would ease the tension between easy to type
and easy to parse. You could make the client parser *very* simple. The
server parser could be more complex, but not much more so. Perhaps I
shouldn't have used "client/server" as the name. I really see it to be
more like elisp with a byte compiler only instead of compiled, you have
a very easy to parse, but still human-readable version for machine to
machine communications (or agent to agent if you prefer).
