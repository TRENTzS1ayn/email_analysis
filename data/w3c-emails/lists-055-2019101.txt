But you can't make the mapping if all you have is a number. In the 8859-1
world, you have to select the font first. If you only have a number you
can only assume the current font. Since that usually restricts you to
ISO Latin1, you can't even get an emdash into the text, let alone math
symbols.

Some tools do use the replacement text to good effect (even your favorite--
Author/Editor). I like it 'cause it gives me an opportunity to make some
changes as necessary. Other tools just use them as symbolic names and make
the mapping elsewhere (forcing me to go hunt it down).

I don't have a clue how character set issues will affect this. In my current
systems, it's completely disconnected because the glyph for a character
depends on the current font. If anyone could assure me that this will be
a non-issue, then I'll be happy (as long as I have their home address for
insurance...).
