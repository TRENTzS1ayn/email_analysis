So, correct me if I'm wrong, but with the proposed set of rules: "If you
don't want spaces, don't put them in." With the other proposal: "If you
don't want newlines, don't put 'em in." (I'm not ignoring the other
proposals just juxtaposing these two.)

I don't see a substantive difference other than that I lose the ability
to do verbatim formatting with the former.
