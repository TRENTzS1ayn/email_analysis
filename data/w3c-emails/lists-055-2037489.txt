Exactly. So having recognized the unavoidable fact, why do you keep trying to
avoid it? I can understand trying to ameliorate its impact, but let us first
face up to the truth: this is the only way we can go.

This conclusion contradicts the inescapable fact. His earlier quote says we
should keep things familiar, so I offer this premise:

1. Most people will create XML with a program that hides the real data format,
in which case the "niceness" and "familiarity" of the format are non-issues.

2. People who will create XML with "dumb" editors or mode-assisted (dull?)
editors also have written programs. To them, quoting data is quite familiar and
macros can be written to assist with it.

The SGML community needs a lean, mean conforming delivery format, which XML can
be. It will be confusing enough to the market to have SGML and XML. Having a
third "version" of SGML is at least one too many.
