Because the tag isn't part of the data. Therefore, any RE whose presence depends
on where a tag is positioned can't possibly be part of the data either.

It's not quite as pretty, or as natural, as:

<p>
This is a paragraph.
</p>

or even:

<p>
"This is a paragraph."
</p>

O.K. I'll try again.

A user wants to capture a particular piece of data. He knows what it is. He
knows whether there are REs in it. He takes the following steps (which you can
follow on your own text editor):

1. He opens a text editor and types in the data, putting the REs where he wants
them.

Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of the party.

2. He now wants to identify that data as a "p" element, so he enters tags,  like
this:

<p>Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of the party.</p>

3. He decides that the structure would look clearer during editing if he put the
tags on their own input lines, like this:

<p>
Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of the party.
</p>

In all of these steps, he hasn't changed one character of the data. So why
should the application see a single RE in step 2 and three REs in step 3? The
data has only ever had a single RE.

The operant word is "bug". If you are regenerating  SGML from a database and the
data of an element starts with a significant RE, you obviously need to insert an
insignificant RE after the start-tag. In other cases you don't have to, but it
is always safe to do so. Both algorithms are pretty simple, so a good system
will allow the user to choose between them.
