At that point it might be best to bite the rest of the bullet and always delimit
data. Look at the advantages:

1. No need to access a DTD to determine if an element is mixed content.
2. All REs and RSs are ignored -- full stop! (See, I'm internationalized :-)
3. Really easy parsing.
4. Much simpler to explain.
