And Word can now open Web documents.  Sure has improved printing. ;-)

Right.  Welcome to framework design:  to the notations, and beyond!

The trick is, an XML viewer that just renders XML isn't as interesting 
an XML-handler that understands/inteprets other semantics of the XML
elements.

IOW, not just AN active-X, but lots of them, some dedicated to 
very simple XML aggregates.  XML, IMO, allows us to send 
property values where some properties are complex as could be
the case for a nest.  Anyway, the Active X way is one way.  
It is a solid commercial way.  VRML (which is actually 
an object language), so far is having a devil of a time 
with the issue of that interface.  Best we leave it for 
the next phase.

Yes,  XML will go beyond SGML users, but because we 
are letting it go beyond SGML.  We will find a lot 
of the same users.  Heck, that's us.
