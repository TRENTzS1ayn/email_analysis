The problem I have is the one you seem to recognize yourself. If someone
adds a keyword to a catalog because he has facilities for interpreting it,
how can he be sure that someone without those facilities can use it? Is it a
requirement that the addition of keywords to a catalog means that the
catalog can only be used on sites that support that keyword?
