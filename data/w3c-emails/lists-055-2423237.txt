The *syntax* of these two are different.  (One has "#ID" and the other 
"#/tei/id", and similar other differences.  CMSMCQ (c) and (d) have no special
character (unless my mailer is incapable of detecting it - there was some
correspondence about that).  also (c) and (d) use "tei" and "teiq".  Also there
is an implied compression of spaces into null and/or ",".  

Are they equivalent and the application must handle both?  Or is there going
to be convergence at some time? (Not being a TEI user I don't know whether
there is a common practice here).
