N.B. My discussion was introduced with the words "Suppose we were to say
(this is not a proposal, though I wouldn't mind if it made enough sense
to become one ...)" and it should not be taken as a paraphrase of
any ERB decision.

So the answer to your question

>Are they equivalent and the application must handle both?  Or is there

is "no they are not equivalent, and no an application is not required to
handle both."

Sorry for any confusion.
