First, I want to thank Paul lfor his "rant". Very nice. I'd also like to
acknowledge that (as he said in private email) PUBLIC IDs may not always be
bound to an immutable reply: resources like "today's weather report" change
regularly. So a caching application that inferred PUBLIC->SYSTEM mappings
from douments that it retrieved over the web would also have to track the
dates of validity on the fetched resource -- but, at least for HTTP, that
mechanism already exists.

Well, actually the TCP efficiency may do that, but even more important to
my mind, is the fact it can help increase the ability to do incremental
display, by giving you the stylesheet before you commit to transferring the
document. Those of us sitting on a modem all day really live and die by
incremental display...

I think that noting that the (trivial) format  difference is determined by
compatibility should serve fine... We've already done that in several
places, with considerably more complex syntactic oddities, and it's not
like CATALOG is a punishing and tricky format.

Exactly -- if the requirements on authors to use PUBLIC IDs were hard, and
if URLs actually gave us guaranteed resolvability, this whole line of
argument would muster some conviction.

Everyone who has used a web-server on a case-insensitive file system and
then moved to Unix, has discovered that URLs are not as simple as they look
(even with the simplest of server and client implementations).
