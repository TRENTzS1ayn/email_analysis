By mail vote and in conference 1997.04.02, the SGML ERB decided the
following question:

Should the XML spec allow external identifiers to take the form

  'PUBLIC' Publicid SystemLiteral

with an appropriate definition of Publicid and the note:

   In addition to a system literal, an external identifier may
   include a public identifier.  A system may use the public
   identifier to try to generate an alternative URL.  If a system
   is unable to do so, it must use the URL specified in the system
   literal.

   No: Bray, Sharpe, Paoli
