The first revision of the XML spec since November is now available at

   http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/WD-xml-lang.html

The revision has been submitted to the W3C and is expected to become
available within the next 24 hours.  (The W3C site in Cambridge is
experiencing a number of problems due to the weather.)
