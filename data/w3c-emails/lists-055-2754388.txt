PostScript and RTF versions of the revised xml-lang spec are available
from

http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml-lang.ps.gz
http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml-lang.ps.zip
http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml-lang.rtf.gz
http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml-lang.rtf.zip

Note that the RTF version was created simply as an intermediate file
in the production of the PostScript version.  It is provided for the
convenience of those wishing to use an RTF viewer, but the quality of
display will vary depending on the page settings.
