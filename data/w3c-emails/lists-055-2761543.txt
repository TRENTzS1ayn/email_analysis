I realized i never answered this one:

* Panorama has a reasonable subset, and their HyTime support is built on top
of the TEI xptrs (which i find rather gratifying).

* DynaText has support for both P1 and P3 version xptrs. I think I did all
the genetic traversals (but only did negative instance numbers for the easy
cases; that was just lack of time, tho, not a strategic decision; and didn't
do regexes within GIs and attrs; and I think i limited it to 10 attr/value
pairs or something (can we say 'in a hurry'? I knew we could)). Didn't do
TOKEN or STR because it's a pain to count them, esp. when you don't know if

    <P>now<X>here

gives one word or two (if X is ITEM or FOOTNOE it's two, if X is EMPH maybe
not). I didn't do SPACE or FOREIGN. Wanted to do PATTERN but didn't have
time to hook up a regex module, so didn't. Obviously ROOT and HERE. I didn't
do spans directly, but you can build them by calling the stuff i built twice
instead of once from your application.

Not sure who else has them, but aren't they like Thneeds?
