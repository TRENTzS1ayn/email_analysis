The revised FAQ now marks changes, additions, and deletions, so you can
see what is new and what is not.

I realise time is short as we approach WWW6 but I'd be grateful if those 
of you with a few mins to spare could have a look through it. I'd like
to be reasonably sure it's factually correct before going public.

Those of you going to WWW6: please tell people about it, and ask them to
send in questions and suggestions, 

///Peter
