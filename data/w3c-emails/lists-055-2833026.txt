It is clear enough to an SGML expert/XML developer - but any author trying
to illustrate a marked section within a CDATA marked section is going to
generate an error message. I was hoping to have some explicit wording to
this effect within the section on marked sections, rather than having to
look elsewhere for the cause of the error message.

Absolutely sure: The source code ends with the word "that" followed by </p>

In the preceding paragraph, where you explicityly state "a conditional
section may contain one or more complete declarations, comments, or nested
conditional sections, intermingled with white space. Conditional sections
must not occur within declarations, except the document-type declaration". 
This precludes any chance of it starting within any declaration that
contains a literal that needs to be skipped.
