You're right. There is a problem of notations that are not registered
Mime-types, but they are not likely to interoperate well, anyway.

Maybe we could _allow_ URLs instead of Mime-types (the : after the scheme
name would disambiguate, no?) -- If and _only if_ there is no Mime-type
available for a data format.

Insofar as the notation labelling problem has been solved _anywhere_ Mime
types are the solution.

   I will be _very_ surprised if anyone can find an argument _for_ URLs
referencing some unknown resource, rather than a Mime-type -- especially
when we are explicitly targeting the Web and HTTP.

   -- David

Note: now that we have PUBLIC, we could state that PULBIC IDs for notations
are Mime types and leave the SYSTEM ID as the one that is not well-defined
as to semantics....

Seems an ironic reversal of the other case, but this is a place where the
Naming probelm is better solved than the resolution problem.
