I would strongly support this.  I have found MIME types an extremely valuable
tool for building my XML system with as it is often otherwise impossible to 
identify  the type of a document (e.g. the target of a link).  (I take it 
that XML systems are allowed to point to non-XML targets so long as they are
of know NOTATION?)
