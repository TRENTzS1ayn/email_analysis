I have tried (not too hard) to envision what it might look

the combination of ilinks and instance isn't enough information
for an application to apple up a display of the combination.

Okay.

At the time I argued that position I thought that the SGML ERB
was going to specify something about applications (as XML apps
are mentions in XML-lang).  By now we have established that it
will not.  So I will have to state my policy outside of XML, in
the larger architecture of the app, whatever it is, and having
these (probably inadequate) hooks in XML is only going to confuse
matters.

| 
| The URL specs indicate (at least, the ones I've looked at do) that
| the semantics of a fragment identifier depend on the type of
| resource of which it's a fragment.  So the semantics of
| 
|    http://www.foo.org/bar#baz
| 
| are defined by the XML spec if the object is application/xml, and
| are defined by the HTML spec if the object is text/html.
|

| call, it's built into the fabric of the relevant RFCs.

Yes, I agree that's so, but do you expect XML TEI pointers into
HTML documents to work?  or are they meant only for pointing into
XML instances?  And if the TEI pointer is in a query instead
of a fragment ID?

| 
| Er, in the sense that if your browser doesn't know what to do with
| XML documents, it won't know what to do with XML-link fragment
| identifiers, and it needs to call a helper app that knows what's
| up.
| 
| I hope this is helpful.

To rephrase, is this language applicable to XML only or to URLs
occurring in any context (HTML, VRML, ETF) pointing into XML?
Or does it apply to URLs generally?
