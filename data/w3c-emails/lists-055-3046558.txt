| Can you provide a pointer to a statement of the new rules?  

They're in the "member area" of the W3C site, which means that they're
not visible to those who haven't paid to become W3C members.  I would
mail you a copy, but as chairman of a W3C committee, I guess that
would be bad form.  Maybe someone else can mail you a copy.

I'm hopeful that we can keep that from happening, but it's possible.
