This appears to be an argument which proves that queries IN GENERAL
cannot possibly be useful -- nothing specific to XML here.  Since
queries do in practice seem to be found useful, despite the fact that
they only work on servers on which they work, I don't see any reason
not to describe how they can be used in XML.  The same problems
surely arise if you build the query into the path segment of the
URL:  it will work only on servers on which it works.

What am I missing?
