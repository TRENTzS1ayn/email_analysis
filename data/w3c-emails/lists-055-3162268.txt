| This appears to be an argument which proves that queries IN GENERAL

Nothing, you said it with "nothing specific to XML here".  You want
(reasonably) a facility that URLs don't provide yet, to wit,
fallback to fragment-ID behavior if the query isn't understood.
Or you want to instantiate a (one among many) standardized query 
language in URLs at least to the extent of being able to declare
what it is.

The solution is to ask for it of those responsible for URLs and 
perhaps HTTP.
