It occurs to me that it is important to know whether a server's
response to a TEI pointer query is actually a response to the
query or a default response of sending the entire enclosing
XML instance.

If the instance is Genesis (but I am ignorant of its content)
and I ask for the third Begettor et seq. (please adjust your
WebTV if I can't ask for et seq.), I will get Enos... if the
query was answered, but Adam... if the server fell back and
sent all of Genesis - and I won't know the difference.

Maybe it would be better not to count on queries yet and 
accept that the Web can't do better than send the whole
instance, for client-side processing of queries.
