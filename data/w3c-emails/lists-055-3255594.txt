Who bells the cat? The market?

The use of determinism seems inappropriate.  As I read the following,
the behavior 
of the fragment identifier (a nameloc of sorts) is defined, but the 
query is not.  IOW, in this spec, it appears to be worthless.  If as 
stated the scheme defines the semantics, then is it the case that 
query is a component for which no http semantics other than the 
append operation are defined, and it is functionally useless?

If so, it isn't non-deterministic:  it is undetermined.

Another way to look at that is, it is an 
opportunity to define, implement and colonize as 
quickly as possible, destabilize competitors, and stay within 
the limit of *keeping up appearances".   If the resource 
determines the query semantic, then yes, this is server 
behavior.  Is that it?

If so, the maximum opportunity here (marketwise) is to define a server 
behavior for XML queries, implement it, and field it before 
anyone else can.  It may not be accepted by the ERB, but who 
cares.  This becomes the area to exploit.

3.  URL References

... While a URL reference is used to perform a retrieval action, the
optional 
fragment identifier... consists of additional reference information to
be interpreted 
by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully
completed.  As 
such, it is not part of the URL but is used in conjunction with a URL. 
The forma 
and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media
type of the 
resource referenced by the URL.

4.1  Scheme

... there are a variety of schemes for descrbing the location of such
resources...
***... the first component defines the semantics for the remainder of
the URL string.***

"4.3  URL Syntactic Component

The URL Syntax is dependent upon the scheme.. most URL schemes use a
common sequence 
of four main components to define the location of a resource

<scheme>://<site><path>?<query>

each of which, except <scheme> mayt be absent from a particular URL. 
Some URL 
schemes do no allow a <site> component and others do not use a <query> 
component."

"4.3.3 .  Query Component

The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by 
the resource.  query = *urlc"
