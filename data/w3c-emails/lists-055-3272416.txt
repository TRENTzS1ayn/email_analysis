This is perhaps more appropriate for xml-dev and I've crossposted the reply.

JUMBO is trying to track the spec as it evolves.  At present it supports TEI 
pointers before the last draft (i.e. with spaces) but I'll hack in the 
commas tomorrow.  As far as I know it behaves as the spec, but I's really 
like some torture tests to see no only if it parses properly but also 
performs properly.  (The msg from James Clark shows that certain elements
might not be found or that there is ambiguity in the spec (e.g.
does *IMPLIED match *).  For myself I find it easiest to have real examples
to develop code against and then when that is done, the authors can match 
against the code.
