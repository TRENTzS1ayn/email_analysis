JIS started to design two new character code standards.  Although 
these will be used together with JIS X 0208, some of the charaters in these
new standards are more important than some of the JIS X 0208 characters, 
said Prof. Shibano.  In three years or so, JIS will propose to ISO these new standards as part of ISO 10646.  The BMP are not likely to include them.
