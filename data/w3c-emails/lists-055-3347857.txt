I disagree.  XML should allow every character in ISO 10646.  I believe 
that this is the intension of the current draft.   (See the syntax 
of character references [58] and [59].)

The two new character code standards of JIS are expected to be widely 
used as part of SJIS.  Then, if XML is restricted to the BMP, conversion 
from SJIS text to XML leads to loss of information.
