This is not necessarily true. You can generate an XML instance that
is entirely encoding in ASCII that contains every single character
from the BMP, plus characters not in the BMP. The *information*
would all be there, but the representation might be "not optimal".

Some people would argue that shift-jis is not exactly a good encoding...
