Emperor's new clothes. I always wondered how it was supposed to work when
so many documents are either dynamically constructed, or in a constant
state of revision. I tend to put IDs on all the things I think people might
want to point at, but that's pretty one-sided too. A combination of regexp
and proximity and element-sensitive searching would help:

id(pubs)foreign(findme beer near pretzel within element ITEM)
