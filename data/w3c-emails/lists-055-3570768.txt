Nothing wrong with tree walking by number if you're pointing into
a stable text (a testament), or you really want to know what
chapter four is right now.  "Stuff on the Web" can be anything,
and will become more diverse.

Emperor's new clothes. I always wondered how it was supposed to work when
so many documents are either dynamically constructed, or in a constant
state of revision. I tend to put IDs on all the things I think people might
want to point at, but that's pretty one-sided too. A combination of regexp
and proximity and element-sensitive searching would help:

id(pubs)foreign(findme beer near pretzel within element ITEM)
