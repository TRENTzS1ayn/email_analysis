from the WEBster online magazine, 15 april 1997:


>XML
><http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/WD-xml.html>
>  Those looking for a "smarter" authoring language than HTML need to take a
>look at the recently released spec for XML (Extensible Markup Language).
>A hot topic at WWW6 earlier this month in Santa Clara, Calif., XML offers
>far more presentation flexibility and connectivity options than its cousin,
>HTML, without being as structured and difficult as its parent, SGML
>(standard generalized markup language). Intended to free authors of many of
>the limitations of HTML and provide a markup language able to function in a
>multi-viewer device environment, XML is a must learn for any serious web
>author/developer.
