Unfortunately Jon, it does not work with Statutes of the Realm, as work
currently in progress to describe the Statutes in terms of XML has proved.
The problem is that certain articles, etc, tend to get repealed, amended or
extended. When they do you get gaps in the legislation. Looking for Para 4.
of Section (51), subsection (c) using something like (51 section)(3
subsection)(4 para) won't work. Repealing of sections, or addition of new
sections, will probably require you to enter an unintuative request such as
(48 section)(2 subsection)(5 para).Not easy to explain to editors!
