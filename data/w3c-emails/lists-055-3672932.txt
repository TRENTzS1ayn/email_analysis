| Unfortunately Jon, it does not work with Statutes of the Realm, as work
| currently in progress to describe the Statutes in terms of XML has proved.

The Statutes of the Realm that I was referring to are the Acts
themselves, published in two standard editions around 1760, if I
remember correctly.
