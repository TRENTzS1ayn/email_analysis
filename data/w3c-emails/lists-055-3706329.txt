No, but you have stated too simple a version of the problem.  Assume
instead that you have 5,000 links to spans in one target document,
intermixed in logical order of presentation with 5,000 links to
300 other documents.

I haven't checked to see that this actually will work, and don't understand
all of the syntax, but just on the issue of entities, it sounds like by far 
the easiest solution to the problem as I restated it.  6 chars per locator 
is trivial, and I don't see what's obnoxious.

Above all, though, let's stop supporting positions by appeal to what
will be most common.  This cannot be known before XML is deployed,
and it should not be a consideration in writing the spec, unless a
full scenarios document is developed.
