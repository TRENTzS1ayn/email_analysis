JIS plans to finish the development of the additional character sets 
in 1998, but I don't think these sets will be incorporated into ISO10646 within 1998.  However, JIS characters sets are not the only thing in the 
Unicode agenda.  I heard that non-BMP characters will be introduced
this year.

I agree that XML 1.0 should limit itself to ISO 10646 + AM5.  Whenever 
Unicode and ISO10646 are synchronously revised, we should probably 
revise XML as well (XML 1.0.1, 1.0.2, ....).

JIS plans to distribute fonts for the two characters sets.  One of the 
two can be easily used within the SJIS framework.  So, there is a good 
possibility that the character set will be widely used on top of Windows machines.
