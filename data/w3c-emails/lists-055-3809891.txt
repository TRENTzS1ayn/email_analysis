A small number of items in the XML rely upon changes to be made in the
8879 SGML standard, reportedly in a technical corrigendum. I'm supposing
that these proposals are to be discussed at the upcoming WG8 meeting in
Barcelona. Would anyone care to comment on the status of these changes,
who will be championing them in Barcelona, and the likelihood of their
being accepted? (And, can we write our congressman to throw our support
behind the changes?)
