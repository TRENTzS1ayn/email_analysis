Please rephrase your questions in formal language.  Documents don't
attain anything, applications don't hope.

|  "An XML processor which encounters a violation of the constraints
|   of well-formedness must not thereafter pass any information about
|   text or markup to the application.  It must pass to the application
|   a notification of the first such violation encountered.  It MAY 
|   thereafter, at user option, pass to the application information
|   about well-formedness violations encountered after the first."

Oh come on.  That would make it be a violation of conformance to output 
information about invalid portions of the instance aside from its
initial fault, including indexing of what text they contain (malformed
or not) and further malformations.  Real world demands will require
that processors not be so dainty.

Who's going to play cop?  And if this were useful, wouldn't it be 
useful only if all parsers encountered the same error first?

If, as the (deleted) prologue to this question implied, you're 
simply trying to avoid anyone making any effort at error recovery,
please give up now, immediately.
