I do not think this is so. I think it is hugely important to say "this is
not well formed"
but overly spartan to then say "so fix it and try again!".

I use nsgmls's ability to fore on in the face of adversity almost daily in
app. development.
 
Ever program in PL/1? You could throw pretty much anything at a PL/1 compiler
and it would just plough through it making assumptions were necessary and
generate an EXE. There are times when this is fine. The original 
K&R C was somewhat similar in that the core compiler generated an EXE if it
could and tools like LINT were provided for checking the assumptions the
compiler
would have made. Perhaps the classic example is

if (a=b) { do this stuff}

My point is that there are times when getting a result even with
errors/warnings present 
is useful - as long as you are told about the errors/warnings. For example in 
prototyping a style-sheet you  could be working with slightly iffy XML docs
but not
be concerned at that point. Equally there will be XML aware tools such as 
greppers, word counters etc.  that can function in the presence of error.
