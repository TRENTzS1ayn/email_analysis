Does that not depend on the robot? I mean, if I want a robot to trawl the
net for
documents older than 1 year with < 1000 bytes containing the 
phrase "love poem" the robot does not need to concern itself with WF.

I  dunno. People seem to want software that guesses. See my previous post re
graphing spreadsheet data!

Machines that do this sort of stuff should reject non WF docs. This is fine.
The problem
I see is if this is mandated in the XML spec. I cannot see how this can be
enforced
anyway. No-one can stop my Perl scripts from forging on despite WF errors!

I can see a lot of sense in mandating that assumptions made by user agents
 should be available to users however.

Again I think it depends on the task the machine is performing.

Not at all. Like you I probably would not have got my head around SGML if it
were not
for James' tools. I was simply making the point that the likes of

    nsgmls foo.sgm | grep -c "^(BAR$"

can be a useful thing to do even if foo.sgm markup contains errors.
