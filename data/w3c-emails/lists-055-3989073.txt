The big M is in the process of going around to a number of large businesses
and investigating what those busisnesses see as requirements for the "next
generation" of borwsers in order to better support intranets.  I was not
part of any of these mtgs, but I did have an interesting talk with someone
who did attend one.  XML appears to be a hot topic for Microsoft.  I am
guessing that they see that as a way to move in on some of Netscape's
earlietr groundwork.  The question of DSSSL vs CSS was asked, and they are
planning on working with CSS as much as possible (which makes sense, from
their point of view.  CSS is *much* easier to impliment than DSSSL)  But
they are dedicated to suporting XML, at least as a way of standardizing how
people extend HTML.

This may be why Microsoft is looking at XML.  It help define what is
"correct" HTML and thus Microsoft can warn you about incorrect and tell you
that it may not display properly. (but it is not their fault... )  Joe and
Jill Homepage are not the focus of the more extended plans for
InternetExporer.  Intranets are.  the money is in big business, and that is
where Microsoft is aiming.  (Not that they will completely ignore Joe and
Jill.  But microsoft software has never been know as the most reliable...)

It is (usually) trivial to notice if the HTML browser recovered from your
errors and displayed your page properly.  It is much more difficult to tell
if the compiler recovered properly.  (I speak with the experience of
debuging programs where the compiler did not work properly.  You don't what
to have to deal with that...)
