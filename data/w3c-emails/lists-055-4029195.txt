But the whole point of Tim's suggestion is that the user _wouldn't_ get
a recoverable portion after the first error.

That's one problem. The other is that failing to utilize the facilities
available leads to atrophy. We've already seen the direction things have
taken which could have been rather different if HTML had been implemented
in full (see what I said at SGML'95). If we have a wonderful XML Spec 
which no browser implements all that much of, it ain't gonna fly.
