The point I was making was that XML-link as defined prior to April 6th was a
good fit for what a group of users wanted - once you killed locsrc it was no
longer suitable and we had to go to HyTime.

Because there is no way of distinguishing between calls to external entities
that must be recalled to make sense of the document, and those that are
"nice to have". How do I know which general entities contain the URLs of
documents that I must recall? How do I even know they contain a URL that
might be significant. (We can't lextype the contents of the entity
replacement string to force it to be a URL!)

The problem is how do you automatically generate a BOS on the fly. I could
see how to do this with locsrc - I can no longer see how to do it.
