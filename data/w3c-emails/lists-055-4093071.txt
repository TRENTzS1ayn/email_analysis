This is like the user who called me (and probably 1,000 other help desks)
to say all his files had vanished from his new LINUX system. "What did
you do?" -- "I typed cd \;/bin/rm -rf * & because a friend told me it was
a useful command to know". Grrrr.

This is like the user who called me (and probably 1,000 other help desks)
to ask why his HTML colors were different from his friend's. He had typed
COLOR="#CZCZCZ" instead of C2C2C2. 

Where do we draw the line between being tolerant of small slippages, and
distorting the language for the benefit of the careless or foolish who
don't bother to equip themselves properly before they start (ie RTFM)?

Arena has this little red widget that lights up when it hits HTML it
doesn't grok (not always invalid). I doubt M or N would do this, but 
perhaps someone else would.
