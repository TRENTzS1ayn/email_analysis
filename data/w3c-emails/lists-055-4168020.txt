If the parts are so uncontraversial, there should be no reason to not
have a basic draft for Barcelona. Charles seems to have done all the 
legwork. If there are things that are contraversial, then they should
belong to the general 8879 "review" system until they are popularly
acknowledged
as needed.

Jon, as far as you can see now, there are no things in XML-link or the
XML-stylesheet proposals that may alter any TC requirements?

The TC mechanism may be suited for day-to-day SGML improvements that
are needed to bring it into line with current practise or needs or
to align with other standards, as far as I see. XML is clearly, even 
as we speak, an example of current practise.  

In other words, I think TCs should be short and highly targetted, and
reflecting actual user needs, not because of kitchen-sink-ism. And I
think SGML should keep in complete sync with XML. So I prefer a TC
sooner
rather than later, and simpler rather than 'complete'.
