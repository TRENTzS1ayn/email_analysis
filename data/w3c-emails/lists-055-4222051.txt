I disagree that XML processor stops passing any text information about text or markup
to the application after first violation.  There may be lot of applications that may require
data after that.

The solution can be that after the first violation is encountered, notify application and then
DON'T send any data until the </endtag> of the <tag> in which violation occured.  Start
sending the data again after </endtag>

For example:

<startdocument>
        [ 1. some other correct tags / informations ]

      <starterrortag>
            [2. >>> violation occured in this tag.]
      </enderrortag>

       [ 3. some more information ]
 
</enddocument>

1 and 3 information is sent but information 2 is sent only if required by the application.
(by default the information 2 can be skipped.)
