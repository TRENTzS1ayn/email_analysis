I think it is. The conditions around "loose parse" will create
the defacto definition of well formed and this will vary from app to app
and then we will have no meaningful way to instruct authors how to make
their content work.

While I can see a more adaptive specification than proposed, I can not
see making multiple levels of conformance.
