That's actually not true. Lots of our customers come to us *because* 
we give them correct HTML. Those people who have applications where 
having the wrong data is serious come to us and use our editor. I am 
not expecting Joe HomePage to use XML; I think he is well served by 
HTML and has no need for something else. Obviously this doesn't cover 
everyone, and we do get complaints about how strict we are, but 
several customers have praised us for that same thing.

And yes, we have told customers that we do it the way the spec says, 
and mostly they accept that.
