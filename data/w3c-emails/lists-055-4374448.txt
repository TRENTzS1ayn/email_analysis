Jon, you missed using catalogs as one way of associating a
set of stylesheets with the XML instance.

I would prefer using catalogs, with one stylesheet being the
"default" (named in the catalog), which could then specify
additional qualified style bindings as needed.

I doubt that we will, in actual fact, be able to define a single
mechanism though...
