I'd add:

        3. At user option, an XML parser may pass the remaining text
        of the document (markup plus content) to the application (or
        to the user if the parser is standalone) prefixed by a signal
        or message to the effect that it is unparsed.

This gives apps the option of letting a user turn on the switch marked
"Show me full text even if there are errors". The app can then conduct
its own interpretation of the remaining text.
