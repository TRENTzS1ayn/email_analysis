Are you really still prohibiting the *parser* from attempting to make
what sense it can from the "remaining text"?  Sounds like that means
each application that wanted to do what it could would have to have
a built-in error-correcting parser, and the "real" parser and the
application would have to pass the material up to the first error
(which has been already parsed and is not part of the "remaining text"
as defined).
