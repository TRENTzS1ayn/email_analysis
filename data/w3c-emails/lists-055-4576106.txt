I'm not saying that we should support every kind of print-oriented construct
in XML stylesheets.  My customers don't expect this and the legal and
compliance industries do not expect this either.  They realize that in
electronic delivery things are going to have to change.  Unfortunately, they
are still bound by laws that are directed towards print concepts (like
last page bottom margins for recording spaces).

What I want is the ability to work within these laws in XML a deliver an
acceptable solution.  ...and there are many *big* organizations who would
be very happy.

Essentially, we need to support a "happy medium" between print and
on-line that will allow developers to deliver legal compliance documents.
