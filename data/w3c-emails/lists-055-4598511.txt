A pure "parser" is *never* used alone.  So to say that the "parser" may
not do a certain something with incoming data, but may pass that raw data
on to the (coupled) application, which is permitted to do something that
is more easily done in that portion of the system called the parser, is
specious.  We should not be dictating the internal makeup of a system.
(As foolish as dictating the internal representation of characters within
a system....)

It's quite reasonable to say that an XML parser *must* provide
an error message saying the incoming data is flawed, not (correct) XML.
And even that the XML "system" *must* pass that error message to the
user.  My objection is to words and phrases that seem to say "and the
parser must not do anything else with erroneous data".

I certainly agree that we should not say that an XML parser *must*
do more than present an error message when presented with flawed data.
That's different.
