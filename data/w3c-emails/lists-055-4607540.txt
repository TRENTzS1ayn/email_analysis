I like the way it is handled now. However, I would be interested
in the way you would describe Production 45 in EBNF then. You are not
very specific about the alternative way you suggest.

I can see your point, from the perspective of a DTD designer. However,
we should try to keep things as simple as possible. (Maybe) XML
will require a slightly different approach to DTD design anyway.
