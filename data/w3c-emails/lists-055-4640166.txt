I've taught in a School of Library and Information Science, but I hardly
think it qualiries me as having librarian experience. However, I can tell
you that a lot of attention in classifying/cataloging these days is on
metadata rather than on classification schemes like Dewey or LC.

Some of you may ave seen a notice of a metadata workshop
(http://www.lbl.gov/~olken/EPA/Workshop/call.html); there's also a metadata
coalition (supposedly at www.metadata.org, but the net's not showing DNS
response on that right now).

I know that in the U.S. Department of Energy we have decided to use SGML
for metadata on weapons records (sorry, closed servers, so I can't give you
the URLs). There's a DOE-wide DTD that's pretty generic, and I'm writing
one that's much more fine-grained for Oak RIdge. I'll be glad to discuss
the topic off-line, then filter stuff back into the XML group at some
point. I will say that DOE would like to make our DTDs work with XML if
possible.
