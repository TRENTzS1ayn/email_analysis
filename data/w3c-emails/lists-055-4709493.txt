I'm going to be running two half-day workshops on XML over the next couple of months. The first will be at the Australian World Wide Web Technical Conference in a couple of weeks and the second will be at AusWeb97 in early July.

I'd like to benefit from the experience of those who have already been involved in running similar workshops. What advice can you give?

Thanks

James
