On further reflection, I would support lexical errors causing sudden death
*if* the XML-link language were smart enough to be able to request
the rest of a document after a lexical error.  That would allow some
resynching. Is it?  

Consider the following fragment:

<layer>
<p id="p1" lang="en">
  A < B   <!--* an error *-->
</p> 
<p id="p2" lang="th">
  A &lt; B
</p>
</layer>

Is XML-link currently defined in such a way that if we died at the error in
"p1",
we could still  then request "p2" et seq.?    Maybe this just
bifurcates the whole lexical thing into XML being strict for applications &
data but robust for
navigation & linking.
