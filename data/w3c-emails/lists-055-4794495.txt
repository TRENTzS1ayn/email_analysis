Michael,

I've been trying to follow this thread, and it brings up a simple
question: if error handling/recovery is entirely up to a vendor, what's 
stopping someone from making some minor changes to an existing HTML
browser and calling it an XML browser?

Requiring conforming processors to notify applications, and requiring
conforming applications to notify their users seems hardly draconian.
After notification, I think you are correct: it is then up to the developer
to decide what is appropriate in the specific XML application. But the
notification must be mandatory, otherwise we're back to the Web's current
broken error handling behaviour.
