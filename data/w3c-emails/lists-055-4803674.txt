At the risk of being simplistic here are my views (as a small fry implementor)

Q1: Must an XML parser report the first error it encounters?
Yes.

Q2: Must an XML parser stop providing data after an error?
No.

Q3: Can an XML parser stop dead at the first error if it so chooses.
Yes.

Q4. Can an XML parser continue after an error without informing the
application of the error?
No.
