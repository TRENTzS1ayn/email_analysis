Q2a: Is it important to have interoperability defined for documents
that have errors?

Q2b: If so, how do we prevent implementation/market-share wars 
over emulating error behavior such that XML will not effectively 
become rewritten by the leading implementations?

A2a: the argument seems to be, don't worry. Since most if not all XML
documents will be machine generated they will all be well formed.
I don't buy it! Programmers are human to and make as many errors
as prose authors.

A2b: ???
