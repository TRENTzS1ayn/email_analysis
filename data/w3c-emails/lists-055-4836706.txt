On error handling in XML...

The SoftQuad SGML parser has multiple levels of strictness; at the
least strict, it can attempt to continue after certain kinds of error.

When you use the Author/Editor Validate option, strictness is (obviously)
enabled.  When you open an SGML file, it's less strict.

In the same way, I can envision an XML parser having two or more levels of
strictness:
(1) completely strict
(2) error recovery, try to soldier on wherever possible
(3) no error recovery at all, goes wrong randomly

I don't see this as a problem.  Let's stop arguing over it and
allow an XML application to take either route.

Clearly a Validating XML Parser must support option (1), including full
support for a DTD.  Otherwise, (2) is generally the most useful if you
have no control over the documents (e.g. got them over the web and just want
to read them) and (3) is easiest to write in Perl.

So allow them all.
