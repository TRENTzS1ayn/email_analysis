No. It is important to have a universal definition of what is an error. I
think it's also important, as Michael and others have noted, that there is
a mandatory notification of syntactically malformed documents. I think even
a little red flag in the browser window would suffice to make authors check
-- because they know that it looks like they are careless if the flag shows
up...

1. Reprogram the brains of the entire industry.
2. make sure the vendors must explain that they are interpreting
_erroneous_ documents. It's a feature, but a very different feature from
the current situation in HTML -- where the definition is essentially
irrelevant for practical work.

Sure, and the programmers, like the authors, will have to fix their
incorrect output, to remove error displays from browsers and other
processors.
