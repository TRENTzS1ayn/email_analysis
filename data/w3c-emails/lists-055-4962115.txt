"Ease of use" or "ease of implementation"?  "The customer" usually wants
what he considers "easy to use", whether it's a good idea or not.

When you argue for "ease of use" of XML, remember that the document creator
as well as the document reader is a "user" of XML.  OMITTAG (which is
essentially an error-recovery mechanism embodied in SGML to the point
where if you can use it to recover, the trigger is not considered an
error after all) was, I believe, introduced for "ease of use for hand-coders".
Are you asking for something like that?  It sounds like you're arguing the
other way.  Which may be a good idea, but the user might argue that it's
not making XML easier to use.
