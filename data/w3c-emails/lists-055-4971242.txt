I guess I mean that it's not only easy for application developers to implement
XML but also for document creators to produce well-formed XML, even when they
are coding by hand. It just isn't that hard.

Earlier, Paul Prescod argued that the goal with XML should be correct
documents, and I think that's right. And Tim's compelling point is that XML's
well-formedness characteristics are easy to achieve.

I'm not asking for anything like OMITTAG. You're right; I'm arguing the other
way. OMITTAG makes sense in a setting where validation is a constant concern,
but in XML validation is optional, and something like OMITTAG could be
problematic without a DTD's context in which to interpret markup. If in XML
you have neither a DTD nor reliable standards for well-formedness, you don't
have much.

I doubt that XML will lose much of its constituency if XML hand coders are
required to enter closing tags. I think those customers will rely on parsers,
"lint"-type tools or strength of character to insure well-formedness. If XML
proliferates as much in the next 18 months as some people predict, there will
be desirable markets for robust XML authoring tools. The other "ease of
use"-seeking customers will probably not be unserved. Look at what GRIF has
done already with their XML+CSS tool. It's just the beginning.
