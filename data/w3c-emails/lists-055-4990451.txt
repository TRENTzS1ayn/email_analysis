I don't think anyone is advocating tolerance for gross error, as we've all 
seen what that has done with HTML. I think some of us are simply trying to 
leave *exactly* what happens up to the vendors. Some sort of error 
notification is essential, but in certain applications the method of error
"recovery" may require sending the XML source on through, others sudden
death makes sense.

In a financial application, it may be that the actual user does not receive
the error message; it's sent on to central office where they send an error
message to the ATM. And "sudden death" seems to indicate that the central
office wouldn't receive the contents of the broken file even while the 
customer shouldn't. Point is, the wide variety of XML applications (some
with UI, some without) makes specific requirements on error handling more
a limiting factor in the specification than seems necessary.

Error notification is a "must", but *how* it is done is application-specific.
Error recovery is a "maybe", depending on the application.
