This is dumb on the face of it.  No programmer or application 
designer will do it.   The XML language designers should stick 
to the error recovery techniques they can reasonably and 
technically define and enforce; otherwise, they have just introduced 
the first *tear off here* seam into the specification.

Applications define error handling.  To that extent to which 
an XML parser is an application parser, define standard error 
recovery.  OTW, be silent and let the mission determine the means.

Draconian?  DTDless and still silly.
