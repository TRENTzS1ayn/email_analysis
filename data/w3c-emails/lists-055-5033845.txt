Some character string representations can only be read from left
to right to determine the boundaries of the characters within the
bit/byte string.  Isn't shift-JIS one such?  I know of one proprietary
composition system with a large character set that uses such a
representation internally.  So first you'd have to "parse"/"lexically
analyse"/whatever your bit stream into characters left to right and
convert them into a representation that could be read from either
direction.  *Then* you could try XML-parsing from right to left.
