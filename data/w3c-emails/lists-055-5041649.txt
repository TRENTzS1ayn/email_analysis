To: W3C SGML Working Group<w3c-sgml-wg@w3.org>

The ERB has somewhat recovered from the run-up to the W6 conference and
has been considering its future work items.  Meeting today, April 30,
the ERB decided to approach decision-making in the following order:

1. Error handling
2. Stylesheet linkage (simple and full-function modes)
3. Unfinished work on XML-link

Once this has been finished (shouldn't take too long) we will consider
in what order we should attack the near-infinite number of items on
the input stack.  One obvious candidate is the original phase 3
work item, the specification of a stylesheet facility suitable for
delivery SGML over the Web.

There are also a large number of new work items, all of them clearly of
real importance, that would reward consideration.  These include:
 - strong data typing
 - data declaration facilities beyond the DTD
 - linkage to behaviors

In related news, we also agreed to aim for new XML-lang and XML-link
drafts by July 1.

Cheers, Tim Bray
