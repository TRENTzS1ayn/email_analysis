Andrew:

You might want to post a pure ASCII version of your doc to make it
easier to critique by mail.

To make the namespace mechanism more extensible, the href attribute of
the namespace PI should be able to point to an entity as well as a
URI.  It would also be very nice if you could declare a namespace as an
entity, and use the entity name as the prefix.  This would:
1)  allow namespaces to interact with Catalogs when they are
specified. 
2)  let those who gag at the use of PIs use namespaces with their
consciences clear.

eg., 

<!ENTITY zoo SYSTEM "http://zoo.org/schema.dtd">

or 

<!ENTITY zoo SYSTEM "zooSchema" -- eventually with catalogs -->

...
<zoo:animalFriends>
  <zoo:Bear>Christopher</zoo:Bear>
</zoo:animalFriends>

I don't think this changes anything fundamental, but is perhaps a
little more "orthodox."  The entity declarations could also be changed
to PIs when the document is transmitted somewhere.

It is interesting to note that without validation, this is all just
syntactic sugar and could be accomplished entirely with attributes,
however if we include validation, then GIs with different namespace
prefixes would have different content models, and namespaces would not
be just sugar.
