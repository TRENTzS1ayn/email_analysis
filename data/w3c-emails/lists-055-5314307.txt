I think we should look for some marketing spin in the naming. I am
not a marketing type and am distinctly unqualified to offer an opinion but
that never stopped me before:-)

I suggest we call it "Hyper-X" being the short name for "Hyper-XML" being
the short name for "Hypertext enhanced eXtensible Markup Language"
