Is this something like the HyTime claim that it is not limited to SGML?

It is rather more plausible, I think, as the mapping of XML architectural
forms to SGML architectural forms is pretty obvious. But Hyper-XML is
a good name. I'd leave the prose pointing out that the architectural
forms will work with SGML, but not let that affect the choice of name.
