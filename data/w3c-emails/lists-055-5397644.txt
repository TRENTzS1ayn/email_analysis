If the majority of XML applications are targeted at delivery over the
Internet, then this sounds kinda redundant. Call me a troll, but I still
like Jon's idea of a suite of specs around the "XML-" prefix. At least this
way the public can immediately see the relationships between the parts, and
XML remains the primary focus.

Well, part of product marketing is checking out the existing trademarks,
although I've always thought 'do diligence' a silly term. Note that Hyper-X
is already in use, although I wouldn't want to guess who owns the
trademark:

   a) "Hyper-X, Hypertextual Consciousness" by Mark Amerika (!).
   b) "Hyper-X for SCO UnixWare 2" -Novell
   c) NASA Langley's "Hyper-X High Speed Research Vehicle Production"
   d) "Hyper-X -- the department of Alt-X concerned with hypertext/hypermedia"
   e) Quarterdeck's [defunct?] "X11 Server Software for the PC"
and many more...

whew.

That may be true and even a pleasant side effect, but hardly necessary to
consider for the task at hand, which is to provide hypertext links for XML.
