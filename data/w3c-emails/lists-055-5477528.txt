So an XML-LINK pointer is what HTML calles a Reference, I think.
E.g. HREF = Hypertext Reference.

And pointers don't point to anything, but contain addresses that point
to things.
And the things pointed to are railway stations.

OK...

I think HTML has clearer terminology here, at least to me.
An anchor contains (has) a reference to a resource.
That resource is "a point in cyberspace" and otherwise opaque.
It's also easy to understand.

I'm not asking for XML to be simpler than HTML, but I *am* asking for
it to be described as simply.
