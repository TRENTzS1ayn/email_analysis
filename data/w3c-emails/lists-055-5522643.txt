Your points 2 to 4 apply equally to system identifiers and were considered
when deciding whether to restrict system identifiers to URLs.  They don't
provide any justification for treating the RHS of a catalog entry
differently from a system identifier.

As for 1, I don't think the issue of how URNs are going to fit into the XML
framework has been decided. Adding SGML public identifiers and catalogs to
XML complicates this significantly.  Before we add public identifiers to
XML, I think we need to have a clear picture of how URLs, URNs, FPIs,
non-formal public identifiers, system identifiers and catalogs all fit
together.  I'm still unclear.
