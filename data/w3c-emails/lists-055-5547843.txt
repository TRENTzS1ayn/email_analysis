I also had much trouble with these terms. 

I believe that what is called here "in-line" and  in HyTime "contextual" are
links that share a number of characteristics:
1. located at the (start) link end
2. uni-directional
3. hardwired 

Choosing 1. -- co-location -- as the basis for naming is confusing for the
reason James cites and also obscures the other characteristics which
identify this type of link. I can't think of a single name that will evoke
all three characteristics and I agree that "simple", "normal" or "basic",
which require definition, are an improvement on "in-line". 

"Out-of-line" sounds like scolding and emphasizes the location of the link
look-up table, which is much less relevant than the fact that there is a
look-up of some sort. 

"Simple" and "independent" are somewhat descriptive and are explainable.

Is there a reason why we can't just call these "direct" and "indirect" links? 

This also keys on just one of the three characteristics of this type of
link, but if 

1. a direct link is always located at its start link end
2. a direct link is always uni-directional
3. a direct link is by definition hardwired

then, I think we should call it a direct link because unlike co-lation or
uni-directionality, it does imply the other two characteristics. 

There may be some very obvious reasons that "direct" and "indirect" are
non-starters, but they sure would speak well to both technical and
non-technical audiences.
