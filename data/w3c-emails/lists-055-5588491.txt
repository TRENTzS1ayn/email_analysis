There can be a lookup in either case.

Yes.  Basic may be better. Simple makes people think it isn't powerful.

Yes.  A clink can point to a location ladder.  Direct and indirect are 
not actually descriptive of functionality.  Inline and out-of-line 
are just descriptive of storage location.  Neither has much descriptive 
power.  Context and independent don't have very much, but they are in
current use and used correctly.  They are also standard.  The XML 
specification is just a set of recommendations that COULD be
standardized.
It will be simpler to achieve this later process if standard terms 
are used.  Durand argues against 'de novo' terms, but for a pre-standard 
practice, all terms are de novo.  Better to use the standard.

Define "hardwired".  Is the <a href="somefunction here"> being generated 
by a server side script "hardwired"?

Call them George if you like.  The average user tries them once, and
then 
uses that "experience" to identify functionality.  Stick with the
standard 
terms already in use in the larger SGML community.  What is being 
suggested now is guaranteed to perpetuate confusion and even more 
factionalization.
