1.4.h Does "explainer" make anyone else uncomfortable?

I added this question, at risk of bringing up something on which there is
already concensus, because I can find no reason not to call a caption a
"caption". 

This is a link caption so call it a "link caption" or if there are reasons
not to use caption, then some of the other common words already used to
describe what it does: "link title" or "link subtitle" 

"Explainer" is in the dictionary, but it sounds weird.
