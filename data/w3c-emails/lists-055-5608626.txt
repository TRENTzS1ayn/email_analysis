Following on the use of two words to denote association and avoid ambiguity,
and, to avoid introducing extraneous, linguistically-unrelated terms, I
would call this the "pointer address" or "pointer value". Of course, it
could also be the "point". 

If there is a reason that it must be one word or that it must be a form of
locat*, I vote for "location" over "locator".
