"Explainer" sounds fine to me.  Both "caption" and "description" seem
to imply a function in too narrow a way: this thing is not necessarily
going to be displayed as some sort of caption (to me this sounds like
it has to go right under a big arrow), and a "description" makes it
sound more like some kind of documentation rather than part of a
function or interface.
