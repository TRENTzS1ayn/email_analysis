But that is a common usage of it.

which is the most common usage of it.

This points out the problems of the name game:

o  Implies the functionality

o  Is in concert with common practice

o  Satisfies an abstract set of rules for naming

I think there will be no argument or choice that satisfies all 
conditions in all cases.  This is why I think it preferable 
to use HyTime names where possible.  In this coin toss,
the coin should be weighted to the side of the standard.
That is easy to explain(er)/describe/capture.
