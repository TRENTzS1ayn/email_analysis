I really have no problem at all with your accurate statement of the need
for a resolution mechanism. But I must ask the question 'What is XML
_for_?' in the same way you do, as we aren't trying to solve all the
world's problems here, simply come up with a simplified subset of SGML
called XML. There are a lot of thorny problems that XML may force to a
head, but within the XML specification(s) I don't believe it appropriate to
try to force resolution of this issue or of entity resolution in general.

I do agree that the market will solve this (hopefully soon), as the need is
obviously there. And it may be an XML application that points the way. This
isn't a matter of passing the buck; it's simply outside the mandate for
XML.
