See the list activity page, http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/SGML/Activity.
We're trying to make a subset of SGML that's especially suitable for use
on the Internet.

Yes, entity resolution _is_ needed, and yes, I do believe it's in scope.
The market won't solve it.  Individual companies will solve it in
incompatible ways.

I believe it is firmly within our mandate.  What good is SGML on the Internet
if the spec doesn't say how you use it on the Internet??

Jon, you there?  What do you think?

I don't care if non-Internet uses of XML don't have to include any way
of doing http (for example) -- I do care if two http-based XML systems
can't share the same files because they have incompatible rules for looking
up FPIs and mapping to SYSTEM IDs.
