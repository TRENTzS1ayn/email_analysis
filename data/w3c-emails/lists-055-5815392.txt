Well, I dare say it is a bigger community, but in either case, 
it is standard, descriptive, and most of the suggestions 
so far wander off in the weeds for some reason.  I say use 
the standard and be done with it.  Why not?  This one 
will be really hard to explain away later.
 
Anyway, great fun, but this is a loss.  Have at.
