[... suggestion for XML catalogs ...]

I support the _idea_ of this proposal, because it gives an impetus to 
creating a managed namespace.  Sometimes such namespaces can be cheap
to create and it simply needs some-body to make a proposal which is
sufficiently convincing, and suffiently simple to implement that everyone
sees the value and adopts it.  (IMO MIME has some of these features though
it also has design flaws.)

At present the most obvious namespace management available to everyone
is DNS.  (For example, in 'Java in a Nutshell', p 19, O'Reilly show how
it can be used to provide a unique namespace for any Java package, e.g:
COM.ora.writers.david.widgets.Barchart;
(The first two components are the domain name in reverse order).

I am not familiar with the URN process in detail - am I right in assuming
that it based on DNS?

Jon, could you expand on this word, please?  If it means 'Those large 
corporations whose business is publishing information and who are prepared
to pay for a maintained site (xmlid.net) to be set up'.  If this is the 
case then it will lead either to a fragmentation of the community, or to 
a proliferation of 'xmlid.net's (e.g. 'xmlid.net.ac.uk', 'xmlid.bio.net')

This server is going to have to be funded somehow, with a registration process
and removal of dead entries.  Will it, in itself, be able to scale to 
respond to demand or will there be a DNS-like system of servers?

It seems to involve a mapping of organisations onto domain names.  For
example SUN:: would map onto sun.com (right?).  Is SUN:: the only
component of SUN or are there also SUNSOFT, SUN_MICROSYSTEMS, etc.
It seems to me that it is necessary to have a feel for the stability
of organisation names before you can get an idea of the work involved.

If domain names are a useful approach, what about the use of
something like:
http://www.sun.com/xmlcatalog/

This says, in effect, if your site (or server) has implemented XML then
this is reserved request for the XML catalog that relates to XML
information on that site/server.  
It's unlikely to clash with existing namespace (apart from people who
used XML for something else :-).  Webmasters could easily implement it, 
and it should be fairly straightforward to update the local catalog.
