I second Jon on this issue.  Again, from watching the VRML experience, 
it was very rough sledding to master the complexities of 3D animation 
given only the specification.  I have been a reviewer for the 
annotated 2.0 version and was already proficient with the 1.0 
version.  It was still tough.  However, as soon (and even before) 
the actual specification was published, books were hitting the shelves 
that made it possible to master by example.  So, I think while 
XML will be straightforward for those who are SGML literate and 
understand hypermedia, for many, these concepts will require 
hands-on experience.  We can work as hard as we can to make 
it clear in the spec, but the spec should err on the side of 
being unambiguous particularly for implementors.  The *average user* 
(whoever that is) will master XML through the tools.

I live in a town full of them.  Don't hold your breath. ;-)
