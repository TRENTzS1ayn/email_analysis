I agree that reference implementations are good, Len.

I don't agree that they should be used in order to avoid standardizing
some things. If we can agree on an appropriate default resolution
mechanism, then we should just do so and put it in the spec.

On the other hand, if our resolution mechanism is so complex that there
is a chance that vendors would balk at implementing it, then that's where
a reference implementation would make sense. But maybe at that point,
we've already made a mistake in making the mechanism complex.
