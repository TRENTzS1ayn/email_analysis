After looking at the examples in the link proposals I find that I
cannot face the prospect of working for the next 10 or 20 years with
this.

We should get rid of the hyphen in front of XML in reserved names and
attributes.

"-XML" is ugly, it's hard to type, it looks dumb, and it doesn't
really pollute the name space any less than any other reserved string.
Reserve "XML" and be done with it.
