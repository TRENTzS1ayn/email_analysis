A slogan:

   "XML is HTML's big sister."

Another slogan:

   "XML is what I thought SGML was in the first place."

Another slogan:

   "XML gives Java something to do."

   Improved version by Tim Bray:

      "XML gives Java something to chew on."

An observation by Eve Maler:

   People have been writing XML all along:

      <PLUG> ... </PLUG>
      <FLAME> ... </FLAME>

I suggest the name "Natural XML" for such constructions.
