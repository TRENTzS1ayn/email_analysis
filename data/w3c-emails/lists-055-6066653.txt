Your proposal sounds okay to me, except for one thing:

1] if there is a processing instruction tht occurs before the DOCTYPE
    line of the form <?-XML-CATALOG "system-id"?> then that is the system
    identifier of the catalog and all other mechanisms are disregarded.

Why can't this be a relative URL?
