I was going to wait longer before announcing this, but as Alex has
broached the subject, I have a sketch of an SGML-and-MIME spec
up at

  http://www.wco.com/~books/draft.5feb97.txt

I'm sure my use of multipart/related is off, but the point of the
draft is to determine what comprises the totality of the information
needed to process an SGML document.  It is deliberately prolix
in syntax, and the DTDs are not serious.  As it is about SGML
and not XML, it is probably not suitable for this list, but some
might find it interesting.  I would be interested in hearing
off list about information types or sets I've ignored.

That is, I don't particularly want to read "you could do it better
this way" or "you don't need foo", at this stage.  I really do
want to read "you need bar, and it isn't in there."
