Exactly right.

not _exactly right_ (but close):

You don't need the distinction between participating and implicit as far as
I can tell. The only cases where implicit links have been proposed are
those where the link is participating.

So we have two axes of variation, and four link types

By the way, external, non-participating, 1-ended links are a way to handle
external tagging of static documents, and thus are not useless (even if
they are quite esoteric).

  Interestingly, in my 87.1 copy of Literary Machinces, Nelson proposes to
use this mechanism for Xanadu (which dates, but does not necessarily
recommend it).
