Nice. Do we need these enough to need to explain 3 distinctions instead of
two? You can keep the destination file explicit, without duplication by
using entities

   Personally I think implicit links to anything but the markup that
declares a link are completely evil, as everyone has to understand the
"implication" for them to be useful.

   Of course, if you're just funnin' me for having insufficient link-type
imagination, there's no reason to take this note seriously...
