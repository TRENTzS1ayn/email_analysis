They are different. Presentation is concerned with how people recognize that
there is behaviour associated with the text: do they prefer underlined text,
a different colour, an in-line icon, a marginal note. These things are
controllable through user preference, and are therefore overridable at
client side. Colour-blind users must be able to use icons, whereas text only
viewers must be able to replace icons by some textual indication of the
possibility of action.

Behaviour is not up to the user, it is up to the author. It is the
author/server that has to control what happens when the link is selected by
the user. Except in rare cases the user should not be able to change the
action that selecting a link causes.This is why you must separate
presentation from behaviour.

I like this terminology (except for the termini - how the hell do I present
Gard du Nord or Waterloo to users?)

This would be better called Link Action. Traversal is not something
non-rocket scientists understand. What most users understand by clicking on
a hotspot is that some action should take place. This is what the
behavioural side of the equation covers.
