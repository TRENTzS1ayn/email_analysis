I think Lee has made some very important points. A catalog
is basically a packing list, and if it doesn't exist, or you
can't find it, life get's difficult.

I wonder if the MIME-SGML work can't be put to good effect here?
The problem is basically the same, and Don Stinchfield's
proposal could be made protocol independent.
