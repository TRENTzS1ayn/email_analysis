Americans go to airport terminals.  Railways are not used 
nearly as much.

One American's opinion:  it looks pedantic.  We tend to steer 
away from such terminology as "high fallutin' BS".

OTH, the rate of change in American speech patterns since the 
invention of mass communications is very high.  I can't think 
of any cases off hand when adopting words from dead languages 
has been much in vogue.

XML - "we can invoke the behavior to link to the terminus"
American - "click here and bag that thing"
