Fine. This is roughyl equivalent to the 2 MIME-SGML solutions, where
one focused on the catalog as the meta-document, and the other
focused on MIME structures.

A meta-document is just a packing list, as is a catalog. Catalogs
should only be used to identify peices in a given document, not 
for the basis for name resolution.

We already have MIME and catalogs.

Sounds like MIME to me....

Sure, instead of pulling the catalog in after accessing the instance,
you pull in the instance after accessing the catalog.

Some people on this list know that I have little love for the SO
catalog syntax, but that seems sufficient to me.
