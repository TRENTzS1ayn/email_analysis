There may be cases where the user wants to know where the link goes, but
doesn't want to actually traverse the link, such as how Web browsers
display the desitination URL.

But in no case does clicking on a link take the user to a _different_
location than that intended by the author, and I believe this is the crux
of the issue. There are two behaviours here: link destination and browser
action. In no case should the browser alter the former.
