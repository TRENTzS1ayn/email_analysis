I'm not wild about any of these, but maybe, like Jon's original list, they
will give someone else a push in the right direction:

"XML: certified organic SGML"

"Faster than a SP'ding bullet, more powerful than an <H1> -- it's hypertext,
it's a database, it's XML!"

or some variation on:

"Link global, code local" [like "think global, act local"]
(actually, I kind of like that one -- or should it be: "Link globally, code
locally" -- I can't tell anymore.)

or, after Eve's nice phrase,

"XML: it's what you've been doing all along"
"XML: it's what you already know"
