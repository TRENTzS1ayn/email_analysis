I certainly qualify as a WH. If this WG includes about one hundred members,
how many are RS? As _many_ as five or ten? How many are capable of writing
SP?

But will that be a generalized, functional system? Entity management and
catalogs are (at least in my opinion) pretty foundational equipment, but of
course it's precisely this sort of demand that increases the complexity of
the final machine.

Will a full implementation of XML plus all of its final component
technologies (link, dsssl-o stylesheets, catalog support, etc.) require the
likes of James Clark to make a complete system? It's fine that the W3C SGML
Working Group Reference Implementation do the job, but if it's become
another SP then we have another SP: an absolutely phenomenal tool, but an
enormous hurdle for developers to create from scratch. If validation of XML
is as complicated as SGML, then what is the point of differentiating it
from SGML? IOW, if you need SP (or its XML complex equivalent) to validate
XML, then you might as well be using SGML tools.

Agreed. Rocket scientists build rockets. We have rocket scientists in this
group. While I'm certain that we could build a terrific rocket here, it's
not in our best interest to make it unintelligible to our target market,
particularly our target market of developers.
