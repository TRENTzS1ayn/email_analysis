This is one reason we suggested a SEMANTICS entry in SO catalog: you
could bring across the document, and also know the various semantic
processors that could be applied to it.

OK. I agree that SO catalogs would be somewhat stretched by this. I think
we might then go off and define the "packing list" and "meta-document"
seperately. For simple cases, SO catalogs would be good enough, and
for everything else, meta-documents.

Perhaps the WG shoudl produce a spec for both?
