If we want a tag line for XML, I'd suggest something like one of the following:

  XML: Extending the Web
  XML: The future of the Web
  XML: Enabling the Web
  XML: Objects for the Web
  XML: What you want it to be
  XML: What HTML was meant to be
  
The Web should be a central part of the message as should some indication that XML permits open extension to current Web pratice.
