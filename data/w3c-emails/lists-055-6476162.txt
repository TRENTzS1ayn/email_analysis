If we are going to go down this path, let's not call this "ball of stuff" a document. An object (WebObject) might be a better moniker since we should include behavior as well as appearance in the ball.

My personal preference would be to include references to behavior (code) and appearance (style sheets). Without that separation reuse is difficult and object management is seriously impaired.
