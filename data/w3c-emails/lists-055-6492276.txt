Like he said. Except I like target about as well as terminus, despite the
possibly greater directional connotation.

I don't think this is safe, since it invites confusion with HyTime
"linkend", which is a different thing entirely. I suppose there's always
"pointees". :)

This has some tradition behind it in hypermedia, in that InterMedia refers
to its pointees that way (sometimes also as anchors). It does bring the
useful intuition that most selections are contiguous, though cooler
applications allow discontiguous selections; and the way people typically
create links is by selecting something and then making a pointee out of it.
