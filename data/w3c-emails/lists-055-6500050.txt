It may or may not be a title.

I like explainer. Its purpose is to explain to the user why they might want
to follow this link (rather, this particular linkend of it). (See Landow
'87, for example). The explanation might be rendered in lots of ways:
subtitle, audio, icon choice, menu-item-name, etc.

The reason it's there in the first place is that it is quite standard
terminology in the hypermedia community (which is not to say we have to
follow it; I actually like caption almost as well).

I find 'title' about as presentation-specific as 'caption'. it makes me
think of big print at the beginning of something.
