In my opinion, no.  The meta-document is information about a *set* of
data--including XML documents.  To extent, it is instructions on what makes
up units of information and what to do with those units of information.

I think it is very important to distinguish between XML as a document and
meta-documents (sets of documents) described in XML.  Further, we must 
concede that XML is only *one* form that a document can be encoded in.

In some applications (existing applications), the SGML documents are *not*
useful to an end user unless they are augmented by other SGML documents,
SGML processors, and instructions for those users.  Rather than having
a "server-does-it-all" model, I would like to be able to deliver the 
"packing-list" of information as well as instructions to the client and let
the client take care of merging and transforming the information.

Except that I'm not talking about formatting only.  I'm talking about 
transformations, workflows, user interaction, down-loadable semantics, and
on, and on.

In one view, the meta-document is just a regular XML document that "starts"
an client-application specific processing model.

In another view, the meta-document is formal part of the XML infrastructure for
delivering client-application independent semantics.

I prefer the latter.
