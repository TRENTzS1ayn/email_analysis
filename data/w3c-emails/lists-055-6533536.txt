I think this is an excellent term and it certainly describes how I use XML
documents.  I don't know enough about objects to know whether we are taking
too simple view, as we have state and inheritance to consider.

I think this is a very useful distinction, which will also help when it comes
to considering style sheets.

If the term WebObject is acceptable for some or all XML documents then it
is a very useful way of reaching out to the wider community.  'Objects' and
'CORBA' are the current buzzwords although a lot of people naively think
that 'CORBA' will solve their problems.  It won't - they have to build
IDLs (Interface Definition Language) on top of it.  Again I may be 
simplistic, but for my problems I see DTDs as providing a large part of 
an IDL, so that by using XML you are making life much easier for object
interoperability.
