As far as I know, terminus has no association with railroads for most
Americans.  We call these things "train stations".  The word
"terminus" simply means an end point, if it means anything.  The
hilarity that "terminus" seems to engender in our Friends Across the
Sea is probably a good reason to use some other term.  ("Link end",
for example.)
