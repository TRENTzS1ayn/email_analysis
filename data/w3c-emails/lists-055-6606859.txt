I'm sorry. Color blind users should be able to see fromthe link type that
Kringle.class implements a "pop-up-list" instead of failing to see Green
text on a red background when they have equal brightness.

Similarly it may help a blind user to see a series of hierarchically
organized links instead of an animated display of shuffling cards.

Similarly, it may help a web-walker to see that two pages are connected by
a link rather than having to execute a java script in a "sandbox area" and
trap calls to AppletContext.showDocument().

We need to be able to specify behavior, but we need not be ruled by our
need to specify behavior.

I like "Link Action". It's a much less predjudicial term than traversal,
and it covers the same field beautifully, as well as many things beyond
that field, that traversal slights.
