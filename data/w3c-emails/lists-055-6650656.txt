Strange.  I can publish a print book, which binds together in
what everyone recognizes as a book font, size, kerning, paper
type, thumbtabs, page numbers, line numbers, verse numbers,
and footnote markers that cause the eyes of literate viewers
to flicker involuntarily to the bottom of the page (behavior).

Yet when I bind all this together (with the text) in a document,
somehow this becomes a metadocument.  If I reprinted the book
in another font, font size, etc., I'd have another book,
perhaps "The Large Type Document for Presbyopters," which 
I would call attention to as different from "The Document,"
although for some purposes it is "the same".

This group must eventually determine how to associate all the
information that comprises the "metadocument".  It must also
determine how to associate the parts of a "document".  Why
should these be separate tasks?  

And where is the description of the overall architecture?

Just as some would like to see SGML Link declaration information be separate
from "the document".  And others insist vociferously that it *must* be
part of "the document".  And others would like "the document" to be just
the SGML document element/instance.  What should and should not be part of
"the document" is a religious war.  :-(
