The "pre-SGML", if you will, concept of a document was simply
something that is printed.  SGML looks at a document as a
collection of potentially reusable information, which may
be reused in many ways besides republishing it on paper again
in a slightly different format.  "The document" is something
that can be published, searched, spoken (a very non-paper form
of publishing), indexed, etc., etc.  If, as you suggest, that
this something together with its publishing specifications is
a document but that with different publishing specifications
is a different document, then with its indexing specifications
it's yet another document, when published by speech synthesizer
it's yet another, etc., etc., etc.,...  Put all these things
together and you've got a metadocument, in many people's mind.

If the union of all of your related-by-having-the-same-content
documents is a metadocument in some people's mind, there are
others that would like in this brave new world to use "document"
to mean the intersection: the core structured data set.

...And those who draw the line somewhere in between.

Isn't English fun?
