Oh yes, a further point that arises in response to David's response:

David replied:

But note that historically by far and away the most common language
for defining large-A Applications is NATURAL language---English,
German, Japanese, whatever.  I expect somewhere someone has used, for
instance, Z to formally specify an SGML Application, but that's the
exception rather than the rule.  So (2) is really Not Our Problem.  As
for what aspects of (3) ARE our problem, see my reply to Jon on the
'There Are No Metadocuments' thread.
