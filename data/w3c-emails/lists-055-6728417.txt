If the running of this code is controlled by user interaction at the client
its appearance: if it is action that is forced on the application by
information from the server it is behaviour! (Author defined formatting is
currently being referred to as behaviour: user defined formatting is
currently being referred to as appearance. Both types are required - its the
point of control that defines whether it is a behaviour or not.)

The DSSSL style sheet as sent by the author is a behaviour. The version as
modified by the user, or the overrides issued by the user, is what
constitutes a change of appearance. The terms appearance and behaviour are
misleading, like addresses/locators/explainers.... They say what the result
is, not what you need to get there. What we need is something like local
control parameters and remote control parameters to distinguish where
control actually lies.
