It's just a matter of interpretation. Code is data is code.
Java bytecodes are nothing more than a processing specification 
until they are interpreted, and there are a number of ways *that*
can be done as well...

As soon as you start defining objects that have some behavioural
semantics associated with them, you also open up the possibility
of people interpreting the semantics.
