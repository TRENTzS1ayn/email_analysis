I don't deny this -- it's obviously one of the reasons we're all excited
about XML. But as has been pointed out in various messages, building
authoring tools that validate, that provide the level of link markup
complexity to support current proposals, that provide either CSS or DSSSL-O
support, these all may obtain a hefty development effort. I know simply
adding CSS support to the Stonehand HTML Viewer was not a trivial effort.
But I'm not worried about browsers -- they certainly seem trivial by
comparison to what is required by an authoring tool.

I suspect most authoring tools will do well-formedness checking but not
validation, and therefore some of the XML advantages over HTML may be lost.
In my head I'm trying to get a handle on an ideal balance between a simple
and fully-supported authoring tool, and what developing that would entail.
