For the kinds of purposes that SGML (and XML) propose to support -- i.e.
re-use they _are_ the same. That is why some of us are so vociferous about
separating processing from data content (and insistent as Len says, that we
have only a bag of (structured) values, behavior and rendering free).

Anytime we break that distinction, we make some form a reuse more difficult
or impossible (depending on how central to the document markup the
formatting decisions become).

Now, if these reuse issues are not appropriate in a WWW context, then we
should not be doing XML at all, but working on adding more kinds of
behavior tag to HTML so that it can finish its metamorhphosis into
"Postscript for the Web".

This is all baby SGML, folks. It's the _point of the whole thing_. So let's
finish it, but stop dragging over the same issues. I don't mind Postscript
for the web, but if that's our goal then we don't need generic tagging to
get there.

Who cares. If we want the rendering/processing independent part of the
document to retain those properties it must be separated from the
rendering/processing instructions. So we need a mechanism to "glue" them
together.
