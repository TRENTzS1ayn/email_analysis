True, but essentially false:

   Once the interpretation of the data is a turing-complete problem, the
possibility of _useful_ interpretation goes way, way down.

   Those unfortunates who stored data in hypercard scripts discovered that
the hard way -- of course they're fine for the ages --- If you happen to
have a hypercard interpreter in your pocket, along with a clone of the
MacOS.

This is why I mistrust jumping to code _too soon_. To push the interaction
envelope you need code, but you also lose reusability, because your
environment sneaks into your data... We definitely will need to attach code
to documents though.
