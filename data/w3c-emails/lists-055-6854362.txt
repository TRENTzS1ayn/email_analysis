Since PUBLIC is likely to be a point of user-tailorability, it should be
looked at first -- implementations that don't implement PUBLIC resolution
will simply ignore the PUBLIC, thus causing it to "fail". I can't think of
a case where someone who _has_ working public resolution, would prefer to
use the system ID -- andif they did, it seems they could always ensure that
any given public ID (or all) would fail to resolve.

Since the new proposal is different from 9401 couldn't we issue it as the
W3C's equivalent of an "experimental RFC". ie. well-defined, a potential
candidate for standardization, but requiring practical experience before
endorsement. That seems to describe DELEGATE to a T.

I would like this even more if it is possible for the base to look like this:

<?XML-BASE SYSTEM "http://www.foo.org/bar/">
<?XML-BASE PUBLIC "+//ISBN 9882-3::FOO//SGML bar stuff//EN"
                  "http://www.foo.org/bar/">

This would also allow things with PUBLIC IDs to announce their identifier
-- which would be a great virtue, I think.

I _think_ without having the proposal in front of me, that we can use %escape
to handle this, and that may be the right thing until SGML fixes the
Minimum literal restrictions.

That may be so, but I think it should go out there, and experience will
tell _if_ it will need any changes.
