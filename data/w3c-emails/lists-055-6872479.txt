Actually, that's the opposite situation in my experience:

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"
                          "http://www.cm.spyglass.com/dtd/html.dtd">

This announces to the world that the document conforms to HTML 2.0, but
tells the processor that a local copy of 'html.dtd' will provide the
resource without resorting to a PUBLIC catalog lookup. IOW, why bother
resolving the reference if the document seems to know where to look. Then,
if the SYSTEM fails, resort to the more generalized process of a catalog
lookup using PUBLIC.

I believe Panorama has the same behaviour.
