For  endpoint name I would prefer either endpoint role or endpoint type as
this describes the purpose of the name better. As I almost painted over
gloss why not use the key term it is defined under in Roget's Thesaurus -
commentary. (Alternatives suggest by Roget include legend, inscription,
notes and one that seems particularly apt for this discussion group,
adversaria!) Another alternative, more in line with your link description,
would be link descriptor (or should that be endpoint description?).
