Hmm, seems I was right - we do *not* have a consensus on this one.

The argument in favor of SYSTEM-first is that this is apt to
be quicker and cheaper (particularly if you assume that a PUBLIC id
usually generates a SYSTEM id).  

The argument in favor of PUBLIC is simpler; it has another level of
indirection, potentially some supporting catalog machinery; in fact,
can be considered to be in some sense of "higher value".

The argument in favor of saying nothing is that the right thing to do
is [existence proof in the debate here] not crystal-clear and may be
application-dependent.

Any new arguments? - Tim
