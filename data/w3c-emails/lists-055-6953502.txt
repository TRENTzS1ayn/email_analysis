I didn't mean to imply a behavior at all. What that DOCTYPE says is that
there are both SYSTEM and PUBLIC available, not which one is given
preference. I'm not advocating constraining UA behaviour. Your converse
statement:

is true iff the UA is set to prioritize SYSTEM over PUBLIC. Please note
that I was not stating that converse, I was replying to David's statement:

by trying to state that a general, simplistic rule is not possible.

Agreed. I'm in agreement with David's last summary on the subject:
