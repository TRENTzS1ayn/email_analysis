There seems to be no single, descriptive term that encompasses all the
qualities of each type of link so I suggest names that emphasize none of the
qualities (not, then, in-line or direct or independent). I think that
"simple link" and "complex link" would be good, but if shortened into slink
and clink, while they have a nice sound, would conflict with HyTime. 

Maybe "simple" or "basic" as James suggested coupled with "xlink" for the
sophisticated, complex types of linking now possible with XML. I think it
would be easy to present simple links as what you get now with HTML and XML
links as the future made possible by XML applications.
