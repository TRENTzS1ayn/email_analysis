Yeah verily!

This is the "minimally constraining" view -- it allows folks
to manage data however they choose -- lump the content and
the metadata together, or store them separately and link
them.

Documents, Metadata, and Links

The thing which you get when you follow a link, when you de-reference
a URI, has a lot of names. Formally we call it a resource. Sometimes it
is
referred to as a document because many of the things currently on the
Web are human readable documents. Sometimes it is referred to as an
object when the object is something which is more machine readable in
nature or has hidden state. I will use the words document and resource
interchangeably in what follows and sometimes may slip into using
"object".
