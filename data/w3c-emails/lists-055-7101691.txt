There's a danger of missing the point on this one: it's not whether
you should take PUBLIC first or SYSTEM first, but that having picked
one (assuming both were provided), _and failed to resolve it_, the
other one ought also to be tried. Too many systems try one, fail to
resolve, and just give up without having tried the other one.
