Panorama uses SYSTEM in preference to PUBLIC, and I think this is the
right behaviour.  If you don't want the SYSTEM identifier used,
don't give it.  What's it for if not to override the PUBLIC resolution?

This is an interesting idea.  Better to combine them:
<?XML-BASE_external_id_?>

By the way, you forgot the ? at the end of the PI.  So do I.  So does everyone
else.  This syntax won't fly,.
