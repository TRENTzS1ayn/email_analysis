I attended that meeting and tried to put in a plug
for XML whenever I could. The W3C folks tried hard
to downplay SGML and XML, but they did not manage
to keep me quiet. It seems clear that they consider
XML a bit of a threat and are trying to minimize
its role. The best way that we can overcome that
is to demonstrate the uefulness and practicality
of XML as compared to HTML. Interest in growing,
but it will take time and demonstrable software
to sway more people to our side.

I expect to be atending the next AC meeting on June 17/18.
Having software to demonstrate at that meeting would
be a big help in pushing XML higher up on the agenda
for the consortium.
