It is competitive.  We have to live with 
that and understand the competition.

The W3C consortium is a collection of conflicting 
interests.   Go where they need this:  not where 
they fear it.  This is when alliance with ISO 
and WG8 plays to an advantage.  Don't compare 
this to HTML.  Don't compare this to Acrobat.

This is SGML made practical for practical requirements.
Figure out what those requirements are first.
