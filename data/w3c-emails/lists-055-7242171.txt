Yes.  That is the most unobtrusive way unless you want to use 
PIs.  Then you have IADS.

In general, arch forms bother me to this day.  They still look 
like a way to have class inheritance without specifically 
defining the machinery for classes and inheritance.

It opens up an entirely new specification to 
write or a to reference HyTime.  Is an archForm a real class 
indicator, or just a conventional set of parameter entities?
Can an arch form inherit arch forms?

Yes.

This doesn't seem possible to decide without a description of 
what XML archForms are.
