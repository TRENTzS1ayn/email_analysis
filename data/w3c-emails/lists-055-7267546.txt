Yes.  I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of this point.
HTML is almost perfectly suited to the problem space it was originally
designed to address, and for that reason it will probably be around
for decades to come.  It is a big mistake to position XML as
competition to HTML.  XML is not going to take over HTML's problem
space, and suggesting that it might just generates needless hostility.
