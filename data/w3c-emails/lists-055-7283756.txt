As David, Paul, Steve, Kurt, and others, I would have PUBLIC take
precedence over SYSTEM; only if the catalog lookup fails should one
try the SYSTEM identifier.

The PUBLIC identifier provides necessary indirection, and is essential
for addressing portability. This is the approach we chose in Synex
ViewPort (using the socat), and how e.g. Panorama works.

Cheers,
