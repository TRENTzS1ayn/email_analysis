The link is the actual multi-ended relationship.  The link description
is the result of processing the link description element.  It has all
the information needed to build a link, but I call it a mapping
because the SAME link description can result in DIFFERENT links
depending on where it sits in its host document, and where that
document sits itself, because of relative elements in the locators
used to identify the endpoints.  Your question also gets us into the
metadocument thread, because the most obvious aspect of context which
affects what link instantiates a link description in any particular
case is the catalog, supposing the one of its locators uses an FPI.

Does this clarify?
