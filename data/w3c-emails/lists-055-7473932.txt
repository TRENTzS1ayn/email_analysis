This would allow a designer to use either the reserved GI as the link
element name, or modify a legacy name by adding an AF attribute. Not
counting myself among the Hytime cognoscenti I'm going to stretch a little
here, but this is my understanding:

There might be an XML application that uses the XML GI:

    <XML-LINKTO HREF="http://www.foo.com/" HRTYPE="alink">

which could be equivalent to an XML-ized HTML:

    <A HREF="http://www.foo.com/" XML="LINKTO" XML-HRTYPE="alink">

although I'm not sure from various sources if the attribute name should be
'XML', 'XMLNAME', etc.

[Since I've probably got this skewed, I'm ready for my reeducation. *slap*]
