| The two methods described perorm the same function, but are used for
| different purposes. The first example allows a designer to create an
| new SGML application. The second allows legacy applications like
| DocBook or HTML to be retrofitted with architectural form attributes
| to be used within an XML processing system.

Now I'm hearing arguments in favor of using the attribute method.  I'm
not hearing anything about why we need both methods.  Either the
attribute method works or it doesn't; if it does, why do we need both?
