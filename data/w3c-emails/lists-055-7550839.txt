you don't need both.  attributes work fine.  you will get both 
because common practice is to use the GI.  It if inflexible 
unless one starts . appending in the GI.

has anyone considered what happens when several arch forms 
must be applied to the same element type?  For example, 
a community wants to use the XML type for a link, but 
specialize it further with arch forms only a set 
particular to a community shares?
