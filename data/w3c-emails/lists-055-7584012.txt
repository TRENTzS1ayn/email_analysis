If there is to be a single mechanism, I strongly feel that it should
be an indirect one; whether attributes, PIs, or arch forms, I'm not
sure.

My reason is that XML is supposed to be a *semantic* markup language.
Both explanatory footnotes and bibliographic references could be the
same species of hyperlink, but I want to mark them up differently,
since they *are* different things.

However, if an implementor is implementing this, would it really be
hard for them to treat a GI that is identical to one of the known
attribute values as equivalent to specifying that attribute value?
