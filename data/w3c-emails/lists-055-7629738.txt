I don't assume that people will hand-code a DTD, but I could see a
Microsoft Word-like application that builds its document storage model on a
base DTD and stylesheet that the user unknowingly modifies as the document
outline and styles are filled in. Tens of thousands of DTDs every day.

XML applications may also be developed to fill niche roles in various
industries, with the idea that interoperability is gained by using a
commonly-available XML browser. CML might just be the first of many
industries that would want to take advantage of a simplified, custom
markup. Not thousands of DTDs, maybe a stable dozen. But browser vendors
(and I'm guessing average users) would much better understand a common GI,
with an option to use an attribute left to others.

As I mentioned, I'm much more an advocate of using attributes, but a
stable, understood GI might be a choice *some* people would prefer.
Netscape, forinstance.

Whoa. You obviously don't work in marketing.
