System is fallback for PUBLIC that fails. But as my conversation with
Murray showed, it's probably better to tell authors that the two had
_better_ be equivalent as applications get the choice of resolution
mechanisms. I think my example was quite realistic, and shows that some
SYSTEM IDs should be handled before some PUBLIC IDs, and vice versa....

??? I don't understand. I was intending to give one construct with two
variant forms (exactly parallel to Entity declaration forms).

well, if _we_ are confused, it is likely from interference with our
knowledge of SGML syntax, in which case it won't be that widespread a
problem.
