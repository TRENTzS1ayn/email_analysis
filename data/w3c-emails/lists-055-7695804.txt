Well, much as I hate to disagree with steve, I think we should either not
accomodate such needs, or hedge them with restrictions if we do accomodate
them.

We should not allow turing-complete languages for determining link destinations.

I won't repeat the arguments, but it is clear that web-analysis software is
a growth industry. We should make it easier, not harder. Computable links
make it harder, and are pretty _unnecessary_ on the web, as far as I've
seen.

Yes. All of those properties should be separately specified, not encoded in
the document.

They're both pernicious -- but we have to live with microbes and viruses as
well as macro-fauna...

Yes, but SGML provides no _special_ facilities for processing. This was the
point, and I've yet to see any pratical or theoretical reason to abondon
this for linking when we agree that it is a good idea for other
presentation features.
