As part of a project on electronic conferencing and publishing
I shall shortly be releasing CML on CDROM, along with tutorials,
examples, a Java-based CML/XML browser (JUMBO) and some links to
public XML pages.  I have written a short introduction to 
structured documents and their processing (from my point of view :-)
which is aimed at people who have never heard of SGML.  I'd be grateful
for any corrections of fact or misrepresentations :-) in the draft
at 
http://www.venus.co.uk/omf/cml/doc/tutorial/xml.html

(The CDROM is being distributed by the Royal Society of Chemistry
who are committed to SGML-based publishing and to CML/XML.  We expect 
about 5000-10000 to be distributed so that it will reach many libraries.
I don't yet know whether there will be spares - probably :-)
