Nothing, except that this is basically what X.500 tried to do when
applied as a routing mechanism with network directory information. 
That hasn't flown much so far, partly because of the expense, and 
partly because it has to be 100% populated to work properly.

What you describe is a great template but I think the management
factors need a lot of work (persuade people it's worth it), and at 
first sight it looks like it could create a lot of request-response
network traffic.
