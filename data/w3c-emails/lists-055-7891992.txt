I'm using 6. because my response is the same for both 6.1 and 6.2:

>6.1 Are linking element source documents interesting?

>6.2 Locator fragments and traversal process model

Both of these would be great to have, but I simply don't see how we can
specify this and still get the cow out of the field and home. In a highly
cross-referenced business like research, 6.1 would blow your socks off,
and in an era of expensive bandwidth but cheap cycles, 6.2 would be very
useful, but both of these are large matters and I'm not convinced we have
the resources and time right now to fix them. If XML gets off the ground,
maybe they can be bolted onto it at a later stage.
