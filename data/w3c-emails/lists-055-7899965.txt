>2.2.a Should we allow link recognition via a reserved GI?

No.  (If systems decide to assume that a GI of 'tlink' or whatever
it ends up being called in the final spec *is* a tlink in the sense
of the spec, that's error recovery in the absence of a required
declaration.  And I'm not sure it's such a great idea even as
error recovery.)

>2.2.b If so, what should the set of GI's be?

The empty set.
