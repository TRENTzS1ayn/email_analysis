| I still think we should avoid PUBLIC.  I have yet to see any clear
| examples that require it.  Paul Prescod has come close, with a
| teaching environment using SGML where the students don't have network
| access, but it is not clear to me that that example applies to a
| version of SGML developed especially for web use.  In other words, the
| requests for PUBLIC seem to come from SGML users rather than Web
| users, and stem largely from backwards compatibility.  Jon's system at
| Sun is interesting, but could equally well be done with URLs as far as
| I can see.

No.  The whole system depends on the links being specified in terms of
location-independent names.  That's how they continue to work even
when the usual source of a document goes down or the document is moved
to another server.
