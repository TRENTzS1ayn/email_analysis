Not yet.  Soon, we hope.

I read productions 27-31 as meaning:
  - the root element must be preceded by a prolog
  - the prolog must begin with an XML declaration
    i.e. <?XML version='1.0' ... ?>
  - the prolog may contain PIs, comments, one document type
    declaration, and white space, following the XML declaration

Which part of this isn't clear from the spec?

Yes, general entities may be used.  No depth restriction is made.

The paragraph quoted is referring to the elements (instances), not
to their types; to actual containment, not potential containment.
A PARA contained directly within a NOTE has exactly one parent element:
the NOTE.  The fact that other PARA elements have or can have
parents with GIs other than NOTE does nothing to change the
nature of the parent-child relationship.
