The SGML handbook says (p. 379) that "The system identifier
can be omitted if the system can generate it from the
public identifier and/or other information available to it."

So the actual storage location ought to be deducable
from the public identifier, not the other way round.
XML should not differ from SGML on this point.
Agreeing on precedence is required if one wishes to
be able to override a system identifier (Jon gave
a good example in designing redundancy into documentation
systems).
