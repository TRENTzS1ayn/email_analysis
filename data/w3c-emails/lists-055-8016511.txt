Sorry, I was less than precise in rewording what I was sent. It
related to what NAMEs are {required|allowed} in an XML PI in the
Prolog? VERSION and RMD seem to be required, ENCODING is obviously
dependent, EMPTY I believe has been taken away (so one correspondent
said, anyway), are TEXT, NOTEXT, DEFAULT, and IDINFO still in?

Aaaaaah. Sound of light dawning. Perhaps something about ocurring in
the instance could be introduced to make this clear. Many thanks.
