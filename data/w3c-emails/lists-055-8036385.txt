Jon, you're right on. Give the user controls to shape the presentation
as needed for particular means of understanding.

Hear, hear. 
Let the information work with speech readers for the blind.
Give it logical organization and linearized presentation usually.
Allow asides with easy return.

See, see. 
Provide large type for the low-vision. 
Allow legible font substitution
in place of decorative ones. 
Add a much larger range of point size than MSIE [about 8-14 pt],
even more than 72 pt max of NSN. 
Allow reverse video as one friend prefers.
Get rid of wallpaper and other chart-junk [credit Ed Tufte].
Identify ALT text for all images.
Allow color shifting to help the color-blind. 
Make the accessibility controls accessible.
