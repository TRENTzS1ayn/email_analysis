I suggest that XML allow either a system identifier or a public
identifier in a DOCTYPE, but not both.  It seems clear from our
discussions here that in current and future practice there will always
be differing ideas about which to prefer when both appear, based on
instinct, experience, and the demands of the situation---and that this
divergence of views is not founded in ignorance of SGML or failure to
think the problem through, but rather on the range of possible uses
for this kind of multiple specification of where to get an entity. To
me it looks like a natural for the category of: useful but troublesome
SGML features that we prohibit, at least for now, until there's some
compelling reason to add them back in despite the possibility for
confusion and difficulty of implementation.
