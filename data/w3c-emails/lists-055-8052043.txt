To:w3c-sgml-wg@w3.org

To make clearer what I proposed on this topic just now:  let's keep
both SYSTEM and PUBLIC but drop the SGML option of mixing them.  So
yes to

<!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM 'foo.dtd'>

and

<!DOCTYPE foo PUBLIC '-//US Army//DTD Jargon list//EN' >

but no to

<!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM 'foo.dtd' PUBLIC '-//US Army//DTD Jargon list//EN' >
