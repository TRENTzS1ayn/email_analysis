    It means that authors who intend to use both SYSTEM and PUBLIC are
duty-bound to either use (and test) a programmatic solution that ensures
they are identical, or must test the document with both public-preferred
and SYSTEM-preferred resolution in place.

   In other words, it's like broken link testing -- a pain, but one that
enables  sensible implementation strategies... So yes, author error may
cause conforming implementations to do different things. This is no worse
than the C statement
j = j++ + j++; which can return a variety of values and have a variety of
side-effects on conforming C compilers.

    In this case, since the author has control, it's probably better to
just do _something_ instead of worrying about doing the _right thing_.
