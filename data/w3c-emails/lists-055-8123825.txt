I agree that it can be specified separately, I just hope it is specified. 
The SGML world seems to have come up with several elegant solutions 
to this problem of packaging entities: mime-SGML, SDIF, TR9401, etc. 

Whereas the "Java world" as represented by Sun just chose a solution based
on readily available software (.zip with no compression) and got on with
it.  I would really like it if we could just choose a solution and "get 
on with it." I don't care if it is as simple and inelegant as "tar" (in fact, 
I would prefer a system that was as simple as tar).

If, as you suggest, the solution is specified as a separate document, 
"XML-Package", then it can be replace at any future time with "XML-OLE"
or "XML-Bento" or whatever else is more advanced.
