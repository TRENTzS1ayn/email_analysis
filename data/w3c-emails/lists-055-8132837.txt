I agree.  But please do note that downloading a single zip file with
all the documents, images, dtds and style sheets is likely to be
scads slower than downloading the same thing in html with HTTP 1.1 or
HTTP NG, because the browser can download images at the same time as it
is downloading the style sheet and the document.
Putting everything in a tar precludes parallel processing, and that's
a real problem.

Try the Opera browser for Windows if you want to see how fast an
HTML browser can go.  If netscape is a porsche, opera is concorde :-)

I hope we don't require the use of a single packaged file.
