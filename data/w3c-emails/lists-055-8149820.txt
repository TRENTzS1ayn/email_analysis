This puzzles me a bit. Emacs psgml-mode resolves FPIs faultlessly and I've
been using that method increasingly over the last year. For software that
doesn't support it, but uses socats, I have entries for the FPIs.

Can someone who knows more about the background say why resolving

  "-//Foo, Inc//DTD Wonderful Document Type//EN"

into

   /usr/local/lib/sgml/Foo,_Inc/DTD/Wonderful_Document_Type

is A Bad Thing, as it seems most people decry it (leave aside the Win3.x
and VM/SP users who don't have access to long filenames, as those systems
clearly have a problem, and leave aside the problem of write access to
/usr/local/lib/sgml, as that part of the filetree is parameterizable).
