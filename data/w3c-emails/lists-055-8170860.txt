That's sensible, although there would then be no standard XML way of
processing a document with PUBLIC -- you'd have to use a resolution
mechanism to get a CATALOG file and then a TD, and we haven't got one.
Maybe we can live with that?  Just don't use PUBLIC if you want things
to work for other people?  It would be like a sort of processing
instruction.

This is illegal anyway in SGML, unfortunately.  If you could
give multiple external identifiers, our priority problem would be
solved, as we could say that it's left to right -- i.e., in your
example, foo.dtd would be preferred, but had PUBLC been first,
it'd've been the other way round.
