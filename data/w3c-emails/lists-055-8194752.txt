I agree, but the solution needs to be acceptable to authors and implementors.
If it doesn't make sense to them, it won't fly, and right now, the dingdong
over PUB vs SYS comes out as a straight play between FPIs and URLs. I can
guess which one NS and MS are going to pick. Sun did an excellent job on
packaging, except picking the filetype ".zip" for something that conflicted
majorly with the established practice (read: expected behavior), which was 
a really crass thing to do. Let's not make the same mistake.
