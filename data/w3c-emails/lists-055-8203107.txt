Hmm.  You could find some and ask them.  Of course, the love of the ear 
is to hear what it heard before.  That question usually sets off the 
platform wars.  Gzip is popular because free, but not a great way to
pack up multiple files, so in reality, just compression.  Pkzip can 
pack multiple files and compress, but it's not free.  What Lee said 
should be considered:  fat packets piss off the NetLords.  Small, 
"guaranteed overnight deliveries" are the way of the web.

Don't let them pick.  Pick smart here.

Pick the one that can be implemented fastest in XML 1.0.
URLs are well-defined and can do the first set of jobs.
Public are what is needed for absolute independence.  Now, 
when is it often necessary to be independent at transfer?
When is it necessary in local storage?  When is it necessary 
when archiving?

You mean there is another mistake we can make?
