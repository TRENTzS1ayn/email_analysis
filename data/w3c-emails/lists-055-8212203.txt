Yes, NORMDTD by Richard Light. DOS program, some small bugs, but it
flattened the whole of the TEI for me, which was massive. Copy at
ftp://ota.ox.ac.uk/pub/ota/TEI/software/normdtd1.exe

The output of some linemode parsers (eg sgmls and sp) was in part 
designed for input into subsequent processors, I think.
