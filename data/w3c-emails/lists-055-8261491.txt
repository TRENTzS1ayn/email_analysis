An example (from "ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN")
(BTW I use the FPI to identify the document, not its location):

There are about 100 such records in the file:

<!ENTITY aacute SDATA "[aacute]"--=small a, acute accent-->
                ^^^^^           ^^                      ^^
The fields underlined are not parsable in XML.  

This means that either it is not possible to use the ISO entity sets 
in XML (which seems a pity), or they must be transformed (?who would
validate them) or maybe there is some cunning way round this problem

My personal opinion is that the SGML comment (which is ubiquitous in DTDs,
entities , etc.) will be the thing that causes most problems as the
change to --* *-- is not immediately obvious to those who haven't been
involved in the discussions.
