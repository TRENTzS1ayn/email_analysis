True.   SGMLer's have a horror of working software though.
It is more pure to declare than do.

Yes, now imagine it as a snake trying to swallow a stylesheet, a DTD, 
a document instance, a catalog, a few miscellaneous applets.

Possibly.  Some are complaining on the VRML list that the failure 
to nail down a scripting language is the reason we now have so many 
incompatible "world" files.  Others say picking Java would have 
given VRML to Sun, or JavaScript, giving it to Netscape.  So we 
have VRMLScript which is JavaScriptByAnotherName, and still have 
all these Java applets.  Some say, "let the market forces and 
hot content decide" which of course is no decision and guarantees 
the incompatibilities continue because market forces created them 
originally and will continue to create them.

The sun still rises.  Truth is, we decide.

Well, I'd hoped for something that didn't remind me of my 
band, but if there is a gig, working equipment is better 
than none, and Peavy amps may buzz, but they still work 
when dropped from a moving truck.

It doesn't have to be perfect.  It has to work and get 
us to XML 2.0.  It should also be cheap and easy.
