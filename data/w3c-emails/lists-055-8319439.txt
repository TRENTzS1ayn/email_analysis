It's hard enough to get Panorama to work with normal SGML :-)
But this is very useful information, Peter, thanks for identifying it.

I have a sneaking suspicion it was introduced because C programmers
can't get a handle on comments /* unless they have an asterisk */,
and as they are the target audience for implementations, this was
done to persuade them that XML is not as hard as SGML :-)

I think the intention was (?is?) that XML can be parsed by SGML parsers,
but there was no intention that it should go the other way round.
