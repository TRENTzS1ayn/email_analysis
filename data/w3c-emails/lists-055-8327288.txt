The comments are not mandatory -- they're just about universal, though. 

The source of these things is, of course, Annex D.4 of ISO 8879. And it's
not just one file but quite a few in a typical installation. The annex is
not normative text, but files containg this public text have been copied by
almost every vendor (a quick look around my disk found copies from
WordPerfect and Adobe/Frame and two copies from SoftQuad). There are
further examples of this sort in ISO/TR 9573, Techniques for Using SGML.

Given the near ubiquity of files that look lile the Annexes, maybe XML
ought to reexaine the decisions on the things Peter points out above.

(I, for one, think the "--*  *--" delimiter is more junk to type -- and it
makes me have to hit a shift key, too. I have enough sense to distinguish
between when I'm typing text and use " -- " as an em-dash and when I'm
typing code and putting in comments.)
