People are meaning different things by "resolution".  Joe's point was
that if you receive an XML document over the web and you don't have the
DTD, your XML software hass to figure out automatically how to fetch
tbe DTD, and do it, with no user intervention.

If we end up using CATALOG to link to style sheets too, this may make sense,
since then we'll need the public ID to associate the style sheet with
all documents using a given DTD (and that particular catalog).

If we don't, the public ID isn't really needed in this case, and you're
best off with a normal URL cache.

If some systems use the PUBLIC ID in some way to fetch DTDs, and some
future system fetches a different DTD than the one you specified, e.g.
because they happened to use the same public ID as you, there may of
course be problems...
