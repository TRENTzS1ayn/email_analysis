I said that I am prepared to accept communal discipline and I don't
intend to post further on this topic unless asked :-)

I got the impression from 2-3 mails that this had surprised people and 
I am sorry if I have raised an issue that had been put to bed.

My reaction is that it will create a lot of work and potentially some
confusion.  Not everyone will initially understand the reason for two sets of
entity sets which differ only by asterisks and they may occasionally muddle
them up. If this is recognised and accepted, that's fine.

I accept that for large well-financed organisations this isn't a problem.
Nor is it a problem for people who are developing a complete XML solution
without any reference to existing SGML.  The problem will hit those who
(like me) are on the fringes of the SGML community and who have to make
do with what bits and pieces they can pick up.  

My own position is that my DTD (CML) is (now) not interoperable with XML.
The problem is not primarily technical.  The components that CML interoperates
with belong to other organisations who own the copyright and for each of
which I shall have to get permission to alter and redistribute the material.
Whilst I am sure this will come in time, it's not something that a single
individual is likely to make much headway with.  Therefore, I cannot
legally distribute my material in XML-form (unless I have misunderstood
this).
 
I will predict that what will happen is that people will develop XML software
which has switches on the command line, that allow it to read 'SGML' entity 
sets, rather than the confusion of interoperating with 'SGML' sets and 'XML'
sets in neighbouring directories.

No :-)  But it would be a useful thing for those of us who are trying to 
develop software to have the definitive XML versions of the common DTDs and 
entity sets.  At present my XML development is stalled until this happens.
