I concur completely with Michael.

No-one has ever said that existing legacy SGML (or HTML) files will be
valid XML files.  They won't.

The conversion is automatic and trivial.

The <!--* comment syntax *--> came from me, and is a sort of
transition syntax: you can use this in SGML today, as any SGML
parser will accept it as a comment that just happens to contain the stars.
If'when SGML is enhanced to allow different start and end comment delimiters,
this comment syntax lets you include -- in comments.

Also, yes, it looks familiar to C programmers, and there are a lot of us.

No, none of these files will break.  They are all SGML files, and
are not for use with XML.  I expect that a future Panorama may well
handle both XML and SGML...

I agree.  All the changes were made for good reason.
XML is a subset of SGML, but that doesn't mean that a subset of existing
SGML files are XML files.

No.
