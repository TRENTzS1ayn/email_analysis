Furthermore,
(1) we don't have SDATA entities at all in XML, so none of the ISO
    entity sets can be used;
    
(2) Unicode is used, so the replacement text of character entities
    has to be quite different anyway.  Since we aren't using SDATA, we
    can't rely on applications mapping "[third   ]" into anfraction,
    but must change
    <!Entity oneThird SDATA "[third ]" -- one third -->
    into
    <!--* one third: *-->
    <!Entity oneThird "&%0x2153;">
Once this has been done for the (large) subset of ISO entities supported by
Unicode, you'll just refer to the new public IDs and through the unspecified
magic of CATALOGs everything will work :-)

Nor is it ever likely to be (sorry).

Converting the entity sets and DTDs is a good idea, and should be
done, once the language has settled down a little more.
