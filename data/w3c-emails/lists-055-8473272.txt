I don't remember what I said, but I like this (but only if attlists can be
split, if not, we _have_ to use PIs to implement a new declaration).

On balance this is the best approach. AFs simply mean elements that are
processad based on attributes, that satisfy some constraints. And we don't
need to drag HyTime in to explain that.

I'm not sure about this. I agree that it seems to make sense, but then why
not redefine the XML-FORM attribute -- and then we're 5 times more meta-
than we need for the task. I still incline to keep the attnames short and
just fix them. I like the flexibility of the other, but I can't yet feel
that it's worth having to explain an "attribute-mapping attribute" to the
unfortunate reader of the spec.

But if we could find a reason to use blink it would be so amusing!

The return of the repressed, with a vengeance!
