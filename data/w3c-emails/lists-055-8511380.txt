I like the so-called "Stopgap PI" with content that looks just like an
attlist would.  I don't see the "legacy" problem as very problematic.

Before the TC passes, you must have:

   <!DOCTYPE tei.2 public "-//TEI//DTD P3//EN" [
   <?ATTLIST xref
             xml-link    CDATA   #fixed "xml-tlink" ?>
   ]>

and after it passes, you can still have the above or you can have

   <!DOCTYPE tei.2 public "-//TEI//DTD P3//EN" [
   <!ATTLIST xref
             xml-link    CDATA   #fixed "xml-tlink" >
   ]>

with the latter form preferred.  Why care about enforcing obsolescence?
That would be like getting upset that people still use ISO 8879-1986
instead of ISO 8879:1986 in FPIs.
