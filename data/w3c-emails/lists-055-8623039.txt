I question your use of "large" here, Lee. I made some preliminary looks
into this late last year and my impression was that Unicode had support
for just over *half* of the ISO SDATA entities.

I suppose you could still call that "large," but it seems rather misleading.

Yes, I've seen lots of hand-waving on Unicode's private use areas, but on
that issue I'll claim to be from Missouri--I'll believe it when I see it.
