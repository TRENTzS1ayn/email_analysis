I wouldn't worry too much, yet, Peter. I saw long ago that XML would be
untenable as a data format for managing source docs and that we would have
to adopt on-the-fly conversion if we chose to use it at all for delivering
documentation over the net. I'm sure that there will be PD tools available
to do just that since, so far, it doesn't seem to be too difficult of a
transformation.
