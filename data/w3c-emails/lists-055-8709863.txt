All of those, i.e. NOT 'behaviour', and no others.

All optional except locator.

Type is per link element, locator and scheme per explicit resource
(i.e. one in (simple) links, one per locator element in mlinks);
caption and role per resource (i.e. two in links (see previous message
about name collision) and one per locator element in mlinks).

> (iii)should it be carried in the GI, in an attribute name, or in an attribute

All in av-pairs.

>  (iv) should we predefine a set of values?

Type:  no, just a syntax, as before: a(.a)*
Role:  ditto.
Locator scheme: a minimum set, not closed.
Locator: no, just a syntax per scheme, by reference to relevant standard
Caption: CDATA

Implicit in answers above.

>  (vi) should we allow the use of values other than those predefined or

Duck.
