There is one syntactic advantage i see to the element approach: It provides
a way to attach additional information to each linkend. If, for example, the
user wants to add an explainerHHHHH^H label to each linkend,
it's a lot cleaner to do it with subelements:

<LINK-MONO TYPE=COMPARISON>
   <LINKEND ROLE=AUTHOR 
            HREF="http://www.ebt.com//u/sjd/bio.htm">
   <LINKEND ROLE=TEXT1 
            HREF="http://lit.org//milton/paradise_lost.htm#27966"
            LABEL="In this passage Milton clearly alludes to D. Steele.">
   <LINKEND ROLE=TEXT2 
            HREF="http://lit.org//dsteele/yet_another.htm"
            LABEL="See, they both talk about people.">
</LINK-MONO>

Try combining them LABELs into one element! Obviously doable by introducing
internal syntax (prohibit semicolon or something and pack 'em up). But ugly.
