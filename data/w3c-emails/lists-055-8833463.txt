Sorry. I think we should say that all _XML-linking_ information is encoded
in GIs or attribute values. With generic markup people can _implement_ any
behavior that they can define -- but we are defining behaviors that people
can count on -- and links in CDATA are not such behaviors unless we define
how they work.

I think the fact that people can implement other linking mechanisms goes
without saying, but we should be explicit about exactly what is permitted
by XML linking.
