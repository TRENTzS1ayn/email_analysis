My feeling is no, we should use attributes. Now to comment on Steve's
answer, because it may illumuninate my own.

I agree that this syntax is better for explainers, but it's less-compatible
with the "new" HyTime as I understand it, and it means that we have to talk
about content models which I would like to leave completely open to the
user.

So, although I love explainers (Labels), and have spent years arguing that
they should be supported by Hypertext systems, I'd rather lose them and
keep the syntax simpler and more flexible.

It will also keep our Mini-AF description much shorter and more
understandable, as all we need to specify are attributes, and we don't even
need to raise the confusing questions of what meta-content models mean and
require.
