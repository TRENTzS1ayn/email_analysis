I have never felt the need to ask the question "what does LINK mean", only
"what does it do?". As to interpretation: Isn't it patently obvious that
the example I gave should be interpreted as meaning nothing more or less
than "associate the semantics of xml-link with the xref element type"?

LINK just gives us a modular, extensible wrapper for the multiple attribute
definition lists everyone seems to want. The syntax is dead simple, especially
in the restricted form I suggested and there is free working software out
there that will handle it.

I was late joining this list and have spent several weeks catching up. I
wasn't aware that LINK had been proposed, discussed and rejected,
otherwise I wouldn't have "resurrected" it. Is this the case? If so, I
apologise.

The syntax isn't new. It dates from 1986 (earlier, actually). And I don't
regard LINK as controversial. Merely little understood and much maligned.

Aside from knee-jerk reactions, what are the objections?
