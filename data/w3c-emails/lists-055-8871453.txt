Not screeds:  just the proper references.

Ok.  The rest of this isn't aimed at you, Peter, or 
anyone in particular.

The other side of this, we will need all the personal, 
public, private and professional support we can get.
The SGML community is our natural ally.  Another duh, 
but worth remembering.  That is simply political.  What 
is not political are the policy documents out there, that 
is, the ISO, government, company, etc. that do reference 
ISO.  Where the alliance is strong and not encumbered 
by weasel wording or other strange and unneccessary 
considerations, we whose job it is to see that XML 
is adopted as a preferred delvery format for SGML 
can do that a lot easier where the references are clear.

HyTime/SGML can do us a lot of good.
