This is a restriction we can live with in XML 1.0.  Maybe longer.

"Permitted" might be the sticking word.  All XML Linking can say is what 
a conforming application must guarantee.  What is done beyond that 
by use of other attributes or element types is not something XML 
enables.  Otherwise, we are stuck trying to provide the mechanisms 
for extensions to XML Linking when in effect, that should be 
an issue for XML 2.0 once XML 1.0 has been shaken like a rag 
doll in the dog's mouth with a kid pulling on it.  We are the dollmaker,
not 
the dog or the kid.
