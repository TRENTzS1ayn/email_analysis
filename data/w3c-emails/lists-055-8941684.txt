Thanks Bill!

Please, keep things in perspective. Exaggerations like "XML is not SGML
therefore it is no good" help no one. Lets not forget what, in my 
opinion is the real point, that XML is designed to increase the audience 
for SGML. The new audience has shown by their behavior that they are 
unwilling to make the commitment that full SGML requires.

Yet, HTML has shown that an audience is there. Hopefully XML will help 
those whose "expressive" needs have outgrown HTML or any other fixed 
tag-set language. And because it is a proper sub-set of SGML, XML instances
are instantly ISO-8879 compliant. All at a cost of *some* SGML users
doing a relatively (relative to may of the translations they already do)
simple transform.

BTW, during the ERB meetings I often asked the question: what will this
do to the expressive power?  I was willing to give up a whole lot more
that I had to.
