Umm... has anyone actually said "XML is not SGML" or is that an 
exaggeration?  Peter MR expressed discomfort with the number 
and amount of changes he was making to CML to be XML compliant.
Since he is one of the very first to try this, we should be 
cognizant of his reaction.  He supports this XML, so consider that 
for those for whom a case has not been made, for whom benefits 
are hard to demonstrate, that reaction will occur often.

Ignoring the reaction is exactly the same mistake as ignoring 
the behavior of the audience you cite.  That is the customer base 
speaking.  Being on the ERB should make you more aware of the 
problem, not less.  Otherwise, why are you there?
