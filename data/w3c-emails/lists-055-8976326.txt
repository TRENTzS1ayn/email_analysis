The proverbial CS bachelor's degree holder should be able to take the
XML spec(s) and implement.  They should not need to write checks to
the ISO.

Bibliographic references are certainly appropriate, as are "BTW, this
is what HyTime calls ..." or "For SGML geeks, the differences are...".
Saying, "To understand this, read ISO 10744 Technical Corrigendum 1,"
is a Bad Thing.
