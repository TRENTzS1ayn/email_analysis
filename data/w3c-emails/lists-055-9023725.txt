I agree -- saying "To understand this, read the HyTime standard" is in 
all but one case an oxymoron; this sentence is the exception.

XML must stand (or crawl or wriggle or fall) alone.

If it is _absolutely_ necessary tomention HyTime in the spec., please
make it in a non-normative part such as a note or an annotated bibliography.
You don't need to read GML [sic] docs to use SGML or AAP either.

Most of the people using SGML today would rather be beaten on the
soles of their feet with a dead fish than read the HyTime specs;
most of the people using HTML today would rather watch.
