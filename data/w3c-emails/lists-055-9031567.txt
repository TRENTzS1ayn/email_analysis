Glad to know some of us read minds better than others.

There is no worry of that.

Fear is still fear.  It is a bad way to reason.  If some are caught 
in that fear, it is their own problem to be considered.

Go ahead and close it.  I am not stark.

However, the normative reference is more than an acknowledgement 
of intellectual parentage.  It is the authoritative reference 
for the boundaries of the development of the subset being 
adopted by XML.  If it is not, and 8879 and 10744 are 
not boundaries, then XML is not the basis for SGML Lite and 
a competitor to XML will be developed.  This isn't a situation 
we should enable by our fears or our tastes... or our ambitions.

Nor is it bounded.  But it can be understood.

That is a mistake.  Conformance to SGML is one of the most 
important features of XML.  If that is not understood by now,
then the ERB should resign en masse and let WG8 do this.

They don't.  We do.  Conformance with SGML, that is, that XML is a 
wholly comforming subset of SGML is the primary constraint.  That 
is why a TC has been offered by WG8's chair.  That is not a light 
matter.  If such conformance is abandoned, the chair of WG8 should 
reconsider that offer, and WG8 should continue with a separate 
and competing version.  It will be ISO, authoritative, and something 
which those whose contracting agreements span nations and considerable 
investment will be made aware of.  It will be XML that dies; not SGML.

If they wish to understand the full and authoritative definition of 
AFs, that is precisely what it should say.

You gave up your credibility there, Michael.  You nor your group has 
the authority to take over anything.  That is exactly the problem 
with this work.  As for having to read ISO 10744 or ISO 8879, they only 
have to do that if the XML subset is incomplete with respect to 
a developer's requirements.  OTW, why would they read that?

If my visitor wishes to leave a guest bedroom and go to another 
state, that map is of use.  If all they wish to do is sleep in 
the bedroom, why would one offer them that?  It is a facile 
comparison and misses the point:  ISO is authoritative.  XML 
is a set of recommendations from a consortium working group.
That is it's EXACT authoritative status.  Don't confuse these issues.

That is not the case.  Whatever experience you have, you have 
not learned the lessons it provides.  If you work in the 
industrial side of the SGML community, you know that the 
authoritative references are the ones that can be quoted
in contracts.  That is one reason why ISO HTML is greeted 
with relief.

No:  they are the authoritative chain of references which enable 
contractual obligations of all parties.  If you and your committee 
members cannot live with that, resign now.  Otherwise, be aware 
of your obligations to your community.
