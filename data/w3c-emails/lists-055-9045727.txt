If the shoe fits, wear it.

I was trying to help clarify vocabulary for two parties who seemed on
the verge of starting a flame war by systematically misinterpreting
each others' messages.  I don't read minds.  But I do read the postings,
possibly with more understanding for where David is coming from than
you've exhibited, and possibly with more understanding of where you're
coming from than David may have gleaned.  If you'd rather have a flame
war than a useful exchange of views, suit yourself.  (And hand me that
torch.)

If what I described is not what you're worried about, then I have
misunderstood your earlier postings completely, and my attempt at
mediation was ill founded.  Sorry to have wasted everyone's time.

If we hope to persuade an audience of something, then their fear,
reasonable or not, is not their problem but our problem.

Fear is a bad way to reason, Len.  You told us that a moment ago;
you don't need to add a demonstration of it here.

It's WG8, not you, who will decide what to put into a revised 8879.  I
know enough of its members that I am confident that they are capable of
noticing that XML guarantees the SGML conformance of valid XML
documents, and of valuing the increased accessibility SGML gains by
having clear documentation of a useful subset.  You insult their
intelligence by suggesting otherwise.

Conformance to SGML was *accomplished* in XML.  If you have not
understood that by now, who should be resigning?  It was not
accomplished by reference; it was accomplished by hard work.  It
does not need to be guaranteed by a normative reference; it is
guaranteed by the restrictions explicitly made in the XML spec.

Len, if you ever see signs of XML abandoning the principle of
SGML conformance, then perhaps remarks like this paragraph will be
in order.  Until you do, they are wildly off the mark.

The point at issue is not whether XML documents are legal SGML; the
point is how that result is accomplished and documented.  You seem to
wish we had accomplished it by providing a document that could not be
understood without reference to 8879; I think it is good that we did
produce a document that is comprehensible by itself.  Since there are
*already* SGML subsets designed for easy implementation which take the
approach you seem to prefer, I suppose we can let the market decide.  So
far, after three months we have two publicly available XML parsers and
an indeterminate number not yet public.  After eleven years, how many
publicly available Minimal SGML parsers do we have?  Seems to me the
market has already decided.

Yes, of course.  If any reader wishes to understand the full definition
of anything, going to the place where it is defined is usually a good
idea.  Why someone interested in the full definition of architectural
forms would be looking for a treatment of them in the XML Link spec is
beyond me.  But let's suppose they are reading the XML Link spec in the
hopes of understanding not HyTime, and not SGML, and not CALS, and not
the historical development of the Sanskrit passive, but -- for some
reason -- XML Link itself.  Why not allow them to understand the
full and definitive account of XML Link by making that account complete
and self-contained?

The XML Link spec needs to provide a full definition of XML links; that
includes the aspects of architectural forms used by XML Link.  It should
*not* delegate that task to 10744.

I don't know whom you mean by 'my group', but any group defining a
formal system has, as far as I can tell, the right to adopt concepts
from other systems.  That's one way intellectual endeavors make
progress:  adopting good ideas from predecessor systems.

The W3C SGML WG and ERB, in defining XML Link, have both the authority
and the responsibility to take over useful concepts from wherever we
find them.  I don't know why my mention of this obvious fact offends
you, or why you claim we don't have authority to define XML Link in
whatever way we choose, for good or ill.

We seem to differ in opinion here.  Whether it's necessary to read 8879
and 10744 seems to me *not* a question of whether the *subset* is
complete or incomplete, but a question of how complete the documentation
of the subset is.  Normative references are, as I understand the term, a
sign that the documentation before the reader is itself not complete.
Informative references are an entirely different matter.

Good question.  Perhaps you will answer the corresponding question
about XML Link.  If all the reader wishes to do is to understand
how XML Link works, why would you and others insist that instead
of explaining in the spec how XML Link works, we say instead "First,
you must understand ISO 10744; then come back and you'll be able to
understand the rest of this spec."

I don't believe I have confused them; I don't believe I've tried to
discuss them at all.  I don't believe they are relevant to this
discussion, which centers on the question of whether XML documentation
should itself contain full descriptions of salient constructs or
should rely for those descriptions on other documentation such as
ISO 10744 or ISO 8879.  The specification for XML itself does not
rely on 8879 in the way you now seem to require; why did you not mention
this requirement when we were discussing that draft?

Can you name anyone who has understood 8879's definition of Basic
or Minimal SGML without understanding the rest of 8879 first?

I have been told the point of Basic and Minimal SGML was to simplify
the task of creating low-end SGML systems.  OK, where are those
systems?

It's always interesting to read about strange and unfamiliar customs
and beliefs.  Thank you.  I feel like I'm reading an ethnological
report.

By the way, though, if industrial concerns are unable to do things
without authoritative references to ISO standards, why are so many
industrial concerns (a) on the Web, using HTML, and (b) using
the internet at all, given that the TCP/IP family of protocols is
so hopelessly incompatible with the relevant ISO standards?

Since valid XML documents are by definition valid SGML documents,
however, there is nothing to prevent the inclusion of references to ISO
8879 in a contract for an XML system.  Why would there be?

If you mean we have an obligation to our community to make the XML spec
incomprehensible and impenetrable, I respectfully and forcefully demur.
