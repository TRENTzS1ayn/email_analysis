I am very pleased to announce the availability of a new mailing list
devoted to issues of special interest to XML software developers.

To subscribe to the new list, called XML-DEV, send a message to
majordomo@ic.ac.uk with the line

   subscribe xml-dev name@address

(where name@address is your actual email address) in the body of the
message.  To unsubscribe, send to majordomo@ic.ac.uk the message

   unsubscribe xml-dev

To see other facilities available from the mail server, send a message
containing just the word

   help

An initial message to the list and an "info" blurb for the list appear
below.

On behalf of the XML community, I would like to thank Peter
Murray-Rust of the Virtual School of Molecular Sciences
(peter@ursus.demon.co.uk) for organizing the list and Henry Rzepa of
the Department of Chemistry, Imperial College, London (rzepa@ic.ac.uk)
for agreeing to serve as the list coordinator.  The XML-DEV list is
certain to become a major resource as XML moves toward realization.

Jon

 Subject: Welcome and Thanks

 This is a test message to XML-DEV.  I am very grateful to Henry Rzepa
 for setting this up at my request.  Henry is the one who has to field
 the problems of bouncing addresses and so on.  Henry has been
 extremely supportive of the development of CML and of SGML-based
 publishing in chemistry, but please route any SGML/XML queries to me
 rather than him.

 This list is hypermailed which means that every posting is available
 on the WWW.  The great advantage is that it's possible to revisit the
 pages for factual information.  Please choose your threads and
 subjects carefully.  Note, of course, that all postings are public and
 that you should not post anything that you would prefer only a small
 group to know (e.g. the location of pre-alpha code).

 I have written an 'info' which should appear shortly - there is no
 detailed agenda, but a general belief that if we take a collaborative
 approach to developing components (of whatever sort) we can get
 prototypes and demonstrators working very soon.  We benefit from
 knowing that we are all working from the same draft, with the same
 beta-release, or whatever.  Topics should always relate to XML in some
 form, although they may spring from existing SGML applications and
 installations.

 It is probably not appropriate to post large chunks of material (code,
 document instances, etc.) to this list, but to post URLs instead.  It
 may be useful to evolve a page where these are listed, but I'm not
 offering this on day 1 (volunteers?).  The development of XML is very
 rapid and it is always helpful if resources can be uniquely identified
 (i.e. have IDs, date stamps, or different URLs).  I am probably as
 guilty as anyone in this matter :-).

 INFO:

 XML-DEV is an informal unmoderated list to support those who are
 interested in the implementation and development of XML.  XML is being
 developed as 'an extremely simple dialect' of SGML to 'enable generic
 SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in a way that is
 now possible with HTML'.  Further information about XML or pointers to
 it can be found at:

    http://www.ucc.ie/xml/     (Peter Flynn's FAQ site)
    http://www.sil.org/sgml/   (Robin Cover's SGML page)

 The XML spec is still being actively developed. The latest draft is at

    http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/WD-xml.html

 This list is for those people actively involved in developing
 resources for XML.  It is not restricted to members of the working
 group (WG), but many subscribers to XML-DEV will be actively working
 on implementing some part of the spec.  Examples of what might be
 discussed:

    - the detailed implementation of the spec
    - resources such as documentation, test data, test results.
    - XMLification of components (DTDS, entity sets, catalogs, etc.)
    - APIs for software developers.
    - problems in implementation, and queries for XML-related resources
    - the use of existing SGML tools in creating XML resources.

 It is NOT appropriate to:

    - request general information on XML (use the FAQ)
    - discuss non-XML topics in SGML (use comp.text.sgml)
    - discuss revision of the spec (use the WG)

 The mail on this list is publicly hypermailed and all postings should
 be made with this in mind.  The hypermail is seen as a useful resource
 for locating information, and for current awareness as to who is doing
 what.  If there is sufficient volume, it may become valuable to
 abstract these pages from time to time.


 Peter Murray-Rust, Feb 21 1997
