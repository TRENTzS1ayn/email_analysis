On the internet, people scoff at the very thoguht of ISO standards because
they are not willing to pay to read them. If we want XML to be accepted we
must make the documents authoritative and self-standing. It is our job to
make XML SGML conforming (or not). It is an implementor's job to follow
what _We_ specify. We will not ease their task by making them read the ISO
documents.

That's the difference between an informative, and a normative citation. If
it is normative, we require thaqt they read both.

I think that this is socially, and politially unacceptable, and technically
unnecessary.

It is also implied by the goal of a 20page definition. If the definition is
20 pages,  and makes nromative reference to 8879, we have made things _more
complicated_ not _less complicated_.

If we add the HyTime standard, we have compounded this problem by at least
a factor of 2-3.

Compatible means compatible. I can define language A as a subset of
language B without making explicit reference to language B or its
definition documents, so long as the definitions themselves meet the
criterion.

    Clear enough now?

I agree that we should cite all relevant ISO documents for those interested
in further background, or in need of features we are not providing that
those standards do provide. Endorsement by the ISO is a feature that is
variably rated by our target users.
