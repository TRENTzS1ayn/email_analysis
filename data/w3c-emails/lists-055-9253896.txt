Good.  What of ISO 10744?  If architectural forms are used, 
what is the relationship?  On HTML, Dan Connoly has made sure 
that HTML to that degree designers thought prudent, is an 
application of SGML.  Will XML Links remain legal HyTime?

I know some don't care about that.  I do.

Yes.  That was a stupid remark on my part.  I apologize.

The problem is drift.  Does XML remain a subset in the 
sense the Dave suggests?  How is that maintained?

No.  I do have a question.

What is the dynamic relationship?  Does XML go on being 
a consortium specification for an application profile 
of an ISO specification?

That is exactly right.

I suggest if you need the opinion that matters, ask Charles.
