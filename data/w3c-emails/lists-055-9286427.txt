We don't need any more on this subject.  There are several key
questions relating to linking in front of you.  Given that the ERB
will be deciding these questions Wednesday morning and that they
probably won't be considering comments made after Tuesday afternoon,
you have less than 48 hours to put on record whatever you have to say
regarding the matters at hand.  If you have time to post something to
this list, it would be better spent addressing the questions before
you than revisiting decisions already made.
