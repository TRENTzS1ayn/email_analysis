You missed my point completely Jon

As you yourself point out, the point of cascading options is to overcome
accessibility problems. The key point in my message is the last quote. It is
no good saying "use my applet to point to the spot you want more info on" to
a blind person. Equally its no good saying "point to the red square in the
green circle" to someone who is colour blind. They need some way to "make it
bigger, with no background images and a sound explanation of each link". We
must have user over-ridability of link behaviour if we are to make XML as
universally acceptable as HTML.
