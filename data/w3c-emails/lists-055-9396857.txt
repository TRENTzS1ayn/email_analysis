I, for one, would like to separate out the information about the object
container locator and the contained located object. I think that doing this
will help to make the calling of referenced documents from cache or
alternative sources much easier.
The example of  xml-tlink="url (http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/p3) id (foo)
child (3 p)" appeals to me particularly because of its clear split between
the URL, ID and path navigation from ID components.
