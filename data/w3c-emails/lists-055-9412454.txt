So, structures like the nameloc/nmlist or nested FCS links cannot be 
legal XML Links?  Then it is not legal to state that a link can 
contain a series of IDs which are an aggregate of link targets?

What is liking information?  Does this mean that in 
the content of a link, (e.g, <A href="foo">bar</a>) bar is not linking
information?
