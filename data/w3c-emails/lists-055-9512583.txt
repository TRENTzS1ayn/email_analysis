Sorry, I thought from the subject line for this thread that "xlink"
was being proposed as an alternative to "xml-link".  Now the proposal
seems to be "xml-xlink" as an alternative to "xml-link", which is a
different matter.

I could go with

   xml-link

for the XML version of a contextual link and 

   xml-xlink

for the XML version of an independent link.  "Extended link" works for
me, too, and I like the opposition of (plain old) link (like the kind
you're already used to from HTML, only better) vs. xlink.
