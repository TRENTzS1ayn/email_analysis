I think we are talking about different things here.

The LINK-based syntax that I am proposing is intended to tell an XML
processor something useful about an existing document without having to
edit either the document or the DTD. It's just a way to let (say) the TEI
DTD say: "Hello, I'm the TEI DTD. You don't know me, but I have an xref
element type which I'd like you to treat as if it were xml-link."

Communicating this information can be accomplished without invalidating
the document with respect to SGML, using the syntax I propose.

You are talking about a scenario in which a user may want to specify
different attribute values on different instances of an element type--
which obviously requires editing the document. Trouble is, as soon as you
do that--and specify a value for an attribute which is "declared" using
a magic PI--you no longer have an SGML compatible document.

In short: The magic PI solution (<?xml attlist ... ?>) doesn't give you any
extra mileage. It's just yet more new syntax for something that already
exists.
