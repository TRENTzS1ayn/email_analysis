Uh, why was that, again?  If we have a reserved attribute named "XML-LINK",
used to select among somewhere between 2 and 5 different types of
elements that make up the linking machinery, then we *own* this attribute.
Why do we need to prefix the *values* with "XML-"?  It seems like

<A XML-LINK="LINK"> or <WHIZZY-POINTER XML-LINK="XLINK">

are safe and unambiguous.  

I suspect there was a good reason for this that I managed to miss, and
I can't dig it out of the correspondence. -Tim
