This might be because of a misguided fear that if we prescribe
a set of values for the XML-LINK architectural control attribute
then we'll be invading users' namespace for enumerated attribute
values, a la:

<!ATTLIST mylink
xml-link (link|xlink)#FIXED "LINK"
otheratt (foo|bar|link)#IMPLIED
    -- oops, duplicate token in attribute declared value --

This fear is misguided because nobody needs do it that way,
declared value NAME works just fine:

<!ATTLIST mylink
    xml-link NAME #FIXED "LINK"
    otheratt (foo|bar|link) #IMPLIED
>


It could also be that the value of the XML-LINK attribute
specifies an XML-LINK architectural form, and if we allow
10744-style architectural minimization (wherein GIs may
be automatically interpreted as architectural form names)
this would invade users' element type namespace.
