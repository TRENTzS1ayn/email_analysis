If no WG8 support is provided, and LINKTYPE (a la pepper) is 
not acceptable, the stylesheet option (Allen and Milowski) 
would be my choice.  Since we will be opening the 
processing spec phase soon enough, that would be a 
minimal path.

It may be that we did this in reverse order.  Understanding 
the options with the processing spec might make some aspects 
of the linking spec easier to understand and explain.
