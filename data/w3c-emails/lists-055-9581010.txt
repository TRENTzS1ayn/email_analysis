This can only be possible if the element concerned already has all the
information required by an XML link processor in the appropriate form. The
chances that an existing element will have user updatable scheme, locator,
caption and behaviour attributes already, with those names, is extremely
slim. (Hence my comments yesterday on the need to allow for the mapping of
attribute names.)

Yes, but what elements can they be used on? They cannot be used on the HTML
A because this does not have any of the attributes listed above. It cannot
be used on TEI links, because they do not have some of them. 

(Steve: If LINK could do the job I would be the first to support it - I am
one of the few who have been showing how it can be used effectively for the
last decade.)

It is a fact that no 8879:1986 compliant tool will be able to process
documents meeting ANY of the proposals made so far; PI, multiple processing
or LINK processing. They will all baulk the minute one of the attributes
defined by XML has to be added to an instance if it has not been defined as
part of the element's first ATTLIST.

What it buys you, if you start it with <?XML, is that it is a clear
statement that you can only process this document if you have a processor
that understands the XML notation - any other SGML tool will report an error
for it.
