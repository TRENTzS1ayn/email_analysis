This sounds like the "application engines" talked about in HyTime.
Does the ERB intend to draft an extension mechanism similar to the way
HyTime allows one to declare architectures to use with HyTime?
IOW, XML is the base linking architecture, but it provides the 
way to enable others to be defined for application conventions?
Or will this be something that remains defined in the HyTime 
annex?
