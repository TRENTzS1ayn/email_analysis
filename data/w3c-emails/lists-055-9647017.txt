You were talking about prose in the standard. I am not
too much of a person that is crazy about formal languages.
However, IMHO the less prose in the XML standard the better.
(But I think everybody will agree on this.....or not?)

I do believe the less prose, the more implementors
we will get. I have started to implement an SGML parser 
when I knew about SGML that it is something like Standard or
was it Structured GML.... :-) Putting down the productions
of the SGML handbook was pretty much straightforward,
but then ....

During the implementation of XML I tried to implement it the
way it is prescribed in the standard literally (like a person without
any SGML knowledge would do....) After all, one day we have to 
face the WWW crowd and guess how eager the will be to read
through lots of potentially ambigous prose.

When I tested XML first time against the XML test-instances I had 
to change the grammar lot.
(Especiall many S were missing the current draft. Maybe,
one day, I will have the time to put down all the *mistakes* 
I enountered)

Finally, if you think that my interpretation of production 33
in the current draft is wrong ,or at least not correct :-), then I 
just would like to know how one can deduce that (%par;) works in
XML.

PS: Just playing devils advocate......
