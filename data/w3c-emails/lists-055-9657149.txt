I took the sense of 4.3(6) to mean that PEs were treated in the same way
as other entities, though I agree that strictly 4.3 does not relate to
PEs.

The effect is important, of course.  For example, I have included HTML2.0 
in my DTDs by something like:

<!ENTITY % html20 SYSTEM "html20.dtd">
%html20;

Unless the PEs in HTML2.0 are processed, the construct fails.

[...]

IMO developing parsers and real examples are the best way to discover these
problems and I am very grateful to Norbert for his effort.
