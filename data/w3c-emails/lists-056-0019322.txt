Martin, go take a look at Panorama -- or any other ViewPort-based product --
to see why this is not true.

For example, in a Panorama style sheet, I can say that DIV is a table, with
H1 being a table cell.  Now, there are no CALS span attributes and no
colspec elements, but Panorama happily makes do with the subset.  Such a
style sheet ships with Panorama Publisher Pro.

And, of course, all the elements are different, as are the content models.

So I don't think this really counts as conforming to the CALS table model.
