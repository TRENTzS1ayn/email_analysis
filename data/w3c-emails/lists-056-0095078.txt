Validation is only an issue if you make it one--editors, for example,
have 
states where validation issues are ignored.  Browsers may never care
about
validity because it doesn't matter if the document conforms to a
particular
schema.

Perhaps it's better to say that validity *can be ignored* in the
abstraction,
not that it goes away.
