Yeah yeah, but that does not answer my question, at least the one I was trying to ask.

One more try. Let us have linking element:
 <a   XML-LINK="SIMPLE"
SHOW="REPLACE"
ACTUATE="USER"
HREF="http://www.elsehwhere//other.xml?XML-XPTR=ID(chap1.section2)..ID(part1.section3)">

I traverse that link. I understand the server-end constructs (or has) a grove for that document, and
selects or marks (or whatever) the appropriate nodes as the resource. 

I am in a browser. I expect a replacement text.  In what form does the resource get back to me to 
replace my existing text?  It cannot be XML as it is, because it will not be well-formed, unless we
define some conventions. Are you proposing now some binary grove-to-grove transfers instead?

Yes. But the document is in the memory of the server, and I want my fragment in the memory
of the client. What have I missed?  Is this in fact impossible in XML, and the XPTRs only
allow such fragments to be located and then used on the server?  (That would be fine, but
it is not at all clear.)
