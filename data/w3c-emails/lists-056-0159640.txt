Firstly, whatever insight I have comes from a long, thorough and very 
helpful article writeen by EliotK on xml-dev.  [Suggestion - Eliot has to
explain the same thing so often, that perhaps his collected writings could
be captured and distilled.  Seriously, it's worth having a Link (SIMPLE) to.]

The point which I got from Eliot's article was that one use of link
technology is to regard them as structural.  IOW they complement the use of
hierarchical containment (via Element content) to provide an arbitrarily
complex document structure, and where the difference bewteen links and 
containment is syntactic only.  I wish to use these links as structural, rather
than for presentation.  It is possible that I can and should invent some ROLE
that describes this, but the use of AUTO/EMBED seemed to be generic and 
valuable.  [It is isomorphic with the IMG tag in HTML:
<IMG SRC="foo.gif"> automatically embeds foo.gif in the document at that
point.  *How* it embeds it will probably be dependent on the way you represent
your document in memory and could either be a link to a blob, or could expand
the object as part of the grove.]
