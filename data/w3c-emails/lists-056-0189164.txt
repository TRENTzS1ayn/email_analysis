If links are the same kind of thing as formatting, then we should anticpate:

* an equivalent to inline attribute-based formatting like HTML <FONT> 
(i.e. SHOW, ACTUATE, BEHAVIOUR),
* an equivalent to CSS (drm's suggested stylesheets), and
* an equivalent to DSSSL (HyTime queries?).

Each of which will be useful to various groups. I don't  think one competes with the 
others, except for appropriateness in any given system and user group.

In any case, an application can ignore the values of any attribute it wants to. The SHOW and
ACTUATE attributes can act as defaults or hints for browsers in the absense of any other
policy.
