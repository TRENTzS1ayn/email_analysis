Looks good.  Simple.  Checking heuristics and prefering MIME to PIs 
in case of disagreement become (formally)  implementors' and applications'
error handling strategies, and outside the realm of valid XML.

If you say MIME and PI must agree, else it indicates a system error,
then surely you should also require  MIME and OS metadata must
agree?
