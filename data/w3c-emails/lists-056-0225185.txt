Jon Bosak has already informed you what the rest of the list knows
and will not revisit.  This topic has been discussed in detail 
by knowledgable and well-practiced members.  The design as 
written is the result of that discussion.  The relationship 
between behavior and link structures is understood and 
documented.  Given the schedule, now is not the time to 
revisit this topic as no new evidence has been presented 
to warrant it.

Your arguments and David's do not present any new information.
