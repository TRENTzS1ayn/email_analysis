So what does it gain you saying that a DIV conforms to the CALS table model?
It certainly doesn't help semantic interpetation of the type Andrew Layman
and Jon Bosak asked for as part of the namespaces debate. Of course you can
associate any notation processor with any element, but to convey meaning you
need to ensure that namespaces and notations match. For example, if I said
that notation HTML was to be used to process elements in namespace CALS, and
CALS was to be used process elements in namespace HTML, what would that gain me?
