[Daniel Rivers-Moore:]

| Having said this, I think it has been extremely useful for the SHOW,
| ACTUATE and BEHAVIOR attributes to have been placed in XML-LINK
| _in_this_early_draft_. Given that XML-STYLE has not yet been produced,
| and given that in order to start implementing XML-LINK, there has to
| be some way to specify how linked information should be presented to
| the user, putting it in XML-LINK is a valid _temporary_ solution.
| 
| But when XML-STYLE is written, it should include ways of specifying
| not only typographic, spatial etc. information about presentation of
| element content, but also behavioural information, both about element
| content and about links. At that time, the SHOW, ACTUATE and BEHAVIOR
| attributes should be migrated from XML-LINK to XML-STYLE.

You're missing an important point here.  xml-lang is basic to XML, but
xml-link and xml-style are optional modules that may be required for
some applications but not for others.  It is very easy to visualize an
application like JUMBO that is doing useful things with XML and needs
links but is not doing anything that would require a style language.
Saying that an application has to support a subset of DSSSL just to be
able to use links is not acceptable, and we have already concluded
that to use links minimally you have to have the SHOW and ACTUATE
settings.  So you will have those two attributes in xml-link no matter
what you get later in xml-style.
