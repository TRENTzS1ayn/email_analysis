DSSSL does have a cascading mechanism.  A DSSSL stylesheet can import
multiple other stylesheets (by means of the use attribute on the
style-specification element).  Rules in the importing style sheet override
rules in the imported style sheet, and rules in one imported style sheet
override rules in subsequent imported style sheets.  Specifying that a
document is to be processed using a sequence of style sheets can have
exactly the same semantics as processing it using one style sheet that just
imports that sequence of style sheets.
