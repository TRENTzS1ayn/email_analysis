Some quick comments:
(1) I assume it can also go in the DTD?

(2) It would be very useful to allow a TITLE attribute, so that a user
    agent such as a browser could display a such as:
    Styles:
         Large Print
        *Standard
         Grunge

(3) Are the type and href keywords case sensitive?

These are the ones I strongly favour.  (a) is of course Panorama's
current behaviour.

I think that's very sensible.  Perhaps the Web Collections work will
eventually supersede the use of SGML OPEN catalogs, since they are
(currently!) in XML, and can carry a wide range of other metadata including
certificates, digitial signatures, information on authors, publishers and
the generic Dublin Core metadata and so forth.  Certainly I expect to
see future web browsers use Web Collections... or at any rate, that
was the original purpose!
