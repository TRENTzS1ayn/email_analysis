Unfortunately as it may be, in almost every company I've visited that
has programming and software development as a goal, using someone else's
code is seen as harder than writing one's own.

I've also encountered companies with a policy of not using free software,
so that they always have someone to sue -- er. to blame -- er, to call
for support.

A restriction that a parameter entity can't be redefined inside a marked
section would make "dumb" implementation easier, I think, but might
also make one particular kind of customisation difficult or impossible.
