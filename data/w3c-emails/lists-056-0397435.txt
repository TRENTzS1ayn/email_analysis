My proposal (mostly identical, except that I left syntax inheritance out)
was ignored, but you should pay attention to at least _one_ of us... Joe's
proposal looks reasonable at first perusal.

The ERB seems to have had some discussion of requirements for namespaces.
It is hard for those of us in the interest group to really address these
requirements since they have not been explicitly shared -- at least not any
that require a new language mechanism. The only visible requirement is the
need to associate semanticsfrom different standards to elements of new DTDs
(or WF-only documents). Since AFs answer that need, the silence on this
topic is puzzling. Perhaps everyone simply agrees and that's why there's
been no more discussion?

We still have a proposed extension (namespaces) to address a solved problem
(AFs attach DTD-independent semantics to elements already). There may be
additional drop-dead requirements that make forging ahead into the unknown
necessary, but before we standardize on something new and untested, maybe
we should have a clearer argument.

Sorry for being grumpy, but I really don't get it...
