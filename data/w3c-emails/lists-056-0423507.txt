Not true Eve. I might choose to do link managment out-of-line. I might know
I want to link a point in a document to some point that is not currently
available (say the file is scheduled to be completed next week). How do I
indicate that I have a deliberate dangling link? By creating a one resource
out-of-line link! At present you model is location+ not (location,
location+). Lets leave it that way.
