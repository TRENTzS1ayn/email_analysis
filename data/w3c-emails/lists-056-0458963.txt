Here's an example close to my heart -- and to some applications or
potential applications out there as well.

Single-ended out of line links can be used to implement external tagging of
documents. This can be useful for marking up read-only unmarked documents,
or for recording alternative markup of a single document. Conventions for
expressing that semantics for links jhave not yet evolved, but are
certainly possible and useful.
