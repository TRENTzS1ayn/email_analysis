It should probably also be pointed out that a number of participants
argued strongly that information providers need the ability to
associate certain fundamental intentions with regard to their links.
This applied in particular to links that should always, in normal
browsing, be traversed without user intervention and displayed to
the user.  True, a style sheet in effect for a particular
application (e.g. a robot web crawler) might not always obey such
owner intentions; this was recognized and held irrelevant to the
key issue, which was the information provider's ability to give
an indication of the intentions.  At this level, these attributes
*do* inhere in the link rather than in the style, and so are
appropriately defined as attributes of the XML architectural forms.
