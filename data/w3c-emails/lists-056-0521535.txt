I would like to have some mention of the possibility of using
meta-data in Appendix E. Something like the following would suffice:

  I cases where it is possible to determine character encoding
  from meta-data (for example, HTTP headers), this information 
  should be used. It is a reportable error for the meta-data and XML
  declaration to differ.

Anything beyond this is unnecessary.
