This is an old debate in the hypertext data model discussion. The question
is whether links should contain type information or other semantic
annotations, ir simply note correspondences between items. I call this the
distinction between lightweight and heavyweight links. Since heavyweight
links with n endpoints can be modeled as lightweight links with n+1
endpoints, the debate is a bit moot.

Because of the architecture approach we have chosen, there _is_ type
information associated with each link -- given that, 1-ended links make
perfect sense, and has (at least) the applications that I have suggested.

Whether we call such semantics link data, link meta-data, or an implicit
semantic endpoint is irrelevant. In fact, I think that Hevyweight links
have a bit more power since the semantics is a universal attribute of all
links, and it is distinguished on all links as well -- whereas it just
becomes another endpoint in the lightweight case.

I suspect that this we are in raging agreement, but I want to make sure
that that is the case by making my position more explicit.
