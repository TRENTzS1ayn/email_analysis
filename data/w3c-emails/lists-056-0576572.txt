Yes.

Having recently been working on MCF, which is precisely a concrete,
machine-processable notation for namespace definitions, I feel a strong
need for a URI.

Yes, but it is woefully incomplete.  DTDs say nothing about data
typing to start with; extensible typing is the #1 base requirement
of everyone with requirements in this area.

This leads us to a big problem.  We want metadata that includes, but
is not limited to, the kinds of things you can do in a DTD.  What's
the solution?

As for the rest of Joe's proposal, I'm trying to do a summary of
where we stand... stay tuned. -Tim
