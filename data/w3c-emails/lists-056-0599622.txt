I like it very much too, but am a bit puzzled by the order of the 7 and 8
without the formal model. The text suggests that the more natural form mght
be TRING(8,7,"Literal") so that the number of occurrences of the literal is
always retained next to the literal itself. Alternatively you could say
STRING("literal",7,8) to  make it more obvious what order you do things.
("Look for "literal" 7 times and then move on 8 characters".)
