As usual, in catching up with a pile of WG mail, I came across one old
message that I wanted to respond to.  I believe my point has been made
implicitly in further responses in this thread, but I thought it was worth
making explicitly:

Notations do not apply only to external entities.  In 8879, a NOTATION
attribute on an element is meant to convey the notation in which the
element content is expressed.  XML has retained NOTATION attributes.

If notation declarations are used to declare namespace ID prefixes, then
they do indeed universally disambiguate namespaces.   Of course,
namespaceID:gi is a novel way of *using* notation names.
