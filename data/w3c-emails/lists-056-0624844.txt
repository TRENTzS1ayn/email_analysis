Occam's razor would indicate going with #2, since we need add nothing.  #3 is
certainly cool syntactic sugar, but it opens the door to messing with the
structure of the GI.  I've also suggested a different extension for error
recovery.

The next step will be defining regular expressions for parsing the GI to
determine which extensions are being used.  I don't say  that's good or bad,
but I suggest it will now be inevitable.
