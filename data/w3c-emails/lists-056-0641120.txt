For those that haven't read my note on XML-DEV Grif has announced
that it will release Symposia Pro, our HTML/well-formed XML editor
with certain XML extensions including the use of CSS with XML at
the end of June.

We like this proposal and are considering implementing it
in the forthcoming release of Symposia.

We very much like both cascading and merging behavior. So we'd opt
for 2 or 3b. If I understand 3a correctly is seems to complicate
things for the user and perhaps undermine the designer's control
of the presentation. Is the user supposed to understand the
relationship between the stylesheets? If 3a suggests that the option
should be available to the user but that there is still some
default system behavior we would be very amenable to that.
3b isn't very desirable; whatever is done should be done reliably 
in any system.  But anything goes is preferably to nothing allowed.

We are not sure we have a handle on the implications but we'd like
to ask if it is impossible to imagine retained cascading behavior 
irrespective of the type?  We do this already in a sense, cascading
CSS over our own stylesheet mechanism.
