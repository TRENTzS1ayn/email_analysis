Er, the idea is to provide the simplest solution that meets the needs,
not the solution that requires least work on the part of the people
writing the specification.

The use of Architectuaral Forms might require all XML processes to
read the DTD, in which case it might as well not be optional.

I don't agree with this at all.  C++ has :: in much the same way as has
been suggested for XML, and does not have regular expressions for parsing
identifiers.
