The ERB met June 18; present: Bosak, Kimber, Maler, Wood (for Sharpe)
DeRose, Paoli, Hollander, Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, Magliery.

1. On the issue of contextual/inline/independent links.  Formerly known
as "Link-5: Extended Contextual Links", the "tesuji" example.  We agreed 
unanimously:

We will add a new attribute INLINE to both simple and extended links.
The values are TRUE and FALSE, with the default being TRUE.  TRUE means
that all content of the linking element, excluding pieces of the linking
element's own machinery (i.e. child locator elements) are to be considered
a resource of the link.

We will add new attributes LOCAL-ROLE and LOCAL-LABEL to both simple
and extended links, which may be used to provide ROLE and LABEL 
information for the content, which, assuming INLINE="TRUE", will be
referred to as the local resource.  If INLINE="FALSE" but LOCAL-* 
attribute(s) are present, this is not an error, but the LOCAL-* 
attributes have no effect.

2. We agreed that the only sensible content model for both SIMPLE
and EXTENDED linking elements is ANY.

3. On the subject formerly known as "Link-4: Extended Linking Group 
Indirection", we decided that:
- the explanation obviously needs to be improved, many readers didn't
  get the idea
- we will add a new XML-XLG-STEPS attribute to the GROUP element
  saying how many steps the author thinks a processor should chain out, 
  in order to build the appropriate set of links.  However, this will
  be treated only as a hint and will have no required effect on 
  XML-Link processing.

Cheers, Tim Bray
