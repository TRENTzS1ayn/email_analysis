I agree that I'm getting testy, since I've posted 3 previous postings with
the argument clearly spelled out, I may have said to little. Apologies for
any rudeness, but the point still stands. I will repeat the argument again.

If you allow "importation" of elements from another "namespace", you need a
way to validate that this is legal according to the DTD.

But the reason you want to do this is because the element is _not_ legal in
the DTD.

Therefore the validation of multi-namespace documents needs to be defined.

So we have a technical argument that you can't have namespace proposals of
the form advocated without defining some new kind of validation behavior,
or without creating a blanket exception from DTD conformance requirements
for validating parsers.

If you want to do something other than such partial DTD importation, like
just attach unique IDs to elements of some sort, then you don't need
namespaces, just a convention about how to use attributes.

Clear now?

Attach an attribute. You can use Notation or ENTITY valued attributes to
associate an FPI with it, if you want.

(2) grouping names so that,

Each stylesheet looks at the attribute corresponding to its architecture. I
thought this was well-understood procedure by now.

If you use Attribute values to control processing, you can decouple or
tightly couple DTD and semantics at your pleasure.

As long as you stay away from allowing things in one DTD that are not
declared in that DTD.

I don't see a strong emphasis on this foundational point, and you're the
first person to respond to my posts on the issue, so I may be getting a bit
testy.
