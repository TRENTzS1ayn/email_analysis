This is exactly what "namespaces" (however poorly chosen a name) are
for.  In Andrew Layman's original example, I may need a book name from
a bibliographic DTD, a price from a financial DTD, and a digital
signature from the DSIGS DTD.  The namespace declaration, whatever
form it takes, is a way of signalling to the user agent that some
previously known semantics can be associated with certain elements.

Whether or not this is a good idea, is certainly open to debate.
