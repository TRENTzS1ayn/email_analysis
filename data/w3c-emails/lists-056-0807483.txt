I appreciate this.  As the WG knows I am particularly interested in non-textual
information such as:
<ARRAY>1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5</ARRAY>
etc.
and so can now use STRING(2,1," ") to locate the third number.
Is it expected that this whitespace is to be counted excatly as it appears 
e.g. in:
<ARRAY> 1.2 2.3   3.4 4.5</ARRAY>
or
is there provision for normalising it as in attribute values?  I appreciate that
it may be easier to require authoring systems to conform to (say) single spaces,
but it is extremely easy for counting of whitespace to produce errors and the 
possibility of normalising it would be valuable.
