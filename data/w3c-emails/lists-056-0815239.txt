I've read the subsequent discussion and tried to understand the implications 
of implementing #2; my impression is that there is a non-trivial overhead.
I'd like to support #3, as it's the easiest to write software for both at
parse time and postprocessing (and those are important XML criteria).  As a 
dirty webhacker I appreciate that this may be less elegant than AFs, but I 
think it's robust and easily understood.
