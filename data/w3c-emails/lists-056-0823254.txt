Whereas the validation of DTD instances against architectures is not only
well defined already, there is free working code to do it with (nsgmls -A
option). 

Given the potential downside of going with option #3 and getting it wrong
-- however "vociferous" the demand (*not* need, as David points out) for
it might be -- the maximum action to take for 1.0 should be to allow ":" 
in names, if need be, and "reserve it for future use" as for as the XML
application profile goes. 

P.S. I, for one, am very grateful to David Durand (testy or not) for
raising this issue. He has it exactly right. 

"Out of the tag soup into the namespace broth" sums the matter up for me.
