In complete agreement with David and Mathew.  

The argument of "not liked in WebLand" is irrational.   
It is all too easy to lightly dismiss a decade of work in which one did
not 
participate and does not bear one's imprimatur.

All redefining the DTD into uselessness does is increase the 
urge to abandon XML work and return to fixing SGML.  That 
process will be more rational than one in which faceless, nameless 
wordless entities set the rules, the tenor, and the outcome.  Nyet.

The XML reference to ISO 8879 must be normative to prevent precisely 
this kind of bad judgement and unregulated process.
