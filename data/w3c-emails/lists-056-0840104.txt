That is eminently sensible.  The only drawback is if the nameless
WebLanders 
begin to immediately propose, implement and market the solutions they
have in mind 
already as "extensions to XML".  Sound familiar?  The cats have not
changed 
their spots.  OTH, that is fear_by_observation talking and is not
rational.

To repeat:  make sure the reference to SGML is normative.  Then continue 
to negotiate with ISO WG8 which while a slow process, is working
apparently 
and will eventually get the optimum results with the highest confidence.
