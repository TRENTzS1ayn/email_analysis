David has a good point. A colon in the Layman proposal does not define a
"namespace"; it simply delimits a set of names within a single "XML element
name space" that have similar origins. Unless you have a mechanism that
clearly says "this GI name qualifier" is associated with the semantics
defined at URL.... it has no meaning. Calling it a namespace is wrong. When
SGML includes a properly scoped/nested version of namespaces within formal
DTDs (later this year hopefully) we will sincerly regret XML's poaching of
the word namespace to mean simply "a set of names that begins with the same
name qualifier".
