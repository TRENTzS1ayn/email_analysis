I think that the role of a standard is:
a) to clearly define what is a conforming implementation, and
b) to enture that conforming implementations successfully 
   interwork.
Although it is useful to show suggestions for implementors, a) and b) 
are the most important.

I do not think the current Part 1 fulfills a) and b).  Let me show 
an example.

Consider a proxy server that performs code conversion without rewritting 
the PI.  Consider a WWW browser or robot that does not understand XML.  
Such browsers or robots certainly exist now and will not disappear in 
the near future.  If they save a transfered XML document in a file, 
the header information will disappear and the PI will remain incorrect.  
Then, an XML parser is likely to fail.

Now that implementations fail to interwork, something should be wrong.  
I would like to know which one is wrong.   The proxy server?  The 
WWW browser or a robot?  The parser?  Is this clear from Part 1?  
Or, is this outside the scope of Part 1?
