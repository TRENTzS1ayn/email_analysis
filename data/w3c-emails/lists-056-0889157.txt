I agree that this should be allowed.  But given that, isn't your proposal
(1) unnecessary.  We can get valid XML documents that include namespaces
without it.  I agree something like it is nice, but I don't think we're
ready to standardize it yet.  On the other hand I think the basic concept
that gis have a namespace part that inherits is relatively straightforward
and uncontroversial.

I'm not sure I agree with this.  I can easily imagine wanting to combine
element whose types come from different namespaces but have them share one
ID namespace.  I'm not at all sure it makes sense to bind the ID namespace
to the element type namespace.

Agreed.
