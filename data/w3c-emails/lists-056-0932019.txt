The problem is how to ensure uniqueness of ids when you are cutting and
pasting things from different documents produced with different DTDs. We
need something that is as easy to generate in this case as HTML anchor names
(which are deliberately not unique) if we are to attract a wide range of
authors to XML. Scoping ids in the same way that you scope element names
within a qualified name in Henry's proposal might make it easier to avoid
conflicts (though by no means certain!) Whilst you might then want to
enforce uniqueness in the result as a system constraint it should not be
enforced by dictate.
