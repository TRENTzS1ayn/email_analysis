The attached file suggests a way in which XML extended links with a model of
ANY could *usefully* contain XML extended link groups as part of their
content. While I would find such models very very useful, before I go too
far down this line I want to check with those of you developing systems that
the concept of nested groups of specifications will not become an impossible
task for developers if this is permitted in Version 1.0 of the XML-link
specification.
