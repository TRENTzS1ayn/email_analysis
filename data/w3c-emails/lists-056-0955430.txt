This would make even slightly complex DTDs much more difficult to
maintain (as you know), and would strengthen the case for 1) eliminating
DTDs entirely from the spec and 2) never constructing them in XML,
rather producing one's document in SGML and filtering to XML.  It would
also blow away any chance of using familiar techniques to customize
DTDs, reducing the utility of caching them and stranding TEI users.

Of course, that's obvious.  But you say what you are leaning toward
doing without saying why, so it's hard to know what argument might
be considered relevant.
