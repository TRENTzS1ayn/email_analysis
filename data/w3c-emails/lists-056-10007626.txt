I am the co-editor with Martin Bryan of the Topic Navigation Map ISO
standard (ISO 13250), which is the continuation of an effort of
modeling done under the auspices of the CApH (Conventions for the
Application of HyTime) and the Davenport Group.

Topic Navigation Maps give to the users the possibility to structure
and control navigation strategies, and they can be used to emulate
(and simplify) the traditional paper-based navigational tools, such as
indexes, glossaries, thesauri and cross-references. Topic Navigation
Maps are views on information that are intended to be interchanged and
merged for Web-based information publishing and retrieval.

The extended link definition, as proposed for XML, contains the
mechanism that we need for Topic Navigation Maps, i.e. the possibility
to address information from outside. Therefore, it will be possible to
describe a significant subset of the Topic Map Architecture using XML
links. This will hopefully be an important application for XML links.

Topic Maps are formally described as an application of HyTime, and we
are now working on the syntax necessary to make XML links and HyTime
links (1997 version, to be published soon) work together.
