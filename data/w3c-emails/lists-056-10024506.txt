I sure can try.

Assuming alternative syntax proposals will be offered, I belive the issue 
is a detail that should be added to the problem statement. 

The syntax that differentiates between contents and attributes 
-should/should not- (choose 1) be inherited by children elements.

eg are these equivalent?

<head>
<meta xml-att="true" contents="some contents"\>
<meta xml-att="true" contents="some more contents"\>
<meta xml-att="true" contents="some end contents"\>
</head>

<head xml-att="true">
<meta contents="some contents"\>
<meta contents="some more contents"\>
<meta contents="some end contents"\>
</head>


or

<*head>
<meta contents="some contents"\>
<meta contents="some more contents"\>
<meta contents="some end contents"\>
</head>

<head>
<*meta contents="some contents"\>
<*meta contents="some more contents"\>
<*meta contents="some end contents"\>
</head>
