Always nice to hear that.

I don't really agree here. I think SGML will _not_ fill the role XML _may_
fill, so I don't think this is an option, at least for me.

I still disagree with this. A normative reference turns 8879 into mandatory
reading for implementors, and implies that _if_ there's a hole in the XML
spec, then 8879 may automatically be invoked to clarify things -- and I
don't think that XML can assume that 8879 will give the best solution to
unanticipated problems. The XML standard must be free-standing -- It's up
to us to make sure that it is.

We can't use 8879 as a crutch, but have to resolve our own problems here. I
may be arguing a conservative line on this issue, but it's not because I
believe that we _shouldn't ever_ extend on 8879, but that we had better
_understand_ any extensions we do, and _all_ the implications.
