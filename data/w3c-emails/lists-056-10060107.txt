I neglected to mention one other option in my earlier mail: why not just
stuff the data in attributes instead? This gets you the exact same savings
if you use a one-character attribute name for these cases, like "C" for
"content". Except where you have to quote, but since [-.A-Z0-9] are allowed
most RDB field types don't need quoting:

<FIRST>Steve</>
<FIRST C=Steve>

this does have the advantage of requiring no language changes at all, and
reflects the SGML tendency to put atomic information bits in attributes, and
structured information bits in content (though of course we're
simultaneously discussing that very notion).
