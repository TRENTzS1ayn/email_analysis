If these are only leaves with relatively short character strings, why can't the
data be stuck as attribute values of empty tags?  I.e.,

<name v="Andrew Layman"/><position v="XML dataslinger"/>

instead of

<name>Andrew Layman</><position>XML dataslinger</>

This has a fixed cost of 3 characters per tag over empty tags and doesn't
require changing the current spec.  (Note: this could be attacked as a kluge,
but I think it does the job.)
