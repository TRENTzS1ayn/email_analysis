James,

I must agree with Peter's point (b), in that while I've benefited from
the gracious efforts of several individuals try to explain to me AFs,
I still don't feel I've gotten an arm around it.

Perhaps if one doesn't already exist, someone could write an AF
tutorial with examples, similar to Steve Pepper's paper on LINK, which
did me a world of good (and probably brought headaches to those who
then had to deal with my newly-armed neurons...)

I think an online AF tutorial would be a wonderful help for many of us,
particularly as we move forward with XML designs.
