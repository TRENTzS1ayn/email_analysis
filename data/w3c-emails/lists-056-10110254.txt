intuitive enough and psuedo-element linking can always be achieved as a type

I presume you mean, element as opposed to subelement. "Proper" is an SGML
term for an element instance which is valid by virtue of a content model, as
opposed to by virtue of an inclusion exception -- which I presume cannot be
what you mean, right?

But still, how do we refer to content that isn't a whole subelement? That's
a major subtraction of functionality.

For example, it makes it impossible for external links to refer to anything
that the original author didn't tag: like, pointing to a word or phrase and
describing it as a typo, an allusion, a desired link origin, a noun, or
whatever. Bad thing to leave out of a language, IMHO.
