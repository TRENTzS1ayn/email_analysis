If one considers those just learning XML, particularly those coming 
from the world of HTML (where it's often tough getting across an 
understanding of the difference between tags and elements -- heck,
most of books on the market get it wrong...), trying to promote 
'pseudo-elements' is really going to confuse many people. Even if the
concept is understood in the abstract, how many people would be able
to accurately count that which they can't always even see?

Support for pseudo-elements sounds like an enormously deep hole to
put on the learning curve. I'd drop it entirely.
