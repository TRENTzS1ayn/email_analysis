If we view that as a major deal, it's easily soluble with a hack: since
there are only 2 cases, you merely have to represent somewhere which case
your locators assume. 

Or (better), choose a counting algorithm that keeps locators invariant
across the two cases: like, decide that pseudoelements consisting solely of
whitespace just do not count. Maybe it sounds stupid, but it also looks a
whole lot better to me than not having a solution at all.
