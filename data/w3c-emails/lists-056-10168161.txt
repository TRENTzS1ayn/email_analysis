The slippery slope is in putting in abbreviations. The primary
difference between a valid XML documents and a valid SGML documents is
that the XML document has *very few abbreviations*. That isn't a
definitive argument against the feature, but a valid part of one. Our
methodology has always been: "when in doubt, leave it out" especially
when it comes to abbreviations.

OMITTAG and SHORTREF also have compelling value for certain applications
such as data transfer. Using OMITTAG and SHORTREF, your database could
look like this:

<!DOCTYPE FOO ...>
a1|b1|c1|d1
abc2|abc2|abc2|abc2
aa3|bb3|cc3|dd3

That's pretty damn compact! So I think that the burden of proof lies
with those who claim that shorttags are different and will not open the
floodgates for other abbreviations.
