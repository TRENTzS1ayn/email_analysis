Yes -- SHORTTAG is quite different from OMITTAG and SHORTREF.

It seems to me that there are very compelling reasons _not_ to use
short tags for data transfer.  It is in fact the one are where I would

want robustness and the possibility of good error detection.

Several other approaches have been suggested on this list -- have you
considered these?
