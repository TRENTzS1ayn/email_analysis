You are right, of course.  I used the first because I assumed that a 
SYSTEM had to use a 'filename', but I much prefer the entity approach.

Anything that is 8879-style would be preferred  - my reading doesn't 
extend to these - even after your very generous present :-) <A HREF="#fn1">

<PROPOSAL>
We should identify a character (Tim has suggested ':') for indicating
hierarchy in qualified names for GIs.  Even if we can't resolve whether we
should use it *now*, it may help in internal representations and temporary
files.  '.' had the advantage of being DNS and Java-friendly, but maybe
it's a good idea to choose a different one for that reason.
</PROPOSAL>
