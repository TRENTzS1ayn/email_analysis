I don't want to clutter up the namespace discussion with (much) more on AFs
since I have a sneaky feeling that they will behave very differently for
WF and validatable documents.  I do not see them resolving the tag
collision in the InformationObject approach to responsible WF documents 
(i.e. components validated against different DTDs).

[...suggestion for tutorial + examples ...]

I have been surfing www.sil.org today and have made some personal progress.
I downloaded nsgmls (now I have a machine to run it on) and would benefit
very much from a simple example so I could just run it.  [The reason I'm 
taking bandwidth here is that I'm sure we shall come back to this in the 
next phase(s) or XML and it will be very valuable to have simple working
examples to help those drafts].  Since no one has (so far) said it solves 
our problem even using 8879 I'll let it drop...
