Yep, sorry. The confusion is magnified by the fact 'sub-element' seems to be used in this thread to mean part of an element's content (ie possibly character data).

Yes, I agree. But it is separate from the question of what CHILD(N) means. I'd like to see CHILD(N) mean the Nth child *element* and, in addition, would like some means of addressing character data.

For example, it makes it impossible for external links to refer to anything
that the original author didn't tag: like, pointing to a word or phrase and
describing it as a typo, an allusion, a desired link origin, a noun, or
whatever. Bad thing to leave out of a language, IMHO.

That was the very point I made in response to Tim's Link-6 post.
