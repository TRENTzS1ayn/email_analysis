Others have also suggested -- and I agree -- that we can
do without structured attributes because XML already supports
structured elements.

If you need to represent some thing in XML, and that thing has parts,
then it is best encoded as an element.  If any of the thing's
parts have parts themselves, they can be encoded as sub-elements.

Attributes can be used to encode the parts that don't have any
(important) sub-parts.

I agree.  Terseness is explicitly *not* one of XML's design goals.
