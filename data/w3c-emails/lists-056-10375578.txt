I'm still somewhat puzzled by the SUBDOC suggestion, since "shifting" into
a subdoc is supposed to establish a new parsing context (see p.90 in the
Handbook on Annex C.3.2), whereas from what I can tell the closest thing
to simultaneous namespaces -- which is my undertsanding of SD5 -- in ISO
8879 is CONCUR. However, having never used this, I have no idea how big a
can of worms I just opened here:-) [If I should be shot, could someone
please do that ASAP?:-)]

Nevertheless, drawing on simply the syntax of CONCUR-ed tags, the schema
could be placed in parentheses, viz <(schema)tag>. In fact, production
[28] in ISO 8879 says that's really a name group, so multiple schema
could also be placed within the parens, appropriately separated.

Complicates the parsing somewhat though (and calls for more than a
cosmetic change to the -lang spec compared with Tim's suggestion.)
