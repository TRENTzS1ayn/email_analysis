What reason is there to suppose that the word or phrase will be a complete
pseudo-element? You would have to have some mechanism for addressing within
the pseudo-element; and if you have such a mechanism you can use for
addressing the character data directly from the containing element without
going via a pseudo-element.  Pseudo-elements are neither necessary nor
sufficient for referring to untagged words or phrases.
