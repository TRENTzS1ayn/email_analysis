Do you mean

  {sets of elements} or {spans of characters}

or

  sets of (elements or spans of characters)

?

I think it actually

  {sets of elements} or {sets of spans of characters}

If your location source is a set of elements and you search within each
element for some word, then you get a set of spans of characters.  This
doesn't look very minimalist to me.
