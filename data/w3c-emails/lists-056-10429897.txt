Actually a more correct keyword would be "CACHE". Group is designed to tell
you what files you need to call into cache memory before displaying text
with AUTO includes, or to avoid delays when a user calls a file that has to
be called at some point in processing the file. It will normally be a
precursor to any Extended and Simple links that reference the same files.
