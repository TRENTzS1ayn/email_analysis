I am strongly supporting SD1 - Short End Tags, primarily with respect to
the useage of XML to exchange databases. In some examples from my desk -
we are exchanging data for engine management system - I was saving 40%
size of the instance by simply shorten the end tags.

Making Perl hacker?s life easier is ok. But if such kind of programs
want meet the requirements of error reporting (WF errors) they still
must  track the element names. 

There was a proposal to allow Short End Tags in Elements with PCDATA
only. I think this is hard to keep sure.

Therefor, I hereby propose, that Short End Tags are allowed in valid
XML-Documents. In this case, it causes no more effort to read the
document, since there is a validating parser.

On the other hand, the database people need a Database scheme, so that
they will work with valid XML-document primarily.
