I must side with Paul (and not just because I'm a desperate hacker in
no matter what language I happen to deal with;-). A 40% reduction achieved
just by shortening end tags indicates that there is more tagging than
content. Surely a database application can deal with
<A>
<b>foo</b>
<c>bar</c>
</A>

as easily as with

<author>
<firstname>foo</firstname>
<lastname>bar</lastname>
</author>

(and there you have a 46% reduction without having to change the spec...)
