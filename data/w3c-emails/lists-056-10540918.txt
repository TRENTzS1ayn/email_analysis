I am in the same position as Eric - I have never used HyTime or TEI and 
my knowledge is completely confined to the discussions on this group.
I suspect that I have severely misinterpreted parts of the spec.
I also find it difficult to understand abstractions without concrete 
implementations to help me, which is why I think (a) implementations and
(b) examples are critical at this stage.  I believe that the current spec is
not easy to implement and that unless some of the points that Eric has 
described are addressed, the July 1 version will not be crisp enough to
get multiple implementations that have similar behaviour.

Agreed.

As far as I can see - and I've posted on this - a link can can 0-N resources.
The number of resources is not determinable from the locator because it
may depend on the result of a TEI Xptr search.  If a resource is a Set of
elements/sub-elements etc., then it should be called a Set.

There is a potential confusion here because a link may be SIMPLE/LOCATOR
which locate a ResourceSet, or it may be EXTENDED when it contains a 
LocatorSet.  Each member of the LocatorSet locates a ResourceSet.

I think examples are essential.  Then we can comment on what we think they
(a) mean (b) do - if anything.  Also diagrams help a lot.

I assume that each Locator can only have one TITLE (attributes cannot be
duplicated).

I think there is confusion in the use of the wors LINK.  An EXTENDED
element is not a link per se, but a LINK-CONTAINER.  It can contain 0-N
LOCATORs.  In the special cases:
0 represents a null link
1 is essentially a simple link (its 'anchor' being at the position
of the tree/stream within the EXTENDED element (otherwise 
where is it positioned?
2 represents two links.  These might either form a 'double arrow'
or be two independent links starting from the position
in 'EXTENDED'.  If the implication is that there is a 
reciprocity, it's not spelt out.
3 can only reasonably be a trident-shaped link?
and N likewise.

In fact, as I write this, I'm getting concerned that JUMBO doesn't do what 
other people expect it to do.  Please comment on the following:

<P ID="one">
This is para one
</P>
<P ID="two">
and this is para two.
</P>
<LINKSET XML-LINK="EXTENDED">
This linkset has two ends
<LINK XML-LINK="LOCATOR" HREF="#one">
<LINK XML-LINK="LOCATOR" HREF="#two">
</LINKSET>

Now - I assume that the intention of the authors is that if I'm sitting on
"one" and click it it jumps to "two" and if I'm sitting on "two" it jumps t
one.  That's not what JUMBO does, and I suspect it's wrong.  [JUMBO treats
the links as a multi (bi-) headed arrow.  If XML-LINK was ACTUATE="AUTO"
it would immediately traverse to both and (say) light them up.

If JUMBO is wrong, and I suspect it is, then I would find it difficult to
see how there could be less than two LOCATORs in LINKSET.  I can see how there
could be more than 2 - this represents a complete graph for N components, 
although I don't see that traversal is a meaningful activity here.

'A link which serves as one of its own resources'. 
[resource] 'anything which happens to be reachable by the use of a locator
in some linking element'.
This looks wrong:

<A ID="foo" HREF="#foo">

would qualify, but is presumably not intended.

I suspect that bidirectional will be the commonest.  Multi-bidirectional
could be composed of lots of bidirectional links.

This will be application-dependent, I suspect.

HenryT has mentioned an 'implicit resource'.  Henry, could you elaborate

Independently, I am concerned about when Traversal takes place and may post
later.
