I see some (small? you decide) problems:

#1. Aren't empty elements also leaves? If all leaves are attributes, then 
    empty elements (e.g. <BR>) are "really" attributes. 

#2. As we discussed in the fall, if you think of character data as an element,
    you add an extra level to the grove. element-with-data has <pcdata> as a
child which has "data" as an attribute. The mythical <pcdata> element is a 
peer to elements we would consider "embedded" in the text (e.g. a <BR>) 
But the "traditional" SGML grove has each character as a peer node with
elements buried in it.

#3. "data" isn't a privileged attribute: its an unpriviledged one. Why can't
I express an attribute type for data? Why can't I express a default value for
it?

If you turn the problem around, the language should STILL be more regular in
its treatment of attributes and data.

*But* I **do not think that this should be corrected in XML**. We don't have
time, we don't have all of the right people here to discuss it, we can't 
create something incompatible with SGML, etc.  There will be an XML 2.0.
