If we keep "extending" the syntactic power of XML we likewise 
extend the complexity of the parser. A "simple, regular parser" 
only works on "simple regular data". You cannot increase the power
of one without the other.

For what its worth I think XML (well XML-Lang actually) is already
too complex and would have preferred a lot less syntax that we
currently have. We are on a slippery slope with empty tags - on the
way to pushing XML up the hill to the point where it will become
fully fledged SGML:-( If you need this power use SGML now! Lets
not make the mistake of reinventing it with XML.
