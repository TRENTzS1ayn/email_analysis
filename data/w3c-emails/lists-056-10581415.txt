Another approach is to have a header,
<header>
 <field element="a" name="firstname">First Name</field>
 <field element="b" name="lastname">Last Name</field>
 <field element="c" name="author">Warpper for Author record</field>
 <field element="d" name="id">Unique ID for database key</field>
</header>
<body>
<c><a>Parcival</a><b>Snitterpoop</b><d>1</d></c>
<c><a>Priscilla</a><b>Winterbottom</b><d>2</d></c>

and so forth.

This maps conveniently into typesetting tables, and also into the
common variant of CSV files in which the first line lists the field names:
    firstname,lastname,author,id
    Parcival,Snitterpoop,1
    Priscilla,Winterbottom,2
in which you can't actually distinguish the first line from the others
except by human understanding and inspection (ugh!).

I have added textual descriptions in the header; these could be omitted if
unavailable, with the possibility of making the "field" element EMPTY.
