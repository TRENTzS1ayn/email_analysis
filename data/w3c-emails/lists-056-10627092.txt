This item reaches "unstructured land" which makes it hard to use.
Therefore, it could be wise to leave it out from V 1.0 with respect to
the time frame.

Danger comes from mixed contents, as well as from entities. 

*Mixed contents cannot be ignored for practical reasons (Why
shall the adressing of a ressource be changed if it is surrounded to
achieve another rendering.

BTW: I played with lark a little bit, and saw, that in WF
documents anything is potentially mixed content (at least whitspace is
passed to the application)

*Entities my be one special character, text phrases or even
subtrees. How to deal with those, especially in mixed contents.

If it is to include in V1.0 I would suggest only to implement character
(not byte) count and word count which works on the textual contents of
an entire subtree.
