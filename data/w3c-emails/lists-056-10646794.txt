The comma would not be required?

I Really treat this one as the best solution. It does not conflict with
existing HTML - links.
I do not like languages, with many reserved words resp. where tokens can
only be identified with regard to the context.

This proposal resolves the ambiguity at the end of the expression.
Having nothing after the comma isn?t smart either.
