Perhaps true of HTML.  In VRML, failure to put the header with 
version will cause the world to die a draconian death.  So, 
folks do deal with it and editors put it in automatically. 
Interesting bit, it is actually a required comment.

BTW:  the VRML experience is one to look at where a minimalist 
language uses "parse or die" tactics.  When casting about for 
XML pro/cons based on "experience" one will do well to remember 
HTML isn't the only framework language out there.  In fact, 
reference implementations, test suites, and content lifecycle 
problems based on software cycle desyncs are getting to be hot topics.
