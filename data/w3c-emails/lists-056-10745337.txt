Exactly.  Here is the rub:  what is the market for XML if most 
low-level apps can be handled by HTML and <object, high-level 
apps are handled by SGML and things in between are Word or FoxPro?

The slippery slope is still the murky line between application 
developer rights and the rights of the specification of a markup 
language to restrict application development techniques to ensure 
interoperability over portable data.  Where is the line?  Why?

When one says "developed for the Web", does that have any real 
substantial meaning any longer?
