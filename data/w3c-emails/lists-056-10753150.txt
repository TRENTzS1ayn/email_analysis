Umm, what does one do for variants such as the multiple ways 
different cultures specify a date?  It is not a problem 
in a class (make a subclass), but how do you recommend 
doing that in the header without an extra level of field tagging?

It is a problem in some database applications.  In fact, the 
customization problems for these are getting to be enormous.
