I agree this is absurd.  But the conclusion seems to me to be that either

- we don't do character counting, or

- we accept that people are going to need tools to be able to create
documents that use XML link (or at least this aspect of it): they are not
going to be able just to use vi/notepad.

I think a system might quite reasonably choose normalize precomposed
characters into composite characters or vice-versa, since there's no real
difference in the semantics. If I've got a base character followed by a
non-spacing character, and the combination of the two is available in
Unicode as a precomposed character, and I've got a system that doesn't have
the machinery to render non-spacing characters, then it might well be
desirable for it to do the precomposition.
