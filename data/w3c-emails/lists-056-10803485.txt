The more I look at the arguments, the more convinced I am that
XML is not likely to be a meaningful format for distributing 
database-resident bulk data. This shouldn't surprise anyone: it
was never designed to do this. You want to ship bulk data, you
send a Java applet followed by a gzipped datafile, and let the
applet generate XML locally for the display.
