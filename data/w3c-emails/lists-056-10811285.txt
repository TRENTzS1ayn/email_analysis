[Liam Quin:]

| By now, though, a number of alternate suggestions have been made, and
| it seems clear (to me at least) that there is a large majority not in
| favour of allowing short tags, since they do not appear to be needed.

The ERB meets Wednesday morning, and we will be prioritizing all of
the subjects raised over the last week.  Based on the discussion in
the WG, it's a safe prediction that several of the recent proposals
will be eliminated from further consideration.
