I don't think I *can* have it unless the ERB says so (productions [3]-[6]).
How would I declare it?

I'm happy to have two (C++-like).  James Clark rightly pointed out
that my SGML was simplistic, but it can still be done - and
the result is prettier:

<!DOCTYPE CML [
<!ENTITY % fq "CML::">
<!ENTITY % mol "%fq;MOL">
<!ENTITY % atom "%fq;ATOM">
<!ELEMENT CML (%mol;)*>
<!ELEMENT %mol; (%atom;)*>
<!ELEMENT %atom; (#PCDATA)>
]>
<CML>
<CML::MOL>
...
</CML::MOL>
</CML>
