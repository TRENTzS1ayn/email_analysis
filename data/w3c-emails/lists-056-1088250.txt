Thank you Tim. I have been following the thread with great interest and
find myself distracted at some of the rhetoric that has been posted.
I hope everyone will respond to your posting as a cry for precision. 

Regarding validation

I would like to understand better just what type(s) of correctness 
testing may be possible with the <dc:name> approach.  As I see it, we can:
 1. perform well-formed testing
 2. validate...which portions would be able to be validated if only the 
"base" DTD is available?
 3. apply application specific tests to fragment content

I suspect these are sufficient for the example that was given.

Regards,
Dave Hollander

This is so true. The web's success provides it the high ground.
I must argue that the SGML lessons will help the web, not the web
must help SGML.  Since we are all moving toward a new technology, 
any point will lose if it is pressed based solely on the premise
that the SGML community knows better.  If that argument is used enough, 
the SGML foundation of XML may become suspect then challenged.
