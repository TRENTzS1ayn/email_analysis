Assuming that some or all of this proposal is adopted by the ERB key points 
that I would like them to consider are:
- all of this should be transparent to the parser (i.e. the parser
simply transfers attributes, values and content as at present.)
- if the ERB define a validation procedure for the XML-SQLTYPEs 
(and I'm not sure they should) it should be after parsing 
and before the application.
- XML only deals in strings and should not be concerned with the 
internal representation of these strings as other types.
XML should not require that an application carry out any 
operation on these types (other than transmitting them 
without corruption).
- if all the recommendations are adopted, and an application is 
required to do meaningful operations on these types including
conversions, there is quite a lot of work involved.
