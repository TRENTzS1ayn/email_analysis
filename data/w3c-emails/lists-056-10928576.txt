I vote against it unless it is a general solution.

Keep it out of XML-lang. This is an application issue, not a syntax 
issue.

Yes.

No data typeing for mixed content, unless the XML content model rules are
extended so that one can bind the data format to the content model (could
break SGML compatability). As I said before, I feel this is an application
issue.

>DT-6. Should the primary attribute name be XML-TYPE as proposed in [2]

Yes.

Yes.

Yes. Some definition of data size needs to be included.
