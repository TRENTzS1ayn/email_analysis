Over last weekend I pointed out that WG8 had asked me to submit a proposal
for namespace identification based on an extension to the existing mechanism
for using parameter entities to reference element sets. I have now managed
to complete a first draft of this proposal for submission to WG8, and attach
a copy of it herewith for the information of the XML community.
