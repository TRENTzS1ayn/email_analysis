I strongly favor this alternative.  The chain should stop when it
returns to an already-known document, but other than that, I think it
should be up to the application.  I can see some applications only
going a certain distance down the chain; others that silently follow
the chain in the background, updating the display as they go; and
others that just don't follow it at all.  This is an excellent space
for browsers to distinguish themselves in, and I think any one
prescribed handling will break at least one possible application.
