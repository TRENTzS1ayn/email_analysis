True; but remember that we cannot express in SGML the claim that ":" has a
special meaning within GIs. 

We could do so in XML, of course (though it would be tricky to allow
single-colon as any old namechar, yet reserve double colon as a delimiter).

gi ::= gipart
     | gipart "::" gi

gipart ::= namestart namechar*
