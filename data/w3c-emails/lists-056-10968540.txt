Wellllll, almost. The behavior is a little different because each DTD
applicable in a CONCUR document must fully cover the document instance,
right? This is not quite the same as saying "once I'm in this piece, this
other DTD applies" -- and it's not at all trivial to paste a chunk from one
DTD into another document and get it all to parse right with CONCUR, *even*
if you have already put "(dtdname)" into all the tags first.

(Martin, remember I'm one of those who quite *likes* CONCUR -- I just don't
think it completely solves this particular problem).
