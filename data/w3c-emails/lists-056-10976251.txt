I interpret this as trying to enforce a particular top-down parsing model.  At
the risk of appearing pedantic, the following revision appears to be legal:>

<?XML version="1.0" RMD='INTERNAL'?>
<!doctype bogus [
<!entity a "firstname">
<!entity b "/firstname">
<!entity c "lastname">
<!entity d "/lastname">
]>
<author>
  <&a;>foo<&b;>
  <&c;>bar<&d;>
</author>
