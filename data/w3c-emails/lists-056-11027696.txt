As I said in my response, I think it should return pointers to two
locations in the stream. Spans are only really useful if they can point to
arbitrary points in a document (i.e. not even well-formed element trees).
The mental model shoud be selections in an editor:

So if you had the following:
<MOL ID="H2O2">
<ATOM>H</ATOM><ATOM>O</ATOM><ATOM>O</ATOM><ATOM>H</ATOM>
</MOL>
<MOL ID="H2O">
<ATOM>H</ATOM><ATOM>O</ATOM><ATOM>H</ATOM>
</MOL>

and the span:
'ID(H2O2)CHILD(3,ATOM)..ID(H2O)CHILD(1,ATOM)'

you would be selecting a _region_ that overlaps two molecules.

To process it, you might ask to see the ESIS stream representing the events
between those two points. You would not get an element or a set of
elements, but instead something that might be repesented as 2 arrows
pointing at a tree, or the following string:

<ATOM>H</ATOM>
</MOL><MOL ID="H2O">
<ATOM>H</ATOM>

Yes, there is no stuff linearly between a tree and some part of its contents.

>(b) a WF element created by unstacking the unbalanced closing tags:
><MOL ID="H2O2">
><ATOM>H</ATOM><ATOM>O</ATOM><ATOM>O</ATOM>

Yep... You shouldn't get a guarantee of elements from span.

Seems clear to me. An endpoint should not be a sub-part of the starting
point. It just doesn't make sense. We probably do need to state this
explicitly.

Yes, but it could be 1/2 if only a partial element is selected. Use of
spans to mark alternative markup will regularly create cases like this.
That's one of it's applications.

The problem is thinking that a span can be treated as an element, or
anything like one. It's not, it's two points, identifying a region of the
document of interest for some process.
