The problem is, that if that is so, then CHILD(N) is useless for addressing
PCDATA in all cases.

Are you addressing the EMTPY tag <son/>?  If so, I didn't think that we
were proposing to lose it. The problem is only with pseudo-elements, not
CHILD per se.

But you raise the point that would be perfectly plausible to have markup like:
<PARENT>
<DAUGHTER/>
Julie
<SON/>
Joe
<DAUGHTER/>
Melissa
</PARENT>



and address "Julie" as CHILD(2).

If we bag pseudo elements (even the way I suggested, by concatenating them
all together), we lose that.

Fromn you other posts, It looks as though MathML would need something
similar to the above, to address PCDATA chunks between <SEP/>s. And this
seems a very legitimate need.
