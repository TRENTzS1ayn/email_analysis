This is the kind of link you can use to represent external markup. A
1-ended link is an assertion that the link body is relevant to the data
selected. The user-added atributes on the link may control a stylesheet or
retrieval process.

I thought that an "EXTENDED" was never contextual...

Sure, could be a pop-up menu of endpoints, could be an annotated
correspondence between two locations -- depends on your style sheet's
rendering for that _particular_ kind of link.

I would think this is wrong.

Many meaningful kinds of traversal come to mind: pop up a menu of possible
desintations; make a simultaneous display of several destinations; choose
one destination randomly and go there; etc... See your local stylesheet for
details.
