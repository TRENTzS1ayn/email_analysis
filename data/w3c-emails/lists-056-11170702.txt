You had me scared for a minute, but I don't think the XML grammar
allows this (it would be a serious error if it did):  where is the
license to recognized the entities within the tags?  There is none:
the Reference non-terminal occurs in the productions for content and
attribute-value literals, but not in the ones for start- and end-tags.

Whew!
