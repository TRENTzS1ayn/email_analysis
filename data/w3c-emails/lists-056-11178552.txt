Unless I missed the point, you are saying you want to divide a GI by a
colon 
to provide and application with a morphology for a namespace.  My
comment 
quoted above was that that was done in several applications of SGML 
using compound GIs (it was an Oster app where I saw it used) so it 
was doable.  Use of the colon doesn't seem necessary for that.  

What the ERB says doesn't phase me.  If it violates SGML rules, that
does.
