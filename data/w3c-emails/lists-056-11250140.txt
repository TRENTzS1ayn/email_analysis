No, I don't see that conclusion follows at all. You can build into the
applet whatever smarts you want: all I'm saying is that shipping bulk
data premarked in plain XML (or SGML) is inefficient. Having a
dynamically-generated chunk of JavaScript unwrap and rejig a
dynamically-composed chunk of data in some highly compact (?binary)
format might overcomes the transmission problem. The XML which hits
the browser should be the same as if it has been composed and
transmitted _en clair_.
