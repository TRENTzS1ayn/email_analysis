There's a fourth axis: Which software module should be in charge of data
type validation, the XML processor or an application?  A number of people
were pointing out the work involved in implementing some such validation
schemes, and it may put us far outside XML-Lang's "development budget."  If
we make XML-Type a separate spec, the existence of a type-validation
application would be implied, the way XML-Link implies the existence of a
link-processing application.
