I'm with Chris Maden, in favor of (1).  I think the spec should say
more explicitly than it does (but sorry, I don't have wording) that
a GROUP element serves as a signal to the application that there are
(or may be) links involving the current document, whose existence
is asserted in the documents referred to by the enclosed
DOCUMENT elements.

Given the confusion that has reigned over the question, perhaps the
spec should also mention explicitly in passing that those links may
take the form either of n-way links (EXTENDED) or simple links
(SIMPLE).

I'm inclined to think we should *not* need to say "A browser might
invite the user to specify which of the documents listed, if any,
should be read by the browser in order to discover links into the
current document."  That seems an obvious behavior to me, but it's
probably too obvious to need mentioning -- unless of course it's not
obvious at all, in which case it may not be as good an idea as I thought.
