Tim Hyland (hyland@uplanet.com) has asked me to solicit your comments
and suggestions as a group of SGML/XML experts regarding a proposed
Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML).  The designers of the language
wish "to understand better how HDML and XML intersect and if it is
possible to recast HDML as XML."

The pointer to the HDML specification is:

   http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Submission/1997/5/Overview.html

If you are interested in helping out with this, please respond
directly to Tim Hyland at the address above after reviewing the
specification.  DO NOT POST TO THE W3C-SGML-WG LIST.

Jon
