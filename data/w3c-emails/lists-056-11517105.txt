I am against adding data typing as another XML-lang validation issue.
I'd prefer "validating XML-lang" and "validating data types" to be separate
(orthogonal) issues/features/modules/whatever so that an "XML-datatyping"
spec (misleadingly named, since it would be data typing for all SGML) could
be used (or not) independently for XML or SGML applications.

I'd entertain some sort of "datatyping=yes" attribute on our introductory
<?XML ... version="1.0" ... ?> PI, but the default handling of XML should
not require datatyping.  It just isn't necessary to require that of all
XML processors.
