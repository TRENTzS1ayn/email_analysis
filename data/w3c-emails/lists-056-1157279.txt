Precisely why I way that we must rely on HTTP header. I'm starting to
think that Rick's proposal of requiring servers to remove the PI
is a good idea.

I have argued for treating the PI as a header a number of times, or
using an alternate header syntax. If we formalise it's role as a header,
then it should be possible to strip it without altering checksums of
documents etc. but unfortunately, it also include RMD and VERSION...
