You started by asking the question "is there always a DTD?"  The answer
is yes, as you've just demonstrated.  And by the only definition of
validity that I know, it *does* produce validity information.  The
document matches the DTD; the document is valid.  Q.E.D.

Now you seem to be wanting to restrict the question to 'good' or
'real' DTDs.  I know that Tim leans that way, too.  You're chasing
a chimera.

There are at least two implementations of grammar generators which
will produce something resembling a DTD from an arbitrary well-formed
document:  the well-known Fred, at OCLC, and a program in Lisp
written for a thesis in Oslo (? or was it Bergen?) by S. Solstrand
a few years back.  Her work deserves to be better known, but that
would probably require an English translation.

Whether these programs produce 'real', or 'good' DTDs in the sense that
I believe you are subliminally using these terms, I cannot tell you,
since I doubt seriously that a meaningful definition can be given that
allows 'real' DTDs to be distinguished reliably (formally, mechanically)
from DTDs in which every element has a content model of ANY.
