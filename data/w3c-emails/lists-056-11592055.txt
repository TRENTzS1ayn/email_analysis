Yes. I agree that it is important to keep a document integral.  A
document may use different namespaces in different parts, for example
mathematical formulae in one section and chemical markup in another.  It
should not be necessary to split the document into several physical
files to achieve this.  Further, an author may want to use both
mathematical and chemical symbols in close proximity, interleaved even.
This should be possible within one file.
