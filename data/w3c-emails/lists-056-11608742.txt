I had to think about it.  Old apps that took this approach
post-processed 
(at least after the SGML parser was done).  You want the XML parser to 
help.  Ok.  That makes sense.

That argument is strange to me and always will be.  We are waaaay past 
the average bear at this point anyway and SGML is only hard if one 
has to write the parser.  I suspect before we are done, 
we will have SGML Lang and XML app for everything else.  But hey, 
eternal optimism here... :-)

At least, keep up the discussion.  The ERB can come down to a 
simple majority and nothing guarantees it will be the most 
technical of the collective.  That is why this chorus is 
here.

Yes. OTH, if developers really need this now, we have to address it now. 
That is good.  If we find a workable and acceptable method, then 
SGML WG8 (most of whom are here lurking somewhere) gets to see it 
worked out, tested, shredded and ammended. Then if it still makes sense, 
they have a very firm basis for adoption.  I think that is a good
process.

Sure.  Now, can we say in short sentences what the requirement(s) is?
That would probably help the authors of the spec as much as anything.

Yep.  It's the other part of XML and it needs work.  The folks to do
that are certainly here.  Most of my day is now spent looking at
commercial 
relational database apps, so I can only sit and learn from you at the
moment.
