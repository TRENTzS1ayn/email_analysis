Discussions surrounding the development of the XML specification have
generally been based on technical merit and feasibility. Considering
that Microsoft has no external product, I assume the allusions you keep
making to your 'customers' refer to people working within Microsoft on
projects that may or may not be targeted for the open market.

Unless you've had that hidden team of 1000 programmers working night and
day on XML and are already selling into some unknown foreign market, you
have no more or less 'customers' than anyone else in this group. We all
have 'customers' (or more correctly, 'potential customers') that we wish
to serve, and the correspondent pressures from within and without our
companies and organizations.

Allusions to 'market pressure' that so dominated (and polluted) the last
days of the IETF HTML working group should have little bearing here, where
I believe the goal is to produce the best specification possible, one that
generates the _widest_ possible audience of developers and real customers.
