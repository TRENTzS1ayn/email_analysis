"islands of validity": An interesting concept. I have often observed 
that in the past I have tried to impose validity on entire corpus when 
there was only a small part that I was really interested in being valid,
as extended beyond the well-formed requirements. Indeed, when
I look at html and validation, it really is only a small portion
of our web pages that I am really concerned about, specifically
forms and meta-data, the rest I just want to parse cleanly.

What about the other side of the coin, if there is a DTD for mydoc, but
not for formula, can you have a valid document with an opaque bubble?
Is there any way to make this a SGML valid concept? If the mydoc DTD 
had formula as any would be be ok?

<Tagent-question>
How is validation with ANYDTD interesting? Only for the smart editor?
