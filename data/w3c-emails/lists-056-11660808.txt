You were wondering who I meant by "customers."  I mean all the various
potential users mentioned on
http://www.packet.com/packet/97/20/index2a.html. I mean largely the
groups such as the digital signatures initiative, the PICS labels people
and the OCLC folks. 

I don't know what you mean by "technical merit."  To me, it means
applying technology to serve people's needs. Part of accessing technical
merit to me is to talk to potential customers of a technology and ask
them what they hope to do with it.

As John, Tim and others have observed, we have a lot of issues in front
of us.  Narrowing the focus to those features we have immediate need for
is simple economy.  

If you have some customers whose priorities conflict with those I
mentioned, please let us know who they are and what needs we are
overlooking.
