Does the "if any" mean that it may not be possible to construct a DTD to
match the name domain? In what way could a doctype FOO not be associated
with a name-domain FOO? (Perhaps you mean "a name space does not
_necessarily_ equal an _existing_ DTD"?  Basically, I'm not seeing the
point of the distinction you're drawing.)

Can I use an attribute from one namespace to qualify a GI from another
namespace? (Actually, what could that accomplish?) If I can't, then does
the namespace of the GI fix the namespace for its attributes? Could you
clarify this, please?

Sorry to be harping on this, but what happens with colons in attribute
names? Will there be an extra well-formedness/validation constraint
involved? I think an example with attribute usage would help a lot.
