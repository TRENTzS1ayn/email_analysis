The overall document would be valid if either:
1.  the mydoc DTD had an ANY declaration for formula *and* all the elements
    that could be inside forumula, or
2.  if formula changed its content's namespace to some other DTD and that
    DTD had an ANY declaration for all the elements.

If you want validity, you do have to have a declaration for every element.

An ANY DTD is basically an 8879-compatible way to give a list of
elements names that can be combined in any well-formed way.  Validation
against such a DTD is effectively equivalent to just validating
against a list of allowable element names.  As such, it's only
'interesting' in that it is as close to well-formed as you can
get and still be able to validate.
