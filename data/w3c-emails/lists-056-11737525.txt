[Discussions about sets of elements, and what xpointers 'return', etc. deleted]

I'm with David on this one:  links connect resources, those resources
are identified by locators.  Vanilla locators identify a single point
in a document.  Span locators identify a pair of points in a document.
End of story.  Nothing is returned.  What applications do with a span
is up to the semantics they implement for their link types.

See how easy things are if we eliminate processing language [hint, hint :-]
