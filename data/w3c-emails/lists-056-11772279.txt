There is a difference - its a scoped CONCUR. What we are really talking
about is having a CONCUR constuct that has the well defined scope within the
instance of a SUBDOC (while at the same time being able to cross-reference
from scope to scope.) This is the new beastie that you need to deal with
on-the-fly fragment concatenation. The real question is "What is the role of
a DTD when you do on-the-fly fragement concatenation?".
