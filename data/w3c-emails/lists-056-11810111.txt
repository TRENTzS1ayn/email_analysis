Well, the standard says:

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This seems to imply that in:

  <!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ENTITY % pe   "'">
  <!ENTITY % pe2  '&pe;&pe;' >
  ]>

pe2 would be expanded to '''', which is illegal.

I should note that neither NXP nor lark can handle my example.
