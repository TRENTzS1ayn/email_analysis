Tommy,

As Dave D has correctly pointed out in the namespace issue, it is 
important to acknowledge that your sense of the tradeoff. Your 
description of the tradeoff is exactly what I was thinking as we 
discussed the issue. However, for me at least, it is a technical, 
not political, issue.

As I view the scales, simplicity and the functionality of namegroups
and namespaces out weigh the implementation costs associated with
parameter entities.

No, but they do provide for the most common usage of parameter entities
that I am aware of. The other use that I would be alarmed if we lost is 
their use in modular DTDs. I believe that the ultimate "namespace" 
solution with fragments combined in the instance, not the DTD, will 
support this need.

However, I do not use parameter entities often. Could you list other
significant features that would be lost?


Regards,
Dave Hollander
