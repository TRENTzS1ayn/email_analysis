This is a good point, but it's not a fatal flaw of the proposals, just a
good feature to add to them. I'm rather dubious about the namespace issue
(as I intend to say later on), but I don't think that scoping is a problem
for any of the proposals other than the high colonic -- and that proposal
simply avoids the problem by requiring full qualification.

   FWIW dynamic scope is definitely useful in some cases, and we should
make sure not to forget to examine techniques and implications of it for
anything we decide.
