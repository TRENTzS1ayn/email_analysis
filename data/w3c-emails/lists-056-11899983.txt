My understanding of the recent discussion on architectures is:

Architectures propose that the meaning of an element be separated from
the element's name.  That is, we have one thing, the name, that is used
in the tag and referrs to some structural information in a DTD.  Then we
have an attribute.  The attribute refers to something else that tells us
what the element is really all about.  In an extreme case, we could have
something like 

<X>
 <X whatitreallyis="ORDERS">
 <X whatitreallyis="LINEITEM">
 <X whatitreallyis="NAME">Number, the Language
of Science</X>
 <X whatitreallyis="AUTHOR">Dantzig</X>
 <X whatitreallyis="PRICE">5.95</X>
 <X whatitreallyis="ZONE">9</X>
</X>
</X>
</X>


Before I go further on this line of reasoning, I want to check: Do I
have this much right or am I mixed up?
