Except for this sentence, I agree with the rest of Tommie's posting.
I want to lose PE's and am willing to accept that for people who need
to live in a complex-DTD world, they'll probably have to use Full SGML.
But Eve is correct, I think, in saying that namegroups in declarations 
do replace one or two common PE usages.

My willingness to make the the trade-off is because despite really a lot
of work by myself and (even more) Michael, the PE section of the XML-lang
spec is blatantly hideous compared to the rest of it.  It is hard to
explain, hard to understand, and hard to implement.  It needs a supporting
section in an appendix to try to "explain" it (always a bad sign). It is a 
psychological barrier to the acceptance of descriptive markup.

Partly because this because the current PE reference replacement rules 
are arguably B.A.D. (broken as designed) - Michael and I came up, I think,
with a significant innovation in specification tactics in the use
of the %-operator, and the result is still very very complicated.
