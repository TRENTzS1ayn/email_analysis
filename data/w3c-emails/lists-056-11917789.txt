What happens?  Nothing special.  You have a long, strange name.
However, I suspect that you mean to imply something that I miss.

Frankly, I would prefer that colon were reserved to separate the
namespace part of a name from the rest, but I gather this would be hard
to fit into the confines of SGML.
