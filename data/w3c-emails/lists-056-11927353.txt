I have no objection to using CONCUR syntax if it has the same meaning as
the proposed namespace qualification.  It was my understanding that
CONCUR did not permit DTD mixing.  If my understanding is wrong--if
CONCUR does allow attributes and elements from multiple namespaces to be
used within one element, without changing any DTDs--then using
parentheses is fine with me.
