Not really; SGML can easily be set to allow colon in names; in its current
state it just could not *validate* that you only use the colon that way.
But, it can't validate that you use semicolon on the end of entity
references or that you only use #PCDATA at the beginning of a content model,
either. Those are all XML conventions that restrict the range of SGML
alternatives that XML may also use.
