Sorry, my fault for overloading "qualify". Assuming ':' is the name
component separator, I was basically asking about a construction like

   ... <X:FOO Y:BAR="baz"> ...

where within the same start-tag, an attribute is drawn from some other
namespace than the element. Is this kosher?

OK, I take this to mean that in <X:FOO BAR="baz"> BAR comes from the X
namespace. (Aside: one problem with the *term* "namespace" is the usual
connotation of uniqueness within it: yet in DTDs, element names and
attribute names are allowed to "clash". Is this a problem?)

Again, basically, can <X:FOO Y:BAR="baz"> be considered a well-formed
start-tag if attributes from "foreign" namespaces are verboten One way to 
look at this is to ask "Is it part of the XML parser's job to detect
namespaces and report an appropriate parse event to the application?" Or
is the detection of qualified names a job for something downstream?
