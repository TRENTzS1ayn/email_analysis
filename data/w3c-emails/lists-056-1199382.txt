It seems odd to me that we are going to add complexity to help people who 
need to publish databases but remove complexity required by people who need to 
publish large, complex documents adhering to large, complex DTDs. Aren'

*here*? I am concerned about this shift in focus from publishing large 
documents to solving the world's problems.
