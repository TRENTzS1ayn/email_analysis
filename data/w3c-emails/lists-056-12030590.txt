ARjun Ray asked a number of good questions asking for clarification of
the namespace proposal.  These are copied below, with answers preceded

[Andrew Layman] Yes. I intend that attributes can include
namespace qualifiers.

[Andrew Layman] Yes, BAR comes from the X namespace.
(Aside: The namespace proposal does not affect the issue that in
a DTD the attributes and element names are allowed to clash.)

[Andrew Layman] This is the key question here. It is not the XML
parser's job to detect namespaces. Applications that care will break out
the namespace part of the name, and look for a matching namespace
element. This could be a standard support routine shipped with parsers,
but is not--strictly speaking--a parser's job. Similarly, I do not see
validation as part of a parser's job, but as something that is (at least
logically) layered on.
