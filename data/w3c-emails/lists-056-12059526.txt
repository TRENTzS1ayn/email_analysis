I don't think you'd want to allow this, and I'm not even sure it makes
sense:  by definition of what it means to be an attribute (even in
the natural language sense), how can "an attribute of some element in
the Y namespace" be an attribute of "the FOO element in the X namespace"?

Actually, please just consider that a rhetorical question (we don't need
the extra email philosophizing on this concept).  Just explain the user
requirement this could possibly address if any.
