For authoring large complex documents, we already have an excellent
solution: SGML.  For delivering them on the Web, XML does just fine;
it will be trivial to generate documents in an SGML system just
dripping with inclusions and PEs and &-groups and whatnot, and 
pump out the instances, which will be well formed.

The fact that this document delivery format is being embraced by
some unforeseen application groups is a pleasant surprise and not
one of the things we set out to achieve.  And Berners-Lee was just
trying to support collaborative Physics research.  And yes, it 
seems to quite a lot of us that we should indeed go to some trouble
if as a result we get to capture the world's metadata in a relatively 
sane format.  Metadata *definitely* looks like a nail to me. -T.
