Thank you, Eliot (and Jim!).

After a half-hour's struggle with the MS Word document at this URL,
I've tagged the file in TEI Lite and translated it into HTML; those
who are, like me, Word-less (in the software sense!) can view it at

   http://www.uic.edu/~cmsmcq/tech/n1873.sgml

P.S. if you encounter errors viewing this with Panorama, let me
know; I think the necessary files are there and in good shape, but
I have not tested this document in Panorama on the net.
