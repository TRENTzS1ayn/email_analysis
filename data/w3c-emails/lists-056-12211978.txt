Reading a clean copy of the HTML version I made from the MS Word
copy of N1873 a couple of hours ago, I discovered a gap in the text.
When I went back to the original to see if the gap was there, or
owing to a flaw in my processing, I discovered (a) the gap was in the
original, but (b) there was an even worse flaw in my processing,
and I had somehow managed to extract from the Word file what appears
to have been part of an undo or history data structure.  I found
in the file another version of the text which not only had no gap
but had more sections.

If you got the HTML and it had three sections, fetch a new copy.
If you tried to get it and it wasn't there, I apologize for the
interruption of service; it's now there again, and this time I
hope it's correct.

If someone who does have MS Word could look at the original and
confirm that I now have something approximating the correct text,
I'd be grateful.  Apologies to Dr. Takahashi and to Jim Mason if
I've still got it wrong.  I'm sorry, but I'm not going to read this
again before I go home.
