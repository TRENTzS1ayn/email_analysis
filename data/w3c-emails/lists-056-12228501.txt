Thanks for the qualification.  I meant only that one can read a
well-formed XML document, producing a tree (grove) of its parts, without
actually going to the second level and validating it, so I see that we
are in agreement.

I don't mind being educated on specialized use of terminology.  (Though
I'm still getting over the shock I had when I discovered three
different, vocal user communities all using "meta-data" to mean three
wildly different things.)
