I'm surprised to hear you say that.  To me they seem about as different as
two proposals on namespaces could be.  The Japanese proposal allows separate
DTDs to be combined into a single DTD by using separate namespaces for each
DTD's elements.  It then allows instances to be created that conform to
those DTDs.  It thus allows me to create *valid* XML/SGML documents with
elements from multiple namespaces. As far as I can see you proposal
addresses only well-formed documents.  I don't see how it helps if I want to
create a valid document:  to do this I need to compose multiple DTDs into a
single combined DTD, but your proposal doesn't even mention DTDs.
