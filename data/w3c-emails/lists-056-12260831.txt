IF the namespace problem can be substantially addressed by architectures
AND IF we had an XML "DTD for DTDs" spec.

would it follow that namespaces (+ validation of docs with multiple
namespaces) would become a XML-Link solvable problem, tractable
without any extra syntax stuff?

Basically what I am asking is can we reduce the namespace problem to
a special case of another problem.

BTW I am not suggesting that I have a clue what "validation" with
multiple namespaces would actually mean:-)
