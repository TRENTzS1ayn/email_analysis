Sorry to have pushed the wrong buttons.  The aspect of 'returning' I
was worried about was at the top level as it were -- i.e. the problems
we get into in trying to speak about what 'the processor' passes to
'the application'.  I THINK what my answer is is clear given the part of my
comment I reproduce above, with the clarification that (modulo the
pseudo-element question being discussed in another thread :-) by
'point' I mean (singular) resource, i.e. (grove) node designation.  In
the example to hand, that means a pair of nodes, one inside the other.
Whether or not that makes sense is up to the application and the
semantics it attributes to spans.  I don't think it's our business to
rule out a sensible semantics for such a pair a priori.

I also don't think we should rule out "ID(C)..ID(A)" (inside-out) or
backwards spans.  Spans are just a suggestively named way of locating
a pair of resources in a single locator.
