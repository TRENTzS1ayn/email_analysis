This is one issue where one might take a lesson from Dr. Goldfarb's 
speech on standards authoring:  he called it, "the law of conservation
of
nouns".  It's a definite DUH, but Lee is quite right that some 
terminology disambiguation will help clarify the discussions.  It is 
also something to feed to the FAQ.  Schedules being what they are, 
there may not be time to do it on the list, but such a list of 
terms might speed things up once done.
