Yes. Under the current terms and relationships, that is the best goal.

This is true, but harder.  Implementation guidance in VRML
specifications 
is being decided after the fact of language specification
in the process of conformance testing design.

However, VRML is a single application language.  Is XML?  What 
levels of conformance are tested for XML and how is that related 
to implementation certification? I think deciding that will make 
it easier to decide where the lines are.
