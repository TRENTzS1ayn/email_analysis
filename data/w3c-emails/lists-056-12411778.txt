The Language Technology Group is pleased to announce the beta release
of LT XML, the first publicly available XML toolset written in C.

For further information and access to the software distribution, see

  http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/xml/

The LT XML tool-kit includes stand-alone tools for a wide range of
processing of well-formed XML documents, including searching and
extracting, down-translation (e.g. report generation, formatting),
tokenising and sorting.

LT XML is an integrated set of XML tools and a developers' tool-kit,
including a C-based API. The beta release now available is UNIX-only,
but a WIN16 version will be available in the near future.

Sequences of tool applications can be pipelined together to achieve
complex results.

For special purposes beyond what the pre-constructed tools can
achieve, extending their functionality and/or creating new tools is
easy using the LT XML API, which provides both event-oriented and
tree-fragment oriented access to the input document stream. Minimal
applications require less than one-half page of C code to express.

LT XML is available to anyone free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
