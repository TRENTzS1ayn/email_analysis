Firstly, apologies to Mr. Bullard and Mr. Quin for misattibution
in a recent post.

With regard to that posting can anyone confirm or deny that
a RAST/Grove/extended ESIS description of a parsed XML doc
is desrable for parser dev. / conformance testing?

NXP and Lark parse XML. Do they produce the same result? How is
this known?

In the months and years ahead, many products will claim XML
parsing capabilities. How will such claims be gauged?
