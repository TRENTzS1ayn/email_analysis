I'll take the bait.  Here are three questions that arose in testing
our parser:

1) If a dtd declares an attlist in required markup, and an element
appears in the instance with an additional attribute, is the doc't well-formed?

2) If an start tag appears for both an empty and a non-empty element, is
the doc't well-formed?

3) Are Names which are 'matched' folded up before they are delivered to
an application, e.g. gis, attr names, and in particular, PI names?
