I did not really ask for a grammar generator. My point was, that there
might
be another level of "well formedness", where an XML can rely on a known
structure
even if the document is not parsed using a DTD, which lead me to the
proposal
of "well structured" documents.

I also don?t want to specify quality levels of DTDs. 
My intention was to make it easier to handle XML documents:

use a simple parser (non validating parser)
make application simple and robust by having a limited set of structure
in this case, the DTD-reference is a kind of "contract"
