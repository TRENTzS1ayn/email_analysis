I do not mind losing hankaku katakana characters, but am slightly
worried about MSDOS and MS-WIndows based programs that might generate
XML. For example, if MS-Word had the ability to create XML, then we
might run into some problems. I know that hankaku are becoming less
frequently used, so I am not sure that forbidding them makes
sense... over time they will not be used anyway.

For this, like the above, I can understand the rationale, but I do not
think that the XML language specification should mention anything
about encodings, beyond the fact that any encoding whose character
repertoire is a subset of that in the SGML declaration can be used.

The fact that most tools do not support JIS X 212 is probably
sufficient to make it seldom used. I do not think we need explicit
language for this.

Again, I do not think the XML specification should even attempt to
enumerate the possible encodings (with the possible exception of the
Unicode ecodings).

I disagree. I have seen *many* Japanese people become *very* confused
when they include (accidently or not) an ideographics space character
into their DTD or whatever, and have a parser fail. 

Also, I do not think that most people recognise it as a fixed-wdith
kanji character at all. A long time ago now, I spent a considerable
amount of time talking to SGML *users* about whether they would like
hankaku katakana, and ideographic spaces "normalised", and how they
would use them. The results of that survey were inconclusive at
best... some people thought normalisation was a great idea, and other
felt that they really didn't want it.

The private use area, and surrogates are critical for certain
applications.

This is based upon the denial of the need. The need is there, but the
infrastructure is not.
