I, for one, am getting the uneasy feeling that XML is starting to
suffer from "over-indulging":  it's putting on too much weight.

Of course, everyone wants it to be powerful enough to solve his/her
problem, but then it risks being too big to be the ubiquitous solution
we want it to be.  (I had the same feeling with various SGML Open
technical resolutions:  I started out thinking something simple would
give us a good cost/benefit ratio, and then features kept getting added
until I feared we were reducing the chance of having it widely implemented.)

I say this not from an implementor's point of view, but as one who just
wants XML to succeed:  SGML and HyTime "do it all" but get stuck in a
small niche, and HTML grabs at a very small part of the problem, but
pulls in a huge market.  I'm beginning to lean (even more so that I
may have at first) toward trimming what we can.  Though I reserve the
right to be convinced otherwise, I would currently support ideas to
simplify XML by restricting the use of PErefs.
