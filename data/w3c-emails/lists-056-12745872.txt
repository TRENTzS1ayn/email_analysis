My vote would be to add nothing to the spec until you get a
1.0 version out.  At this point that "extremely simple 
dialect of SGML" rant is getting thin as the language 
gets fat.  Sometime soon, some people will get wise and 
will begin to question the full court press of articles 
based on wishful thinking about this.

Stop the *spirit of XML* arguments.  Requirements were used in the 
beginning to stop and start decisions; now is not the time 
to switch over to *spritualism* based on private 
wants or speculations.  That sort of thing only works on 
the painfully naive and the membership of this particular 
working group is past that appeal.

Sort of a wishful thought then.

That's one prophecy.  There aren't a dozen XML applications 
out there and the people making this prediction have the least 
experience with markup systems of anyone on the list.  Not 
good credentials. Here's another prophecy: many people without DTDs 
will quickly write them once they work out it isn't hard and it is
extremely 
useful.

The spec can't even tell us what the output of a parser is.

Requirements.  Justify based on the requirements.
