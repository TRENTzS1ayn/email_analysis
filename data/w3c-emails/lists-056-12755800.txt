I for two am agreeing.

Then use SGML.  That has been the standing answer to the request 
for more functionality since James Clark first used it during 
the character set debates.

Mission creep:  a committee should work on what is on the agenda at 
the break and never work on what it proposes over lunch.

Time and conditions change with requirements.  What worked the first 
time may not work again.  XML will succeed if there is a definite 
mission it can fulfill.  As "SGML On The Web", it has a mission and 
we generally know what that is.  As "The Fix for HTML" it is 
proposed for a mission most are not sure is worth risking existing 
investments in.  As the "We Can Do This Better Than WG8 and Bury 
That Awful HyTime Thing", it is an intellectual heist and some 
what like listening to Pat Boone sing "Good Golly Miss Molly".

I lean toward a solid set of requirements to which both the ERB and the 
list abide through the first version of XML 1.0.  After a 
period of implementation and market feedback (give it six months) 
the next version can be proposed, drafted, and worked.

Right now, it is becoming  mess of private experimentation just 
as the press is calling it something it cannot be until implemented,
fielded and tested.
