Thanks.

This concern is understandable.

I should speak with my colleagues, but this might be a good idea.

I do not know yet.  Historically, people at Japanese universities 
have had little interest in SGML or structured documents.

This is probably a good idea.

Exactly!

Again, this is understandable.

OK.

Yes, this is a difficult decision.

Programmers think the ideographic space as a delimiter is a 
crazy idea. I do not think any of the computer programming languages 
allows the ideographic space character as a delimiter.  At least, cc 
on Unix does not.  nsgmls does not.  

Some non-programmers think the ideographic space is merely another space 
character.  As a part of PCDATA, we should allow the ideographic space 
and full-text search engines should handle it as a delimiter.  Nevertheless, 
we feel that the ideographic space should be disallowed as a delimter 
between <!DOCTYPE and the DTD name.

As for Gavin's reply, I do not understand his position.  In his mail (Thu, 16 
Jan), Gavin wrote:

We are well aware the need of gaiji characters.  What we are against 
is the use of gaiji characters in open intechange via XML over 
the Internet.  Put in another way, documents containing characters 
from the private use areas are not XML, but XML-like.
