How could it?  An encoding converts a sequence of bytes into a sequence of
characters.  The replacement text of an external entity is a sequence of
bytes, so it needs an encoding to convert it into a sequence of characters.
But the replacement text of an internal entity has been parsed and so is
already a sequence of characters.

SP does this.  If you don't specify an encoding it gets inherited.  I think
of this as being similar to relative URLs.
