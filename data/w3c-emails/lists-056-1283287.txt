Yes.  Minimum pain, maximum gain.  It is the easiest 
way to modularize.  It is how we built several DTDs and 
they worked without pain.  They require one to accept 
switching elements in some cases, but the price is 
minimum particularly if brevity isn't a requirement.

Good.  I suspect parameter entities will be reintroduced 
at a later date, but given the resistance to DTDs in WebLand, 
let them discover why.
