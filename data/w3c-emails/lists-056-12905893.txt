The waters here are muddied considerably by various browsers that
"help" the user by inferring what an invalid url actually means.
The definition of a "valid" URL in a users mind is becoming
synonymous with syntax that "works" which of course is not the
same thing.

Oh dear - error recovery. Arrrrgh!
