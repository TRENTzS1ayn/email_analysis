No argument on "2", given multiple attlists for one element.

However, "synchronizing content models" rarely means something a simple as
"the content model is the same as".  In my experience, it more usually
means,"a part of this model that is the same as a part of that model will
be the same, e.g. all the paragraph-level objects will be the same for
sections, chapters, and sidebars".  This is true even for very very simple
DTDs.  GI name groups do not help.
