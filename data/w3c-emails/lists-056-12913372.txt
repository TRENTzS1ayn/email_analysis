This prediction sure has a ring of truth about it!

A project we have on here needs structural checks that are hard
to capture naturally in a DTD. We concluded that if we go ahead
with that project using XML we will use non-validating
XML parse followed by custom, project-specific semantic parse.

This semantic parse would naturally subsume the structural checks
we *could* have performed with a validating parse but what would
be the point? We need our own layer of semantics anyway. It seems
natural to combine the two.
