That's covered by RFC 1808.

This is effectively a relative URL that includes a scheme name. RFC 1808
mentions this case:

   Finally, some older parsers allow the scheme name to be present in a
   relative URL if it is the same as the base URL scheme.  This is
   considered to be a loophole in prior specifications of partial URLs
   [1] and should be avoided by future parsers.

Yes.  See RFC 1808.
