I agree with everything Paul so succinctly said in his posting on the
difference between the namespace for the current element, and the namespace
of its contents, except the above. The whole point about architectural forms
is to allow you to say "these attributes specify the rules that are to be
applied from semantic specification X whilst those attributes are to be
processed using semantic assignment Y". This is why they are suitable for
multiple inheritence, and why you don't want to assign the semantic
controller as a single namespace identifier on the GI for the general
purpose case. However, having said that, for Version 1.0 of the XML spec I
would be happy to use the following rules:

a) If namespaces are used a notation declaration must be specified in the
internal subset for each name space used. The notation declaration must
point to a URL whose contents show how to process data conforming to that
notation.*

* Alternatively the URL could be required to point to the DTD for that
structure, but I'm not sure that XML developers would be too happy with such
a form of indirected reference to an included DTD - though it would suit me
fine.

b) Element type names may be prefixed by the name of the notation that
identifies the rules for their interpretation rules, and must be separted
from the element name by "::". Only one such name can apply to any GI.

c) An XML-content-namespace (XMLspace) attribute may be added to any element
to indicate the name space to be assigned to all elements in the content for
which no specific namespace prefix has been specified.
