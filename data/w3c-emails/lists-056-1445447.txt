Not only that, but why must the metadata be in a single file? If we had
subdocs I would suggest that there is a strong case for metadata being
incorporated as subdocument entities - this is really what people need: a
means of associating structured metadata with a file which does not conform
to the same structure as the data in the file.

Why invent a convoluted and restricted mechanism for doing something which
is easy to do in SGML already?

(DSIGS that need checksums might be a problem here though!)

Tim says the deadline is Q4 of 1997: this makes much more sense than July 1st.
