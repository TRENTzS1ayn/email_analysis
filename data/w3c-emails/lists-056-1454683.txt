Seconded

If you want to simplify PE processing why not just add a semantic
contstraint that says that PEs referenced in content models must contain
parenthesized name groups? This gives the same processing simplicity/safety
and would allow PE's to be used to group declarations by allowing such PEs
to also be used in place of element names at the begining of the
declaration, without killing off mark section control of DTD fragments.
