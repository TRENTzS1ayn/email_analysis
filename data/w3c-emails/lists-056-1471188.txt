I am *really* happy that a PE-ectomy is being considered for XML.Their
complexity of implementation and explanation are at odds with the bulk
of the XML spec. and the famous "spirit" of XML.

Many people with SGML will stick with SGML as their data format for many
good reasons. They will down-translate to target XML. In this down-translation
they have many issues to deal with - not just PEs.  I say this is good, right
and proper. If we complicate XML too much to accomodate existing SGML
we risk alienating the pioneers currently hitching up their wagons and 
preparing to head west. I say, making [SGML->XML] more complex
is infinitely better than making [XML->Future Apps] more complex.
