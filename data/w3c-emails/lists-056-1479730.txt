I don't see much difference between

<!doctype foo system "foo.dtd">

and

<!doctype foo [
<!entity % e system "foo.dtd">
%e;
]>

It doesn't make much sense to me to allow one and not the other.  I think
the complexity with PEs comes from allowing them inside declarations. 
Allowing PEs which contain 0 or more complete declarations seems
unproblematic.

If PEs are dropped (or disallowed inside declarations), I don't think
conditional sections would be much use.
