And when I suggest that, I think the only way that it's workable is if you
can use external parameter entities, since otherwise those subsets are
going to be too large to be workable.

I think the assumption that seems to be underlying this movement is that
no-one who doesn't already have an SGML shop will want to use full-featured
XML. I think that this assumption may well be false. We can't prove what
the future will hold, but eliminating parameter entities will shape it
powerfully, in the direction of making XML vastly more limited.

Let's relax compatibility with SGML and make PEs into straight text macros
rather than eliminating them. I think that this would be a win for users as
well, since the harders thing about learning PEs is that the string
substitution model is _not_ correct.

Yea, verily, Yea!
