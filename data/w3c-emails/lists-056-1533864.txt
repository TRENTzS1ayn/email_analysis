Would parameter entities that worked like the C preprocessor be too
complex? I don't think so...

I want to use XML instead of SGML for many tasks -- losing parameter
entities will make that close to impossible for me. Since the mess around
PEs is due to their funny syntactic restrictions, I suggest that their high
utility argues for removing the syntactic restrictions, not the feature.

PEs as curently defined are also one fo the last things making a simple
LEX/YACC style implementation of XML trivial -- since PE substitution could
move into a separate input pass if they did not have contextual limits on
occurrence.

_And it would be much easier to explain to *users*._

There is something rotten in PEs, and it's not their existence....
