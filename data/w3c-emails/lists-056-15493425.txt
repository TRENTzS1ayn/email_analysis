Reformulated regular, "Lel Bruce Peto" quoting rose 7.25cts gal to 
95.25cts indexed at a 18.75cts gal screen premium. Move to any month 
pricing and conventional is priced at 76cts gal, with regular RFG pegged at 
78.5cts gal. Market sources say that a $1.20 gal spot price for regular M-4 
conventional would be a surprise while the November no lead
delivery picture remains unclear. Gulf Coast conventional regular 
improved 2cts gal to an implied 79.25cts gal, with A-4 RFG regular gaining 
3cts to 83.75cts gal...as of 11-02-02...
