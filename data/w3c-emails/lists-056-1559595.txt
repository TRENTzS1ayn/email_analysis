I think most of the people will not recognize, that the
string substituion model is not correct, since they put
the border of physical structur to logical borders.

Who would really do something like this?:

<!doctype paragraph [

<!entity %foo "ragraph - - (#pc">
<!element pa%foo;data)>
]>
<paragraph>hello</paragraph>

Macro-processor facility is IMHO much harder to implement
than PEs with restricted use.

Supporting only a subset of PE replacement rules does
not violate XML?s SGML compatibility.

This subset can restrict usage of PEs to that whats known
as CONSTANT in programming languages. PE allow to parameterize
DTDs. They are not there to introduce new Syntaxes etc.

The subset is rather small and should not be too hard to explain.
It can be built directly into the production rules.
