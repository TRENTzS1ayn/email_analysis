Uh, for those who don't have it at the front of their minds, that would be:

 ISO/IEC 9070:1991 Information technology -- SGML support facilities --  
 Registration procedures for public text owner identifiers 

The relevance of this particular standard is open to question.  Furthermore,
if this is something that is going to be used as part of SGML markup 
(which it clearly is, sitting in the middle of the GI) then self-evidently
the syntax must be abstract, there must be a role for this, NMSPPFX, or
some such, which we can make concrete as ':', right? -T.
