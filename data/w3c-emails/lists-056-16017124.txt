Dear all,

we have renewed the translation pages of W3C at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/. This is not only a facelifiting,
but a change in the way we manage translations. Until now, the various
lists of translations were kept up-to-date by hand. From now on, all data
on translations are collected and stored on our site in RDF, which allows
us to generate automatically various 'views' of the data, eg, lists of all
French translations or of all the translations of XML1.0. Note, however,
that at this moment only the translations of Recommendations, and of
documents like WAI Quick Tips, W3C in 7 points, etc, are listed.
Translations of various W3C notes and of candidate/proposed recommendations
are not yet in the database, but will be added soon. As new translations
come in (through the translator's mailing list) the RDF data is updated.
(For the time being this is a manual update, we are working on a more
automatic method of doing so.)

Some of you maintain your own list for, eg, all Russian translations of W3C
documents, or of all available translations of a particular W3C document.
You should consider using the new facilities to maintain those lists,
instead of maintaining the list yourself. We offer various possibilities to
do that:

- you can simply refer/redirect to a full XHTML page on either a language
or a list of translation of a particular technology. Of course, you have
then no control over the output format... ;-)
- you can invoke a script returning an XHTML fragment that you can include
in your page (either on-the-fly through a server side include when
applicable, through some regular automatic update of your own pages, etc)
- if you want to manage RDF directly, you can also invoke a script that
would return the relevant RDF information (in an XML encoding) (B.t.w., the
full RDF data is also public).

There is a more detailed description of the techniques used, as well as the
right URI-s to invoke the various scripts or to get access to the RDF
files, in:
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/Overview.html.

Comments, ideas, feedbacks, etc, are welcome

Ivan Herman & Martin Duerst
