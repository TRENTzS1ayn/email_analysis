Come on - there are many areas of XML where you have placed semantic
constraints on the use of valid SGML features. Why should placing
constraints on the use of PEs be any different?

We haven't got round to discussing this in committee, but the idea of adding
an option to restrict the use of PEs to:

a) just complete declarations
b) just complete model groups
AND
c) keywords for marked sections

would meet with my backing, and would seem to fit well with the rest of the
subsetting we are planning to do. (Changes to the SGML declaration are
'easy' and are expected. Changes elsewhere must be extensions.)
