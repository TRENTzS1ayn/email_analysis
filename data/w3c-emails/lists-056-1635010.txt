It defines ISO's formal rules for structured naming of objects. Obviously
this is of no interest to the XML ERB, even though it was developed by WG8.
We all know by now that the ERB has nothing to do with applying ISO rules!

In a minute you will notice that nearly (if not) every example of structured
namespaces produced by a member of WG8 that has been placed on this list
uses :: rather than : - I wonder why?

Any guesses what the WG8 panel are likely to assign as the default to NMSPPFX?
