The problem is that this is a relaxation, not a constraint.  I want to
remove all the arcane rules about where PE's can and can't go and
just say they do straight text macro-style substitution, orthogonal
to the DTD grammar.  But lots of such PE references would be illegal
per 8879.  With this change, PEs would self-evidently do all the things
that PEs do now but would have none of the problems that are making us 
lean to nuking them. -Tim
