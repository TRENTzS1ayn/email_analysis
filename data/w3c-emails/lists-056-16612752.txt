Thanks also to many translators on this list who reported errors, many errors
have been spotted in the HTML 4.0 specification. Recently, all known errors
were corrected, and a new version of the specification was issued.

It is available as

    http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424

or of course just as http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/.

For translators who want to get rid of all the errors they have
detected, or just otherwise want to get their translations up
to the latest stage, the section at
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/appendix/changes.html#h-A.2
is of particular interest. It is entitled A.2 Changes from the 18 December
1997 specification.

Happy translating,   Martin.
