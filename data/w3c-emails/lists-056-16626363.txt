Dear Editors and Translators,

I have a question about attribute's name in HTML4.0 document.

Please tell me the reason why "_" (under score) and ":" (colon)
are not discribe as attribute's name character in section 3.2.2
of the HTML4.0 Specification ?

| In certain cases, authors may specify the value of an attribute 
| without any quotation marks.
| The attribute value may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), 
| digits (0-9), hyphens (ASCII decimal 45), and periods (ASCII 
| decimal 46). We recommend using quotation marks evenwhen it is 
| possible to eliminate them.
