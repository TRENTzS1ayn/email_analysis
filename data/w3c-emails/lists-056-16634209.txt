Dear translators,

as coordinator of the Italian translation team of HTML 4.0 specification, I
want to point out to you a possible discrepancy between paragraph 17.6.1
and paragraph 18.2.3. The problem concerns the attributes "onfocus",
"onblur" and "onchange": according to the opinion of some members of our
group, it could be happened an exchange between the elements "select" and
"optgroup" about the attributes listed above.

Can you help us to resolve this doubt?

Thank you in advance,
Michele Diodati - Liber Liber (http://www.liberliber.it)
