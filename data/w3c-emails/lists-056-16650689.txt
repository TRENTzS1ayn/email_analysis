Oh yes, I see the problem. I think 18.2.3 is correct since the
attlist-definition for OPTGROUP is

<!ATTLIST OPTGROUP
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  disabled    (disabled)     #IMPLIED  -- unavailable in this context --
  label       %Text;         #REQUIRED -- for use in hierarchical menus --
  >

ans %events are defined as 

<!ENTITY % events
 "onclick     %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer button was clicked --
  ondblclick  %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer button was double clicked--
  onmousedown %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer button was pressed down --
  onmouseup   %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer button was released --
  onmouseover %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer was moved onto --
  onmousemove %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer was moved within --
  onmouseout  %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a pointer was moved away --
  onkeypress  %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a key was pressed and released --
  onkeydown   %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a key was pressed down --
  onkeyup     %Script;       #IMPLIED  -- a key was released --"

But you're right, in 17.6.1 there are too many attributes listed for OPTGROUP:

Attributes defined elsewhere 

      id, class (document-wide identifiers) 
      lang (language information), dir (text direction) 
      title (element title) 
      style (inline style information) 
      disabled (disabled input controls) 
      onfocus, onblur, onchange, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover,
      onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic events)



Michele, I think you should direct your question to www-html-editor@w3.org as
mentioned in the HTML spec.

A similar mistake is already listed in the errata:
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html40-updates/REC-html40-19980424-errata.html



Bye,

 Stefan.
