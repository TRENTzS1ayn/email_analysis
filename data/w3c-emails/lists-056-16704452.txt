Dear Editors and Translators,

I've noticed recently that the new version of HTML4.0 recommendation
contains a copyright notice which may prohibit creation of translated
versions. http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/about.html#h-1.4 states that
"No right to create modifications or derivatives is granted pursuant
to this license."  I am not good at reading legal texts, but to me it
seems to prohibit creation of translated versions.

I would appreciate your comments.
