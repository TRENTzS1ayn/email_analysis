No, the word "not" IS needed.  As noted in the previous paragraph of
Section 8.2.4, "ISO-8859-8-i" denotes implicit bidirectionality, and
"ISO-8859-8-e" denotes explicit directionality.

"Unicode bidirectionality algorithm" means implicit bidirectionality
algorithm, thus, "ISO-8859-8-e" should NOT be used.

P.S.  If you have some difficulty in translating into Japanese, maybe
I can help you.
