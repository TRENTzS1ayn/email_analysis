Hello ISHIKAWA-sama.

Thank you for your advice.
Please allow me to ask you more detail.

Yes. I read RFC1556 to understand the usage of "-i" and "-e".

I still have two questions.

(1) Are there many language that can be encoded by "-e" encoding or
    only Hebrew and Arabic have "-e" (and "-i") encoding ?
(2) Now my understanding about section 8.2.4 with your help:
    Section 8.2.4 says "we can use NO '-e' encodings to express
    explicit directional control, because HTML uses the Unicode
    'inolicit' bidirectionality algorithm only".
    Is it right?

Thank you for your kindness. 
By the way, could I write to you in both English and Japanese (by
ISO-2022-JP) ?
