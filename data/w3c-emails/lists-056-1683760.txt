As an author and maintainer of DTDs, both modular and flat, it's
really hard for me to imagine using XML with PE-less DTDs. Removing
parameter entities would relegate XML completely to a down-translation
language, where I'd author and validate all but the simplest DTDs in
SGML. I wouldn't even begin to consider DocBook, TEI or even HTML
without PEs. It would make them almost impossible to manage, too much
work, and if I must spend my time with a DTD, I'd spend it in SGML.

I think we should follow the spirit of the rest of XML and simply
constrain PEs to a reasonable functionality for XML; elimination 
seems like an enormous mistake unless we want to turn the corner
away from complex, valid documents authored and maintained in XML.

Executive summary: A strong vote against PE removal from someone
who does a fair amount of DTD work.
