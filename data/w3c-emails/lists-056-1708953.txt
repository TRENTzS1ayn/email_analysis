Martin, quit bleating! :-)

The XML ERB/WG/whatever-it's-called-today has already changed the NET
delimiter to "/>", PIC (to "?>"), and considered changing comment start/end
to <!--* and *-->.

There is no reason to use :: when : and . are equally available.
On the other hand, if :: is chosen, I don't see that as a big deal either.

That something is standardised by ISO means nothing if the standard is
not already in use.  Or you'd better tell the Web to move to HyQ.

Your own email address is not ISO conformant (X400, X500 etc.)

I do agree with you that gratuitous differences from existing SGML practice
should be avoided, as should gratuitous use of complex jargon.
