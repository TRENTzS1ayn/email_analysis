How will relying on the external header fix matters?  The problem is
that it is always possible to get a transcoding server that doesn't
understand the format it's transcoding (one reason sending binary files
via Bitnet was always such an adventurous experience if one of the nodes
involved was an ASCII site).

The best that can be hoped for is to have some chance at noticing that
there is a discrepancy -- particularly important given the frequency
with which transcoders garble the data (at least ASCII/EBCDIC
transcoders do -- perhaps the transcoders for CJK character encodings
work flawlessly all the time).

To do that, you need to have the PI retained.
