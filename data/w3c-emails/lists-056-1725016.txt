I could buy that. If we make the internal subset simple enough, 
we could even require parsers to read ATTLISTs for defaulted and
fixed values. From there it is just a hop, skip and a jump to
architectures.

I agree 100%.

The question of the hour, then, is would WG8 supply us with a 
simpler, more general PE feature or can the SGML WG come up 
with a simpler, more restricted (but still useful) PE? Language 
lawyers? The proposed WebSGML changes to SGML are so massive 
that PE generalization doesn't seem outrageous to ask -- if 
it is a good idea.
