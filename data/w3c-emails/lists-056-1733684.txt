Having parameter entities for just (1) complete declarations (modules), (2)
complete model groups (nearly equivalent to GI name groups), and (3)
keywords for marked sections (switches) greatly impoverishes the set of
useful PEs.  You don't have PEs for:

4 Individual attribute specifications (common attributes)
5 Sets of elements with which you build up repeatable-OR content models
  ("classes" and "mixtures" in Jeanne's and my methodology)
6 Other content model subgroups
7 Other things that are less needful, but still useful

If I can't have at least 1 through 5, I can't get away with doing
high-quality, complex production DTDs.  If it's just too complicated to
spec and build the capability for 4 and 5, which I'm willing to believe for
V1.0, is it that useful to have 1 through 3?  I'm not sure.
