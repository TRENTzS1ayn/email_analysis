I want to add my voice (again) to the 'keep PEs in somehow camp'. 

I believe that their removal will raise the entry level for XML for some organisations by moving complexity
from within the XML processor out to  document designers and administrators who will not relish the 
problems of maintaining what will amount to monolithic DTDs, or collections of non-XML (SGML) units that will 
need preprocessing. And I feel sure that there will be far more designers and administrators than there are 
people writing XML processors.' The greatest good for the greatest number'?

I would also like to endorse the idea of restricting the use of PEs to 'useful' parts of the syntax, 
like "(foo|bar)", as this should improve the lot of both XML Processor implementers and those who 
write and manage DTDs.
