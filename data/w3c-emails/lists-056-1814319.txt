I agree that 1, 2, 3, and 5 are essential to the complex DTD world.  (I
think we can live without 4, although I want it.)

But there's another aspect of PEs that isn't on Eve's list that I feel is
important; the ability to declare them multiple times, and an unambiguous
rule about which over-rides which.  I don't actually care if the first,
last, longest, or cutest is used as long as I can declare several and know
which will be ignored and which active.
