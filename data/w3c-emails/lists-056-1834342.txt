To make it quite clear, I wasn't suggesting dropping DTDs, but was concerned
that the requirement to implement highly complex DTDs (i.e. thousands of lines)
required a PE system which some implementers would find too difficult and which
wasn't *required* for their much simpler DTDs.

I am prepared to take on trust that Michael's new proposal(s) is/are 
straightforwardly implementable and support the ERB in whatever solution they
propose.  If it's clearly presented then I think that it's implementable by 
a webhacker.
