I'm not convinced this is a desirable change. I think it would be much
harder to do a GUI DTD editor that preserved the parameter entity structure
if parameter entities were allowed anywhere.  I don't myself think making
them more like simple macros is the right direction to be taking SGML. 
Rather I think that, for use within declarations, it would be better to
head in the direction of a less syntactic approach. One reason for this is
namespaces: macro-like facilities generally interact poorly with
namespaces/modules.
