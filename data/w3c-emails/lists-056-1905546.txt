Even though I don't think XML particularly needs PEs, I think they are being wrongly criticised because they are not like CPP
macros.  If you demand CPP macros, use them at your server!

PEs are very well-behaved "macros".  The constraints on their placement make them less easy to abuse. In particular, they stop a
"macro" from including text that goes outside the scope of the current production.   So when you read a DTD and you see a parameter
entity reference, you always know that you can skip over it and visually keep parsing: it will not contain any nasty suprises.
