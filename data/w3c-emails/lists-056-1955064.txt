It may not be too late for the TC. Remember that part of the reason for the
odd rules in 8879 is that 8879 had to cope with the situation where there
was no REFC, just a separator. XML does not need this. I could envisage
making the set of rules that apply when REFC is not present optional. But
first lets agree with what is required, and what is Tim's myth.
