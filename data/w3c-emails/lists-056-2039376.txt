MCF is Meta Content Framework, an application of XML proposed by
Netscape.  The drafts have been heavily reworked based on early feedback,
check the spec out at:

 http://www.textuality.com/mcf/NOTE-MCF-XML.html

If (like a lot of other people) you found MCF a little daunting first
time around, you might want to check out the new tutorial at:

 http://www.textuality.com/mcf/MCF-tutorial.html

I understand this is now going to migrate over to a just-now-forming
new working group in W3C that is going to try to co-ordinate all the
disparate metadata activities.

Cheers, Tim Bray
