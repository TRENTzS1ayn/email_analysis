Most such machine-readable "documentation" is dependent on the system doing
the reading.  That's just what PIs in the DTD are for.  Is that what you're
arguing for?

If there's some particular form of "machine readable documentation" that is
so universally useful that it ought to be a specific language feature, the
SGML RG of WG8 would certainly like to know about it.
