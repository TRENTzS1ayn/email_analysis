Does this mean that there is a standard way of documenting DTDs using PIs?
Please forgive my ignorance - (I have never seen it in the (rather few) DTDs 
I have downloaded.)

Well, I thought that dtd2html was a good start.  It uses HTML for each Element
and can also deal specifically with attributes which apply to more than one 
element.  I see no fundamental reason why this approach couldn't be bound 
into XML DTDs.  Using XML rather than HTML for the documentation would 
probably make it easier to extract machine-parsable material.
