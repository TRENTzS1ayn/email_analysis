No, and I cringe at calling it "machine-readable documentation";  Any comment
in the DTD, or an MS Word file of text meant for humans is "machine
readable".  I was guessing you meant "machine-*understandable* documentation",
i.e., information about the DTD that was in a form that a computer program
could act on when processing the document.
