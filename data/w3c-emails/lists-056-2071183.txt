I don't see that SEEALSO in n1929 implies the used of fixed atts.  However,
Annex K says there is an example of SEEALSO in Annex L which is missing, and 
Annex L ends at a point that could be short of the full text ("except when
validating^M").  Would someone check to see whether the file is short?

Anyway, I'm writing about something different.  N1929 defines ways to
state in the SGML decl various stuff relevant to XML, and in Annex L
says that "XML requires a specific SGML declaration" and that "Explicit
SGML declaration not permitted [in XML]".  The latter is correct per
XML-lang of 31 March; the former is correct when parsing XML as SGML,
but not when parsing XML as XML.  

Under this new TC, how do the results differ, if at all, between
1) parsing XML as SGML using an SGML-SGML-declaration-for XML
   with the XML toggles switched on, and a conforming SGML
   parser, and

2) p[mumble]sing XML as XML (necessarily without an SGML declaration)
   using a conforming validating XML processor (the rules for which 
   are presumably unaffected by anything in this TC relating to the
   SGML declaration)?
