[Peter Murray-Rust:]

| IMO the additiona of useful documentation to DTDs in a formal manner
| would be the single most valuable thing that could be done to 'sell'
| the DTD concept to the new users of XML.  A complex DTD, with or
| without PEs, with no machine-readable documentation is a turn-off.

This is out of scope.  Please take futher correspondence on this
subject elsewhere (e.g., comp.text.sgml).

Jon
