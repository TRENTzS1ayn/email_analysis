Unfortunately I see applications for PE in subsets (though if they were no
more complicated than general entities it would not be so bad.

I agree with this, but I don't see how we can abandon the XML is SGML
constraint now. And Michael's heartfelt plea for PEs is totally correct. We
_need_ them. It would be great if they were a lot simpler (for which, read
_NO_ contextual dependencies, or substitution value restrictions).

One they are string substitutions (with an anti-infinite substitution rule
of some sort), they are not that much bulk, given that they are little
different from general entities.

WG8, can you save us from ourselves?
