Eve is correct, this proposal preserves compatibility at the expense of
utility. PEs are the universal bandaid for the generalizations that DTDs do
not let us express: commonalities of content model, attributes, context of
ocurrences, element classes and so forth. If XML is to be useful for
content on its own, we need these generalizations in our DTDs. We faced
this once and made the right decision in terms of power. We should not back
off now.

We already have HTML, we need something more than another delivery-only format.
