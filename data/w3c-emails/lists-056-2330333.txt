As has been pointed out (by me, last fall), even rewriting the MIME
headers is not always performed correctly -- especially in email.
My incoming email, on this EBCDIC machine, is full of MIME-encoded mail
claiming, in its MIME headers, to be in ASCII.

No external label is ever foolproof.

No internal label is ever foolproof.

Fools are just too doggone ingenious.

Under these circumstances, I don't see the point in *requiring* any
processor to prefer the internal to the external label, or vice versa.
Anyone who argues that one of these will always be right in cases of
conflicts must be living in a world rather unlike mine.

This is probably an argument against the proposal recently mooted, to
declare inconsistency between the internal and external labels a
well-formedness error.  I'd be inclined to continue to define it as
an error, however -- but it should be an error from which it's possible
to recover.
