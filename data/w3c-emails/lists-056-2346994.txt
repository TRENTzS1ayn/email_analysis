Thanks Jon, 
Understood and agreed.  I think that any early implementations (from
a document labelled DO NOT IMPLEMENT :-) can expect to be transient.  

I expect these discussions will have some of the flavour of discussions
about APIs (which seem to be making good progress).  If XML-DEV does throw up
agreement, I am sure enough ERB/WG members will take note.
