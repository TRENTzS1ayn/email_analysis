Alternatively (although I'm not wild on this) it could be made a
well-formedness/validity constraint: a valid document would not use
PEs in a way that isn't valid SGML under the 1986 Rules.

A well-formed document migh have fewer constraints.

This in some ways might mirror the "obfuscatory entitiy references" note
in the SGML standard itself, I suppose.
