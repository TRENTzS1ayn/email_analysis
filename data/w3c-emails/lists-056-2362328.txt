    ******************************************************
    Welcome to the   G L Y P H    F O L K S   mailing list
    ******************************************************
    This is an unmoderated mailing list for the discussion and
    development of:

       1) A standard for character definition.
       2) A standard for defining character properties.
       3) A standard method of resolving character definitions to
          glyphs and glyph images.
       4) A standard way of encoding the above.
       5) A standard for use of such definitions in XML and SGML.

    These standards must work in a distributed environment, and in
    particular, be applicable to the Internet. They must also, as much
    as possible, work with information technologies such as full text
    indexing, and formatting.

    The primary purpose of this work is to allow publishers that use
    large character repertoires, or uncommon characters, to exchange
    documents in a portable, and semantically meaningful manner. This
    is in stark contrast to the current alternative of sending images
    embedded using linking structures.

    Where possible, ISO and other standards should be used.
