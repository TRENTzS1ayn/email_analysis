Are those systems conformant MIME implementations? Bad software is bad
software, and should be fixed.

Making it a well-formedness error would result in people ignoring the
spec. I believe. 

How about removing this section of the specification:

   An entity which begins with neither a Byte Order Mark nor an
   encoding declaration must be in the UTF-8 encoding. 

which effectively *requires* transcoding proxies to rewrite the PI, or
use UTF-8 (both of which are not likely to happen). Without this, at
least there is some appearance of equality. 

I also dislike the specific recommendation of any value for the
encoding spelcification, and especially those related to Japanese. Can
we do without them, or simply state that they must be one of the IANA
names?
