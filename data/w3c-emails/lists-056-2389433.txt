I understand this.  They have to respect SGML boundaries for 
legal combinations (to express myself loosely but with fewer
characters).

Because 

1.  Other than entities, no other form of string substitution 
is legal within SGML (discounting pre-processors)

2.  Too many constructs that occur *naturally* in extant 
artifacts are verbose in a regular element model

3.  Some sets of existing complex schemata will be 
unavailable and unusable without PEs

I concede the usefulness of PEs in XML.
