Consequence arises from action not declaration.  
Otherwise, the word would be the thing.

It means the editors/designers/ERB of the specification have 
specified a language that does not violate the technical requirements of 
the parent specification.  It does not prevent them from 
writing one which is technically complete.  If they can do 
that, they can write a specification that needs no clarification.

A normative reference means XML is SGML, not SGML-like.
