But if an XML document is defined to be an SGML document, doesn't a
scrupulous implementor have to read the SGML specification to *ensure*
that the XML spec is complete, accurate and sufficiently constraining? 

"This national law is intended to be consistent with international law.
If there is a conflict between this law and international law, consult
international law."

Doesn't a careful lawyer have to read international law before
interpreting the local one?
