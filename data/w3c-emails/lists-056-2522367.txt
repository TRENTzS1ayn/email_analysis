David Durand writes "BTW if you go back to the original namespace
proposal, the association of semantics is the only _explicitly cited_
reason for using namespaces."

I believe he is right. Keeping the names associated with specific
semantics (more exactly, keeping the names distinct) is the point of
"namespaces."  There is nothing in namespaces about multiple semantics
on an element, multiple inheritance, supporting processors who want to
process elements without knowing what their semantics are, etc.
