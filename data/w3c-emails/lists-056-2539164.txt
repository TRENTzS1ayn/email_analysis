Both AndrewL and RickJ have proposed namespace philosophies which should be
supported.  Andrew's might be examplified by (say) a DTD for the J. Physical
Chemistry (a real journal), which might wish to publish in XML.  It could 
construct its own DTD based (say) on X-HTML, with precise contexts in which 
MathML and CML can be imported.  This may be workable with a very static
editorial policy where the style was frozen for some years.  The problem  is 
that  
(a) it can be difficult to identify all the places where merged content
is allowed (e.g. equations (math or chem) in tables, citations, etc.) 
(b) if a new mergeable DTD becomes important, it's extremely difficult to 
edit the DTD to include it.  You start running into n-squared numbers of 
interactions.  And, since CML may very well include (or interoperate with)
MathML, you may have unforeseen second-order problems.

Rick's position would seem to be the only way of creating a valitable approach
for a more general journal like Science or Nature, which range from Astronomy
to Archaeology.  (At present CML get rounds it by having a single container - 
XLIST - which has a content of ANY and can occur almost anywhere.  #OTHER makes
this approach more honest.)
