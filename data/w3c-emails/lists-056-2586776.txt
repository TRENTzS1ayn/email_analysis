I can't decode all the numbers given for the name start characters,
but from the comments below, it looks like you've added _ and : to
name characters but not namestart characters.

Now this is precisely what I want, but my understanding was that the
ERB decided to add _ and : to namestart characters too.  (Why?  I see
no reason to want to add _ or : to namestart characters, and it just
so happens some tools [e.g., Adept] make use of an initial _ character
to denote internally reserved names, so at least for the present, we
will not be allowing _ as a namestart character.)  I'd be pleased to 
hear I'm wrong and _ and : are NOT allowable namestart characters,
but I wonder if someone can confirm the current decision.
