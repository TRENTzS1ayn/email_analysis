I wish to report that a good swedish trade magazine carried an
two-page article about XML. Since it is pretty long (6 columns)
I do not have the time to translate it, but cannot refrain from
reporting errors, ommissions and true horrors (there is a lot of
accurate information also, but not as fun reporting):

From "Datateknik" Nr 9, May 15:

  "Behind XML is among others, W3C and Tim Berners-Lee, the
   man that created the World Wide Web."

Note that Tim Berners-Lee is the only name mentioned in conjunction
with XML. Furthermore, the only illustration on the page is a
picture of Tim Berners-Lee. At least XML is not attributed to Microsoft
this time. Will they ever get it right ?

  "HTML is usually described as a subset of SGML..."

Hm.

  "These descriptions [DTDs] are written in a application and
   platform independent way with the help of markup, or 'tags'
   as they are called."

No comment.

  "In contrast to HTML, XML can separate form and content,
   just like SGML."

What ?

  "The form is stored in a DTD and the content stored separately
   from the form. The same information can be presented in a
   differrent, with a different DTD. Just like SGML."

Confused ? DTD==stylesheet !!

  "XML also has parts that are missing in SGML. The linking parts
   are more powerful."

Well, yes, if HyTime is ignored the linking in SGML is pretty basic.

  [ommitted discussion on CDF and Microsoft Explorer]
  "CDF is based on SGML. Microsoft now hopes that the partly
   Java-based open structure of XML will entice other web-developers
   to embrace SGML as standard."

Wow. XML Java-based ?

  "The third prerelease of Explorer 4.0 is expected in mid 1997, and
   it will according to Microsoft have full support for XML."

Is this true ?

  "SGML does not use MS Word, the most common SGML editor is
   FrameMaker. There is also an Unix editor and a PC editor."

Words fail me. I just cannot come up with a witty comment to this.

To be fair, the article does contain a lot of accurate information,
and as a whole is very pro-XML, but all the mistakes unfortunately
will create a lot of new misunderstandings.
