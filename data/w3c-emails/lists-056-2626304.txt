I'd go further; the value of an ID attribute shouldn't have to be
a Name in the XML sense.  Among other things, a URL is an obvious
candidate.  Also Bert's points about casefolding are well-taken.
(Although remember, the NAME attribute of A is *not* an ID anyhow).

The important thing about an ID is that it be unique, right?

Why, historically, was the value of an ID restricted to Name?
