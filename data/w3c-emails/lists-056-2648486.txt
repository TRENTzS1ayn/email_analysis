After thinking about it a bit, I thought that something like #OTHER was also
generally too loose, which is why my proposal on validation and namespaces
allowed you to specify which namespace to use.  After all, CML might import
several different namespaces, but at some particular point you want to specify
there should be an equation here.  If you can designate the namespace (i.e.,
<!ELEMENT html ( head, (body | frameset | layer | MATH:: ), tail ) >), you can
ensure that.

However this looks reasonable as a simplification for the first round.  The
more general question of namespace architecture will take a lot more
discussion, especially if it must also fit SGML.
