TIM BRAY: Why, historically, was the value of an ID restricted to Name?


I eagerly await this answer.  This has been a pain in the tail in designing
applications where there are existing naming conventions that don't match
SGML limitations.  If a thing has always had a unique identifier, peolple
tend to want to use the old one even when the system changes.  Why WAS it
done?
