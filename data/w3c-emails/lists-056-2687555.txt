But that begs the question of the existance of namespaces.  XML-lang,
as
deliverable in July, will not have namespaces.  So we should avoid
trouble
and prevent incompatible namespace dialects emerging.  

If the IG and WG8 come up with a good system that requires it, then ":"
can be moved up to be a namestart character, but for now all we need, I
think,
is the simplest of naming conventions "::" to keep names of exportable
elements in DTDs unique.
