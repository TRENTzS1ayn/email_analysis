Perhaps the question is "should we have different rules for every
different
type of thing?"

It is not clear to me that the answer is yes!  In fact, the fewer
differences
in rules the better.  The NAMECASE split for entities and other names
is
confusing enough without adding more differences.

I think that what people really need is a way to add arbitrary
grove-aware lexical parsing to any attribute.  To be able to say: "this
is the lexical model for this attribute, and it has to be unique (or
present) in this namespace."
Too much for XML!
