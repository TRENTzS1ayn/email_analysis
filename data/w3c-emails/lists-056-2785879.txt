Well, yes and know.  This assumes you (or rather, the DTD designer) know the
structure of the namespace you are refering to.  Suppose I have a document in
which will be stuck (not necessarily by me) a motion picture type rating and/or
a secure signature.  There may be several rating systems and several secure
signatures systems, depending on which country the document will be viewed in,
the material being reviewed (i.e., motion picture vs. tv), etc.  The signature
may be put in by my email agent and even translated from one protocol to
another as it moves among legal domains.  The DTD designer should be able to
say "the rating goes right here" without necessarily knowing what its exact
form will be. This is why my proposal went out of its way to support very late
binding.  I think we're going to need that for a lot of applications.  So I do
think you get some added value from MATH::
