I think we should avoid these flapping barn doors. Rather we should have
a structured mechanism for using components and extending them. A sort
of structured equivalent of this:

<!ELEMENT html ( head, (body | frameset | layer | %included-types; ),
tail ) >

Doesn't the Japanese proposal already cover this? You can require
"inputs" to DTDs that are parameter entities that are pasted into
particular places. This is very much like C++ templates.
