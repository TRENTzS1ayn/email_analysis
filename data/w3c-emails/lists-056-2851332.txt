% You can put numbers in an ID. You just have to start with a name start
% character. But even if that wasn't the case, don't you have the same
% problem when you want to make database connections between entities and
% records? Connections between element types/attribute names and database
% records may be rare, but they are not non-sensical.

In theory, maybe I would. In practice, I've wanted the other. And without
having to fudge adding a letter to start with.
