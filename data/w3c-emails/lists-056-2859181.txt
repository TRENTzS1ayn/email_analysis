Is there a good reason why they can't all be different?  I have never
understood why I have had to make unreasonable things permissable in GIs
just so that I could have entity names that mapped reasonably to the names
in, for example, a graphics management system.

I want to be able to declare separate rules for GIs, IDs, attributes, and
entities.  I don't think I'll really want to make them all different very
often, but I do want to be able to.  It just doesn't seem reasonable that
they should all have to be the same - they describe different types of
information and interact differently with the external world.
