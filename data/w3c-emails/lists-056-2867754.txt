Lauren and Tim have some good points regarding IDs.  It is a benefit if
an id can easily map between an element and either a real world entity
or an object in another database system.  Unless there is some bad
consequence to permitting a freer use of characters, relaxing the
restrictions just seems to simplify document construction and
processing.
