Just to add to my own commentary, and make a possibly important point:

Of the several NAME namespaces (element, element type, entity, and attribute),
element-name (i.e., ID/IDREF/IDREFS-valued attribute) is the only one that
never occurs "in the raw": since it is always an attribute value, it can
always occur in the document as an attribute value literal--and hence it
does not need the tight lexical restrictions to prevent collision with
adjacent characters of many sorts.  So in this way element names are
lexically different from other names in SGML syntax.
