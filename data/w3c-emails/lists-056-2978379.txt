I think "id" would be a bad element name, since it goes against the
HyTime practise of "id" being "ID". I have used quite a few DTDs that
use id as CDATA, and it is frustrating and works against my
expectations.

I suggest, if we must have them 

XML-ID    CDATA 
      XML-IDREF CDATA   

I don't think we can have XML-IDS and XML-IDREFs without constraing the
CDATA in some way. I still think it is a bad idea, because it allows
obfuscated markup, which is a great sin.  Sure, it may clarify some
things too.
