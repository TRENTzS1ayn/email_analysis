The MCF and XML-data people might be interested in the HyTime 
"description tables". (HyTime:1992 6.5.6)

They are a way of getting element and text embedding 
without having to use entity references, just using elements
and attributes.  So they are quite in spirit with the
"declarations...boo; elements...hurrah" feelings of our webbed 
(though not green) friends.  

They are also smarter than text entities, in that they
can have attributes on them, not just on their contents.
