I've been asking that question for a couple of weeks now. Why does
XML-Link encourage people to use system IDs right in the instance
(generally avoided in SGML) while XML-Lang does not allow people to do
so in the "obvious places" (entity references). Or, another way, why
does XML-Lang require external entity references to be indirected
through an "external entity reference" construct while XML-Link does not
*allow* you to use the external entity reference construct *at all*?
Both of these seem reasonable to me (but neither is allowed):
