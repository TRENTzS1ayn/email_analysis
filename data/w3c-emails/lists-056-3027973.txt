Good point. So

* soletag close delimiter is "\>", or 
* people have to do <IMG />, or
* "\" is NAMECHAR (& is the mandated delimiter for URLs) not "/", or
* a name cannot end with NAMECHAR (given the SGML declaration I made
up, 
where, I think, NAMECHAR only has punctuation characters)

What a mess!  

I really don't think we should directly allow any characters 
that are in other XML delimiters inside NAMES (or inside any 
"unique CDATA IDs").  If we cannot use them in data, why should 
we be able to use them in markup strings?
