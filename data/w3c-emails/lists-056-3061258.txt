In its meeting today (25 June 1997), the ERB discussed the problem
of namespaces, and in particular the proposal to include ':' as
a name character in XML.  The group decided unanimously that:

  - colon (&#x003A;) will be added to XML as a name-start character
    (N.B. *not* just as a name-character--as a name-*start* character.)
  - the use of colon in XML names will be reserved for experimentation
    with name spaces and schema scoping; since it will be standardized
    in its semantics at some future point, anyone using it is
    running the risk that their work will be invalidated by the
    standardization and will require updating when the standardization
    (which is not guaranteed to use the colon separator at all) is
    completed.
  - As a result:  authors should not use colon in their DTDs (except
    as part of a name-space/schema-scoping experiment), but parsers
    *should* accept colon as a name-start character.

Other decisions will be reported separately.
