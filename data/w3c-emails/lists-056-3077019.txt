The inference you are drawing is unwarranted:  there is no guarantee
that the name-space solution eventually adopted for XML will use
colons in names.  The problem (at least the problem I have) with
not explaining why colon is reserved is that it divides the world
into the in-group (who know why it's reserved and get to experiment)
and the out-group (who don't know why and who are effectively told
not to experiment).  It's reserved for a simple reason and there
seems no need to keep that reason secret.  Is there?
