Er, that seems to be presupposing that a final solution will use ::
rather than just : by itself....  If we know that already, there is
no need to experiment with the syntax!  Clearly this isn't decided.

Perhaps there's scope for a Rationale of XML book ("The Spirit of XML"??),
in which this could be further elaborated upon...
