Yes, that certainly looks like a normative reference to me.

But the handling of references in the xml spec[1] is non-traditional:
there's a touchy-feely "relationship to existing standards"
section and section called "references" which is really a
bibliography, but no a list of normative references.

So the current draft[1] seems unclear on whether the reference
to the SGML spec is normative.
