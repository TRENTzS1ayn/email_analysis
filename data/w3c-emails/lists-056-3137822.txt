Tim, Jon,

When I added a "status of this document" section, I neglected
to add a "comments should be sent to ..." sentence.

The last thing I want to see is insightful and/or useful
comments on that spec[1] not getting due consideration.

Tim, as editor, would you prefer comments were sent to this
forum, or to you directly in stead?

Jon, as chair,
what do you think about comments on MCF-XML in this forum?
(a) absolutely not: do it again and we file a motion to
remove you from the WG
(b) I'd rather they didn't, but since Tim reads the
mail here, it's reaching the editors, and
so no serious harm is done. But please send
comments directly to the editor as a rule.
(c) Only if they directly relate to xml-lang, xml-link
or other specs in scope here
(d) Sure! we expect mcf-xml to be reviewed in this
forum eventually, so we might as well start now.
