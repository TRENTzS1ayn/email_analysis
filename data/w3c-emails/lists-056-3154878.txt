Well, what we'd like is if somebody spots a dropped comma or other typo,
just yell at the nearest editor, don't congest bandwidth, but if they
feel there are deep architectural problems, that has to be aired out
in public.  Is there boilerplate language for this purpose, or should
I invent something.
