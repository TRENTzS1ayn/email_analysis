I prefer "ID". "XML-ID" is too long.

The name "ID" is only reserved when it is an attribute.
I don't think we need to say anything about elements
that are named "ID," whether they go against expectations
or not.

"IDREF" is not necessary, "HREF" does the job already.

I don't think we'll need IDS, and IDREFS are handled with xlinks:

    <xlink><x href="#1"/><x href="#2"/><x href="#3"/>...

(A bit verbose, I admit, but it avoids having to reserve any special
delimiters.)
