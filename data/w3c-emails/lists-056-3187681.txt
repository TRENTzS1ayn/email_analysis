No, it is presupposing that we may need to use :: for something special
in the future. It needent say what and it needent ever be used.

That doesn't follow. The current spec reserves the colon character to
allow people to experiment with the semantics, not the syntax. Mine does
the same, but allows people to use the single colon to experiment with
*anything* not just namespaces, and also allows us to use the double
colon for anything in the future, not just namespaces. It also stops our
final standard from breaking experiments (in whatever) that occur in the
meantime..

This seems like the appropriate place for that kind of rationale about
the future of the standard.
