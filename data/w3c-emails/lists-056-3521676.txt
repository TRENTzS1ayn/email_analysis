| 5.1.a Shall we support a mechanism for a document to contain a list of 
| other documents that someone thinks ought to processed with it, in order
| to find linking elements pointing into the first document, and in general
| create a web of related documents?

"In general create a web" confuses an otherwise clearish question.

Again, XML 1.0 allows this.  You are asking not whether it should be
supported in general, but whether one method should be specified.  Yes.

| 5.1.b If so, shall we say anything normative about whether this must be 
| done? 

No.

| 5.1.c Should we use an SGML element, a PI, or some other construct to hold 
| this list of documents? 

An SGML DTD defined by the SGML ERB.

| 5.1.d If we use an element, what should it be called? 

"-//W3C//DTD XML-omnistuff//EN", unless you're serious that the W3C
doesn't own XML, in which case maybe "-//Everyman//DTD XML-omnistuff//EN".

| 5.1.e If we use an SGML element, should we have subelements per referenced 
| doc or just a token-separated list of entity names in a single attribute? 
| In either case what should the subelement (if any) and attributes be 
| called? 

It would be so much more relaxing to write a DTD for this, wouldn't it?  In 
any event you have to provide (what were) HRTYPEs for each doc referred to.
