Support for URL addressing should be compulsory, but not the only option.
Ideally I would like to see SGML FSI support, or at least a subset of the
default FSI set, with the presence of <url> being implied at the start of
the string if there is no other identifier for the type of locator being
used. I would also like to see a TEI locator identified by a <TEI> tag
defined as a formal FSI.
