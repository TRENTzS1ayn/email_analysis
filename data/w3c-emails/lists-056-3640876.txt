Yes - as long as it is repeatable and can be used anywhere. (I want to build
webs by saying add this web to that web)

It or an element conforming to the same architectural form with an
architectural attribute name that matches that of the element, the attribute
being required for any user-named equivalent element.

This would make it impossible to have in-line extended links!

Yes

What is a document in this sense, and how can you "open" and, more
importantly, "close" it? Where the LINKSET is used at the start point you
can say it is effective while any document the set refers to is listed in
the History/Go list (presuming this is minimized a la Netscape). But you
cannot use the same rules if the LINKSET is "attached" to a document at some
stage after its is first called.
