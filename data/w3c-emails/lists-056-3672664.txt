In case anyone is curious, here are the ways in which the opentag.dtd isn't
XML compliant (some of the ways are trivial, some not):

- #PCDATA must come at the beginning of a content model (%paratxt;, u, ...)
- #PCDATA must always use * occurrence indicator (u, ...)
- #PCDATA can't be in a model with pernicious mixed content (lvl)
- Exceptions not allowed (b, ...)
- OMITTAG specifications not (yet :-) allowed
- NUMBER declared value not allowed (p, ...)
- Comments not <!--* *--> (but this isn't in the spec version they used)

Designing and implementing DTDs according to the XML constraints is a new
discipline...
