we should allow (require) 1 level of indirection. So the first link you
come to, you follow silently. You park at the second whatever it is,
however.

This gives us the flexibility of indirection without need for loop
detection (remember processors where you could loop the microcode with
indirection). It also makes targeting a link more difficult, but not
excessively so.
