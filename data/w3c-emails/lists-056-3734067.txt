I don't like locator types. We should define a fixed list of types, and
leave it there -- interoperability and simplicity are not served by making
obvious extension mechanisms that people should not use.

I don't mind the single locator that much, but I'm not sure why it's an
issue... Are locators going to appear in the content of elements? I think
that's a bad idea because it violates many people's expectations that "tag
stripping" makes sense. It doesn't always, but putting link addresses in
content means that authors can no longer choose to use a tagging style in
which tag-stripping does make sense. This seems a problem to me.

nonexistent

Seems too complicated. Locator syntax should differentiate locator type,
via URL syntax.

This is a good reason for a single locator attribute -- although I strongly
believe that we should _not_ have multiple locatore languages: if TEI is
not enough, then XML should extend it, not add others in.

URL syntax, and self-indentifying fragment IDs. Possibly some LOCSRC-like
way to spcify a base URL, or starting entity (for XML syntax-based location)

Yes, I think. We could require a declaration to tell the difference: CDATA
link attributes would be URLs, and IDREF attributes would be IDREFs with
the same properties as today.

Worst case, we make IDREFS look like "#sdfds" and change the SGML concrete
syntax slightly.

replacing spaces with commas in the TEI locators makes soemthing that packs
nicely, as Steve has pointed out to me before now...
