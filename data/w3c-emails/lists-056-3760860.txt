4.1.f for me; URLs demonstrably do the job, and already encapsulate
a whole bunch of different schemes in a manner that if, inelegant, works.
I'd figure out a way to squeeze anything else we need into URLs - we
can do this with TEI XPTR's in one or two ways, and I suspect this would
be a win for TEI too.  That really leaves IDREF(S).  So... 
<asbestos-undies>do SGML IDREFs really need to be subsumed into XML Link?
They're already part of base XML.  If they do, must we retain the current
syntax, or can we URL-i-fy them, by putting '#' in front of IDREFs
and/or inventing a couple of new schemes?  Someone said that per
web rules, we have to formalize what the part after a '#' means in
XML anyhow.  Ooh, I'm gonna get scorched.</asbestos-undies> -T.
