I hate it, but I think we have to do this.  Warning: this is going
to be a *major* pain in the butt to explain/justify to the webheads
who are used to GI-dependent semantics.  A 2-phase teaching strategy
will be required - first you explain XML links using hardwired GI's
and attributes, then *later* you say "oh yes, and you can call 'em
what you want".

Eve's method is as good as any. -T.
