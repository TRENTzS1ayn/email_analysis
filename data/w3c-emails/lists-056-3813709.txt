Tough one.  I see three choices:

 1. duck, say nothing
 2. say we indirect one level, as Durand proposes
 3. make this another axis of behavior policy specification, a
    numeric-valued attribute, i.e. INDIRECT-CEILING=4?
 4. say we never indirect, leaving it up to the application.  I think we're
    going to get enough of TEI XPTR to have most of the goodness of
    location ladders.

I go for #4. -T.
