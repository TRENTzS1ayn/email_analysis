Right.  And the recommendation is only that it be done for mnemonic
purposes.  (I.e., as a reminder to humans doing manual tag input.)
The parser is guaranteed to ignore it.  Furthermore, in the CONREF
case, the recommendation is not even good advice.  Because when
the CONREF attribute is not specified (which presumably should happen
sometimes, or the element type should have been EMPTY and the attribute
REQUIRED), the omitted tag minimization parameter should be whatever
is appropriate when the CONREF attribute is *not* specified.

Yet another reason why the perfect parser would have each warning
able to be individually turned off.  Gang-switching all warnings
off just because you're deliberately going to violate one of the
warning conditions and don't want to be flooded with messages isn't
adequate.
