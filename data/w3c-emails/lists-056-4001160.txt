I won't to respond all David's arguments, because Murray Altheim did an
excellent job of countering most of them. Let me just pick up on a few
points he didn't cover:

And I take even more seriously the fact that James Clark *has*
implemented it. Even more so considering the arguments raised by those
who think LINK has been rendered obsolete by DSSSL. (Now why would the
guy who practically rewrote the DSSSL standard turn around and
implement LINK, I wonder?)

To be honest though, I don't think citing authorities is a very productive
way of conducting a discussion. (Do you want me to start marshalling
Charles, Eliot and others in my support?) I too have a lot of respect
for the Omnimark people, but I don't consider people's arguments in a
vaccuum. If anyone were to have a vested interest in *not* supporting
standard mechanisms for generalised processing it would be vendors of an
SGML processing language that is well on its way to becoming a de facto
proprietary standard. (Not that I am accusing anyone of intellectual
dishonesty; everyone's opinions are to some extent formed by their
personal interests, as well as their experience and needs.)

I said I didn't feel qualified to comment on how much extra difficulty
of implementation it would cause. I still don't, but I am grateful to
Steve DeRose for admitting that this isn't the major issue.

However, from a conceptual point of view, I think separate name spaces
is a great strength, precisely because it solves the problem of name
space collisions. Much cleaner than APPINFO "sda=sda" (or an implied
APPINFO "xml-link=xml-link") and another reason why the LINK-based solution
is preferable to multiple attlists.

It means that the document designer has included an element type which
generally acts like an xlink, but that for a particular processing run
(governed by a particular processing specification, or LPD) should be
processed as if it were a foobar. More power, see?

(Or else it means someone screwed up, of course. But you can't ever
guarantee against that.)

I did indeed mean something completely different. (Is my English really
that bad?) What I wrote was:

First of all, it was the *argument itself* I suspected of being vicarious.
As far as I was concerned, Tim was merely reporting the argument in an
objective manner. (I didn't know his own position at that point in time
anyway.)

Secondly, "vicarious" has nothing to do with fabricating positions. My
dictionary defines it as "deputed, delegated; acting or done for another".

My suspicion was that dislike of the syntax could not be the real
underlying reason for objecting to LINK, and subsequent discussion has
shown this to be the case (at least for Steve and Tim; it does appear that
this was Jon's principal objection).

I haven't seen any contributions from Michael on this topic. Did I miss
something?

Best regards,

Steve
