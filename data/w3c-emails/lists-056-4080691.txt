I did say I'd said my last for the time being, but I have to clear up
an error I made (I think):

I'm not sure this is the case after all. I may have been half-remembering
something else (that the "-A archname" option automatically activates any
LPD of the same name). But it would be a nice feature to have -- and calling
it "non-conformant" is a bit silly: All that would be happening would
be the on-the-fly creation of a virtual document. Nothing in the standard
that prohibits that.
