With SP, you can concatenate files on the command line, which allows you to
do:

nsgmls mydoctype.dtd mylpd.lpd  mydoc.sgm 

You can also have an external LPD subset, so you could do:

<!DOCTYPE Foo PUBLIC "...">
<!LINKTYPE XML-Stuff PUBLIC "...">
<foo>
 ...

Obviously, any entity manager could be designed so that you could "slip in"
a LINKTYPE declaration without actually having in the document entity,
although this is, of course, a hack.

Cheers,
