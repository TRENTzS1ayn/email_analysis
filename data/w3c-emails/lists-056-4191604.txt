Yes.

I think we should say that it should be done unless overridden by the user
or unless it fails to fetch some documents (broken links). We should make a
requirement that document sets not processed together should somehow
indicate to the user that the display is "incomplete".

In other words we can't ensure that applications do what they are asked,
but ought to require that they inform the user if they are not so doing.

yes. It should be recursively defined, too.

companion.

I like the term companion document.

companion/companions -- depending on structure.

we could use the same name for a PI if we use that method. I think elements
of one form or another are nicer, however.

PIs to extend XML are one thing, but XML link is, in some sense, the first
XML application people will see so we should play nice...
