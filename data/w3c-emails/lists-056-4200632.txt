No. Authors can define one if they need to do it.

No. I don't believe that it has enough value to justify controlling the
user's markup.

Despite the feeling that it's hard to find elements, you still have to find
the corral... I have not seen an argument that shows how corrals really
make things significantly easier, so I don't believe that they do.

No.

no. Even more restrictive than corrals. Emphatic no.
This makes external links extremely difficult to control, especially when
they are used within a document (eg. footnotes, commentary, local
imagemaps)...

We need to specify "minimal effectivity," so that users of a document are
free to keep as many external links as they want open -- but an author
shuld be guaranteed that once all companion documents are available, all
the external links in those companions will be visible in the starting
(displayed or current) document.

   In other words we want to enable authors to say what is _part of a
document_ but we might as well let readers determine if they want to add
links on their own (for bookmarks or commentaries, etc.).
