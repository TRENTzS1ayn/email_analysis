I do - I am aware that you have not thought out all the implications of the
change you suggest:-)

You need to specifically state what DTD the link was designed for so that
the parser can check that the LPD is not being applied to an DTD it was not
designed to work with

You need to say #IMPLIED so that the parser can check that the option to
allow implied links has been allowed for in the SGML declaration

The #INIITIAL makes the fact that this is the start point clear - you gain
nothing by changing it to a default name such as xml-proc

What the xref is meant to show is a puzzle - you have to assign attribute
values to specific element names in the link spec.

Yuk. This will just not work in the case of all SGML LPDs. How are we to
distinguish when it is relevant from the majority of cases where it is not?

It may be useful for XML - it is less than useful as a general contraction
of all SGML applications of LPDs. If it cannot be a general change to SGML
XML is no longer SGML conformant, which is what we have all been fighting
for so hard.
