I interpret this to mean that any use of the '#' target requires it to 
correspond to an ID and that HREF corresponds to an IDREF.  This represents 
a departure from HTML, and while there is no requirement to follow
those semantics, my primary concern is the potential confusion to users.
[I raise this because when I developed CML I started with IDREF/ID and
dropped in in favour of the HREF/NAME convention because I thought 
it was easier to 'sell' this to people who didn't know SGML.]
