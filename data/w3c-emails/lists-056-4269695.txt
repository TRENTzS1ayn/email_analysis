I think that presenting references as URLs (rather than SGML ID/IDREFs) is 
the best (and probably only) way to get the webheads (i.e. me) on board.

I'm wondering what the role of ID/IDREF now is?  Is it:
- left semantically free so that SGMLheads can use in in whatever
way they are used to
- acting as a synonym for a simple case of xlink?
- doing something significant but different?  (if so I'm not
clear what that is).

If we are requiring the target to be an ID, it needs spelling out.
