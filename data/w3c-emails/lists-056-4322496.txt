For newly-written DTDs, if you need SGML/OMITTAG YES compatibility,
there are pretty obvious tricks with parameter entities that you can
use.  For existing SGML DTDs, you're pretty fortunate if the omitted
tag stuff is all that needs fixing; compared to the possible labor
involved in dealing with inclusions, this is a piece of cake.  The
Perl-script-hacking approach can be applied to modifying the text of
DTDs as well as that of XML instances; fixing the omitted tag stuff is
amenable to that approach, but fixing content models is much less so.
