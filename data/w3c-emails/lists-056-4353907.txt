The first sentence/paragraph says:

  If the reference type is TEI, the HREF must be a TEI locator.

Do we mean "TEI locator as defined by the TEI Guidelines" or
"restricted TEI locator as defined by the XML subset."  I
assume the latter, since otherwise it makes no sense to talk
about restrictions, but then I think we need to say that in
the above quoted sentence.
