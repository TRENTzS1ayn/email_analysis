In the May 5 XML Link draft, section 5.2, location source:

I don't understand "referrer".  I don't know how to interpret
"the non-link element that refers to the link element."  I assume
"link element" should read "linking element" (ref. section 1.3),
but I didn't know the linking element was necessarily referred to
by anything.  Can someone please explain this to me?
