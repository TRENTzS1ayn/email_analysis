Only a hack as you described it.  But what SP does (I'm fairly sure--I
haven't actually used SP, but I know James) is not to slip a LINKTYPE
declaration into a pre-existing document entity; rather it creates the
document entity out of more than one pre-existing file.  Which is the job
of the entity manager, and doesn't violate SGML principles or rules.
