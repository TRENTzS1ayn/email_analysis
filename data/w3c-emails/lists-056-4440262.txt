The rule is in TEI, not SGML I assume?  Therefore we don't *have* to accept
it precisely for XML...?

I understand the logic!  This is going to create great fun with numbers.
Let's try something like:

<NUMBERS>-.2 +1.3 0.13E-14 -2.3E+14</NUMBERS>

These are all (I think) valid IEE representations.  If the rule is applied
as stated then (I think) namechars include '-' but not '+'.  Remarkably the
first 3 numbers appear to survive, but the fourth gets its exponent
deleted.

In fact, given this rule, I cannot see how numbers can be transmitted in
text (and I'm sure that there are even worse things we want to transmit!

I would very much like to avoid having to use the construction:
<NUMBER>-.2</NUMBER><NUMBER>+1.3</NUMBER>, etc. This will drive
scientists away quite rapidly.  Many languages (including XML) have a concept
of whitespace, so please can we qualify TOKEN with (say) DELIMITER="XML-S"
or similar if we want it.

It always does!  The challenge is how can we use it for free format material
which is not solely 'text'.  I think we must address this.
