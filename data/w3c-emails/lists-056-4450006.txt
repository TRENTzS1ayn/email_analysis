I am ignorant of the full glory of TEI (the phrase 'p.419' is slightly 
forbidding) but I wasn't really arguing for things I don't know about.
TOKEN (possibly amended as in a separate message) and PATTERN will do me fine,
though I will *have* to have something like FOREIGN and I would have thought
many others would wish to search non-textual information.
