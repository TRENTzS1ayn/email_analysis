We have been having considerable problems on XML-DEV interpreting
how and when entities are to be resolved, and there is sufficient ambiguity
that it would be useful for the WG/ERB to see if this aspect of the 
XML draft could be clarified.  I apologise for those WG/ERB members who 
will already have seen this on XML-DEV but I have been encouraged to bring 
this back.

My own experience comes from trying to 'convert HTML2.0 DTD to run under
XML'.  (My own DTDs use HTML2.0).  [I appreciate that there is no algorithmic
conversion and that certain constructs (e.g. inclusions) have no equivalent in 
XML].  HTML2.0 uses a significant number of PEs and PEReferences and some
have to be called iteratively.  My question therefore might be rephrasable
as:
'does XML have the same power of entity substitution as SGML?  If not, where
not?  Where it does, is it the intention of the ERB that it adopts the
same strategy for entity substitution? In any case, can it please be 
summarised?'

[Please accept this question from someone who learns by example, rather than
trying to understand 8879.  I'm afraid there are others like me...]
