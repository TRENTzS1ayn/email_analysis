This rule (unnatural as it is) was chosen for compatiblity with HyTimes's
TOKEN addressing mode -- I don't know its status nowadays, but I would be
happier with "space-delimited groups" than any other form of token. But I'd
rather leave it out, not becuase it isn't usefulk, but because it's hard to
make any definition of "token" that will work across the many contexts
where they may make sense -- scripts with their punctuation conventions,
programming and scripting languages, and no doubt others. We're better off
with REGEXPs I think...

It shows all the features -- so it's actually good that way. But the
definition is weird enough that its effects are not necessarily clear from
a casual reading.
