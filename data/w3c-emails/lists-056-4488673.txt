If use is not required, then implementors have to deal with external links
in arbitrary contexts anyway, hence the corral gives no advantage.

NO. -- since not using a corral allows the links anyway, using the corral
shouldn't introduce funky dependencies!

Hence, as I said before: Worthless!

And if you can have xlinks outside of corrals ever, then corrals are
rendundant.

This is right. We need to specify an effective set "required" by a document
to respect author intent -- Any other rules are a matter of user-and
application related choice. If we get the semantics clear, the rest will
surely follow.
