If you specify a "Base" (locsc) you deep-six any other logic for
determining the base. No problem.

No. If people give something more than one name, they are responsible for
making them all work. Otherwise we intorduce pointless complexity.

I don't see that we need anything other than relative URL rules for this --
either relative to the retrieval-source of the document, or whatever BASE
was specified.

This keeps it simple, and re-uses Web semantics where they make a lot of sense.
