I would also like to reinforce Lou's request. This was one of my first
comments on the initial draft, and it didn't generate any stinging
refutations. I think we need to be able to annotate resources that we can't
write on (_one_ reasong xlinks are so nice) -- and that means that there
may not be a convenient element to hang the notation on. And there may be
situations where an author wants to provide optional fine-grained links
without clogging the inline markup with a set of tags whose only purpose is
to serve as an anchor.

   Finally, of course, I don't see that there's that much of a problem
implementing such links -- it's a _very_ simple generalization of regular
xlinks.

Yes we do. I thought start/end might be better, but it collides with
linkend. and linkendstart and linkendend is confusing!
