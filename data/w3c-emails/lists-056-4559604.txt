Panorama (built with Synex ViewPort) implements a subset of TEI pointers
fairly close to the propsed subset for XML.  We do spans, too, since
otherwise you can't do user annotations with them.

There are samples enclosed with Panorama Pro.

Well, I don't know about imposing, but I agree with this.  There is no
difficulty in describing TEI pointers in this way, though -- again, see
the Panorama manual, or maybe I could post the relevant excerpt.
