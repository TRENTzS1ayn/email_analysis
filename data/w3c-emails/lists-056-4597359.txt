Language FAQs should not point to press announcements from vendors.
No disrespect, but that is the fastest way to get a rumor going that 
Softquad or any of the vendors listed as supporting XML have 
*unholy* influence, etc.  Eschew hegemonies real or perceived.

What we know, we know.  What we do, we have to explain.  
Otherwise, Reagan would be in prison playing canasta with 
Norriega.  :-)
