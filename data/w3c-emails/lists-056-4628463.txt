Works for me.  This XLG would be in a document other than the read-only
document.  Extending this idea, this other document could also
contain all the mappings between xmllink and the read-only document's
GIs and attribute names (which means that the read-only document
need not use the xmllink reserved names), and even a summary of
all the GIs in the read-only document that are EMPTY.  That would
enable XML (or at least the read-only document) to do without the 
<empty/> syntax, and potentially make many existing SGML documents 
valid XML documents.
