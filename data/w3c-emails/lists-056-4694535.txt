I don't understand this remark (and I did follow the WG's iscussion
of EMPTY, and I do have a lot of sympathy for the result).
                       
An XML-compliant application will have to be able to parse xmllinks,
won't it?  Or are you envisioning applications that can parse XML
but not xmllinks?

No -- that would mean that you could only parse XML documents if you
could parse the xlinks in this external document, so the document
would have to become part of the base XML spec, making that language
more complex.

This has all been discussed ad infinitum in the XML WG list, and the
current draft XML syntax for EMPTY elements is a compromise with good
reasons.  I (reluctantly) refer you to the archive...

The issue of existing SGML documents being valid XML is also much more
complex than just changing <empty> to <empty/>, and needs the use of a
tool like James Clark's SPAM anyway -- which could easily add the / in
empty elements' tags.

Any more on this probably belongs on the XML list, or in private mail!
