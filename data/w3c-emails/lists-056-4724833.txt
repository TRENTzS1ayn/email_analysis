I am hoping that _most_ XML applications will parse XML but will have
nothing to do with links or styles.

Examples:
* database export
* spreadsheet save as XML
* compiler intermediate file/parse tree
* financial transactions
* metadata records (XML version of MARC, if you will, or Dublin Core)
* preferences files
or anywhere else structured datea must be shared between applications.

The revolution is beginning.
If you're not for us, you will be soon.
When the time comes, and you're up facing that wall,
the black book will be empty.
