If current trends continue, the majority of them will be English speakers,
though not necessarily native English speakers. That isn't an argument
for language bigotry, but for suggesting that it *may* still be more intuitive
to most page authors five years from now than (seemingly random) numbers.

Anyhow, five years from now is a LONG TIME. What do we know about five years
from now: do they still edit XML text by hand? Do they still use a few,
standard DTDs, written in English? Do people write their own DTDs in their own
languages but continue to use the &lt; and &gt; conventions because they are
so universal? Did Unicode actually take off? Are programmers the only people
who see "raw" XML code?

Okay then, what do

<?XML ?> "version" CDATA DOCTYPE RMD

mean if I'm not an English speaker? Why are these funny double-tick
mark ("") characters special? How do I know that they start and end a string?

Once again, I'm not advocating that anyone be forced to use &lt;, but that it
be made easy for the majority of us now, and potentially in 5 years, who are
either familiar with the convention or are English speakers (native or not).
