Couldn't some parser author add an option to spit out a list of
the filenames used in parsing an instance? Say nsgmls -Z produces

   teisgml.dec
   foo.sgml
   teifpi2.ent
   ...
   tei2.dtd
   teicore2.dtd
   ...
   isolat1.ent
   
(complete paths where relevant) in a form you could pipe into tar or zip?
Or a list of the FPIs instead/as well?
