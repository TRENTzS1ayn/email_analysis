I want to emphasize John's point that short term concerns should take
precedence on this issue. Five extra pre-defined and perhaps overridable
entities won't hurt XML in 5 years. Maybe we'll look back critically at
our Anglo-centrism, but I can live with that. I'll already be doing 
penance for the environment and the plight of the Ogoni.
