| If current trends continue, the majority of them will be English
| speakers, though not necessarily native English speakers.

Your estimate of the future proportion of non-English-speaking
Internet users differs significantly from mine.

| Anyhow, five years from now is a LONG TIME. What do we know about five
| years from now: do they still edit XML text by hand?

Yes.

| Do they still use a few, standard DTDs, written in English?

No.

| Do people write their own DTDs in their own languages

They invent tags in their own languages.  Most of them don't know what
a DTD is and don't care.

| but continue to use the &lt; and &gt; conventions because they are so
| universal?

Depends on what we decide.

| Did Unicode actually take off?

If it didn't, we're toast.  The XML character set is based on the
assumption that Unicode takes off.

| Are programmers the only people who see "raw" XML code?

No.  But with few exceptions they will be the only ones who need to
put in a character entity by hand.
