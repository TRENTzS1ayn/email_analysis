I'm not sure quite what you mean by 'quoted.' I think the names
seem strange in that it isn't the 'direct English' of 'amp' or 'lt'.
If it were available as an option, I'd much prefer using character
references in this form, since

  a. we are really only using them to escape special characters 
     in SGML, so most if not all are declared in the reference
     delimiter set (Goldfarb, p. 360)
  b. if the reference delimiter is changed, (eg., '<' to 'foo') then
     the entity reference ('&#ERO') changes with it
  c. they are as 'language-neutral' as SGML, rather than specifically
     English acronyms
  d. they are well-defined (ie.,8879)
  
But from what I can gather, they can't be used in a document instance.
nsgmls returns an error such as

   "ERO" is not a function name
   
so I'm gathering this option is not available. Too bad though.

I'd certainly be happy with several such as you mention, but logically
to me it seems better if we don't define any at all, insofar as they 
aren't formally declared in DTD-less documents unless a default
ENTITIES document is invisibly included. And then, we're not compatible
with SGML.
