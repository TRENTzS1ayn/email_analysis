Not a cheap shot at all.  My point is exactly that an XML instance
without a style sheet, an applet that interprets the semantics of
the GIs, a DTD, or some other document that collects that and
similiar information is uninterpretable.  As some other piece is
required to interpret XML markup, the opportunity exists to insert
a summary of EMPTY GIs there - an idea mooted last Fall in the 
context of PIs.  

I am more concerned about packaging and delivery in general than
with <empty/>; I brought it up only to show that packaging and 
delivery have implications for aspects of XML that have already
been decided - but could be reconsidered before everyone's feet
are set in concrete.  Now's the time.
