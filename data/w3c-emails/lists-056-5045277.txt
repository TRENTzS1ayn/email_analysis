If the Web architecture cannot support clean internationalization, 
then making all locators URLs is only an option for the first 
release.  My guess is, this is a hole that can be exploited in the 
competition between the two commercial vendors of web browsers and 
should, therefore, be left open in some way to take advantage 
of the one who is able to devise a *beyond URL* solution.

If IDREFs can't be links, we are invalidating a lot of existing 
work in SGML as well in order to accomodate a weak addressing 
system.

It looks like URLs need some work.  You should make it clear 
that URLs are a first version limitation only and that XML 
developers should be working on a stronger, more flexible, 
and more international solution.  If they can't do this 
within the URL framework, then it should be replaced.
