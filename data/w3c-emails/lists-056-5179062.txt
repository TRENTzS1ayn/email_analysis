TOKEN and FOREIGN seemed the obvious ways to solve some of my problems.
I'm happy to accept the ERB's conclusion, but will require some method
of searching through a node once it has been reached by a TEI pointer.
Is this completely application-specific, or is there a way (FOREIGN not
being allowed) to apply (say) a Java method to the node contents?  It could
be worthwhile to converge towards a standard syntax, because this will
be a common requirement and general XML applications/browsers will need to
recognise it.  (It may be that the solution is best discussed elsewhere,
but I'd like to feel comfortable :-)
