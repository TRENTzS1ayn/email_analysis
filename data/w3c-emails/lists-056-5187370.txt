No -- I was writing from home, sorry.
They are GREATER THAN and LESS THAN.

UNICODE has ' (0027) as APOSTROPHE-QUOT
and         ` (0060) as SPACING GRAVE

> What authority says that the &quot entity is "`"? 

My faulty memory.  Actually different SGML sources give &quot;
to be ' or ", which doesn't help (e.g. Joan Smith, an authority but
not authoritative) gives quot as " and since the standard didn't
give pictures, nor the handbook, that's how I've always used it.

Yes, that's resonable.  In display work the single quote is often
rendered more heavily.

Well, ASCII has it as an apostrophe, I believe.

No, it's a common computer science name: bra and ket, [ and ].

Someone else gave the 5 names.  The spec isn't up to date, so I didn't
check against it, sorry.

If the names are part of the language they must begin with XML-.

If you can override them, they should not begin with XML-.

If you override them and do not have a DTD, you're OK to the
same extent you are with any other entity.

I don't see how you can forbid other entities to have replacement values
of & or < or " --- and that would be the effect of your second bullet
point --- so that must surely be an error in reading?
