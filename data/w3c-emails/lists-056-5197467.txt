This is an issue for URLs in general.  When the HTML/HTTP/URI groups
agree on somethhing, we can follow it in a future XML.

The browser is responsible for URL-encoding strings passed over HTTP
as part of GET requests.

Some old and broken HTML browsers did't URL-encode things they found
in HTML, or tha the user entered.  I note that Netsape 4 does do automatic
URL enoding, and I think 3 does also.  MSIE quotes spaces but allows 8-bit
characters to pass through, but turns \ into / everywhere (!)

It would be a good idea to mention in the XML link spec that URLS must
be url-encoded by software that uses them in contexts that require such
encoding, and that they may be expected to undo/revese such encodings
before displaying the results to users.

Good!

Note that this way XML will be no less international than the WWW...
where there are strong incentives for i18n.

Perhaps someone (Misha?  You there?) could comment on RFC 2070 and 
that working group's discussion on URLs.
