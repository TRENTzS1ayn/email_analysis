One thing which was abundantly unclear in the spec until Mike S-McQ
pointed it out to me last weekend is that even valid instances must
use <empty/> format, even if the element is defined EMPTY in the DTD.

I has mistakenly assumed that DTDfull instances didn't need this,
because the DTD said which elements were EMPTY and which weren't,
and that <br/> would be required only in DTDless cases.

I've changed the FAQ to reflect this, 0.5 out next week including math 
in response to several queries as to whether XML could "handle" it (some
misapprehensions still being created :-)
