I mentioned some while ago my feelings about doing FPI resolution over
the network on a client-server basis. After some discussion last
weekend with MSQM, I have put my money where my mouth is and done some
coding, which you can test drive at

     http://www.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/PUBLIC

Basically, if you attach an FPI to the end of this, separated by a ?
in the usual manner, and replacing spaces with underscores, it will try
to resolve it and send back the file, eg

     http://www.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/PUBLIC?-//IETF//DTD_HTML//EN

It seems to work OK in Nutscope and Opera, but MSIE refuses to recognisethe
Content-type of text/plain, which raises the question as to whether we or
someone needs to type DTDs, char ent files, and fragment files.

Currently it works only for the DTDs etc I have on disk (natch) but if 
you supply a partial FPI, it resolves as much as it can and gives you a
list of possible completions.

Comments welcomed.
