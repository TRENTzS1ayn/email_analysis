On being jogged by a WG member, I realized that I had fallen much
further behind in keeping up the unofficial WG archive than I had
thought.  My apologies.

I have put the WG mail for February and the first half of March on
sunsite.unc.edu in files named 9702a, 9702b, and 9703a:

   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9702a.gz
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9702a.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9702b.gz
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9702b.zip
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9703a.gz
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/wg/9703a.zip

You can also use HTTP to retrieve these.

As usual, I cannot guarantee that I received everything sent to the
list, but these files contain everything that I did receive.  The W3C
archive for this group is publicly visible, so you are free to share
these files with anyone who might be interested in our transactions.
