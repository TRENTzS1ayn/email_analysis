I wonder what constitutes sane (or insane) Unicode encoding :-)

Aparently at last week's Unicode conference in Mainz it was agreed that URLs
would be allowed to contain any 10646 character providing that those outside
the first 95 characters were replaced by %number representations. (I also
heard that the %number concept would be extended to allow hexadecimal
numbers, but I find this somewhat hard to believe without the invention of a
number delimiter code or a fixed length requirement for both numbers and hex
values.)

Presumably the same rules will apply to fragment names as to domain and file
names.
