How can implementors implement case folding interoperably if there

If you specify server behavior for URLs that is not that specified
by the existing RFCs, please either call them something other than
URLs or put your case for variant behavior to the IETF's URL WG.  
"Too bad" is not much of an argument.  Did the ERB consider using queries
rather than fragment locators?
