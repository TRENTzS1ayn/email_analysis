I agree that we need to "edit" all the names cohesively, and I especially
like your suggestions about using "SIMPLE" instead of "LINK" and having all
the XML-LINK values right up front.  (Have we actually voted on HREF as the
name for the locator attribute?  I don't think so.)

I suspect that the latest version of the spec needs some basic cleanup that
will take care of some of your comments.  (There shouldn't be a Behavior
attribute anymore, and why did we spend hours on Label just to have a Title
attribute? :-)
