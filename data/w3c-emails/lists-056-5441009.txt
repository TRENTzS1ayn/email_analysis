I just did some tests and it appears that the fragment identifier (the text
following the hash on the URL) is even passed to the server, at least for
HTTP.  Thus a server does not even know that you are addressing 
http://www.overthere.com/this/and/that#foo
rather than
http://www.overthere.com/this/and/that

This makes using the fragment identifier for server-side filtering rather
difficult, as I see it.
