There are two points here, which have not been distinguished clearly
in what Tim has posted, although I'm sure he has them distinct in
his mind.

  1.  What is the URL fragment syntax for XML; that is, what do 
      fragment identifiers mean wrt XML?

  2.  How can the TEI mechanism be used in URLs in general?  

After all, I might want to use URLs with TEI xptrs to point to
almost any kind of data, not solely XML.

Tim's remarks about large XML documents apply just as well to
other data formats; they can be big, it may be desired to retrieve
only parts of them, and so on.  It should not be assumed that TEI
xptrs are going to be used solely with XML, and thus a solution to
(1) above does not provide an answer to (2), unless the limiting
assumption is made that for every large data format a special
query language must be constructed.

I assume Eliot would agree ...
