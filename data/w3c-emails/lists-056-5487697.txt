We assume he means 'NOT even passed to the server'

In XML, we do *not* want to build the server-side/client-side 
distinction into the link syntax.  We want to attach a URL and
a TEI xpointer and let the server & client figure out what to
do.  If we want to force server-side processing, the '?'
syntax is available.  

There is nothing in the current URL RFC that allows a resource/fragment
partitioning without also forcing the process model.  In my view, this
is purely a bug.  Either we introduce a new syntax, or we overload '#' 
and let the market deal with it. -Tim
