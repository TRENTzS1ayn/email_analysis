On the subject of fragment IDs, there seems to be some confusion.

There are two kinds of fragments.

One is a standalone part of a larger document, where only the fragment
is served.  That isn't the web fragment, though.  The other is a named
part of a document, where you have the whole document, and want to go
to a particular region (surrounded in HTML with <A NAME=xxx>....</X>).

Please don't confuse them.

SGML Open fragments are nothing whatsoever to do with the # kind of fragments.
I'll call them chunks for now.

In a web world, you are supposed to do SGML Open chunks by giving each
chunk its own URL, just as DynaWeb (there! I spelt it right!) does.

Since # is for something different than chunks, it doesn't have to solve
the chunk requirements, and therefore the fact that the #stuff doesn't
get sent to the server turns out not to be a problem.
