This was a question I asked Tim.  He told me that there shouldn't 
be this distinction in the spec per se.  I agree;  this looked 
to me like a way to handle the implementation under COM, so it's 
a discussion that probably belongs on the developer's list;

I agree with what you are saying above, but that has always been 
the case with URLs as far as I know.  Watching some of the 
discussions on the uri list, it seemed that trying to get the
naming and addressing concepts into separate boxes was a fairly 
difficult problem.
