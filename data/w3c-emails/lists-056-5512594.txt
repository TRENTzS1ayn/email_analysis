Or two things named "fragments".

That is fragment as I usually think of it.  A separable piece of a
whole.

That is a named location with an element to anchor the locator.  Call it
a 
fragment if you like, but that isn't what one usually thinks of as a 
fragment in SGML.  Thats a position to scroll to.

How does that work?  IOW, what gets returned?  The document, or the 
fragment/chunk/frame?

Are you suggesting a different URL convention for the SGML fragment?
Again, what gets returned?
