While I agree with the sentiment, I object strongly, very strongly,
to overloading the query part of a URL. Such usage just confluges
the 3 seperate roles of URL's.

Right. This is why I prefer to use the *pure* URL (none of the fragment
or query part, or even URL parameters). The pure URL should be regarded
as an address, and carries few semantics, which is exectly what we want.
