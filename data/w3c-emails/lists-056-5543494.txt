Please don't do this!  Let's not add confusion by trying to rename
something that's had a perfectly good name for some time now.

What TR9601 deals with are fragments, let's not try to start calling
them chunks now.

It seems to me that, of the two uses of the word "fragment," the one
referring to a named region of the document is misnamed.  How about
"named region"?
