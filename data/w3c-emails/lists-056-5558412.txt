Like it or not, the name of the "#foo" thing at the end
of a URL is called a "fragment identifier". There is 
really nothing wrong with the name, as it is an identifier
for a fragment within an HTML document. 

You can futz about with names all you like. The fragment 
identifier is entrenched in Web-speak. There is no getting
around that. Trying to rename it will only create confusion
for the large base of HTML users.

Just my humble opinion,
