This is eay to fix, though. An alternate syntax should not be a serious

   No, we need to define the client-side method. We can suggest a
server-side sytnax, but frankly I doubt that we can do that in a way that
will satisfy all the servers (and unprincipled hacks) out there on the
server side -- and I don't see that we really need to.

   I think that leaving it to the author to decide how the URL should be
done is perfectly reasonable: Things like the OED will not be served up
monolithically (probably by contract with OUP!), and so references made by
authors (or people browsing a site) will automatically be in terms of URLs
that designate smaller, well-formed document fragments.

   I'm afraid that I don't see what the problem is with having two formats,
and no standard for the server side.

  Servers can serve up URLs that take advantage of whatever queries they
support. This does not seem difficult to ensure. I don't really see a
significant practical advantage (other than neatness) to standardizing the
server query syntax.

   I suppose you could do blind queries to a server if you have a common
syntax, but I'm not sure that that is a primary goal here...  It certainly
doesn't seem _required_ to support linking and browsing, which are the
de-facto requirements for WWW compatibility.

   Can anyone offer an argument to convince me?
