I was VP of Engineering at ArborText about 4 years ago.  Most bulk mail
that currently gets addressed to:
Paul Grosso
VP of Engineering at ArborText
(and a lot still does!) should and does get rerouted locally (by some
effecient adminstrative folks) to Mike McEvoy who is the current VP of 
Engineering.  It should not get sent to me, despite the fact that the
"system id" of Paul Grosso is still a valid identifier.

I strongly disagree.

No, the reader of a read-only document can do no such thing.

Yes, one can add something like the OVERRIDE entry to the catalog.
This is one way to implement my choice (g) which says to require 
that there is some way for the user to specify which to try first
(so that the user can specific that PUBLIC should be tried first).

But I'm not going to be the one to suggest we complicate the XML catalog.
