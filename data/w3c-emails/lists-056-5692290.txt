That is exactly my point: the misalignment of public identifier target and
system identifier target is a mistake. The results should be unspecified.
If I send mail to Paul Grosso at Paul Prescod's address, I probably will not
get mail to Paul Grosso.

The author can delete the system identifier if their goal is to allow 
overriding. That was the scenario you described in your first message: the
author wants to allow overriding.

Nothing needs to be added to the catalog. Catalogs are by definition 
read/write*. This is the ultimate override. If an author wants to allow 
overriding, they should put in the public identifier and leave out the 
system identifier.

* If catalogs are not read/write, at least logically, then there is no way 
to override them, whether a system identifier is specified or not.

I am beginning to think it would be simplest to just require one or the
other. Providing both is useful when there is no reliable mechanism to
transmit a catalog, which represents a default lookup mechanism. But if we
specify a reliable catalog mechanism, what is the argument for allowing
both? It seems like it is just a feature designed to cause confusion and 
mistakes.
