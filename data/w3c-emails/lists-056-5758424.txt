The rhs has to date always been a storage object identifier.  The
latest draft (TR9401:1997), which is still in subcommittee, changes
the rhs to be a Formal System Identifier.  In no case is it a public
identifier.  (Technically, it's not a system identifier either, but
it is true that your average system identifier is a storage object
identifier, so while Michael's wording is slightly imprecise, it
is not particularly misleading.)
