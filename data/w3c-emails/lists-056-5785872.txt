It is not a logical error - it is an absolute necessity. 

Consider the case where an XML-LINK uses an option, such as REPLACE, that
cannot be supported on a receiving system. The system may require that a
local variant of the DTD be produced and that this local variant be used to
override the vesion pointed to by the system identifier. 

Similarly I may need to restrict the set of colours that an HTML document
can be displayed in to ensure that no one reading the document at my site
who suffers from epilepsy will be effected by a bad colour combination in a
bgcolour or colour attribute. I may also need to ensure that the DTD does
not contain a blink option for the same reason. I may be constrained by my
insurance company to ensure that such situations cannot occur if I want to
continue trading!

Rubbish - if you send me a letter next Monday address it to me c/o the
European Commission in Brussels, but please also send a copy to my office so
that it can be placed in the office filing system!

It is not abuse - it is a requirement to overcome operating restrictions
when requesting read-only data you have no control over.

99.9% of XML files will be read only - you can't just delete their system
identifier.

It may not be the responsibility of the user. In most companies it will be
the responsibility of the system manager to ensure that company policy is
followed, not the users.
