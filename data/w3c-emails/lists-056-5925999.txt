I ran it with NXP. I had to make a few changes :

1.) <!element foo o o any> ---> <!element foo any>
(The ERB hasn't decided yet on this subject, or has it ?)

2.) I had to change the position of yy and zz
(I wasn't thinking about this problem of refering to 
an entity that was not yet declared. Now I need to check
carefully when NXP resolves (is supposed to resolve) entity references)

3.) <!entity % yy '&#37;zz'> --> <!entity % yy '&#37;zz;'>
(Note the semicolon after zz !)

After these changes I got the same results.

FYI: I tested with latest release. It has not been published yet.
