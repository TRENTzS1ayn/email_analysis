So now *every* URL must be looked up in the catalog? And if we design a 
global resolution system then every URL must be looked up first in the global
resolution system (which could be several network messages) and then, on 
failure, is directly accessed? I prefer to call a spade a spade: public 
identifiers are designed to be looked up. They are not addresses. System
identifiers describe where something lives: they are addresses.
