The first two above are only available to W3C members.
I note something that may be related to those two, but not
referenced in Jon's list, and available from the Microsoft site is:

Channel Definition Format (CDF)

CDF is an application of XML. Thus its definition consists of the 
various XML elements and attlists defined therein.

This CDF DTD has no #PCDATA. All content is in structure and attribute
strings. As the purpose of CDF is to allow broadcast, push, from any 
desktop, these attributes provide structured description of what is 
being pushed (through urls). Presumably a client will automatically 
get and possibly request some or all of those received urls.
