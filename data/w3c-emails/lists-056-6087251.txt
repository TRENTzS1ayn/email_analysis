>I share Norbert's concern about uncertainties in the XML draft 

For the record: us too.  Our feeling is that, as Norbert suggests,
once WWW6 hits, XML is de facto frozen because there will be more than
just our little family doing implementations.  As a result, Michael
S-McQ and I, and the ERB, are plowing through all the issues
like mad; Michael and I spent a half-day together Friday plowing through
all the little syntax errors and style problems that people sent in;
Murata Makoto is the best proof-reader of all, by the way.  The right
thing to do is pretty clear in almost all cases (except bloody horrible
parameter entities) and right or wrong, we *must* have a solid spec
by March 31... the decisions are almost certainly going to disappoint
some of you, but at least we'll have the virtue of the thing being
solid.
