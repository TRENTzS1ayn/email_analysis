The original posting of the decision did have the form <--* ... *-->

Tim Bray and I are at work on a revised version of the draft spec
which will include fixes for the reported errors and the changes so
far agreed to, for the comment syntax (adding the asterisks) and
white-space handling.

Right now, the standard disclaimers pasted on all W3C working drafts
remain appropriate:  the draft is subject to change.  If a given
version of the draft is clear and consistent with itself, I think
we're doing OK.  If implementors want currency more than consistency
and clarity, the decisions we've made have all been announced, and
the logs of the WG are the place to find the decisions.

They are the current version; the current version is always subject
to revision.  In fact, the only changes being made to the productions
are:

  - correction of reported errors (missing *, missing S, etc.)
  - implementation of the comment-syntax decision, to prepare XML
    for use of comment open- and close-delimiters when SGML gets
    them
  - incorporation of more of the constraints on entity replacement
    into the grammar (in particular parameter entities)
  - simplification of some productions using regular-expression
    subtraction.  (This is a notation Tim found in some orthodox
    CS treatment of regular expressions, so it's not just ad
    hockery:  (A - B) defines the language which contains all the
    members of A except those which are also members of B.  Comments
    can be defined as

    '<!--*' (Char* - (Char* '*-->' Char*)) '*-->

    which is, in a slightly more formal way, almost exactly what
    Lee suggested long ago:  anything can appear in a comment,
    but not the string '*-->'.  Translation from this notation into
    that of a specific regular expression engine may require close
    attention to detail ...

Since we'll add some things to the grammar to allow us to talk more
directly about parameter entities and how they are expanded and where
they are going to occur, I think we'll be able to say very explicitly
when general entities are / may be / must be expanded.  I don't think we
should constrain the order of comment handling beyond what is logically
implied by the constraints given in the section on logical and physical
structure.

Catalogs are not now part of XML.  Whether they are likely to become
part of XML is something every implementor must judge individually.

I hope this helps.  I see Tim has already replied, but I will send
this anyway in case having the same message in a second formulation
proves helpful.
