This is rather like Michael and Lou's paper at WWW '94, in which they asked
browsers to be able to map element names to HTML element names, almost
as if they were architectural forms.

A better way than hard-wiring some semantics is to have a Behaviour Sheet,
a small XML document that maps from (element, attribute) pairs into
HTML feature.

One could use the DSSSL transformation process, but that is more complex.
