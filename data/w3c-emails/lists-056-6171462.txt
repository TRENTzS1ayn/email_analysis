Except for forms, that's IADS.  It will work very nicely and is 
easy to use.  Plan C is easy.  Make an interactive stylesheet 
editor for it and keep the styles fairly simple to build with.
Take a look at the IADS stylesheet editor if you want some 
ideas.  It helps if it can suck in a DTD and 
populate the tag tree.  That way, existing DTDs can be 
converted quickly and you get mindshare quick from a 
ready audience.
