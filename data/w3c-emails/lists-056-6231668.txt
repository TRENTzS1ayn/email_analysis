Thanks for the public URL, Harvey!

I noticed some problems with MS's examples.  They use net-enabled
start-tags in a couple of places (like the ITEM example), they don't
use XML declarations, and they don't quote all attribute values.
Other than that, it's nice to see XML being used, whatever _le Monde
Informatique_ may think of it.
