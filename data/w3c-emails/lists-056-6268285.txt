I object strongly to this. I recommed using the ";"
separator to produce a URL parameter instead of a query 
parameter. This does not add anything else to the already
overloaded query area, and allows mixed references and queries.

For example:

   http://foo.com/foo.sgml;XML-PTR=ID(A27)?keyword=foo

This is just as easily handled in CGI as anything else, and
cleanly separates addressing and querying. You can also
use it with fragment specifications.
