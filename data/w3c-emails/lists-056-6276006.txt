And he's right: don't use # or ? to mean something special in URLS
when they already have meanings...

especially when we already have a good way of diong it with semicolon.

I'm not sure what the ?keyword=foo is here, though --
don't the parameters come _after_ the query?  Well, I don't have
the specs in front of me, sorry.
