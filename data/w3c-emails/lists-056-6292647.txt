Can you (or anyone) give a clear explanation of when and where the
semicolon can be used?  I have read RFC 1738 without becoming clear on
the interrelations of semicolon, question mark, and hash mark.  The
ERB originally wanted to have something to separate the URL proper
from the extended-pointer syntax, which did NOT specify explicitly
whether it was the client or the server which should actually do
the query.  Would semicolon fit that bill?
