I find that RFC 1808 has a clearer description of the URL grammar, especially
where params are concerned. It is quite clear on the syntax:

   <scheme>://<net_loc>/<path>;<params>?<query>#<fragment>

Unfortunately, the new Berners-Lee/Fielding/Masinter draft appears to 
contradict RFC 1808 with respest to parameters.

   "Extensive testing of current client applications demonstrated that
   the majority of deployed systems do not use the ";" character to
   indicate trailing parameter information, ..."

Our application certainly makes use of ";" to indicate trailing parameters
and I suspect will break if this draft is adopted unmodified. I'd hesitate to
use the "new" Berners-Lee/Fielding/Masinter syntax unless it has already 
become an RFC.
