The semicolon would fit the bill, though as was noted, currently,
no clients that I am aware of interpret the path parameters. This
does not mean that a client *couldn't* interpret them (fact is
that most clients also interpret URL's... take relative URL's
for example).

I question the desire to separate the Xptr syntax from the URL.
What is the purpose of the Xptr if not to address something?
What do the following mean to people? 

  http://foo.com/foo;xml-xptr=ID(a27)
  http://foo.com/foo?xml-xptr=ID(a27)
  http://foo.com/foo;xml-xptr=ID(a27)?keyword=foo
  http://foo.com/foo?xml-xptr=ID(a27);keyword=foo
