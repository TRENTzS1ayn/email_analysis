| Yup.  Obviously.  Also, it's a query.  I totally fail to see the
| utility, or even the existence, of a distinction between an
| address and a query.  Given the URL 
|  http://docs.sun.com/ab2/alluser/ADVOSUG/@xmlToc
| tell me please, is that an address or a query?

@xmlToc is the name of a script that generates the XML TOC for the
book named ADVOSUG.  If the choice is between address and query, it's
a query.
