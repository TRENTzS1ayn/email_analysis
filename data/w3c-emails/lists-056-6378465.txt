We decided months ago that the second of the two WG in-person meetings
would take place at the WWW6 conference in Santa Clara.  I think the
best plan would be to hold it Thursday evening, April 10, right after
the conference closes.  After the WG meeting we could have a smaller
meeting of those who intend to give demonstrations during the
Developer's Day session on Friday.

To arrange space for the meeting I need to know how many people will
be there.  Please send me private mail (we don't need your reply
archived!) under the heading "WG meeting at WWW6" if you know that you
will be attending.

Jon
