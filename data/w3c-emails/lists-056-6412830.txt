What's wrong with the Paul's DSSSL approach, or a (cleaner, non-HTML
mentioning) architectural-form approach?

Is <form> support on the XML-wg agenda?

No problem, assuming easy-to-use XML stylesheet editors ;-) Unfortunately,
XML+DSSSL is hard to sell to the "Notepad" crowd.

What differentiates (well-designed) SGML publishing from (current) Web
publishing, in my mind, is the following: The former gives publishers an
eXtensible way to describe content, whereas the latter gives leading
browser makers an exten$ible way to describe formatting. So if MSFT or NSCP
ever decide to throw in a set of formatting commands to make equations
*look* good, then much of your argument disappears.
