In all servers I've access to, MIME parameters are passed on unaltered
to the CGI script, which is free to do (for example)
    if (/[?]/) {
s/[&]/;/g
    }
and then proceed.

For example, Netscape and Oracle servers handle this fine, as do
NCSA and Apache.

That's well over half of Internet web servers already... so I wouldn't
say "almost no servers".

It's true that they don't pass the parameters to the CGI script in
a separate variable, if that's what you mean, but they don't swallow
them either.
