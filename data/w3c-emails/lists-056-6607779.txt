Drawing arbitrary lines is what a standard is for. Being arbitrary is not
_always_ a crime.

I don't think so in this case. One reason to preserve those entity values
is that people know them as an escaping mechanism for syntactic characters.

I for one, still think that for the reasons you give, we should have
included ISOlat1; I think compatibility with HTML is important, and
compatibility with the rest of the ISO standards is a non-issue.

However, I think that the magic five have a different argument which is to
allow a "simple" escaping mechanism. For many HTML-level users, the notion
of character codes is not simple. The notion of escape sequences is one
that they have already been forced to deal with -- so we should not force
them to the character code model when it's not required.

Personally I sympathise with the DHH (Dumb HTML Hacker). Despite years of
CS geekdom, I still file most numerical information in a mental hashtable,
under the key "number" -- and almost always have to look up even codes that
I've looked up 1000 times. So I know that _even for me_ the usability
increase will be significant if we keep the entities.

And as you know, the incompleteness of the Unicode character set means that
we are already forcing people to invent non-transportable opaque private
character sets (SDATA again). Let's not make it even worse by throwing out
useful, totally standard, well-established practice in favor of more
obscure, hard-to-remember numerical codes.
