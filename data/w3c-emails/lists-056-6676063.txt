| 8. Should the predefined entities be removed or altered?
| 
| Proposal: Drop all predefined entities
| Yes: Kimber, Bosak, Maler
|  No: Bray, Clark, Paoli, Sperberg-McQueen, Hollander, Sharpe, Magliery,
|      DeRose
| 
| Proposal: Well-formed XML docs are considered to have &lt;, &gt;, &apos;,
|           &quot;, and &amp; predefined.  Valid XML docs must have them 
|           declared *if* they use them; the spec will give a precise 
|           definition of what the declaration must be.
| 
| Passed unanimously.  Outstanding item to get the declaration just right.

Does this mean that a well formed XML doc that uses &apos; becomes
invalid if a doctype declaration is added and &apos; is not 
declared?
