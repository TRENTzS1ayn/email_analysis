It must be made crystal clear that its absence implies:

o XML version 1.0 - documents complying with future versions are going
  to have to require the declaration for disambiguation
o UTF-8 or UCS-2 encoding - "An entity which begins with neither a
  Byte Order Mark nor an encoding declaration must be in the UTF-8
  encoding."
o RMD of ALL - "If no RMD is provided, the effect is identical to an
  RMD with the value ALL".  I disagree with this choice of defaults,
  but that is the current spec.
