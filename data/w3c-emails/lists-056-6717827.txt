Yes, I agree.

Yes, I agree.

I agree with Chris on both points here, I think.  When the latest
draft of the spec is available, we'll have to review this aspect carefully
and see what the implictions are of RMD=ALL, as I think other changes
in XML may have happened (e.g. the entity names).

If we are very clear on the Default Version, we will be able to
add PUBLIC in later if ever more than two people can agree on what it
means or does :-), and if there is ever a satisfactory way of using them
automatically over the Internet that has been deployed and tested.

In the absence of PUBLIC IDs, we will need to support the processing
instructions for links to style sheets, of course, when we get to
that part.
