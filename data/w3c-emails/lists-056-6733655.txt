Please can you/the_gang ensure that the munged syntax is human-readable and 
human-hackable if possible.  I suspect that many of these queries/addresses 
will be authored by humans and no-one seems to think there are good graphical
tools (yet).  I would prefer that we didn't have to type %20 throughout
the string because it's both unreadable and error-prone (at least for me:-)
