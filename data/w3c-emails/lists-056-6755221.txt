It should be noted that all the NO votes were "no, not ready for this
particular draft, we need to agree on a resolution mechanism before we
can include public identifiers."  There is general agreement that XML
will have public identifiers, but there has to be general agreement on
a resolution mechanism before it shows up in the spec.  XML 1.0 has a
long way to go before it achieves "recommended" status.  This feature
just isn't cooked yet.
