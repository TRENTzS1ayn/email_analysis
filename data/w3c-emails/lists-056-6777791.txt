I concur.  I too thought the voices of sanity had prevailed, so 
I have been quiet . All my documents and those of my clients
will also be non-compliant.  Writing small programs to take out the
minimization indicators out of DTDs and make empty elements look different 
in instances is trivial. Coming up with an entirely new 
mechanism to solve my identification/location problems is NOT.

In my opinion, Resolution is 
      NOT 
part of your charter.  You are not going to tell me 
what to do with a URL, that's my problem as an application.
There have been legions of PRO arguments.  The only counter
argument that stuck (or did I miss a few?) was "there is no
agreed upon mechanism."  This is true, but not necessarily useful!
