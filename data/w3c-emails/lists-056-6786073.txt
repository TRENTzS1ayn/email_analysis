Jon,

Thanks for that note -- it makes me feel a lot better about this 
decision.

BTW, on talking with Bill Smith about the variance in needs between people
like Tim and Eliot's needs, what's the likelihood of defining conformance
levels for XML? This would allow a lightwight app to have, for example:

   XML-CORE:  Level 1 (core of XML)
   XML-LINK:  Level 1 (basic linking ala HTML)
   XML-STYLE: Level 0 (no stylesheets)
    
while an intermediate app might declare:

   XML-CORE:  Level 2  (charent and literal ENTITY decls, etc.)
   XML-LINK:  Level 2  (add a few more interesting link types)
   XML-STYLE: Level 1  (dsssl-o or similar)

and the mother of all XML apps:

   XML-CORE:  Level 3  (ext. text ENTITIES, PUBLIC, DELEGATE support, etc.)
   XML-LINK:  Level 3  (full linking; ~TEI, etc.)
   XML-STYLE: Level 2  (dsssl)

We'd also need versioning, so the PI for XML would contain an indicator
such as XML-LINK="L2V1.0.1". We could define the conformance level of 0
as non-conforming, and base the concept of 'well-formed' upon a sensible
conformance declaration.

Just some ideas really, not wishing to start a new flame war.
