On the contrary, I think PUBLIC is ideal for the Internet, because it
provides just the right levels of identification. But it does need 
owners to register, and the GCA to run a server-based index.

But maybe URNs will do all this...everyone seems to think they'll stop
nuclear war and make the trains run on time, just like Mussolini, but
I have yet to see anything that makes me believe it.

I don't see any advantage. The latter already works: URN's aren't in
use yet.
