What this means is that all HTTP requests are really queries of some sort,
although some queries are more obvious than others.  Servers may try to give
the impression of a distributed name space, but after all, any request to a
server may result in an arbitrary amount of computation to determine the
material actually returned.

After perusing this thread a bit, I think Gavin's right that we need to
distinguish this from just query syntax, but for the sake of the client not the
server.  If we consider the Xptr as a query, then we always need to go back to
the server.  If we consider it as an address, then a client can use a cached
document to resolve it.  It could also be construed as an implicit agreement
with the server that whatever comes back has a fairly stable existence.

Also, as current servers don't support this, there's no reason we can't be
ahead of the curve on suggesting a new syntax.
