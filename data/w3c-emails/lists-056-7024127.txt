It seems to me the essential question is, if I have separate URLs for each
chapter, then they can refer to each other, but if I have one URL for the book,
and retrieve each chapter as a query, then any cross references require
returning to the server, because each cross reference is a query.  So we want a
syntax that says "give me piece X of document Y".  This way, if I have two
pieces of the same document at the client, the client can resolve cross
references.  Current practice, as I understand, would require downloading the
entire book and using # for cross references.

It's not enough to build a navigator window, but at least you can start
displaying an index of which parts of the document have been retrieved.
