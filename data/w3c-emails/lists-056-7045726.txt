From Tim:

We have catalogs, and we know the we will have URNs, so we have two
mechanisms, one implemented thanks to Norbert, who also did delegate (and
it didn't take him more than a few days to do, either).

So I assumed that the problem is that we haven't decided what mechanism XML
should _require_.

Otherwise the argument seems to be more hole than fabric...

And since a required mechanism is harmful, I feel like I have to start from
the beginning again, and return to the _resolution mechanism independent_
requirement, which is critical.

   Otherwise, I confess that I can't make out what the objection is. Not
that I agree with the objection that I perceive, but at least I thought
that I knew what it was.
