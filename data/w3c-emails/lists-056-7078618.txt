The notion that a URN was simply a kind of URL took a long time to kill,
but it died because it's fundamentally not true. the URN prefix can be
treated as a protocol by a parser, but it is semantically distinct and does
not receive the same kind of processing.

That would be required, but it's not reminding, it's a meaningful distinction.

I think that it is a useful pragmatic way to address the resolution
problems that are ineveitable, and enable additional semantics-based
caching for smarter clients.

We've had this discussion off-list a couple of times now. People will use
URL backups for PUBLIC IDs properly -- not because they are virtuous, but
because if they don't, their documents won't work. That's the way people
learn how URLs work too.
