To anyone who thinks you can't have grand functionality without a big spec, I
highly recommend looking at the R4RS Scheme standard, which is only 50
languages and teaches you the whole language.  You might also consider the
Algol '60 standard (16 pages, I'm told).

On the other hand, you can consider Common Lisp, at 900+ pages, with,
ultimately, no greater power.  But it includes everything and the kitchen sink.

Scheme is all over the place, embedded in lots of different systems and taught
to thousands of students as a first programming language.  And schemers
regularly go beserk when people start trying to add anything to the language.

So maybe the XML is to Scheme as SGML is to Common Lisp is a good analogy.
