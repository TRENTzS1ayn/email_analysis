I think I was rather intemperate in my recent messages. Declaring an
intention to ignore the standard and being rude are both inappropriate, and
did both. As I was reconsidering my mail over lunch, Eudora was faithfully
delivering it. No offence intended to Lee -- It's just that I think PUBLIC
is _very_ important and got carried away.
