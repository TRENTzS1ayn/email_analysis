Obviously.

Yes, you can alpha rename everything.  This is _not_ a no brainer.

Exactly what I said in the paragraph you cut.

Yes, this can obviously be done.  But the client has no way to know that
http://server/documentY/, http://server/documentY/partX and
http://server/documentY/partY have any relationship because it's only "might."
In most of the web they don't.  I don't think renaming is so easy once you
start thinking through examples, i.e., suppose subZ of partX can be separately
downloaded, and I get partY, which has a reference to
http://server/documentY/partX/subZ (because after all, I could ask for just
that), but then I request partX and a little later subZ.  With a little thought
it's pretty likely they are the same, but there is no guarantee.  I now have
two versions of subZ.  This is not good behavior.  I think it's worthwhile for
the client to know both subZs are more than coincidentally the same.
