So, as an author, you hve to decide which way you want to provide your
data, and whether having two URLs for the same data is a problem or not.
It's not the renaming that's not "not a no-brainer" it's whether you want
to support two access techniques for the same document (parts).

This cannot be done, in general. All we can do is _enable_ people to make
nice views available. As far as I can tell, 20% of the important pages on a
corporate site have at least 3 URLs. This is a problem if you make
unwarranted assumptions about the URL->document mapping. The only warranted
assumption about the meaning of a URL in vacuo is _no_ assumption. If we
choose to encourage a particular form of query URL that is a suggestion --
it can't be something that clients can count on.

It is unnecessary to suggest a server format for URLs that access XML
document parts, but harmless. It is harmful, if it encourages clients to
try to parse URLs for meaning.
