Actually I think it is important too.

I will post separately a summary of what I see the issues to be.  One of
the difficulties is that I think people are arguing for or against a set
of features or a syntax and assuming that the reasons and needs are
"obvious", but other people think their reasons are totally different.
The meaning of "resolution" seems to be a clear example.

Thanks again for your note.

Lee
