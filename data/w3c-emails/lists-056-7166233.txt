But maybe the *browser* wants to control the navigation. Maybe it wants to
build a table of contents by asking for all of the "head" elements. Maybe it
wants to build a list of figures by looking for all of the "caption in 
figure" elements. If it doesn't know the query language that the server
supports, and the server has not set up explicit URLs in its own query 
language, then the client must download everything and sort out what it needs 
and doesn't need.
