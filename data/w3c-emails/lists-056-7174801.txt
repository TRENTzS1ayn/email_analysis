I agree with this, though when I use the term "query", I really
want it to mean something that *may* point to *something*, where
"address" to me means something that always points to an object
(a list of nodes is also an object).

If I ask for record 36 in a database, I would call it
an address, but if I ask whether any records contain "foo"
I would call it a query.

As David points out, perhaps this is a religious/philosophical
issue...
