I am suggesting a system where the *client software* (guided by the user)
can choose what view of the data it needs and ask for only the sections it
is interested in, using sophisticated, SDQL-like queries. I am not convinced
that such a system is doable for XML, but I am surprised to hear that some
people seem to think that it is not even a long term goal.
