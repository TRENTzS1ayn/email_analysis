Agreed.  As long as the client is basically a display/formatting engine, it is
OK for the server to have total control on the name space, but once the client
starts having some intelligence, there need to be agreements, at some level,
between client and server on what's what.  The server obviously creates the
name space.  The client only requests the server live up to its commitments.
