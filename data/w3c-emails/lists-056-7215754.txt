Forgive me, but I have completely lost touch with what is being concretely
proposed, as the debate grows increasingly abstruse.  Concretely, the
ERB voted in favor of:

1. addressing resourcs on the web with URLs
2. addressing structures within XML docs using TEI xpointer subsets
3. using the RFC-standard '#' and '?' separators to package up #1
   and #2 in a locator in a standard way, when the document wants to
   specify the network process model
4. using a new syntax to bundle up #1 and #2 into a locator when the
   document doesn't want to specify the process model.

You folks (Lee, Gavin, Matthew, David, Paul) have been saying some very
reasonable-sounding things about all these issues; would it be possible
to crystallize them down into some concrete modifications to, or 
alternatives for, #1-#4 above? - Tim
