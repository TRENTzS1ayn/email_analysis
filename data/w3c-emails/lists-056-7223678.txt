(By the way, the thing that everyone is calling XML-CORE is actually
called xml-lang.)

It's interesting (glancing briefly forward as I try to catch up with
my mail) that subsequent discussion in this thread seems to have
focused on uses of lang+link without style and missed this assertion
that xml-lang is useless all by itself.  There will be *thousands* of
applications that use xml-lang alone for the exchange of structured
data between processes and among databases.  In fact, based purely on
the number of applications (i.e., running pieces of code), I wouldn't
be surprised if there were ultimately more XML applications that used
XML without links or styles than ones that did.  A lot of these
applications will be invisible to the user, but that doesn't mean that
they won't be there.
