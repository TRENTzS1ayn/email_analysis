Indeed?  I saw it as a micron symbol.  An excellent argument against
this character.  I know from experience that the circumflex, the pipe,
and the not sign are extremely unstable on IBM mainframes (trading
places as one switches terminals).  We have here existence proof that
such unstable systems are in use; a much safer character must be
chosen.
