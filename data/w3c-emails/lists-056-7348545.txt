Last Wednesday, I posted a simplified rewrite of the XML catalog proposal.

In private email, Jon asked where does the processor find the XML catalog?

In response to my answer, Jon suggested I post it to the WG, so here
is a slightly excerpted version of my answer.

I don't seem to see this as an issue that is necessarily tied to
either having PUBLIC in XML or to using a Catalog for PUBLIC ids.
So my answer is to say that's a separate question.

But, I gather from your question that you don't see it that way.
So my answer is to ask you another question:  how will the processor
find the style sheet?  If we can solve this problem, surely we can
figure out how to point to a catalog.

For example invent a PI such as James suggested for the stylesheet:

So why not something like:

<?XML-catalog type="sgml-open-catalog" href="foo.soc"?>

Note that the MIME type "sgml-open-catalog" is *already* registered,
and the XML catalog would be a valid subset.  Or, we could use a
subtype such as
type="sgml-open-catalog/xml-catalog"
or you could register
type="xml-catalog"
or whatever.
