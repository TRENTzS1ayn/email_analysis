In some contexts, (a), in others, (b).  Since once we've done (a),
public IDs are on the same footing as system IDs (i.e. we still have
the chance of network failure, etc.) it's mostly (a) that I think
needs consideration.  But others clearly have different views.

The class of URLs does include the class of local file names:  they
typically begin 'file:'.  URLs which don't begin with a URL-scheme
specifier (i.e. a URL like 'foo.xml' or 'mydocs/book/chapter2/foo.xml')
are relative URLs and inherit their scheme from the Base URL, which
can either be specified explicitly in markup languages that have it,
or inferred from the actual location at which the object containing
it was found.

So local files *can* be accommodated; without this, the decision to
restrict system IDs to URLs would never have passed.
