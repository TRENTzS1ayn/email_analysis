What history shows is that if the conformance levels aren't specified 
in the language specs, they are specified later by the developers of 
test suites and the sort of thing developed by the guys who do FIPS.
The question usually is, "do they have teeth?" which is what makes 
them useful in contracting.

If they aren't developed by this group, put the good ideas in your 
pocket and wait for a year or two of conflict to develop, then 
pull them out and start again.
