I'm slightly puzzled that you don't seem to see it that way. 
Finding a stylesheet is going to be pretty damn critical, and we
need to make sure it's a 100% robust mechanism.

Surely that's back to front? You must find the catalog first, then
you can point to everything else. Or does this imply that catalogs
are for references to DTDs and entity files only, and that refs to
other resources such as catalogs, are not going to be done this way?

Looks OK, but how soon is this going to gell?
