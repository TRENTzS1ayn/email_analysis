Q:Why is there no agreed-on mechanism?

  Because this is the first time large-scale SGML has been tried on
  the net in this manner, so no-one's done it before. 

Q:Why do we need PUBLIC identifiers?

  To identify in a conformant manner the declarations of our documents.

Q:Do we need PUBLIC as the sole identifier?

  No, on the contrary, URLs as SYSTEM identifiers will do nicely 
  for interoperability, as shewn.

Solvuntur objectiones:

You miss the point: we're not (_I_'m not) asking for pubids as the
sole identifier. A URL will do handsomely for interoperable Web
delivery -- the prime objective -- but I cannot use URLs to 
identify the formal name of my DTD. 

Ergo enforce SYSTEM but permit PUBLIC, QED. End of debate.
