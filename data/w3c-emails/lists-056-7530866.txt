Sam Hunting responds:

I agree. Technology advances. When there was no ISBN, the "specified
default mechanism" of title page and bibliography sufficed to locate the
work.

I agree. One can look for "that book with the whale on the cover" if one
likes. That has nothing to do with whether or not there is a *default*
mechanism.

No indeed -- the publisher who made a "hard coded" street address the
default mechanism for users to find the titles on his list wouldn't stay
in business long! Fortunately, the title page provides the means for
*others* (authors, copyeditors, bibliographers, librarians) to enable
users find the publisher's titles.

The title page/bibliography default mechanism for finding books is not
mandated for users. It is not mandated for publishers either -- except in
that they have found it makes good business sense. 

(Note please that I don't have a hidden technical agenda here of being
pro- or anti-catalog or PI or whatever: I just don't advocate misreading
history as a technique for making sound engineering decisions in
the present day.)

As far as "NOTHING CAN DO THAT" -- in principle, this is correct; when the
universe dies the heat death, PIs won't work. 

However, the title-page/bibliography default mechanism has been working
for some centuries -- the publishing industry, and certainly scholarship,
wouldn't work without it.  FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, it's been a
terrific success. So, from an engineering perspective, wouldn't it make
sense to ask what's right about it, and do that?

    The only thing I know about PIs is that they're deprecated ih SGML ;-)
