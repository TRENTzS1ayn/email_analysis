Terry, although I think PUBLIC is an unnecessary feature in XML,
bloating a language already much larger than it should have been,
even I don't buy this argument.

XML can be revised long before 50 years are up.

If it turns out that by some horrible mistake, PUBLIC is incorporated,
and later we want to use URNs, and then discover that (perhaps) you
can't put a URN in a PUBLIC Id because it uses characters not
allowed in a minimum public literal, or for whatever other reason,
we will have to change XML.

But if that was all, they could simply put the URLs in the documents,
using a CGI-script transformation if necessary.

And on the Web, if mechanisms change, why, you are _still_ the publisher,
and you can change your catalog, or replace it with a frobnitz, and
what's the problem?

So if nothing can do it, let's not worry about it.
The question then becomes, what's a good compromise.

As far as I am concerned, SYSTEM with URLs is a good compromise.
