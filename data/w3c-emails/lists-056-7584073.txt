[Peter Flynn:]

| Is it too much to propose that an identifier must be 
| 
| either          SYSTEM  "url"
| or              PUBLIC "fpi" "url"
| 
| and leave it to the much-vaunted "market forces" to resolve the issue?

It is if you feel, as I do, that in the case where a public identifier
is given, it always takes precedence over a URL.  If it's the other
way around (the URL takes precedence), and a URL is always required,
then the public id is just decoration; a special variety of comment,
if you will.
