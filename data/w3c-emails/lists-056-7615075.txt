In that case I've missed something fundamental, and I'd be glad to
know what it is. What I suggested above can interoperate perfectly
on the internet/web if the software can capture the url and use it. 
I don't see where using docs both on and off the web has any effect
provided you supply the url for web use. What's missing?
