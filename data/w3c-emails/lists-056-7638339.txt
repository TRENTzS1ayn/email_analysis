Unfortunately they're not quite the same text, although the Mormon text
is taken from the KJV. The editorial process changed some of the wording
and some of the punctuation. I don't want a ref to 3 Nephi 14:14 to
point me at Matt. 7:14 any more than I want the reverse. This quotation
just happens to be the same in both.

Something similar applies if you try to locate the quotation  

    "...his Laodamia / it comes..."
