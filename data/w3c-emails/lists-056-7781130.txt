The problem is that word if, which should be written IF EVER.

What is the difference betwee putting an URN in a SYSTEM identifier, or a
FPI in a PUBLIC identifier? Both need to be resolved by some resolution
mechanism. To me the only difference is that URNs must be resolved using
genralized web resources I can have no control over, whereas the XML method
being proposed allows me to control the resolution mechanism for my data
set. To me this is a big plus over URNs.
