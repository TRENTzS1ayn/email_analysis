If there is a local catalog, it seems to be wise to at leas recommend
using formal public identifers.
Local catalog can contain heavily used, slowly (or never) changing
material, in order to reduce network traffic. This ia a real benefit

On the other hand the appearance of a document may be determined by the
reader?s site thus being out of author?s control. But I think the
advantages are more.

I agree. In addition to that, catalogs can provide  many benefits in
terms of maintaining and managing documents. It could even be used as a
manifest file for archiving and copying, especially, if  SGML Reference
Types are used (WD-xml-link-97030 Section 5.3) for the entities being
integral part of a certain document.
