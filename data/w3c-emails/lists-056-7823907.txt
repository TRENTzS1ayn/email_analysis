This interpretation will make the resolution process robust. I hereby
propose, that interpretation also includes unfolding, so that the
matching process is performed case insensitively.

This interpretation should be performed to the publid identifiers as
well as to PublicID in the catalog file.

Obviously, Paul did not specifiy "formal Public Identifiers". That?s
very good. So the Public Identifier is only a significant text string.

If we do such an interpretation, one could think that the same approach
could be done using system identifiers. SP supports SYSTEM entries in
its catalogs. But I think it makes a lot of sense, to keep
public identifiers separate from system identifers.

If nested catalogs are not supported, I guess many implementors will add
other features following different approaches. Therefore I propose, that
the following features of SGML Open catalogs should be there:

OVERRIDE - making the document totally independant from occasionally 
exisiting system identifiers
CATALOG - allowing a very flexible file arrangement by nested catalogs
