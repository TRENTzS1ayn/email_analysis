Yes, and perhaps that is at the root of this.  We may be wanting 
to *do* something different.  I need a way to identify links 
independent of the system location, but that is just indirection 
and perhaps not what the public ID achieves.

Yes.  It is my point that we may be confusing the *name* by which 
something is registered for the *process* and the process is what 
is wanted.

A legal requirement is what a contract can cite and a process 
or agency can enforce.  That is what I mean by that.  If two 
parties agree that the string you cite is a formal name for 
authoritative registration, it is the contractual agreement 
that makes it so.  Otherwise, a string is a string is a string.

Nor would I, but that is their decision to make.  Others are trying 
to write requirements and they are customers who do have a say in 
what is wanted.  The vendors can choose to sell that to them or not, 
and they can choose to find a vendor who will.  That IS how the 
market works.  Again, Don't Fear The Reaper, even if it is currently 
dominant in the reaping business.
