By whatever mechanism decided on, this is precisely the reason my 
cusomters are trying to create their own mechanism to solve the 
problems of address management that Martin Bryan expressed clearly.

I think that is more problematic than the XML community specifying 
public identifiers.  The hassle is real.  I have to read Michael's 
proposal first.  I won't have anything to add, but I do think I 
should communicate *from the market* that the *market* wants a 
solution to the address management problem before it will consider 
XML.  No they aren't holding PDF and HTML to that same standard; 
that is a bad decision already made.  The market takes a very 
prideful stance towards its mistakes.  What they will do is kluge 
their own solution and those of you who sell to them will have 
to support it.  Not good.
