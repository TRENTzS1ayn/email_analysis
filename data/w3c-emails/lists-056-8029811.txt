Agreed.

Also, a common error seems to be omitting the double quotes round
an argument to a CATALOG entry; if entries had to be separated by
at least one of \n \r or \f, this requirement could be dropped, no?
Otherwise given
    STYLESHEET "Pretty little borders and teapots" TEAPOT
the TEAPOT is taken as starting a new entry, which is very confusing.
