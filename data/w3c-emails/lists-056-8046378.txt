I've certainly suggested this several times previously. I'd change the
wording of the description of PUBLIC (because I think PUBLIC has
significant properties
other than resolution. More on that in my next post.

But in short, yes, this would be fine for the time being.

I also don't object to suggesting or allowing the CATALOG approach. I think
it has the potential to become an embarassment, if it is a _required_
default behavior, and some mechanism makes the default behavior obsolete.
(I can see this happening multiple times in the multi-decade life of (at
least some) public indentifiers.
