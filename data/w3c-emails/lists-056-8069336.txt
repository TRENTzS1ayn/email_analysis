I can't speak for the other developers and implementors, but parsing CATALOGs
is not a major problem if the spec is clear.  (I've hacked a CATALOG parser
which managed nested catalogs and it seemed to work).  At least there aren't
any p*r*m*t*r *nt*t**s in them.  Record ends are just counted as whitespace.

So long as the quotes are balanced (which will have to be the case for XML
attribute values anyway) there is no problem parsing this, even if it's
broken over several lines (so long as whitespace is folded into single spaces
which we seem to be converging on.)

One problem with using record ends is that you soon start having to think
about continuation characters, etc.  Of course you can always put a character
in column 6 :-)
