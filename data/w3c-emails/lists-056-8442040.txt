Not true! Most HTML *files* are small. There are many massive documents on
the Web that are broken into non-intuitive, hard to use chunks because the
Web is massively optimized for small documents instead of for retrieving
small parts of large documents. *WE MUST NOT PERPETUATE THIS MISTAKE*.

Then you introduce many OTHER namespace problems like IDs, entities etc.

Please see:  http://www.textuality.com/sgml-erb/dd-1996-0001.html

These are our goals and I feel that it is too late to change them. XML would
be a very different language if SGML compatibility were not an important
goal.
