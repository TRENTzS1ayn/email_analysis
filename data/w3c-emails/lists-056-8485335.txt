If we make PIs hygenic, we needn't encourage people to avoid anything.
They can stick PIs in for every specific target, without stuffing up their 
document's portability, as they see fit.

An example use for formal PIs is documents-in-progress. Editor settings, 
revision control numbers, etc, are all things that should be accessable 
in the grove, even if they are only to be used by the editor application 
& not the browser.  At the moment, they get plonked with a wink in 
comments or in elements.
