XML *is* SGML.  The spec explicitly lists as one of the design goals:

  XML shall be compatible with SGML.

This has been a goal of the XML effort from the very beginning.  It is a
goal that has had an enormous impact on the design of XML and it is a goal
that has been achieved: all XML documents are conforming SGML documents (or
will be in a couple of months once the SGML TC passes).
