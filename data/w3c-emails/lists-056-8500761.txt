And HTML is not RTF; except very superficially.

Bert might have his way.  It depends on the ERB.  This is where 
we find out what good sense is left on the hill.

History can be made to say anything people have an incentive to 
believe.  Some say HTML was a good thing; then XML came along 
and some said it was a bad thing.  Truth is, it was just a 
weak thing forced onto a throne it could not manage.  Now,
