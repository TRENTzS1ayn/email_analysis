I agree that requiring PI users to declare the namespace for PIs is a
good thing, however. If we are going to allow its use we should allow
its *safe* use. I just don't see that we need to standardize them beyond
that.

But the "sticking in PIs for every specific target" is exactly what they
are using SGML to get away from. That's why PIs should be discouraged.

It don't believe that a lack of formalism is stopping editors from doing
all of that now. I think that there are two things stopping them: #1.
Superstition, brought on by people like me who teach (preach?) that PIs
should be seldom used. I think that the examples that you site are
reasonable, but only SGML gurus write SGML editors so they know a thing
or two about parsing arbitrary syntax and should be able to get past the
superstition without help. #2. I've been told that some tools choke on
PIs. That's just poor programming. The semantics of a PI you don't
understand are simple to deal with: ignore it.

I don't think that formalizing PIs will fix either problem. I'm not even
sure I WANT to fix the first problem. I think it is GOOD that non-gurus
are afraid of PIs. I'm not out and out hostile to the idea of making
them easier to parse and work with, but I don't think it is necessary.
