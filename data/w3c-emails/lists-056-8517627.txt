To those of you who very cooperatively shut up when I asked you to can
the discussion about name spaces: take those proposals and manifestoes
back off the shelf and get ready to have at it.  Please don't post
anything just yet, but be prepared to see this question explicitly
placed before you in the next couple of days along with a whole
constellation of new issues to discuss.

Jon
