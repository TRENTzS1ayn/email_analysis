Agreed 100%.

So: we should either require all elements to be exactly 256 bytes
long, or require start tags to have a LENGTH attribute that contains
the byte-offset to the next element :-)

No, the fact is that XML is designed around variable length elements,
arranged into a tree with a variable number of children at each
node. If large documents are to be processed in random-access mode,
with deterministic response time, they have to be indexed, or stored
in a different format than XML. I'm not making it any worse by
attaching extra information to each node.

What about the "/>" delimiter? What about the "encoding="? what about
the keep-all-whitespace rule? What about the absence of !doctype?
"Almost met" still means it failed.
