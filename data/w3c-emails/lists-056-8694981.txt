Bert,

I generally moderate this list very loosely to encourage the freest
possible exchange of ideas.  But all of the discussion is in the
interest of promoting the activity of this group, which is enabling
the transmission of SGML over the Web.  Among the things that will not
be tolerated on this list are a disagreement with or an inability to
understand the purpose of this effort.  Please confine your postings
to contributions in support of the goal of this activity.

Jon
