These are rarely practical due to difficulties in synchronization.

From another point of view, encapsulation was broken as soon as the first
piece of markup was inserted into the document. As soon as you put the
first piece of markup in a document, you impose a viewpoint on it thus
limiting the reusability of that chunk of text. The analogy with OO
programming holds true as this is one of the reasons that objects haven't
proven to be as reusable as was originally hoped.

In principle, I agree with you, but I take it a step farther: I don't
think there should be any markup in the text. Structures should only be
associated with text in the same way that we propose presentation is
associated. It just isn't practical at the moment, because of the
difficulty in keeping everything synchronized.
