I kept quiet on this, but have to confirm that I have been using <?JUMBO ...?>
PIs :-).  I find them quite useful, and would be sorry to see them go.
Essentially I have been using them as interim patches until stylesheets come
along, but also to develop prototype modes of behaviour.  This has similarities
to 
#if DEBUG
#endif
in C programs - i.e. they are very useful for development work but there are
probably better long-term solutions.  Since there are always going to be things
under development, this is at least one valuable role for PIs.

I would also strongly urge that there is a (Name="Value")* syntax because then
an application (*not* a parser) requires minimal coding.  (I asked about this 
a little while ago and took the silence to assume this was so well agreed it
didn't require comment :-)  For example, I'm working on 
<?JUMBO MODE="draconian"?>  (the default is worse :-)
