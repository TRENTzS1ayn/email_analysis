If you are talking about requiring arbitrary data at an arbitrary point
earlier in the document to affect a subsequent elements processing, then
I don't know of a data structure that allows me to write a database that
can handle that efficiently. If I've misunderstood your proposal, I
apologize. So yes, you ARE making the processing of that node
substantially slower.

Many tools have no problem with it.

How can the fact that XML has an extra inline syntax for declaring
character encodings break applications that already have their own
mechanisms for determining the encoding?

This is indeed an annoying difference between validating XML parsers and
non-validating ones, but NOT between validating XML parsers and SGML
parsers.

Valid XML documents must have a doctype.

Yes, for us to have met condition 1 fully would have required XML to
look identical to the input and output of common SGML tools. We have
achieved partial success. Partial success is still partial success. It
is not a call to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
