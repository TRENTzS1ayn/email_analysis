That's exactly the point. People can introduce PIs that work *across all
DTDs*. You'll notice that every XML DTD does not require a <?XML >
element.

A PI is an instruction to a *computer program*. An element is a
*description of content*. A comment is *text to be read by other human
beings about the encoding*. These should not be confused by computers or
people and so should have distinct syntaxes.

I know that there are some who think that it is acceptable to pretend
that instructions to computers are actually "comments" to other people.
Personally I think it is a gross hack. All languages should have "escape
mechanisms" like PIs so that these kinds of hacks are not necessary.

Not if you have a DTD that you must conform to.

So??? XML as a profile of SGML is mostly described out-of-band too. You
seem to come to the conclusion that the current mechanism is fine after
your thinking out loud. Do you then agree that this is a reasonable use
of processing instructions?
