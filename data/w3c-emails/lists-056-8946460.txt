For everyone's reading convenience, I've marked up Jean Paoli's 
submission "XML for Structured Data" and posted it (and the
accompanying W3C paper) at

   http://207.201.154.232/murray/specs/xml-sd.html
   
Any errors introduced into the text are my responsibility. Note that
the second document 'SD2 - Structured Attributes' was truncated, so it
is posted as received. I'll fix it when the corrected text is available.

Any errors, suggestions, etc. let me know offline.

Murray
