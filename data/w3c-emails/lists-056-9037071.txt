By using the words 'XML application' I meant to convey that the
examples I distributed could (minimally) be viewed straight-forwardly
as well-formed XML documents per the current XML-lang spec, with their
semantics as schema specification being left to a generic application.

I agree that a position in which compliant VALIDATING parsers have to
handle BOTH the existing XML-lang way of specifying what Jean called
schemas, i.e. with <!element ...> etc., and a new way of specification
along the lines I outlined, would be at best unpopular.
