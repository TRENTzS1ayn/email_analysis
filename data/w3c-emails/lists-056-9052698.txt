I tend to agree, but with 2 small exceptions:

* I think the idea of requiring them to start with some kind of a
domain/owner label is useful and not overly restrictive: it helps prevent
conflicts between different customizers (note "helps" -- not totally solves).

* I also think it could be useful to create a convention or rule for how to
put PIC in your PIs; just because otherwise everyone has to invent it all
over again (I actually think SGML should have allowed character references
or at least &gt; inside PIs, but it didn't).
