I don't think this at all radical.  In fact, we already have it!
Consider
<percy>
  <attribute>
    <name>Socks</name>
    <value>
<colour>red</colour>
<material>cotton<material>
    </value>
  </attribute>
  <content>
    whatever you want
  </content>
</percy>

Here, I have used an XML representation of an attribute.

There is no need to invent a new syntax that gives no additional flexibility.
