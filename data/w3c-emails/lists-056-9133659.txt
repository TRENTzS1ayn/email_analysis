Peter,

I spent some time last night marking up the documents for the reason you
state, also because I had trouble reading all the munged line wrappings.

A web version of Jean's documents is located at:

   http://207.201.154.232/murray/specs/xml-sd.html
   
Which also includes a link to the Lassila paper. Note that SD2 was truncated
in sending, so I include the text as available.
      
Murray
