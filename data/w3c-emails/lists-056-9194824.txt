I don't understand this. Why would adding more datatypes to the
ones currently in SGML not be an XML issue? Are you saying that
the added types should not be standardized or that it is not up
to a metalanguage to provide syntax for conveying structural 
conventions?

I think that there is a lot of value in providing additional
distinctions for data. I also think that the SQL basis for the
proposal has had enough industry exposure to make it viable
as a basis for standardization.

I would like to consider how to identify other type classes.
Perhaps we should also provide facilities for the object domain:
how to identify the validation method for this object.
