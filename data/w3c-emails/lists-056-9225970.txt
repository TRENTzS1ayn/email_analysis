8 months ago, I was one of the few who argued for empty end-tags. The ERB
decided otherwise. 

AIUI, the decision was cast as an exclusive choice, in the interest of
avoiding option alternatives. So, basically it was empty end-tags either
everywhere, period, or nowhere, period.

Parenthetically, back then an argument that seemed to carry some weight
was that relatively casual greppers (e.g. ad hoc perl scripts) would
benefit from GIs in endtags.

I can't imagine it would pose a problem. In fact, problems are likely to
come from unexpected GIs in endtags (a class of "error" in WF actually
created by the -lang spec!)

But I agree, the lack of posts on this proposal (even to heap scorn on
it:-)) is somewhat surprising.
