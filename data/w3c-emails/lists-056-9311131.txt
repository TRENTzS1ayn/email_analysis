The HTML Math working group has finished its report on Mathematical
Markup Language (MathML).  You can find it at

   http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-math/

The report includes a DTD.

An interest group is being formed to discuss this over the summer; I
will provide further details as they become available.
