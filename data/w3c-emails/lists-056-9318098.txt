Yes, and the fact that this is to be an option is possibly what

Right.  I represented a constituency that I personified in the
Desperate Perl Hacker, who is routinely given a job like, "We've just
been bought by FooTech, so change all occurrences of BarGraf to
FooGraf in every one of these 5,000 documents and republish them by
this afternoon, but not if BarGraf is in one of the 13,000 instances
we've embedded in part numbers, just in the 9,000 places where it
appears in a product name."  This is a ten-minute job for a few lines
of perl, but only if *all* product names begin with <product> and end
with </product> and *all* part numbers begin with <pn> and end with
</pn> (or whatever).  Otherwise you have to actually build a parser,
because the obvious simple pattern matches will trip over possible
substructures.

By the way, I assume that your use of the word "casual" was meant as a
technical description of the script and not a characterization of the
problem.  I can assure you that the problem is far from casual for the
person who is handed this kind of task.

There was never any question that this posed a problem for parser
writers.  It was the users that we were concerned about.

I am as certain as ever that the DPH is a very important constituency
with a very important problem.  We *must* not make it difficult to
solve this problem.  The one thing that might make me change my mind
about this would be the actual (not potential) universal availabiliy
of parsers for the trivial text grammar in every OS, Jade release,
emacs version, perl library, and so on.  If the DPH could rely on the
existence of a function built into every text-hacking tool that would
allow a pattern match to be applied to a given element without
worrying about its possible substructure, then we would have a
fundamentally different situation.

Several of us thought that this was quite a good point back when you
made it.  This is why I'm bothered by the proposal that the </> form
be optional.  If you could make the trivial parser ubiquitous and make
the appearance of the GI in the end tag unnecessary even for the DPH,
then the position that makes sense to me is the one in which *all* end
tags have the short form.

You should allow a day or so to pass before concluding that people on
a mail list have had a chance to respond to a posting.  I sometimes
feel about email the way that I do about speed reading courses; the
real need is to get people to slow down.  :-)
