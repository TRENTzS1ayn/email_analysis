Personally I would find this very useful - I had to invent a special 
ElementType (ARRAY) for CML, and having it built into XML would be attractive
re-use.  (I have two generic containers, XVAR and ARRAY, both of which have
content model (#PCDATA)).  It will be important to decide what the separators 
are in in this, and how to escape the separators if required (e.g. for
Strings).

Note that such a proposal would strengthen the case for addressing into
#PCDATA, which could certainly be done safely in this context.  Obviously
I would re-support such a proposal :-).
