We have just been given five fairly important proposals to consider.
What you don't know, but will find out in a couple of days when he
gets to his destination in France, is that Tim Bray is about to drop a
roughly equal number of questions related to xml-link into this group.
Given our objective of having fairly solid versions of xml-lang and
xml-link for 1.0 out by July 1, it seems fairly obvious that we are
going to have to make some decisions about what gets dealt with first.
We don't have to make the cut right now, but it would help if in the
course of discussing Jean's proposals you also indicated whether you
feel that the feature in question is one that needs to be addressed in
XML 1.0 or whether it falls into the class of things that can be added
later.
