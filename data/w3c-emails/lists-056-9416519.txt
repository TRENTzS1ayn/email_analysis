Some decisions for simplicity were probably not simplifying.

The use of the empty end tag is well established in IDE/AS 
and used a lot when entering manually and converting.  Without 
pretty print indentions, it does make reading a little harder, 
and for someone doing simple macros based on search and 
replace, empty end tags are less than idea.  However, since 
the specification does not mandate them, having that option 
is attractive and one less thing to change in existing code.
