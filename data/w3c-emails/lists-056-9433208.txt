I think the idea of namespace inheritance is a great idea, but I wish
you hadn't tied the example to your SD2-Structured Attributes proposal,
which I really dislike (New, incompatible syntax? What does it purport to do
that can't be done better with existing markup? Mystified...). This was
(and may still be) an issue for WAI/ICADD, and requires a completely
SGML compatible solution.

I don't claim to understand architectural forms in all their myriad
complexity, but I was under the impression that they would serve this
purpose. If that is true, then is this proposal in competition with AFs?
If so, a lot of thought has gone into architectural forms, unless I'm
misreading this and AFs are orthogonal to the need that SD5 professes to
handle. Is this possibly another case of the WWW not-invented-here syndrome?

If architectural forms cannot provide the necessary ties into an external
namespace for your needs, then perhaps a modification and simplification
of AFs would better suit everyone than starting over from scratch.

Rick's alternative also seems preferable: (as he states) clearer, less
confusing, and compatible with SGML (which at least until recently ;-)
was one of our stated goals).
