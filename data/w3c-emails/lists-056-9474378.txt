But an old category of SGML user.  You are now discovering some 
of the reasons for SGML features which were tossed away for the 
ease of the DPH.  This is the whole conundrum of XML.  You are 
considering applications for which sensible applications of 
SGML are perfect, but seem to be slightly misinformed or unwilling 
to consider the parent standard.  Smart designers look past the 
politics of standardization for the features they need and use
them.  Politicians, zealots, newbies and the *thought-impaired* use a 
standard simply because of its source.  XML cuts both ways but a 
lot of effort has been expended to make sure it is compatible 
with SGML.  Despite what you may have heard or believe, there 
are very good reasons for insisting on that.   

An SGML file can be made quite small and quite legal.  A well-formed 
XML file is still just an SGML file you did not validate.
The reverse may not be true; that is SGML's strength and XML's poverty.
