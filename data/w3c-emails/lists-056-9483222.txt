As I Understand It, it's an acronym:-)

Basically, I agree. But I'm prepared to be less than doctrinaire about
options per se. It actually boils down to the "simple and strong rules"
argument: options with byzantine ramifications are bad.

Yes.

Hey, I got assured the first time *I* had to do something like that:-)

In fact, that was the day I realized the general *lack* of "casual" SGML
utilities. Cf the Perl packages for HTML:-(

Which I believe I argued would most likely come to fruition the easier it
were to develop such tools/add-ons. Simple And Strong, yet again, this
time argued by negation: if the rules aren't S&S, we won't see these
useful thingies here there and everywhere. The DPH's problem carries a
very important lesson, IMHO, about language design.

Yup. Allowing both forms actually opens the door for OMITTAG to be
reconsidered also...
