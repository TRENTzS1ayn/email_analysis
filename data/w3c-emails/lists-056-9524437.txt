Not quite. That is, the parse is not impossible, it is merely ambiguous
under the usual interpretation of SGML rules sans DTD, e.g. in

   <foo>123<bar>456<baz>789</foo>

there are two places at which an omitted </bar> could be infered. However,
this can also be read as the lack of a sufficiently strong rule to begin
with. In fact, for an XML parser, the issue of where to put the </bar>
doesn't arise *until* the </foo> is encountered -- at which point a WF
violation is detected under the current specJ. But if </foo> were
interpreted as a Super Right Parenthesis forcing the close of all
"revealed" open subelements, then the implied normalization

  <foo>123<bar>456<baz>789</baz></bar></foo>

would be a disambiguation *by rule*, not to mention doing away with the
redundancy you mention via a *syntactic* reason for endtags to have GIs.

The real problem here, however, is not the syntactic (in)tractability of
such a super-right-paren rule, but the ramifications of OMITTAG as per
SGML.
