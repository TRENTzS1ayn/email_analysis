I understood that tag minimisation was to be of minimal importance
in the XML effort. From a Perl/Python hackers perspective I really
want to have both start and end-tags for each element! Without that,
many more XML processing apps will have to worry about formal parsing
of the XML source. This flies in the face of what I thought would
be true.

It fails the "grep test" and therefore I would prefer to see end tags
stay as they are.

BTW, I think "space saving" is a very dubious reason for revisiting
minimisation. I need a gig disk to install the latest C++ compilers
these days.

In 1984 I had a very nice Pascal programming environment on a *single*
360k floppy disk. The explosion is size is more to do with extra colours,
fonts and graphics than increases is programming power. The sheer
size of multimedia files floating around make fully normalized XML
from relational databases look positively spartan!
