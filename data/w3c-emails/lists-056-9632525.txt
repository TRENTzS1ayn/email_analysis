Irrespective of tolerance, the problem is not with a missing end
tag but with a misplaced one.

LISP programmers are very familiar with this issue -- without an
editor that does a kind of autoindenting not possible with XML,
LISP is incomprehensible and unmanageable.  We use the Scheme
lanaguage internally at SoftQuad, but without indenting it is far
worse than unindented C...

Andrew, I would suggest that you go and read the archives of this
mailing list, excelt that it's probably too much to cope with in a
single lifetime :-(

Jon: what has changed over the last 9 months or so that has made
this a valid topic to be reopened??
