We have a botch at the moment in that the hyperlink #HERE is ambiguous,
does it mean the linking element, or does it mean ID(HERE)?  We need to
fix the syntax to solve this.  Solutions I have thought of include:

(1) putting the whole xpointer in parentheses, unless it's just an ID value
    e.g. HREF="#(HERE), or 
(2) requiring that keywords such as HERE always be followed by a comma, 
    even if there's nothing after the comma,
    e.g. HREF="#HERE,"

Any other nice syntax tricks? - Tim
