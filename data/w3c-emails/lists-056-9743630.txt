A lot of people want to support addressing by char count, token
count, or regexp, within #PCDATA (or [danger, Will Robinson!] mixed)
content.

This is obviously a good idea for many applications.  It is also 
somewhat more difficult than you'd expect in the context of 
wide Unicode characters.  Opinions are solicited as to whether
this should be done for V1.0, and if so, which ones should be done,
and if so, what to do about the internationalization issues.


Cheers, Tim Bray
