  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Does this refer just to addressing (pseudo)elements or to the whole
question of whitespace handling?

As we've mentioned, a parsed document may have a different number of
pseudoelements after parsing according to whether validation is switched
on or off.  Therefore unless *that* problem is solved, I think the current
problem is insoluble.

Note that we can always identify mixed content even from WF documents.  
So is the question:
should we abandon CHILD(N) completely 
OR
should CHILD(N) be undefined if one or more elements are #PCDATA?

I would NOT like to abandon CHILD(N) for element content.  It's perfectly
reasonable to write:

<PARENT>
<DAUGHTER/>
<SON/>
<DAUGHTER/>
</PARENT>

and ask for CHILD(2).  It would be very difficult if we lose this.
