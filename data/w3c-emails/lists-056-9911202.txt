It should mean the n-th element (not element or pseudo-element).

Pseudo-elements don't seem to me to buy you anything.

Either we have sub-element addressing or we don't.

- If we do, then we can just count/search all the data character children or
descendants of an element: pseudo-elements aren't essential.

- If we don't have sub-element addressing, what's the use of being able to
address a pseudo-element if you can't address inside it?

Either way pseudo-elements add nothing but confusion and complexity.
