The new types of schema that are being proposed include a lot of
things that are not covered by DTDs.  Thus we have three choices:

 1. use XML syntax
 2. radically extend DTD syntax
 3. invent a new syntax

Of these, the first seems desirable, the second questionable, and
the third idiotic.

As with data typing and namespace issues, I think this new work belongs
not in XML-lang but in a new small volume in the lang/link/display
series.

This is not realistically achievable in the July 1 timeframe.  It's
hard and is going to require thorough exploration. -Tim
