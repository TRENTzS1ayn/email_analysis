I don't believe that calling it a separate resource helps. It is part of the
resource that contains the links. If its container, X, had an ID then it
would be a named part of a resource. (For Topic Navigation Maps we would
need to add an ID to extended linkss to allow us to address the contents.)

This is the wrong approach - the content is a clue to the fact that there
are sources of information related to a particular term/phrase

This is the correct approach. This should be done simply by
allowing/encouraging the naming of extended link elements.
