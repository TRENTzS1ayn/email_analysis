This is the problem with 'stealing' the reserved name indicator for the
separator between the URL and the fragment name:-) #HERE actually begins
with a reserved name indicator that clearly indicates it is not the same
thing as ID(HERE). Therefore a more correct solution would be to require
##HERE to differentiate the RNI variant from a plain fragment reference
#HERE variant.
