|HERE could be preceded by a character in the URLchar set other than a Letter or '_' (ie one that can't begin an ID).
|
|HREF="#$HERE" can't mean HREF="#ID($HERE)" for example.

Why not drop the word HERE. Or spell it with non-name characters
only e.g. "#". So HREF="##" means quite clearly something very different
from HREF="#foo".
