Right. Having short tags will complicate error detection and
recovery... it will add one more reason for requiring a DTD.

Right. You also run into a large number of I18N issues. I have no
objection to defining an application profile for types, but would
object to having it in the parser. Havin an application profile would
require the definition of some way of hooking a notation validator
into the processing stream.
