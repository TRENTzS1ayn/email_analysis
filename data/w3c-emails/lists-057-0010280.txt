Martin, thanks for your follow-up.

And just FYI: in the list of registered charset values[1],
"ISO_8859-6-E" and "ISO_8859-8-E" are only encodings which use
explicit directionality ("EBCDIC-JP-E" is not for bi-directional
data, I believe ;-).

Yes, sorry for confusion.

And for me, ISO-2022-JP-2 is also acceptable, if you need.
