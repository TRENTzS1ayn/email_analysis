Dear Editors,

Could You explain to me, what do You want to signify, when You said:

---------[start of cut]----------
"Characters include the Latin letter "A", the Cyrillic letter "I",  the
Chinese character meaning "water", etc."
---------[end of cut]----------

I would like to know, what words "Cyrillic letter 'I'" mean?

There are two letters in Russian that can match to this description: the

letter "I" or "Simple I"(outline is: "|/|") and the letter "Short I"(it
is a
letter "Simple I"("|/|") with small dash above it).

Which of these letters You mention in specification?

                                          Sincerely yours Aleksey.
