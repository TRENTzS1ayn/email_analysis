Hello, from Japan.

I'm poor at SGML, so I have a question about section 3.2.4.

| White space is not permitted between the markup declaration 
| open delimiter("<!") and the comment open delimiter ("--"),
| but is permitted between the comment close delimiter ("--")
| and the markup declaration close delimiter (">"). 

Does the "white space" in this sentence mean just white
space character ? 

Or can I write comments such like this ?

<!-- line break after comment close delimiter --
>

Some one please tell me.
