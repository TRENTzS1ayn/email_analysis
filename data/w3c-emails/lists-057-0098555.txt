Dear Translators,

Some time ago, Alexander Belopolsky asked about copyright issues
for translations. We have in the meantime checked this issue and
added the relevant information to our copyright FAQ at
   http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html
It reads:

===========
5.6 Can I translate one of your specifications into
another language?

Yes, provided that you comply with the following requirements and
inform the W3C of your plan to translate our content and inform us
of when you've completed and published the translation. Such
notice should be sent to w3c-translators@w3.org: 

    You prominently disclose in English and the language which it is
translated into: 

   1.the original URL, the status of the document, and its original
     copyright notice. 
   2.that the normative version of the specification is the English
     version found at the W3C site. 
   3.that the translated document may contain errors from the
     translation. 

    You agree 

   1.to the redistribution terms of the W3C document copyright
     notice.Consequently, your translation may be republished by
     the W3C or other entities if they comply with the notice's
     terms. 
   2.that the W3C may rescind the right to publish or distribute
     the derivative work if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion
     regarding the original documents status or integrity. 
===========

I hope this is clear and easy enough. If you have any questions,
please feel free to write to me, to any other W3C team member, or
to this list.

Happy translating,   Martin.
