It's completely OK.  Actually, you don't have to use &quot; (or &#34;)
unless it appears in an attribute value, something like:

   <IMG src="image.png" alt="First &quot;real&quot; example">

And even in an attribute value, you don't have to use &quot; if you
quote attribute value by single quotes, like:

   <IMG src="image.png" alt='First "real" example'>
