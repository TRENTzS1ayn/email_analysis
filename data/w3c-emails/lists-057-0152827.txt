 |Dear Sir,
 |
 |I am writing on behalf of a Japanese committee, namely INSTAC
 |MH/WG4/XML-SWG.  This committee is translating the XML
 |specification.  We hopes to publish it as a JIS technical report.
 |
 |INSTAC stands for "Information Technology Research and
 |Standardization Center".  The URL for INSTAC is:
 |http://www2.jsa.or.jp/INSTAC/english/index.html
 |
 |JIS stands for "Japanese Industrial Standards" and is similar to
 |ANSI.  The URL of JIS is:
 | http://www.jsa.or.jp/indexe.html
 |
 |JIS and INSTAC are under the auspices of MITI.  MITI stands for
 |"Ministry of International Trade and Industry".  It is a part of
 |the Japanese government.  The URL is:
 |http://www.miti.go.jp/index-e.html
 |
 |We have almost finished translating the XML PR.  Our plan is to
 |publish this translation and then revise it according to the final
 |recommendation.  This process is time-consuming, but we have to
 |develop the translation by March so as to get endorsement from
 |MITI.
 |
 |Both the translation of the XML PR and that of the XML
 |recommendation will be published through the Web.  We intend to
 |make paper copies of the translation of the XML PR and to charge
 |the cost for printing.  (I hope that this is not a problem.  If it
 |is, please let me know.)  We also would like to disclose the XML
 |source of both translations through the Web.
 |
 |In both version of the translation, we will prominently disclose
 |
 |>    1.the original URL, the status of the document, and its original
 |>      copyright notice. 
 |>    2.that the normative version of the specification is the English
 |>      version found at the W3C site. 
 |>    3.that the translated document may contain errors from the
 |>      translation. 
 |
 |in English and Japanease.  We also agree 
 |
 |>    1.to the redistribution terms of the W3C document copyright
 |>      notice.Consequently, your translation may be republished by
 |>      the W3C or other entities if they comply with the notice's
 |>      terms. 
 |>    2.that the W3C may rescind the right to publish or distribute
 |>      the derivative work if the W3C finds that it leads to confusion
 |>      regarding the original documents status or integrity. 
 |
 |INSTAC MH/WG4 (an upper working group of the XML-SWG) has already
 |endorsed the translation.  MITI will have a meeting for reviewing
 |the translated specification on 3/30.  If approved, the translated
 |specification becomes a JIS technical report.
 |
 |There will be three differences between the XML PR and the JIS
 |technical report.  First, the introduction is renamed "General
 |issues".  The JIS TR will have a new introduction, which states that
 |
 |>    1.the original URL, the status of the document, and its original
 |>      copyright notice. 
 |>    2.that the normative version of the specification is the English
 |>      version found at the W3C site. 
 |>    3.that the translated document may contain errors from the
 |>      translation. 
 |
 |
 |Second, there will be an annex for the Japanese XML profile.  This 
 |profile has only two pages.
 |
 |- The only impact of the Japanese profile is:
 | "If an XML document written in Japanese uses encoding methods
 |not mentioned in the Japanese profile, it does not 
 |conform to the Japanese profile."  In other words,
 |the Japanese profile is merely a further guideline
 |for XML documents in Japanese.
 |
 |- The first subsection is an introduction.  This profile 
 |only applies to Japanese XML documents.  Furtheremore, 
 |even Japanese XML documents do not have to conform to 
 |this profile.
 |
 |- The second subsection discourages the use of zenkaku-latin
 |characters and hankaku-katakana characters.  Since they are
 |compatibilty characters, this subsection merely restates what
 |the XMLrecommendation already says.
 |
 |- The third subsection says that Japanese XML documents stored
 |in files should be in "UTF-16", "ISO-10646-UCS-2", "UTF-8",
 |"ISO-2022-JP", "EUC-JP", or "Shift_JIS".  This subsection also
 |encourages code conversion programs for XML that rewrite 
 |encoding declarations.  
 |
 |- The forth subsection says that Japanese XML documents for
 |HTTP should be in "UTF-16", "ISO-10646-UCS-2", "UTF-8",
 |"ISO-2022-JP", or "EUC-JP".  It also says that the charset
 |parameter of text/xml MUST be correct.
 |
 |- The fifth subsection says that Japanese XML documents 
 |sent via MIME should be in text/xml; charset="ISO-2022-JP".
 |Martn Duerst pointed out that UTF-8 should be added.  
 |In our next meeting, we are likely to introduce 
 |(1) text/xml + UTF-8 + base64, and (2) application/xml + 
 |UTF-16 + base64 as well.
 |
 |
 |If you think that the Japanese profile should also become a W3C
 |technical note or something, please let me know.
 |
 |Third, there will be an explanatory note.  Why we publish this TR, how
 |we started the work, what was difficult, which remains unsolved, etc.
 |
 |
 |I would appreciate it very much it, if the W3C team considers our 
 |proposal and gives some advice.
 |
 |Looking forward to hearing from you.
 |
 |Sincerely,
 |
