Hi,

I saw that you may need translations from English to Spanish.

I would be happy to volunteer for them if needed.

I have no financial expectations from this, but I can't either promise any 
deadlines since this will be done in my spare time.

Anyway, I hope we can arrange something from which we can all benefit.

Kind Regards
Angel Quintana
