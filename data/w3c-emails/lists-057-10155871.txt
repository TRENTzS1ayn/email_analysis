To:w3c-translators@w3.org

I've translated the "XML in 10 points" to Indonesian language, and I have
posted it to http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml10poin.html

This translation is dedicated to all Indonesian XML community.

I also just started translating "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0
(Second Edition)" from http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006. I will
post it in the sama site, too.
