Dear sirs,

My name is Alekos Psimikakis, and I run a personal translations business
in Greece. My main translation pair is English->Greek. My fields of
specialization are SW & Internet/Web localization, IT, and Computers.
My secondary fields are: Marketing, Public relations, and Education. 

If you are interested in English-to-Greek translation, please confirm that
and send me more information as to what exactly has to be translated.

I don't know exactly what do you mean by "be sure to include the URI of
the specification you wish to translate and the language of the translation."
So, I suggest two fields: 1)HTML/XML and/or 2) localization. You can also
suggest something else if that is more important to you and as long as it is
within my specialized fields, mentioned above.


I can also do a checking/editing/proofreading work.


Kind regards,
Alekos Psimikakis
