Hi,

I've completed the translation of the CSS 1.0 spec to Dutch. The
translation can be found at
http://www.playgarden.com/w3c/TR/REC-CSS1/CSS1.html. For the Dutch
speaking/reading people: please check...

I suggest that the reference at the page
http://www.w3.org/Style/css1-updates/translations.html is updated. I
also suggest that a reference is added at the page
http://www.w3c.nl/Dutch/translations.shtml for the Dutch  Office.

Thanks

Andy Camps
