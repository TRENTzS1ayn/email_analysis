Hello again!

The translation of SVG
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/
into German is going on. Time seems to come back to me. ;-)

The URL for the translation in progress of the REC is:
http://www.schumacher-netz.de/TR/2001/SVG/

I?ve added a link to the stopped translation of the Proposed 
Recommendation that points to the new translation.
The old URL for the PR was:
http://www.schumacher-netz.de/TR/2001/SVG/PR/
This URL will be still available for anyone who follows the old URL.

Maybe You can change the links on the web pages, so that they 
point to the REC.

Thanks and greetings from sunny Germany!
Stefan
