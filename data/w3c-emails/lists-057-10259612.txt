Hello, I am Eiji Oga, Japanese.

I have translated the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
Model and Syntax Specification (W3C Recommendation 22 Feburary
1999). Can I publish my translation on our site as
"http://www.janit.com/xml/RDF/rdf-syntax.html".

I know there is already a translation of this document into
Japanese. But this translation is the worst (worstest) one.
More than 90 % of all sentences are mistranslated.

This is a sad situation for Japanese RDF users. So, I have
re-translated it into Japanese.

I wish you grant me the permission to publish my translation
on our site for Japanese RDF users.

Thank you.

Eiji Oga (oga@ma.nma.ne.jp)
