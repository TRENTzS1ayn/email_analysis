Hello translators, Martin,

The following docs are available in Russian now:
- XML Blueberry WD
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010620)
see http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010620
- XML Blueberry WD
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010921)
see http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010921)
- DTF Note (including DTF Submission and status)
(http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime-970915)
see http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/TR/NOTE-datetime-970915)
- DTF Note
(http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827)
see http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827
- WAI QuickTips (for these I have copied Daniel)
see http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/WAI/References/QuickTips/qt.ru.html
- The NEL Note (I have mailed Susan Malaika to report errata, +NEL
Submission and Staff Comment)
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-newline-20010314)
see http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/TR/2000/NOTE-newline-20010314

All translations are marked with a special line saying the document
may contain errata plus other necessary crap and linking to the
original version.

They are finished, but will be corrected if you send me your
comments/corrections:

1. In XML BB WD
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-blueberry-req-20010921) there's a
section for the references. Does anyone know what is [Cambridge, MA]? Does MA
stand for Massachusetts or Minnesota or what? Is it publishing house? What is it 4?
If anyone translated [Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Developers Press,
2000] will you help me?
2. I was not able to found Russian translations for the following
languages in the same document: Bopomofo script, Minnan Chinese and Yi.
Can anyone help with these? If someone knows where these languages are used or has
any information about them please let me know. If you know how to
pronounce these names your help will be appreciated.
3. I insist that WAI QuickTips are checked and double-checked before
publishing at the W3C (for e. g., one may want to delete the words in
brackets or change the title, 'cause I'm not satisfied with it).
Radik, Maria, will you please have a look at them?
Some terms are awful to translate...
4. The NEL note contains some errata. It says that THIS VERSION is
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-newline-200101314 while it is located
at http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-newline-20010314 (notice the wrong
date).
In the Supporting Documentation section the note mentions IETF RFC959
(FTP). It says that section 3.4 of the RFC is entitled as
'Transmission Notes'. In fact it is 'Transmission Modes'.
I have sent a letter to its author (Susan Malaika) but she returned nothing.
The inaccuracies were corrected in the translated version.
5. Don't know what are "UNIX System Services" and "MVS Open Edition"
(founded in the NEL Note), so I put them without any translation.

Happy translating,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.
