Hello,

How do people start translating the W3C documents? Is the normal way just
to just pick up the HTML source and start rewriting? I understand W3C uses
custom XML-based markup for implementing the documents. If the
translations were made using that very same markup, it would be trivial to
generate PDF and PS versions of the translations too.

However, nowadays I only see HTML (and perhaps zipped HTML) translations
of the specs. Is this the whole truth, or am I missing something? As far
as I can see, it would be most efficient if the XML sources for the TR's
were available, as well as the style sheets necessary to create the
HTML/FO/whatever conversions.


Best regards,

Jouni
