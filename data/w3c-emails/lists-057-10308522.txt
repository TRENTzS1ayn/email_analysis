Hello translators,
hello Martin,
hello W3C members!

A few days ago I got an inquiry to translate the XML Encryption 
Requirements into German for somebody in Austria for a seminar 
paper about Encryption.

Is there a translation already available or in progress?
If I get no response to this mail, I?ll start to translate the document

http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xml-encryption-req-20011018

within the next days.

Happy working,
Stefan

PS. SVG 1.0 translation is still in progress
