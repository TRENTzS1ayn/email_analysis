Hello,
my name is Jaume Nualart, I live n Barcelona (Europe). I'm interested to
translate to Catalan (my Language, more than 10 million speakers) a doc
from W3C.
The document is:
           Resource Description Framework
        (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification
         W3C Recommendation 22 February 1999

The URL of document is: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222.

Currently I'm working in the tranlation. I only want to know how is the
process to include the Catalan version in W3C.
Thanks

Jaume Nualart
