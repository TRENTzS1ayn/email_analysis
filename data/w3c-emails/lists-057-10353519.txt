Hello all,

One question and one piece of information:

Info.: I will hereby inform the translators group and 'w3C that we now have
started a project to translate documents regarding web accessibility to
norwegian. We immediatly start to work on the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0. This document is formerly translated to norwegian (nynorsk).
We have now started to upgrade this translation by hiring a translator to
produce a normative translation (normative "nynorsk" that is, not as a
normative W3C-spec). We also aim to serve this document from the responsible
authorities websites. This work is initiated by The Norwegian Language
Council and The Delta centre (working with accessibility in all aspects).
The final URI or completion date is not yet set.

In the near future we also aim to translate other related documents, as they
get beyond draft state, or as we get permission (Judy, I have the "how
people with disabilities use the web" document in mind here, amongst others.
I will contact you separately). This includes a commitment to translate the
WCAG as version 2.0 get recommended.

Any comments or advice or forget-not's to the translation work/translator is
welcome.


Question: (probably a well known question... I am new to this list and
haven't read the entire archive...) What editors are recommended to edit and
translate the WCAG source document? If possible we hope to avoid having to
clean up the HTML of a Frontpage or a Word document. But the editor must
also be usable; Notepad want do... Any tips? I tend to try/recommend Amaya.
Experiences?
