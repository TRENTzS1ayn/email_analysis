Hello Karen,

Many thanks for your notice. Please make sure that you tell us which
language(s) you are going to translate into. Also, you are talking about
translating 'excepts'. To ensure the integrity of our Recommendations,
we do in general not allow partial translations. We may be able to
allow it in your case, but we need more informations on the details
(what excepts, how they will be marked up and annotated,...).

Regards,   Martin.
