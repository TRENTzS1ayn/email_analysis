We plan to translate excepts from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml that we have
annotated in our upcoming COBOL manual. We have read and adhered to the
conditions under "5.8 Can I annotate one of your specifications?" and "5.6
Can I translate one of your specifications into another language?". This
serves to notify you of our plans.

We understand that we need to inform you when we've completed and published
the translation.
