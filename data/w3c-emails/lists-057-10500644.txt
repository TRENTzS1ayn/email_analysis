I recently cleared a whole bunch of stuff out from that page, moving it
to the history page, so it loads faster. The History page us still
linked.

Also linked is the SVG Implementations page (yes, I have a couple more
to add). If people see implementations obviouslty missing, please feel
free to let me know. Better to have five people tell me than none ...
