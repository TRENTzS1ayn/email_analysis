To:w3c-translators@w3.org

Soon after I finished and published "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0
(Second Edition)" translation to http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml-spec.html, I
translated "Namespaces in XML" from
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114. It's done now and can be
accessed at http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml-ns.html.

I hope that these translations can be linked from W3C translation pages, so
any Indonesian visitor can easily find the translations of these specs.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Junaidi Kurniawan
