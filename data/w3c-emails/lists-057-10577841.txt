Hi,
I am planning to have some pages for "accessibility" in
my home page.  First of all, I've translated WAI Quick Tips;
/WAI/References/QuickTips/ to Japanese.

The result is http://kobobau.com/tips/ac/quicktips/ja1.html

I know we already have a good Japanese translation, that was by
Mr. Masafumi Nakane.  Mine is easier to read, especially for
school children.  Today, many Japanese schools are going to
have their own home pages.  But "accessibility" is not yet
considered in many cases, because of a lack of good texts
written in Japanese.  That's why I did this.

regards,
