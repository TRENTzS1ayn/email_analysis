Dear All,


For study in SVG, I began to create Japanese translation of
the Scalable Vector Graphics 1.0 Recommendation(September 4 2001). 

There is a few chapter yet, and these translations have some differences
in wording style of Japanese from the translation by Mr.Watatani's team,
so I plan it to be a supplementary text of their work. 
Possibly, I may offer some translations to Mr.Watatani's team.
Next translation will be the chapter:3 or 6. 
# Hi, Wattani. It's me. Thank you for your advise.

my pages are:
