Hi,

I've started the translation of the XLink W3C Recommendation of 27 June
2001 to Dutch. The progress of the translation can be found at
http://www.playgarden.com/w3c/TR/xlink/xlink.html. For the Dutch
speaking/reading people: please check for errors...

Ruud, thanx for checking XML Base!

The work goes on. Help is appreciated!
Greetz,

Andy Camps
