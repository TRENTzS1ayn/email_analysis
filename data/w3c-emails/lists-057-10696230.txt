Hello translators, Martin,

I'm translating W3C Data Formats (RDF Architecture) Note and I have
some difficulties with it.

Id est:
1. Martin, can I "translate" the picture it contains?
2. If yes, what does "app." mean? An application?

Updates:
1. XML in 10points
(http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points) -
updated/retranslated.
I've discovered that another translation of X10P exist
at http://www.raleigh.ru/XML/2001/10points.php
2. W3C in 7 points (http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/Consortium/Points/) -
retranslated.
Comments are welcome.
3. MathML 2.0 has now its third translator - Grigoriy Statzenko
(grigorio@raleigh.ru).
4. Mr. Paraschenko from XMLHack.Ru sent me a link where Mr. Tkachenko
(one of XPath 1.0 translators) informs the fido-society that his
translation has moved to a new place at
http://www.xpath.info/docs/REC-xpath-19991116-ru.html . I've checked
his old location - it's dead.

New translations found on the Web (this may sound like a submission):
1. XML-in-10-points by Vasil Yaroshevich (yarosh@au.ru)
(http://www.raleigh.ru/XML/2001/10points.php).
2. Tim Berners-Lee's Style Guide for Online Hypertext
(http://www.citforum.ru/internet/style/index_a.shtml)

Happy translating,
Alexander.
