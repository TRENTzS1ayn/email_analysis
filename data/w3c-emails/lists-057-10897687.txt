Hello translators,

I've started the translation of XHTML Basic 1.0 into Russian.

A few questions to begin with:

1. Take a look at the following fragment:

      <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>

   becomes

      <acronym title="Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta">XHTML</acronym>

   Do I have to indicate the xml:lang of the latest acronym as "en"
   (The html xml:lang attribute is "ru")?
   Is it correct to translate the title without the acronym itself?

   Other examples include various acronyms and abbreviations like
   "W3C", "PDF", "Co.", "Inc.", "Ltd.", "DTD", "WAP", "WML", "SGML" etc.

2. Is there a way for me to get the right pronunciation for the names
   in the Acknowledgements and References sections?

3. I translate the first appearance of a person's name in the text,
   for example:

      Mark Beiker (Mark Baker), Deiv Reggitt (Dave Raggett) etc.

   Is it necessary that I indicate the language of a name like that

      Mark Beiker (<span xml:lang="en">Mark Baker</span>)

   This may result in additional difficulties...

4. Do I have the right to translate the comments in the Appendix B,
   i. e. SGML Open Catalog Entry for XHTML Basic, XHTML Basic Driver,
   and XHTML Basic Customizations? I mean the preformatted text.

I'm waiting forward to hearing from you!

Happy translating.
