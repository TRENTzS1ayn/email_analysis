I think you should use a similar solution here as you use for
names (3. below). For example

<acronym xml:lang='en' title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language"
 >XHTML</acronym> (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta)

or

XHTML (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta)

(and maybe add the text only the first time, but some WAI
experts may know better).

(Well, for my name, please use 'Martin Dyurst' for transliteration.)

Yes, I think this would be the right way to do it.

It is definitely more work. But I don't see anything
particularly difficult/complicated. Did I miss anything?

I think you can translate the comments. It should help the
readers understand what's going on. But I gess you should
add a remark at the start of each piece (catalog, driver,...)
saying that you translated the comments, and suggesting that
for production, the version in the original is used.
