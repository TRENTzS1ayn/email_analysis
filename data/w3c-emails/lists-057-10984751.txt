Hello translators,

First of all, may I ask you to help me to translate
"content model" and "content elements"?

>>I've started the translation of XHTML Basic 1.0 into Russian.
>>
>>A few questions to begin with:
>>
>>1. Take a look at the following fragment:
>>
>>       <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
>>
>>    becomes
>>
>>       <acronym title="Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta">XHTML</acronym>
>>
>>    Do I have to indicate the xml:lang of the latest acronym as "en"
>>    (The html xml:lang attribute is "ru")?
>>    Is it correct to translate the title without the acronym itself?
>>
>>    Other examples include various acronyms and abbreviations like
>>    "W3C", "PDF", "Co.", "Inc.", "Ltd.", "DTD", "WAP", "WML", "SGML" etc.

  Okay, I'm forward this piece to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org.
  
>>2. Is there a way for me to get the right pronunciation for the names

  Thank you, Martin. It wasn't difficult to figure out how to pronounce
  your name, but there are a lot of others.

>>3. I translate the first appearance of a person's name in the text,
>>   for example:
>>
>>       Mark Beiker (Mark Baker), Deiv Reggitt (Dave Raggett) etc.
>>
>>    Is it necessary that I indicate the language of a name like that
>>
>>       Mark Beiker (<span xml:lang="en">Mark Baker</span>)
> 
> Yes, I think this would be the right way to do it.
  I knew you would say that. In this case every appearance of
  XHTML Basic is to be enclosed in <span xml:lang="en"> too.

>>    This may result in additional difficulties...

  You did, Martin.
  I'm not afraid of having a lot to do. I'm afraid I won't find the
  languages the names are written in.
  Some examples: Takuya Asada, Tantek Celik, Herman Elenbaas,
  Ann Navarro, Markku Vartiainen and others.
  I can guess their names origin but that'd be only a guess.

  In general it would be a good idea (for those writing the specs) to
  indicate a name's language using <span> with xml:lang on it.

>>4. Do I have the right to translate the comments in the Appendix B,
>>    i. e. SGML Open Catalog Entry for XHTML Basic, XHTML Basic Driver,
>>    and XHTML Basic Customizations? I mean the preformatted text.
> 
> I think you can translate the comments. It should help the

  Do you mean content/sofware developing?
  
> the version in the original is used.
  Sounds logical. Thank you.

Happy translating.
