Hello Martin,
Hello Alexander,

just to swim against the tide. I never translate people?s names, not 
because I?m afraid of the work to find all languages for the 
xml:lang, but I think it is simply not necessary.

I haven?t met any English speaker who pronounced for example my name 
the right way. 

That is not a matter of phonetic transcription, that?s a matter of 
that he is not a native German speaker, but that is not really a 
matter. ;-)

I think it?s more important to recognize a name at once in other 
documents. To stay by your example:

If you see the name Deiv Reggitt in a translation and look into 
another document (news, Rec, whatever) where the name is in it?s 
original form, do you recognize it at once?

If you like to tell people, how to pronounce it, why not go the way:

<span xml:lang="en">Mark Baker</span> (pronounced: Mark Beiker) .

So that you ever give your reader the original name.


>   XHTML Basic is to be enclosed in <span xml:lang="en"> too.
Not necessarily.

>   indicate a name's language using <span> with xml:lang on it.
Agree.

Happy working,
Stefan
