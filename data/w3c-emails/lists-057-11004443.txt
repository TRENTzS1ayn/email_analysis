  Ordnung muss sein, Stefan.

  For this purpose the following is done by the respectable Russian
  newspapers: the first appearance of a name is translated into
  Russian following by the English form in parenthesis.

  A hypothetical article:

     <h1>Deiv Reggit vstrechaet'sa s Martinom Dyurstom</h1>

     <p>Segodnia v 14:00 po moskovskomu vremeni v kongress-tzentre
     gostinitsi Radisson-Slavyanskay vstrechalis' dva nebezizvestnih
     predstavitelya konsortziuma W3C: Deiv Reggit (<span
     xml:lang="en">Dave Raggett</span>) i Martin Dyurst (<span
     xml:lang="de">Martin Duerst</span>).</p>
     <p>Gospoda Reggit i Dyurst obsuzhdali problemi rasshireniya
     geografiyi W3C za schyot vostochnoy Evropi.</p>

  Note that the first appearance of "Deiv Reggitt" was not translated
  (because it's a heading) as well as the third one (because it's not
  the first appearance).
  If you use this style any reader who reads the article from the
  very beginning will notice the original form.

>> XHTML Basic is to be enclosed in <span xml:lang="en"> too.
> Not necessarily.
  Assuming you're right what is the purpose of xml:lang attribute?

Happy translating.
