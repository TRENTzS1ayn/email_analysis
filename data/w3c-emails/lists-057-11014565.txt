Tell me, where do you know this sentence from?
It?s the most popular sentence in Germany. ;-)

Ok, so if your newspapers do it this way, your readers are used to 
it. So it?s the right way for you.
(Personly I would prefer to always read the original name of somebody 
and see the pronounciation once.)
Our newpapers handle that a bit different.

In this case I wouldn?t use the xml:lang, because it?s quite obvious, 
that XHTML Basic is an english term. Why explain (with xml:lang) 
something, that is already known. 
But that?s a point we surely can argue about hours and hours, where 
to use it and where not.

In cases where you find similar terms in both languages, I would use 
it to explicitly distinguish between both terms.
Or like you use it to tell your reader the english spelling. And 
maybe in several other cases.

Happy weekend,
Stefan
