For those who don't know, it means 'Order must be', or
in a better translation, something like 'Things must be kept in order.'

Well, I disagree. Have you ever seen a Russian name in its
original? I think more or less the rule is, in most places:
- Names in the same script are kept as is (within the limits
   of available accents,...)
- Names in a different script are transliterated. In most cases,
   the original is not given at all, definitely not in German
   newspapers.
