Hello translators,

I refer to my former announcement of translating the P3P 1.0 Specification 
to german. I will finish this work now gladly noticing that P3P finally 
reached the status of a recommendation. I'll publish the URL when finished 
acording to the rules of w3c.

Kind Regards

Thomas Reulbach
