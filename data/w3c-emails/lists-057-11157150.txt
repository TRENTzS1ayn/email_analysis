Hello Alexander!
Hello translators!

In my opinion this attribute would only make sense in the 
translations, if the browser would show the user the given language 
information in some way. So that he could see, if there is a link to 
an already translated document or to the original. But the contents 
of the link/document should already say that. 

Question: You?re not allowed to change a link in the reference 
section to point to a translated document, aren?t you? You have to 
make a comment that is different in style below the original link (or 
something like that) to show, that it is a comment. So the user knows 
from the content what language he could expect, if he follows a link.

Does any browser recognize the hreflang attribute and if it does, 
what action does it take?  

Are there any search bots, that search for documents in a certain 
language and would take advantage of the attribute, so that it would 
be justified to use it?

Well, it?s bedtime! ;-)
Happy working,
Stefan
