Dear sir,
I am glad to announce that our working group have decided to start with
translating some of W3C documents to Russian. The first one is WAI WCAG 1.0.
For a web-master this document is very important. It contains a lot of
useful information that is often not used by web-authors (sad:). Another
point is that this document has never been translated to Russian in an
appropriate way. That's the point of our decision to translate WCAG 1.0
first.
As we only start translating, there are some questions we have.
1.      If there is a known translation of one of your documents (HTML 4.01
for example) and I find it very useful, but full of mistakes and
"unclearness", may I use this translation for further development? Exactly,
the question is in licensing: in GPL, for instance, there is an ability to
make certain changes to the source and distribute this changed source with a
copyright notice of an original author/editor left.
a.       So, can I make changes to a translation and ditribute it (or
publish on my own web-site) modifying copyright notice like this:
"Translated by Original Translator; revised and corrected by Revisor, 2002"?
b.      Does any W3C licensing statement deny this?
c.       Can translator deny this? (I guess not, but we need to be sure, of
course)
We look forward to your answers and any kind of additional explanations.
Best regards,

It all depends on your vision.
