Hello translators, Andrei, Kirill.

  I'm very glad to hear there are volunteers for translation into
  Russian.

  Kirill Vyatchin and me have recently started the translation of
  WCAG1 into Russian. Why don't you choose another document? A lot of
  imortant documents remain untranslated.

> That's the point of our decision to translate WCAG 1.0 first.
  As far as I know you don't have to state the reason to start a
  translation. Can you point to the spec you're going to take after
  WCAG?

  Partial rights for the translated text belong to the translator I suppose.

  May I answer, Martin?
  You shouldn't modify the document's copyright notice in any way.
  Instead, you may want to insert some comments/annotations into the
  text of translation clearly marking them as yours (i. e. using CSS).

> b. Does any W3C licensing statement deny this?
  Check out the W3C IPR FAQ at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html
  I found no information concerning your case there.

> c. Can translator deny this? (I guess not, but we need to be sure, of
> course)
  If I were the author of the translation I would prefer to correct
  the mistakes myself.

Best regards and happy translating.
