Hello translators, Alexander, Kirill,

1. Sorry, but I didn't see any messages about WCAG1 translation... Ok, so
you are already translating this document... We'll try to find another
document, but I am sure that we can translate WCAG1 together. This can be
made much faster and with lesser mistakes.

2. About the rights on a translated document. It is explicitly stated that
copyright holder is W3C and nothing is writen about translator's rights.
Although, I guess there may be a number of different translation's versions
of the same document, so, I think, translator should have copyright on his
translation version if it differs from other ones (or even if it does not).

3. Thanks for advise with copyright notice modification issue. Now I get it.

4. I know, that translator would prefer to correct mistakes by himself, but
the point is, that sometimes it is much easier to make a revision of a
document and republish it with "Revised by" comment. Of course, contacting
original translator is important, too.

Thank you in advance,
Best regards + happy traslating,

Andrei Sosnin

It all depends on your vision.

Hello translators, Andrei, Kirill.

   I'm very glad to hear there are volunteers for translation into
   Russian.

   Kirill Vyatchin and me have recently started the translation of
   WCAG1 into Russian. Why don't you choose another document? A lot of
   imortant documents remain untranslated.

 > That's the point of our decision to translate WCAG 1.0 first.
   As far as I know you don't have to state the reason to start a
   translation. Can you point to the spec you're going to take after
   WCAG?

Exactly,

   Partial rights for the translated text belong to the translator I suppose.

   May I answer, Martin?
   You shouldn't modify the document's copyright notice in any way.
   Instead, you may want to insert some comments/annotations into the
   text of translation clearly marking them as yours (i. e. using CSS).

 > b. Does any W3C licensing statement deny this?
   Check out the W3C IPR FAQ at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html
   I found no information concerning your case there.

 > c. Can translator deny this? (I guess not, but we need to be sure, of
 > course)
   If I were the author of the translation I would prefer to correct
   the mistakes myself.

Best regards and happy translating.
