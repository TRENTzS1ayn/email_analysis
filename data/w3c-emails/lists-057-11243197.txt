I think Alex wasn't proposing to do that. Only to add an attribute
to say that the reference is in English. And while it's very
desirable to keep the references to the originals, the text
of the reference may be translated, and a notice "(in English)"
or so may be added.

Using a different style is preferable, but in this specific case,
adding text such as "(Russian translation)" is necessary anyway,
and then it's pretty clear that this didn't come from the original.

I don't know about any such browser, but would like to know.

Interesting idea.
