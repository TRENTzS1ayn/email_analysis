Foreword: This message contains some detailed discussions of
special cases. But the main goal of this effort is to get many
good translations, and one of the best ways to get there is
to work together. Nothing said below forbids that!

Yes indeed. The copyright in a translation is jointly held by the
copyright holder of the original and the translator.

As part of giving the permission to translate, the W3C requires that
the translation is available under the same conditions as the original.
So e.g. everybody is allowed to print it out.

But the original W3C copyright also forbids changing of a W3C document
(except for translations). Extending that to the translation that would
mean that changing a translation (without the permission of the
translator) is not permitted. I'm not sure that's the only possible
interpretation, but it seems to be the most reasonable interpretation.

There is a very specific exception to this; if the W3C knows about
errors, and asks the translator to fix them, then the translator
*has to* fix them. So (at least in theory), it would be possible to
prepare a list of errors, submit it to the W3C, convince the W3C
that these are really errors, and then have the W3C request the
translator to fix the errors.

As Alex wrote above, annotating a W3C specification is permitted,
and therefore annotating a translation is permitted. Please see
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#annotate
for details. Also, translating a W3C spec is permitted, and therefore
translating a translation is permitted (under the conditions given at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#translate).
An example would be if somebody would take a Russian translation and
translate it into Belorussian.

Indeed there is no explicit information. I tried to give the
best interpretation that I could find above.

Happy translating, and happy collaboration.       Martin.
