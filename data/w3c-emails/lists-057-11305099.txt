Hello Martin,
hello W3C team,
hello translators,

in February Dierk Seeburg anounced the start of the translation of 
XML Information Set. I wrote to his address to find out, if he?s 
still working on it, but didn?t got a response within ten days. Maybe 
the mail address was wrong and he still reads this mailinglist.

If Dierk discontinued his work , I would translate the Infoset and 
make the translation publically available at the end of next week.

Specification to translate:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-infoset-20011024

Regards,
Stefan
