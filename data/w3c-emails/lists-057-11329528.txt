Dear translators,

I have started using language names in the language itself in
the second half of
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/#Language:

    Translations for these and other languages can also be found by
    specification. Other languages include Afrikaans, Arabic, Catalan,
    Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Greek, Galician, Hebrew, Hungarian,
    Indonesian, Interlingua, Korean, Norvegian, Portuguese, Romanian,
    Espanol (Spanish), and Swedish.

As you can see, so far I don't have many examples. Please send me
information or pointers (it may be easier to send a pointer to a
web page). Please send these directly to me or to the list. Also
please tell me if there are any languages missing from that list
(except for French, German, Italian, Netherlands, Japanese,
Chinese, and Russian, which are listed separately).

Regards,    Martin.
