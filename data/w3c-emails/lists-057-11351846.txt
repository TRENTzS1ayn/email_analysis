Hello translators, Martin, Stefan,

XHTML Basic in Russian is available at:
http://w3.hotbox.ru/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219
(including text-only, zip, and gzip'ed tar versions, missing
Postscript and PDF versions)

The list of terms/abbreviations/acronyms is located at:
http://w3.hotbox.ru/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219/glossary.html

The above-mentioned list is linked from the spec itself and included
into zip and gzip archives (I specified that it's not a part of the
spec).

The glossary also includes the acknowledgments section where you can
find out how many people were bothered by me. See:
http://w3.hotbox.ru/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219/glossary.html#acks

I used the following techniques to handle names and acronyms (already
discussed on the list): 1) The first appearance of every name is followed
by its original form in English; 2) The first appearance of important
abbrs/acronyms is followed by Russian explanation; 3) Every acronym
and abbreviation is inluded into the glossary.

Martin, could you check the disclosure about the only normative
version, etc.? Is it ok not to have it in the header but just after
the copyright notice?

Best wishes.
