This is very nice.

I think this last part is not done sufficiently clearly. The
page definitely should not have the W3C Recommendation logo
on the upper right corner. And the title should be reversed,

<h1>Glossary for the Russian Translation</h1>
<h2>for XHTML Basic</h2>

or so.

Having it after the copyright isn't the best solution, but it's
okay.

By the way, most of the Cyrillic letters at the top of the glossary
look like links but don't go anywhere. That may be confusing.


Regards,    Martin.
