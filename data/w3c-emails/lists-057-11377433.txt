Dear Mr. Katuragawa,

We herewith give you permission to translate the document requested,
under the following conditions:

- Instead of saying 'the normative version of this document is the
   English version at ...', say something like 'the original version ...'

- Say that the document is outdated and has been superseeded by
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-mt-20020429/ and
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-primer-20020426/

You might also want to think about translating these documents.
For the rest, please do as for translations of W3C specs.

Many thanks,     Martin.
