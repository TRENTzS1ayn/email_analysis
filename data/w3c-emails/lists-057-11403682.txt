Martin,

I think it could be good to have a uniform markup for translation 
pages to help in the future to take easily and automatically the 
information from these pages with an XSLT files.

We should identify the <span class=""></span> necessary to do it. :)

Title of the Spec.
Authors of translation
Language
Date of translation?
