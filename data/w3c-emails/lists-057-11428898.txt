Do you mean the upper left corner? That was my fault.
I've included 'style="background-image: none"' for the body element.
I'm not introducing a new stylesheet in order not to add extra files

I agree.

I removed the dead links, thanks for pointing this out. The zip and
gzip are updated.

Thanks again!
