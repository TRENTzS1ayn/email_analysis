Hi, I was browsng through the spanish translation of the HTML 4.01 
specification, and I noticed there are some terms that are used differently 
in Mexico and other parts of Latinamerica. I would like to volunteer as a 
Mexican Spanish translator for 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/html401>http://www.w3.org/TR<http://www.w3.org/TR/html 
401>/html401, I currently work as a freelance book translator for Pearson 
Education in Mexico. We follow a standard set of translated terms for 
uniformity, so I would like to contribute.

Regards,

Alfonso Romero
