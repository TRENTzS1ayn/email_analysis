Dear Sir,

we would like to help you with translations of your technical reports
into the Slovak language. In order to improve knowledge of HTML among
Slovak and Czech programmers, we would like to translate your HTML 4.01
Specification located at http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/. Would you be so
kind and inform us if we can do this job, or if such translation is in
progress, or even the specification has been already translated.

Yours faithfully


Ondrej Svacina
