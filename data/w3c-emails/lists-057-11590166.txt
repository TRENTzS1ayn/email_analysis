Hi all:

I am an experienced technical writer with more than 11 years experience as a technical writer and editor. 

My achievements as a contracted technical writer include writing API documentation and specifications for the Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGI) software release for Java developers, creating a C-language API programmer's guide for Sun Microsystems software development kit libraries, and creating XML developer documentation for Internet-enabled channel management solutions. 



I would be happy to contribute some of my time editing or re-writing specifications or other technical documents for your team. Please feel free to email me or call me on my mobile (+1 404 759 3917).



Feel free to pass my contact info along to your colleagues who may not be on this mailing list.



Kind regards,



Scott Meltzer
