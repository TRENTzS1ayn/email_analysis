A few days ago Jasper Levink started the translation of the CSS2 
standard to Dutch. I offered to help him on his translation. You can 
follow the progress at http://www.geocities.com/css2nl/cover.html

I'm starting at the end (the file text.html), he's starting at the 
beginning.

On completion the translation will probably move to w3c.nl or 
playgarden.com.

Greetz,
Andy Camps
