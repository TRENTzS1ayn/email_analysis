You got the wrong address. You should use
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html4-updates/translations for this page.
For translations at W3C in general, please start at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/.

What do you want to get permission for?

1) To reference the page?
2) To copy the page onto your site?
3) To use the information on that page, and to mention the
    translations listed on that page in your directory?

For 1), you don't need a permission. For 3), you don't need
a permission. I don't recommend 2), and I would have to check
whether we can give you permission to do that.

Please feel free to ask if something isn't clear.

Regards,   Martin.
