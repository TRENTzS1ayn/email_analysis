I am interested to translate HTML and XML documentation into Farsi and 
Turkish. Farsi in specific for the Afghanistan.

I want to make sure I do the right licensing and will be for free for world 
wide use.

However, I need someone to talk to me about which documents to start that 
will be most useful for places like Afghnistan.

Thanx everyone
