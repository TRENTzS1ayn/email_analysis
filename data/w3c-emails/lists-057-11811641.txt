Hello,

I would like to help translating your material to Hebrew. 

Few things I want to ask and mention:
1. I dont have any experience in translating (English is not my mother
tongue)
2. I have around 5-10 hours a week to donate for this task, is it enough? 
3. In what format would you like to get the translation? Since hebrew is a
semitic language, there are several ways to display it on a web page or a
document. 
4. Is someone going to do a sanity check for my translation?

I have extensive experience in HTML, CSS, DOM, HTML, XSL and XSLT and some
experience in SOAP, Web Services, SVG. Please let me know which of these
subjects you would like me to work on (i prefer of course to go on a subject
i have less knowledge so i'll be able to help and learn at the same
time...).

Also, i'll be happy to help in any other area.

Thank,
Shay Sharon.
