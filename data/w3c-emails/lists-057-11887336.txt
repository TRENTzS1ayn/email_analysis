Yes it will be for free. The concept is that a kid in a village in 
Afghanistan has to work for 100 years to afford an O'Reilly book on HTML 
.. so I decided to take the manuals from your site and translate say to 
Farsi and provide FOR FREE to them.

This is very key to the success of the project and we are hoping to finance 
the project by the good will of people interested to advance the causes of 
the education at the third world.

In exchange for allowing you to make a translation, we actually
require you to make the translation free for world wide use, in
the same way as the original.

You have mentioned HTML and XML, and both are a good start.
XML is much shorter.
