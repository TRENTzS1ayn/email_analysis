Oh one other thing ... the translations will faithdful to the original text 
word by word. I want these kids to learn exactly the same as the engineers 
in other parts of the world.

Any deviation from that could mean a serious educational loss 
.................

Again any ideas and encouragement is accepted specially in these depressing 
times

You have mentioned HTML and XML, and both are a good start.
XML is much shorter.
