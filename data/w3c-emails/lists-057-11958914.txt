Hello,

Is there anybody at this site who knows which documents need to be translated, the technical workpapers, the drafts, the recommendations...the specification documents (:-)or the notes ?) ...

I want a great funny topic, something new and not to translate any kind of old material which isn't usable at all,...  there is a whole lot of thus available.

Which one is to translate into: german, english, spanish?
Anybody who knows where the documents for translation are linked to ?

:-) Juliet
