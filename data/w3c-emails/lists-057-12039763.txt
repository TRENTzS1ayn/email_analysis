I would like to contribute with a galician (ISO 639 code 'gl')  translation
of the WAI Quick Tips.

Galicia (also Galiza) is an autonomous community situated
in the north west of Spain, right above Portugal in maps.

The URI of the (english) WAI Quick Tips:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/#QuickTips

I am reviewing and discussing the translation (not too much text). Please
let me know who should I contact when ready.

Best regards,

Santiago F. L x ez Ponte
