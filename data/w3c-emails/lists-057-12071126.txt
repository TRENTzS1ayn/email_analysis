To Whom it May Concern:
-----------------------

I would like to inform you that I am interested in translating the
Technical Report "XML Information Set" at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/
into German.

I have read and hereby agree to abide by the Document Copyright Notice
published at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html

As for my qualifications, I work as bilingual web content administrator
for Choice Hotels International and have broad expertise in
English-German translations as well as XML.

I eagerly await your response and thank you for your time,
