  My name is Elmar and I am a student of
Electrical&Electronics Engineering Department in
Osmangazi University, Turkey. While I was surfing in
your site, I noticed that you offer translations of
some documents. Reading what to do, I decided to
contact you and ask for translating those documents
into Azerbaijani language.
  Thanks in advance.
