To:<w3c-translators@w3.org>

I have decided to put some work in translating the CSS 2.0 specification into Danish. 
As I see that I'm not the only one doing that, I would like to get some feedback on which parts have been translated - as there is no point in translation already translated pages. :)

Regards,
Thomas Mouritsen
