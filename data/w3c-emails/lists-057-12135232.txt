Hello - This looks quite nice. To make it even better, the
'Aviso importante' should have a border and a different (e.g.
colored) background. Also, the W3C logo should come after the
'Aviso importante'.

You say that your translation has not been made public yet.
But this is a public mailing list, so sending it here makes
it public.

Regards,    Martin.
