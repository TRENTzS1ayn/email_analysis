Hi,

I've started to translate MathML 2.0 into Japanese as I'm in
spring vacation (I mean I'm in during academic years in Japan).
And it's partially available at http://www.washitake.com/MathML/ .

In this translation, I did:
  o Changed line heights to 150% from 100%.
  o Changed italic style to underlined (without italic).
because those styles are heavy to see with some Japanese
environments (including MS-Windows)

(I also want W3C to make localized CSS for Recommendations
 available, if possible.)

Any comments or ideas welcome.

Regards,
Norihisa Washitake <nori@washitake.com>
