Hi,

It's been some work, but the Translation of Modularisation of XHTML (W3C 
Recommendation 10 April 2001) to Dutch is finished.

In the document http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations.html the sentence "Dutch: 
translation in progress by Andy Camps." can be changed to "Dutch: translated by Andy 
Camps." The URL of the translation is the same: 
http://www.playgarden.com/w3c/TR/xhtml-modularization/Overview.html

Same goes for XML Base. The document at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/ (W3C 
Recommendation 27 June 2001) is translated to Dutch.
The listing of http://www.w3.org/2001/06/xmlbase-translations can be updated with 
the URL http://www.playgarden.com/w3c/TR/xmlbase/ as the Dutch translation.

Thanx,
Andy Camps
