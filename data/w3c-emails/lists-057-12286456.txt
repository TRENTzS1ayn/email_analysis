HELLO TRANSLATORS!
 
I?m glad to announce that Vietnam or I should write Vietnamese language is now entering the translation of W3C documents. 
 
We are trying to establish an ISOC Vietnam chapter and one issue is to translate some recommendations into Vietnamese. We would like to start with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/) and hopefully continue with HTML 4.01 and CSS2.

If anyone has any document of this kind already translated into Vietnamese please let me know! I have seen some names stating that they will translate some documents into Vietnamese (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html4-updates/translations) but there e-mail is out of date and I could not find any documents on the web.

 
Regards,

Joakim L?fkvist
