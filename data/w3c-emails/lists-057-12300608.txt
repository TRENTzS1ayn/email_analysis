Hi!

A long time ago I announced the start of a german translation project 
which was initiated by me as a joined venture between the german W3C 
office, a lot of translators and Addison-Wesley/Germany.


There were several problems, but finally we're getting results from our 
work. Currently the following RECs are being translated, some are 
already finished, some are in the phase of being checked by W3C or being 
spell-checked:

- XPath (translation was published
          by Oliver Becker some months ago)
- Namespaces, XML-Base (already published by Stefan Schumacher)
- XML Schema (translation finished;
               will be published soon)
- XML 1.0 2nd ed. (translated 1st edition published in 1998;
                    2nd ed finished & will follow soon)
- Associating Style Sheets w. XML (translation already published)
- XLink (translation almost finished;
               will be published soon)
- XSLT (translation finished;
               will be published soon)

- HTML (translation almost finished;
               will be published soon)
- CSS2 (translation almost finished;
               will be published soon)



All of the translations related to XML should be published by the end of 
May; HTML and CSS by the end of June. We're working to get it earlier 
done. As soon as something is published I will announce it on this list 
with all required information (translator names, URLs etc).



If everything works out fine, this shall be an ongoing project with more 
translations to follow.



For those attending the Cross-Media-Publishing workshop at the German 
W3C office in April: I will be there too; everybody who's interested in 
the translation project can meet me there.


Kind regards,

  Stefan
