Members of the W3C translators list

I am producing some demonstration/publicity material for W3C and would like
to include the phrase:

leading the web to its full potential...

in as many languages as possible.

I already have English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese
(Traditional and Modern),
Hebrew and Arabic.

Could you please send me tranlsations in as many other languages as possible
as xhtml files including the
charset used  (utf-8 encoding prefered if possible) direction etc.. stating
the language which you have translated into.

Many thanks
