Ikeja - Nigeria

Sir,

It is my great pleasure to writing you this letter on  behalf of my colleagues and myself. Your particulars  were given to me by a member of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (N.E.P.C) who has had extensive  dealings with members of trade organizations in so  many countries. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal  described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and  hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this business.
 
Within the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria where I work as  a Director, Project Implementation and with the  co-operation of four other top officials, we have in  our possession as overdue payment bills totaling  $29.5m which we want to transfer  abroad with assistance and co-operation of a foreign  company and/or individual to receive the said fund on  our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account  to receive such fund.

The amount represented some percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Corporation by a  foreign contracting firm, which we the officers over-invoiced. Though the actual contract cost have  been paid to the original contractor, leaving the  balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principle got approval to remit by Telegraphic  Transfer (TT) to any foreign bank account you will  provide.

Since the present Government of Nigeria is determined  to pay every foreign contractor, all debts owed as to  maintain good relationship with Foreign Governments  and Non-Government Financial Agencies; we have decided
to include our bills for approvals with the  co-operation of some officials from the Federal  Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of  Nigeria (CBN). We are seeking your assistance in  providing a good company's account or any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this  money by acting as our main partner and trustee or  acting as the original contractor. This we can do by swapping of accounts and changing of beneficiary and  other forms of documentation upon application for  claims to reflect the payment and approvals to be  secured on behalf of our company. This process is an  internal arrangement with the departments concerned.

I have the authority of my partners involved to  propose that, should you be willing to assist us in  this transaction, your share of the sum will be 20% of  the US$29.5 Million, 70% for us and 10% for taxation  and miscellaneous expenses.

The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat  it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your  area of specialization is not a hinderance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have  reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will  not disappoint me. 

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Engnr. Mike Moses
