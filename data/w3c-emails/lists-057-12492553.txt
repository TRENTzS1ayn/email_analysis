Hi!


I'm happy to announce the german translation of XLink. XLink was
translated by Daniel Hinz, Axel Wienberg (major parts) and Stefan
Mintert (minor parts) as part of the translation project, supported by
the German-Austrian W3C office.


The translation is available at
http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/2001/REC-xlink-20010627/ (and the latest
version at http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/xlink/). 


I'd appreciate very much if you would link to that address. Thanks in
advance!


Translations of XML 1.0 2nd ed and XSLT will soon be published and
announced.



Kind regards,

 Stefan Mintert
