Hi!

I'd like to announce the first chapters of the German translation of the
W3C-Recommendation Cascading Style Sheets, Level2, as a *Work in
Progress* Publication.

The final (and current) URL for the German translation is
http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512


The translation was done by Judith Muhr and edited by me (proof-reading,
corrections etc). The recommendation is already entirely translated.
More chapters will be published as soon as I finished my part of the
job.


Kind regards,

 Stefan Mintert
