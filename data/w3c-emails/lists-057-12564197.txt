Hi!

I plan to do some of this work. I've already written to Buza Zoltan who is
the maintainer of this work and get in contact with.

But I have a problem: how to start the thing. I'm looking for the master
format of the specification. If I am right from it can generate one the
indexes, and the common headers and foothers (e.g. link to next page,
previous page.)

Or the one can found at http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/ is the original
document?

Thanks for help

NMarci
