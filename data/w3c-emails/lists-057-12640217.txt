Hi all!

I'm happy to announce the availability of two more german translations
of W3C recommendations. As part of our german translations project,
supported by the German-Austrian W3C office, the following translations
have been published:

- XHTML 1.0, Second Edition, W3C Recommendation *1 August 2002*
  Translation: Judith Muhr, Stefan Mintert
  Available at 
  http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/2002/REC-xhtml1-20020801

- Modularization of XHTML, W3C Recommendation, 10 April 2001
  Translation: Stefan Mintert
  Available at
  http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410
  (this is 'Work in Progress'. Chapters 1 - 5 have been translated;
  just minor parts of the appendices are not yet finished;
  the URL is final; everybody is encouraged to link to that address)


Kind Regards,

 Stefan Mintert
