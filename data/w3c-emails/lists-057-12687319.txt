There is a page maintained by SIDAR at http://www.sidar.org/traduc/traduc.htm
in Spanish that tries to collect links to spanish translations of W3C work.

Although SIDAR is an accessibility organisation it is (naturally) interested
in many areas of W3C work - their list includes:

WCAG 1.0 (spanish and catalan) + WCAG core techniques (2000-11-06 draft) +
WCAG HTML techniques (someone is working on it) + WCAG 1.0 Techniques
(1999-05-05 version)

ATAG 1.0 draft (1999-10-26 working draft, RTF format)

HTML 4.01 (spanish and gallego)

XHTML 1.0 and Modularisation of XHTML

XML 1.0, XML in 10 points, Xpath 1.0

MathML

RDF Schema, RDF Model and Syntax

CSS2

XML schema part 0 (primer)

QuickTips (Spanish, Catalan, Gallego)

Should this be referred to, or should there be a page of spanish translation?

cheers
