Dear Mr Duerst,

the translation of the guidelines is finished. They will be uploaded tomorrow
on the URL http://www.ffzg.hr/infoz/dzs/smjer, according to W3C copyright regulations.


I have another question - The Croatian Academic Research Network (http://www.carnet.hr)
produces for students a non-commercial CD-ROM that is free of charge with educational
materials and useful software. This year they wanted to include the WAI Guidelines
in Croatian, as they have just been translated. PLease let us know if that would
be possible and how to handle this issue - is it the same as for URL version?


Thank you!

Sincerely,
