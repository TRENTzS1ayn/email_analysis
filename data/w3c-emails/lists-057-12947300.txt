Hi all,

Emmanuelle Guti?rrez y Restrepo mailto:emmanuelle@sidar.org has concluded
the "XML Accessibility Guidelines - W3C Working Draft 29 August 2001"
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlgl-20010829
translation into Spanish.

The translation is in:
http://www.sidar.org/traduc/w3c-xag-20010829/xages.htm

I know that it is a Working Draft but if there is a translation in to
Spanish, this will facilitate the participation in their development of
people that don't speak English. For that reason at the beginning of the
translation is a warning that says:

"Attention!: This document is a Working Draft, therefore it is subject to
changes. Their intention is to receive observations on the part of the
members of the W3C and of other interested parts. If you cannot send
observations in English to the address mentioned later on, send them to the
translator who will make them arrive, on your behalf, to the editors."

Best Regards,
Emmanuelle Guti?rrez y Restrepo
