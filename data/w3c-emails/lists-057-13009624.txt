METI (Ministry of Economical Trade and Industry, Japan) appreciates
the large prevalence (or expected prevalence) of your documents:
  - XHTML1.1:Module-based XHTML
  - SMIL Animation
  - Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 2.0)
  - XForms 1.0
  - XML Information Set
and instructed the committees in INSTAC/JSA to translate them into
Japanese Language and draft JIS/TRs (Technical Reports).

JIS/TR is almost similar to ISO/TR, and it means that Japan (Japanese
government) authorizes and approves the technical specification.

Responding to the METI requirements, I wish to start the works as soon
as possible, in cooperation with your staff, in particular, with a
support of Dr. Martin J. Duerst. Thank you.

Regards,
