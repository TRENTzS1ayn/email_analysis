hi!

i'm not quite sure if the translators-list is the right place to post
this, but since it is related to translations i'd like to let you know:


in our german translation project we have translations for most of the
specs of the xml-domain. to give the users a convienent access to our
translations i produced an index with terms of all of the
xml-translations in addition to the texts.

the basis are the xml-files of our translations (marked-up according the
trans-spec-dtd, a slightly modified version of spec-dtd 2.1). i wrote
xslt programs  (pure xslt 1.0) to extract, sort and render the indexed
terms. the result is an index of the xml-specs with links to the german
translations and to the original specs.

i use some information that is included in attribute values. in the html
view of the specs these attribute values are invisible. therefore not
all of the terms have been translated (that's a bug). nevertheless the
index is very useful.


even if you're not able to read german, you might be interested in the
result. you'll find it at our german translations site at
http://www.edition-w3c.de/gesamtindex.html


i'm working on it to extend the index to other translations (written in
html) as well. the target is an index of all of the w3c specs.

bye, stefan
