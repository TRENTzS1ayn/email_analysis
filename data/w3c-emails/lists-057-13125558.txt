I think Bjoern is right that this topic would best be discussed on
w3c-translators@w3.org. While there is some relationship to the
topics on www-international@w3.org, it's better to discuss the
topic on the list most suited to it. I have therefore cross-posted
to it; please put followups only on w3c-translators@w3.org.
For people on w3c-translators@w3.org, please have a look at
the previous postings in this thread starting at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/2002OctDec/0012.html.

Please don't give up! Everybody is busy, nobody is perfect in
answering all their email.

One of my long-term plans is to move translations from the current
mail-based notification system to a Web forms based system, which
would make it much easier to maintain the data and produce pages
by spec and by language. One of the preconditions of such a system,
namely to have a database of W3C Tech Reports, is in the works now,
so I might give it a try sometime. Such a system would clearly
improve the situation, but it's quite some work to set it up.
(if anybody wants to help, please tell me)

It definitely would be possible technically, but it would
mean that the publication policy of W3C (which Bjoern explained)
is changed quite a bit.

Also, please note that in HTTP, there is functionality (Vary
headers,...) that would allow this data to be sent separate
from the actual document. However, one would then need a browser
that picks up that information. Also, we would need to hack
the server, so that it sends the English version even when
asked for the German one. [now this paragraph is actually
a topic that's appropriate for www-international]

Regards,    Martin.
