Hello!

I'm happy to announce that the work on some new german translations will
begin soon.

We're about to start translating the following specs:

(1-1) Canonical XML, Version 1.0
       <http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315/>
(1-2) Exclusive XML Canonicalization, Version 1.0
       <http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/>
(1-3) XML-Signature Syntax and Processing
       <http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/>
(1-4) XML-Signature XPath Filter 2.0
       <http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xmldsig-filter2-20020718/>

(2-1) XML Encryption Syntax and Processing
       <http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/Drafts/xmlenc-core/>
(2-2) Decryption Transform for XML Signature
       <http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/Drafts/xmlenc-decrypt>


The translation of the RECs will begin early november. Furthermore we
will observe the other specs to start translating as soon as they become
RECs.

This is an effort within the german translation project, supported by
the german-austrian W3C office. I'm very happy to welcome two new
experts in our team:

Barbara Zengler (DaimlerChrysler research, Germany)
Christian Geuer-Pollmann (University Siegen, Germany)


Barbara, Christian and I will translate the specs. I will post URIs as
soon as there are first results available.


Kind regards,

  Stefan
