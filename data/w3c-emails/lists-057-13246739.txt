Hi,

I am translating the XPath 2.0 Working Draft into Japanese. It is not
connected to the internet yet, but I am going to hand out its printout to
visitors at a meeting next month so that they can easily know what the
XPath 2.0 will be. I will let you know again if I finish the translation
and publication to the internet.

Best regards,
Mikio Oba
