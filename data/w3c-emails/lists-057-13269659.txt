hi!
I'm a student,and now i'm studying the specification RDF 
schema(<http://mail.sina.com.cn/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?http://www.w3.org/TR/rd 
f-schema/>http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf<http://mail.sina.com.cn/cgi-bin/redirect. 
cgi?http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/>-schema/). I want to translate it into 
chinese,so that understanding of it should be relatively easier for those 
who know chinese.
I've read the Intellectual Rights FAQ page. However I'd like to know if I 
began this work ,what else should i do or be attention to? I mean ,is there 
any obligation?
Because I've never do such a job before , I want to know some details that 
i may not think of.
Thanks a lot!

yours,
Wang Li( x )
