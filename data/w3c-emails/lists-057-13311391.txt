Hi,

Just an announcement to make:

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 is translated in Finnish, see

http://www.intermin.fi/intermin/hankkeet/juhta/home.nsf/pages/06D2E977451D62 
FFC2256C1300392172?Opendocument

I personally had nothing to do with the work but looking at the
translations at

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS

it seems that the perhaps the translation has not been reported to W3C?
The translation is published under the Finnish Ministry of the Interior,
see

http://www.intermin.fi/en

The reason I'm telling this is that I work at the W3C Finnish Ofice and
I'm in a (slow) process of compiling W3C material in Finnish. Just thought
to report the WAI translation to you if not reported earlier.

Best regards,
