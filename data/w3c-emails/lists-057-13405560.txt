Hi,
my name's Francesco Iafulli and write to you this letter to ask information ...
or better still, one in particular: I would be interested the lines in the 
transcription
of the inherent material (pratically drawing up a manual in Italian 
language) drives of
the WAI and the WCAG 1.0 in paper format and I would like to know whether 
this has a cost
or a written assent of yours is sufficient (and in such case directly to 
require it)
I look forward to your reply
Yours faithfully. Francesco Iafulli
