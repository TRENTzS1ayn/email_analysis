Dear sirs
hereby i offer myself for translating the UAAG1.0 document in italian 
immediately and later if you find none else in German
Since you require it I add the permission you state in the documents , 
however i feel that it would be much simpler if you paid a nominal fee for 
the translations thus becoming proprietor to them .

Let me know if you accept the offer .
best regards and wishes for the new year
Claudio Cannella


Hereby I the undersigned Claudio Cannella grant for any legal purpose 
whatsoever  to the W3C the permit to publish , make copies and distribute

Claudio Cannella " and/or the local language equivalent and my email 
address at the end of it .
