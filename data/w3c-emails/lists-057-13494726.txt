I had a quick look at the URLs and must say this is very reassuring indeed.
I am involved with similar/connected mission and would very much like to
show my great appreciation to all those involved in helping the visual,
hearing, physical, cognitive, and neurological unable. Assistive technology
plays a tremendous role in communicating with Application Programming
Interface (API), conventional input/output/device API through user agent.

Most impressed.
