Dear Mike Dean, and others

This is Shuji Kamitsuna from Japan.

I am trying to translate "Web Ontology Language (OWL) Reference
Version 1.0 W3C Working Draft 12 November 2002" into Japanese.
It is almost done but I do not understand some sentences of the
document. I hope that someone will help me out.

There are three sentences I do not understand well.

#1 - Section "Instances" -- last sentence.

"The situation is different for datatype values, where XML Schema
Datatype identity is used."

I guess this sentence means...

"The situation is different in case of datatype values in which XML
Schema Datatype identity is used."

Do I get it right?

#2 - Section "Datatype values" -- second paragraph.

"As a nod to backward compatability, literals that occur outside this
sort of construction are interpreted as any of the XML Schema Datatype
values with this lexical representation."

I guess "compatibility" is misspelled as "compatability".
I do not get this sentence well, especially the part "As a nod to
backward compatibility."
Could you say it in other words, please?

Regards, Shuji.
