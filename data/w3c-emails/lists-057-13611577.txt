Hi,
Michele Diodati has completed the translations of HTML 4.01 into
Italian. The translation is available at
http://www.diodati.org/w3c/html401/cover.html. Please, add it to your
"Translations of the HTML 4 Specification" page (this is a new italian
translation, different from that realized by LiberLiber group).

Thank you,
Michele Diodati - Roma, Italy
