Greetings.

I have translated the latest version of "XML in 10 points" (2001-01-10) to
pt-BR and would like to publish it. As instructed in
      http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points-translations.htm8#e-mail
I addressed the author, Mr. Bert Bos, at bert@w3.org a month ago, but
received no response.

How am I expected to proceed?
