One more document has been translated and is now ready for public
reference.

The Portuguese Version of the above document is known as Esquema
XPointer xmlns() and hosted at
http://www.amtechs.com/w3c/xptr-xmlns20030325.html .

Other Portuguese versions are being gathered at
http://www.amtechs.com/w3c 

In this opportunity I'd like to refer that efforts are now being taken
into the translation of DOM Level 2 HTML into Portuguese.
