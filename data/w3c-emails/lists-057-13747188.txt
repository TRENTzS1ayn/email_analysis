First of all: thank you for your efforts.

I am not sure what the question is. Do you mean announcing the translation 
or storing the file? For the former, you simply send a mail to this list. 
If you have problems with the second, and you do not have a stable place to 
store the file, one possibility is to contact our Office in Hong Kong (I 
copy this mail to Yammie Yuen, who manages that office), I am sure she will 
be able to store the translation itself on the office's web site
