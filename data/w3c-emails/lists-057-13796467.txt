Dear all,

we have renewed the translation pages of W3C at 
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/. This is not only a facelifiting, 
but a change in the way we manage translations. Until now, the various 
lists of translations were kept up-to-date by hand. From now on, all data 
on translations are collected and stored on our site in RDF, which allows 
us to generate automatically various 'views' of the data, eg, lists of all 
French translations or of all the translations of XML1.0. Note, however, 
that at this moment only the translations of Recommendations, and of 
documents like WAI Quick Tips, W3C in 7 points, etc, are listed. 
Translations of various W3C notes and of candidate/proposed recommendations 
are not yet in the database, but will be added soon. As new translations 
come in (through the translator's mailing list) the RDF data is updated. 
(For the time being this is a manual update, we are working on a more 
automatic method of doing so.)

Some of you maintain your own list for, eg, all Russian translations of W3C 
documents, or of all available translations of a particular W3C document. 
You should consider using the new facilities to maintain those lists, 
instead of maintaining the list yourself. We offer various possibilities to 
do that:

- you can simply refer/redirect to a full XHTML page on either a language 
or a list of translation of a particular technology. Of course, you have 
then no control over the output format... ;-)
- you can invoke a script returning an XHTML fragment that you can include 
in your page (either on-the-fly through a server side include when 
applicable, through some regular automatic update of your own pages, etc)
- if you want to manage RDF directly, you can also invoke a script that 
would return the relevant RDF information (in an XML encoding) (B.t.w., the 
full RDF data is also public).

There is a more detailed description of the techniques used, as well as the 
right URI-s to invoke the various scripts or to get access to the RDF 
files, in:
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/Overview.html.

Comments, ideas, feedbacks, etc, are welcome

Ivan Herman & Martin Duerst
