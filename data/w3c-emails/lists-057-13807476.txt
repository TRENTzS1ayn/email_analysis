Subject: renewal of the W3C Translation pages


|
|
| Dear all,
|
| we have renewed the translation pages of W3C at
| http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/. This is not only a
facelifiting,
| but a change in the way we manage translations. Until now, the various
| lists of translations were kept up-to-date by hand. From now on, all data
| on translations are collected and stored on our site in RDF, which allows
| us to generate automatically various 'views' of the data, eg, lists of all
| French translations or of all the translations of XML1.0. Note, however,
| that at this moment only the translations of Recommendations, and of
| documents like WAI Quick Tips, W3C in 7 points, etc, are listed.
| Translations of various W3C notes and of candidate/proposed
recommendations
| are not yet in the database, but will be added soon. As new translations
| come in (through the translator's mailing list) the RDF data is updated.
| (For the time being this is a manual update, we are working on a more
| automatic method of doing so.)
|
| Some of you maintain your own list for, eg, all Russian translations of
W3C
| documents, or of all available translations of a particular W3C document.
| You should consider using the new facilities to maintain those lists,
| instead of maintaining the list yourself. We offer various possibilities
to
| do that:
|
| - you can simply refer/redirect to a full XHTML page on either a language
| or a list of translation of a particular technology. Of course, you have
| then no control over the output format... ;-)
| - you can invoke a script returning an XHTML fragment that you can include
| in your page (either on-the-fly through a server side include when
| applicable, through some regular automatic update of your own pages, etc)
| - if you want to manage RDF directly, you can also invoke a script that
| would return the relevant RDF information (in an XML encoding) (B.t.w.,
the
| full RDF data is also public).
|
| There is a more detailed description of the techniques used, as well as
the
| right URI-s to invoke the various scripts or to get access to the RDF
| files, in:
| http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/Overview.html.
|
| Comments, ideas, feedbacks, etc, are welcome
