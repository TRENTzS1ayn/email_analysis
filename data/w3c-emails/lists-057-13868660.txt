Since the language tags are hierarchical, a query on "pt" should
return those tagged as 'pt' or 'pt-BR' or 'pt-PT' or indeed
'pt-anything-anything-anything' whereas a query on 'pt-BR' (or pt-br
or any other case mixture) should return only Brazilian Portugese
documents.

Same for all languages of course.

But equally, if someone asks for 'zh' the they should get all chinese
documents. As you point out, for some languages they are less likely
to do that.

(There is no en-EN because EN is not a country code. I assume you
meant that en-US and en-GB and en are not distinguished).
