Marcello,

thanks for your comments.

As you noted yourself, the two Chinese versions are a different problem, 
due to the differences between simplified and traditional character sets. 
If we forget about that, Brazilian Portuguese is the only one which came 
up, simply because that was the only case where I found translations which 
explicitly flagged themselves as  Brazilian Portuguese as opposed to simply 
Portuguese. In other words, the fact that there is no special entry (yet?) 
for Canadian French is simply because, well, nobody claimed a translation 
to be Canadian French...

So it leaves us with the (until now) special case of Brazilian Portuguese. 
And I very well realize the problem you are hinting at, I was actually 
tempted to merge the various Portuguese versions. Although I finally chose 
not to, your solution of merging the two and possibly flagging them might 
be a better one. It will require some twisting of my code (ie, it will not 
be overnight), so in the meantime I will change the data of the documents 
below (for the sake of consistency). However, I would welcome more input 
from others on the list who might be (potentially) in a similar situation...
