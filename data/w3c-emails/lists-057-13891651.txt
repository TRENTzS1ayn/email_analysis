Hmm... that's an interesting idea... what sort of query did
you have in mind?

xml:lang support in RDF query is a hairball... I don't
think cwm[1] does it at all (let alone any sort of support
for hierarchy); I went around for weeks claiming[2]
that nobody does it, and then finally I got somebody to
say "we do". Sesame or something, I think.

I have no idea whether XML Query works as you expect.
I'd appreciate if you (or Martin or Liam or Michael
or Massimo or anybody else, for that matter) would check.
