DC> Hmm... that's an interesting idea...

No.... its not 'an interesting idea' ;-) its how language tags have
been defined ever since RFC 2070.
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2070.txt

However, reading on, it seems you misunderstood what I was discussing.

DC>  what sort of query did you have in mind?

Neither of the ones you list below....

I meant "query" in the sense of 'the part of the URI after the ?'
because the URIs just announced for translations use ? for that. In
other words, the query parts of URIs that were just announced in this
thread.

For example to get translations for just SVG, its
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=SVG

to get translations just in Finnish, its
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byLanguage?language=fi

So, looking at the language= part, I was just suggesting that it
should work in the way that language tags are defined to work, which
does not seem especially unusual or interesting, just the defined and
correct way.

It would seem highly desirable that RDF could use the same xml:lang
stuff that everyone else uses. But that was not the subject of my
suggestion or of this discussion.

DC> I have no idea whether XML Query works as you expect.

Ok I guess I should ask Paul Cotton or someone (but again, that wasn't
what I was talking about although it is of course what one would
expect).
