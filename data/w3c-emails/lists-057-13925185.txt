Just one small detail: RFC 3066 language codes are case insensitive.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt says:

 >>>>
All tags are to be treated as case insensitive; there exist
conventions for capitalization of some of them, but these should not
be taken to carry meaning.  For instance, [ISO 3166] recommends that
country codes are capitalized (MN Mongolia), while [ISO 639]
recommends that language codes are written in lower case (mn
Mongolian).

So no need to bother with this detail.
