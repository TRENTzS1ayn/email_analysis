The trick is restricting the check in xml:lang attribute to just the number
of characters present in the query. This way, a query to "pt" would return
any documents tagged with either "pt", "pt-BR", or "pt-anything". If you go
a step further and restrict the test to the minimum number of charaters of
either the query string and the testes string, then it would also return
"pt" documents when asked for "pt-PT", but not "pt-BR". I think this
behaviour is exactly what is expected from xml:lang.
This is easy to implement, just tweak the XPath expression in the query
using the string-length() and starts-with() functions.
