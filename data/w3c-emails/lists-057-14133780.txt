Hello!

Two new German translations are available:


The translation of the current XFrames Working Draft is available at
http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/2002/WD-xframes-20020806

Thanks to Michael Jendryschik for his work!

The second translation is HTML 4.01. I announced that one recently, but 
it seems, that my mail did not reach you for some reason. It's attached 
below.

Bye, Stefan
