Hi,

We have created a document to help people move their Web sites to Web 
Standards. We are looking for translators in different languages.

Italian and French are already started.

I'm looking for a Japanese version ASAP to promote the document in 
the Japanese Press. The translator will be cited and the document 
will be put online on W3C Web site.
