Thank you very much for your effort.  Your translation has been added to:

    http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html4-updates/translations#Italian

I'm _very_ sorry for this LONG delay.  For some strange reason I was
accidentally kicked off from the w3c-translators list some time in
March and I didn't realize your report.
