Hello all,

there is a work in progress available of SVG Mobile:
http://www.schumacher-netz.de/TR/2003/REC-SVGMobile-20030114-de.html

I'm out for vacation the next ten days, so if there is someone, who's 
interessted in having a look at it, just do.

Unfortunately I haven't had enough time, so it is just the first step 
of translation. Review and answers to some issues will follow after 
my vacation.

If there is a finished version, I will announce it here, so that the 
link of the translation is ready for public.

Happy working
StefanSTS
