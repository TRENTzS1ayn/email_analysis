Hello Karl,

| We have created a document to help people move their Web sites to Web 
| Standards. We are looking for translators in different languages.
| Italian and French are already started.
| I'm looking for a Japanese version ASAP to promote the document in 
| the Japanese Press. The translator will be cited and the document 
| will be put online on W3C Web site.
| Document:
| http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/03/web-kit

As I sent mail to the local team mailing list, I can volunteer to
contribute Japanese translation.
I think this work work will take several weeks.

Regards,
Nobu.
