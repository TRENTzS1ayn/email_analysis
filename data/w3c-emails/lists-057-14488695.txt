It may be a good idea to use WC3 (in Arabic lettering) ratter than WC3 (in
English lettering)!

The following lead to the original (English text): it may have been a good
idea to leave them in English, see:

You have also translated standards as criteria and anglicised: web master!

The link to the original document does not work.

The whole thing needs a bit of revising and ???flavouring??? so as it is not so
cumbersome.

I am in the middle of postdoctrate research and I can only be used to
scrutiniser rather to redo the whole translation! The translation as a whole
is literal and dose not have a distinct flavour here is an example:

The method we suggest (suggested) in this paper is suitable for any web
regardless of the size. This should suit your needs whether you a small
individual web or a very large commercial web.

The emphasis seems to shift from: talking about the designer to talking
directly to a web!

Hello Ahmed,

I am glad to make your acquaintance. I don't understand what do you mean.
There may some few mistakes to be corrected, but what else goes wrong?
