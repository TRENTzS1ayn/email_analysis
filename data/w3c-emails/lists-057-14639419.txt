Hello w3c, hello translators,

i'm happy to announce another translation as a result of our german
translations project, supported by the german-austrian w3c office.

as i announced earlier, we were working on the translation of css2,
which was available as 'work in progress' up to now. today i released
the final german css2 translation at
http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512

i'd like to thank judith muhr. she translated the specification on
behalf of addison wesley, germany. thanks to them as well for their
support. judith's work was reviewed and edited by myself.


everyone is encouraged to link to the new translation using the above
uri. 

i know that there is work on css2.1 going on. nevertheless, we decided
to finish our work on css2. it is planned to upgrade the translation as
soon as css2.1 has reached a stable status. 



furthermore i finished my work on xhtmlmod. it was already published,
but with a few remaining english paragraphs. now everything ist
translated. you'll find the translation at
http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410

and again, i'd like you to link to the translation! thanks!


all of the german translations of our project can be found at

kind regards,

 stefan
