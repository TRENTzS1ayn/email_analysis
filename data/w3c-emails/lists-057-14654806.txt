Hello. This is Shuji KAMITSUNA in Japan.
I work for the National Diet Library, Japan.

I am interested in Web ontology and want to translate W3C
document, "Requirements for a Web Ontology Language
W3C Working Draft 08 July 2002" into Japanese.

URL of the document is :
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webont-req-20020708/

Actually, I have already translated the document. It thus
can be published anytime. However, I translated it to learn
about ontology, so, I do not have rich knowledge on the
subject. I am pleased to have someone improve my
translation or point out the mistakes I made.
