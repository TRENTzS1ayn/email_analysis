Dear Mr Raggett and to whom it may concern in w3c;

I am the webmaster of "bewaad institute&#64;kasumigaseki"
(uri: http://bewaad.com/) and writing some tutorial articles concerning
HTML and CSS documents for beginners in the site in Japanese.

I found the articles, "Getting Started with HTML", "Advanced HTML"
and "Adding a touch of style" written by Mr Raggett while I was
searching helpful resources for writing such documents.

It can contribute towards Japanese novices who want to write
HTML documents that the documents above could be read in Japanese.
Consequently I would like to translate these documents into Japanese
under your permission (I have read your documents regarding copyright
for the w3c site, eg. "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620"
and "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/ipr-notice-20021231").

It is my great pleasure if my proposal to translate such documents
makes you happy. Please feel free to get in touch with me in case
this mail cannot discribe conditions sufficiently on the translation of
the documents.

Best regards,
