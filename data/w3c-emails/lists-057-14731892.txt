Dear Mr. Kamitsuna, others,

The W3C Copyright FAQ at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate
covers all Technical Reports and thus includes Working Drafts
such as http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webont-req-20020708/.
Permission to translate is therefore given implicitly
if you follow the instructions on the Copyright FAQ page.

Regards,    Martin.
