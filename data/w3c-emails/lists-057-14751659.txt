Dear Mr. Martin Duerst, and others.

Thank you for your quick reply.
Yes. I knew that I did not need permission because
I read the FAQ. However, I found a website, written
in Japanese, says that we need permission for
translating non-specification documents. I became
unsure of it, then.

I clearly understand the rule now.
Thank you very much!

I put the Japanese version of the draft on my website again.
