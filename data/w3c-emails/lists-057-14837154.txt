Dear Mr.Deborah L. McGuinness, Frank van Harmelen, and others

This is Shuji Kamitsuna from Japan.

I am trying to translate "Feature Synopsis for OWL Lite and OWL -
W3C Working Draft 29 July 2002" into Japanese.
It is almost done but I do not understand some sentences of the
document. I hope that someone will help me out.

There are three sentences I do not understand well.

#1 - Section 3.1

"OWL can be viewed as an extension of a restricted view of the
RDF language."

I guess this sentence means...

"It could be said that OWL is the language to extend the restricted
part of the RDF language".

Do I get it right?

#2 - Section 3.3, as for "TransitiveProperty"

"The same DAML+OIL side conditions hold that restrict transitive
properties (and their superproperties) from having an atmost1 or
an exactly1 restriction."

I guess this sentence means...

"The same DAML+OIL side conditions that restrict transitive
properties (and their superproperties) hold from having an
atmost1 or an exactly1 restriction."

That is...

"In the same condition, DAML+OIL may not allow transitive
properties (and their superproperties) to have an atmost1 or an
exactly1 restriction."

Do I get it right?


#4 - Section 3.3, as for "oneOf"

"From this a reasoner could deduce the maximum cardinality (7)
of any property that has daysOfTheWeek as its allValuesFrom
restriction."

I guess this sentence means...

"From this a reasoner could deduce the maximum cardinality of
any property that has daysOfTheWeek as its allValuesFrom
restriction is 7"

Do I get it right?

Regards, Shuji.
