Dear Shuji Kamitsuna,

I will answer your concrete questions below. I trust that you are also aware 
that the "Feature Synopsis" has been revised significantly since July'02?
It is now called "Overview", see http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/ for a 
pointer to the latest version, in particular
http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/webont/OWLOverview.htm )

Concerning your concrete questions:

Indeed, although using "a" as the particle would be somewhat better:

"It could be said that OWL is a language that extends a restricted
part of the RDF language".

Yes, this last formulation is exactly right.

Again exactly right.
