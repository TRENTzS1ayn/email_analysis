Dear Deborah McGuinness, Frank van Harmelen and others

This is Shuji Kamitsuna from Japan again.

I put the Japanese version of "Feature Synopsis" on my website.
The URL is: 
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ax2s-kmtn/internet/owl-features-20020729.html

If you are interested,  I also translated "Requirements" and the URL is: 
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ax2s-kmtn/internet/webont-req-20020708.html

Best regards
