Hi, All 

I have finally completed the translation of XPath (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath). 

The translation in simplified Chinese is available via:
http://www.opendl.com/openxml/w3/TR/xpath/xpath-gb.html

The translation in traditional Chinese is available via:
http://www.opendl.com/openxml/w3/TR/xpath/xpath-big5.html

Any comments and suggestions are more than welcome.

All the best,
Hong Chen
