I didn't think the code was actually (bodily) translatable, apart from the actual documentation and rules. we will hear Marin's comments in due course!

  Subject: re.: hotlinking W3C logo and stylesheets


  Is it permissible to hotlink W3C logo and stylesheets in translation files? 
  I mean to copy the original file,  translate the text only and leave the rest of the code as it is...

  Thanks,
