Hi, Gail

FYI, Chinese version of XPath and Namespaces in XML are available via 
    http://www.opendl.com/

As you know there is a page on Chinese translations at
    http://www.w3c.org.hk/TranslateDoc/

However, for some reasons not all Chinese translations are listed on that page. 

All the best,
Hong
