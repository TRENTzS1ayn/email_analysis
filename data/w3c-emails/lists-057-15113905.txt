Chen Hong:

Thnak you for translation name space to Chinese. I think the big5 version
(traditional Chinese) is needed, too. So I did it. I put it as attachment.

Hi, Gail

FYI, Chinese version of XPath and Namespaces in XML are available via
http://www.opendl.com/

As you know there is a page on Chinese translations at
http://www.w3c.org.hk/TranslateDoc/

However, for some reasons not all Chinese translations are listed on that
page.

All the best,
Hong
