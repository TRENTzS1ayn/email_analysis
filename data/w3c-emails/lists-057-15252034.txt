Hello Susanne,

Semantic Web is an often heard word in these days, maybe you are 
interessted in RDF? It's not the shortest and not the most recent 
recommendation, but some people would be pleased to have that one 
available in German.

As far as I can say, anything else would be fine, too. Just choose 
YOUR recommendation. 

Questions are welcome
Stefan
