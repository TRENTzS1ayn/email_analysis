To whom it may concern in W3C,

My name is Takahiro Mashiko.
Listed as a Japanese Translator (Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guideline 1.0) at
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byLanguage?language=ja


Now I manage a website including contents of websitecreating,
JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheet, etc.
I'm curious as to the accessibility.

So, I translated "Accessibility Features of CSS (W3C Note)"
into Japanese according to W3C's Document Copyright Notice,
and it has published on my website since July 4, 2003.

URI is
http://www.interq.or.jp/pink/taka1112/translation/css_access.html

I would appreciate your response.
