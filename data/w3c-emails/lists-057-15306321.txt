Carmine,

If I interpret your mail properly...

There are some documents of W3C translated to Italian, but not much and 
certainly not enough. The complete list is at:

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byLanguage?language=it

If you want to volounteer for further translations, that would be 
extremely welcome for W3C: we always need volounteers. Please look at:

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/

for further details. In your case, you might also want to contact Oreste 
Signore (see the cc list), the manager of our Office in Italy; he knows 
which documents would be particularly good to have in Italy.

If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact me

Ivan
