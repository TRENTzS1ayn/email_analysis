Dear friends and colleagues,

We are happy to announce that the Indonesian version of the Manual of the 
New Strategy Against Female Genital Mutilation can now be downloaded and 
printed from <http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/NO-FGM/>. As you might know, FGM 
had already existed among indigenous cultures in Indonesia, but it is now 
spreading increasingly among Muslims. Thanks to everyone who contributed to 
this new translation.

However, further translations of the manual into local, especially African, 
languages are urgently needed. Any contributions in this respect would be 
very helpful. Please forward this information and the URL to where it is 
needed.

Sincerely,

Arnold Groh
