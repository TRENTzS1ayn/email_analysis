Before it is made available on the net, a review is needed.
The review process may last two weeks.

it has been estimated according to my previous translation work of XML BASE, It took me one day to finish the translation of XML BASE, however, the review process lasted a whole week(7 times!).

The translation of  XML Infoset takes me two days. So maybe two weeks is needed.

Cheers,
Collin
