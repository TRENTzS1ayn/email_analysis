I've made translations for some specs in catalan language

You can make revisions here, I've made revisions with 5 people and all 
the documents and examples seems to be Ok.

    http://www.minid.net/utilidades/w3c/ Base URL for the translations.

    I've translated from english to catalan for some specs and for some 
others from castallian to catalan, where i found 10 or 20 errors in code 
examples, I've re-checked with the english versions and corrected them.

    Any question or suggestion, error submission to the mail located on 
the "Nota de Traducci?".

    It was a hard work 2 months translating and correcting markupts 
errors like <fonts> tags in the middle of the XHTML 1 specs.

    Specs could be printed with a special CSS for printing.

    W3C's Specs URls are pointed originally as the english versions.

    XML 1 (second edition) is on the way to be finished, also there's 
XML Base, XML 1.1, XHML 1.1, Module Based.

    We're translating all the specs in catalan language and I think at 
the end of this year we (our team) would have all the specs translated 
to catalan language, including working drafts.

Cheer,

Diego Mart?n Lafuente.
