I would like to contribute a galician (ISO 639 code 'GL') translation  of 
'XML in 10 points'  (http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points)



I have reviewed and discussed it (not too much text). The document 
attached is 'valid XHTML 1.0 Strict' according to validator.w3.org

I currently have no persistent place to publish it. I wonder if your 
policy allows to do so in  http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points.htm 
as I find many translations there.

Best regards and congratulatios for the renewal of the W3C translations 
section.

Santiago F. L?pez Ponte
