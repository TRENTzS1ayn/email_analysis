Hi, all

I have completed the Chinese translation of XLink. It's still an initial version and all the reviews should complete in a week.

Simplified Chinese:

Traditional Chinese:

You are more than welcome to have a look and send feedback.

BTW, I am still working on the translations for XPointer.
  
All the best,
Hong
