Dear Sir!

I've got the browser Amaya8.1 from w3c.org.

I did the translation of its Help files into Russian,
and that are available from 
http://pyramidin.narod.ru/amaya.htm

On my WIN98 rus, Amaya doesn't recognize mnemonics,
such as
&Aacute; &igrave;, and the HTML header encoding pt,
pt-br. In file "about_standard_multikey_support.html",
too. All characters are displayed as Russian symbols.

But IE5.5-rus and NetCaptor-eng do it normally.

Where's the problem?

Alex
