Dear Sirs!

We would like to inform you that we are planning to translate these
W3C Recommendations into Russian language:

3. SOAP Version 1.2 Part 2: Adjuncts (Errata) 24 June 2003, Jean-Jacques Moreau,
Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Martin Gudgin, Marc Hadley, Noah Mendelsohn.

If we will be lucky we would like to translate also and the

4. SOAP Version 1.2 Specification Assertions and Test Collection (Errata)
24 June 2003, Oisin Hurley, Anish Karmarkar, Jeff Mischkinsky, Mark Jones,
Lynne Thompson, Richard Martin, Hugo Haas,

but maybe a little bit later.

Planned deadlines are:

1. For 1 (see above) - 5 weeks from the beginning date (e.g. 02.09.03
if we will receive your permission);
2. For 2 (see above) - 4 weeks from the beginning date;
3. For 3 (see above) - 4 weeks from the beginning date.

Please tell us can we do it (traslation in target dates mentioned

Thank you!
