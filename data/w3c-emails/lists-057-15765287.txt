Hi, all

OpenDL LTD has launched "W3C Document Chinese Translation Project" recently. The project would like more people involving the W3C document translation and has the ambition to translate most W3C document into Chinese, both simplified and traditional Chinese.

Current members of the project includes Collin (collin@seu.edu.cn), Hax (hax@sjtu.edu.cn) and me. Everyone is welcome to join the project. We also provide forums for discussions of translations and semantic web technologies (http://forum.opendl.com).

Please have a look at http://www.opendl.com for more details. Any comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

All the best,
Hong
