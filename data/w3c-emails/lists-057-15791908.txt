I would like to volunteer to translate the DOM Level 2 Core Recommendation,
 into Afrikaans. The specific document at: http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-
DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113. Many of the other Recommendations are already
translated into Nederlands, but the DOM Recommendations are not yet translated
into either Afrikaans or Nederlands.
 
Regards
 
Anton Malan
