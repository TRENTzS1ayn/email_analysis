Greetings translators,

As you may know, the W3C CSS validation service is fairly well 
localized, with an interface translated in several languages: German 
(de), French (fr), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl) and Chinese (zh-cn).

The good thing is that it's user-friendly. The bad thing is when you 
create a new interface and you don't speak (or, rather, write) all 
these languages... That's where I stand now.

It would thus help me greatly if people could translate the following 
pages (text, navigation bar text, form labels, ... see 
<http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2002/css-validator/> for how it is done now) 
into these languages.

<http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/08/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en>
<http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/08/css-validator/validator-text.html.en>

I can take care of french, unless someone beats me to it.

Thank you.
