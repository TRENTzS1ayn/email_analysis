These pages speak about "The XSL 1.0 Proposed Recommendation".
Note that the XSL 1.0 is a W3C Recommendation.

Olivier, could you check the pages with the style sheets turned off?
I've seen some small errors that could be eliminated before people
start to translate (e.g., sone inter-word spaces are missing, SVG
Tiny/Basic are lowercase etc.).

I can take care of Russian, unless... you know.

Regards,
Alex.
