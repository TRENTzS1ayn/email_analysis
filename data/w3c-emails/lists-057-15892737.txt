THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY
 

SEPTEMBER 20 - OCTOBER 12
Shows at 2 & 8 PM Saturdays
2 PM Sundays

 

THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY is a live, 2 ? hour re-enactment of the famous 1935 kidnapping trial of Bruno Hauptmann for the murder of Charles Lindbergh, Jr., staged in the original historic courtroom where the trial actually took place!  Critics have raved about this undiscovered gem, and you will too.

 

After twelve years and many thousands of enthralled audience members, THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY will present its last season before the courthouse is closed for renovations.  We're not sure when we'll back, so don't miss this opportunity to catch it before it's too late.  

Tickets $25 - Jury Seats $35
