Hi all,
 
There is a new translated document hosted at
http://www.amtechs.com/w3c/rec-xml-stylesheet/      
 
The document "Associating Style Sheets with XML documents - Version 1.0
"  has been translated to Brazilian Portuguese, sorry for the delay.
 
Other locally hosted Portuguese translations at
http://www.amtechs.com/w3c     being overhauled to link to the new
enhanced translation board. 
 
 
Regards,
Paulo
