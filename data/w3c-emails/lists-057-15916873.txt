Hi all,
 
One more document available at http://www.amtechs.com/w3c/math/ : the
translation to Portuguese of the document ?Putting mathematics on the
Web with MathML? 
 
As a side note, after having read Marcelo?s post, if a need arises to
host Portuguese translated documents, they can be hosted under the
directory www.amtechs.com/w3c .  Fortunately Marcelo?s issue has already
been addressed.
 
And? thanks for updating the board with all the translations.
 
 
 
Regards,
 
Paulo
