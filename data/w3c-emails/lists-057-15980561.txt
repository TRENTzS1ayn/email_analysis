Hi

I'm a translator and a member of another translation project which is
working fine. I want to begin another translation project at W3C but I need
some advice concerning where to get the original files: I just knew that the
original English files are in .XHTML format but I don't know anything about:
- the place to get them and
- where to download them after the translation is finished
- what are the preleminary recommendations before translating except that
concerning to subscribe to w3c-translators@w3c.org or course.

I would like to insist that is a serious offer from my part and you can get
testimonies of my works at the below links in my signature.

Regards
Hafid
