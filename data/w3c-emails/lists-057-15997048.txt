Marta, 
 
Thanks very much for your kind offer to translate our DIWG glossary. We would be delighted if you would provide such a translation for us..
 
From the fact that you have copied the w3c-translators mailing list, I suspect that you are already familiar with the information about volunteering for translations that W3C has at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/Overview.html#Volunteer
 
There is a significant amount of additional information related to translations on this and the related pages and mailing list.
 
Thanks again for your kind offer.
 
Very best wishes
 
Rhys Lewis

Dear Mr. Lewis, 

Hello. My name is Marta Isabel Trejo. I am an English-Spanish technical translator based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I would like to volunteer as a translator of W3C publications and to begin, I would be interested in translating the Glossary of Terms for Device Independence - W3C Working Draft 25 August 2003. 

I would greatly appreciate if you could please give me permission to translate above publication. If permission is given to me, I would use a Computer-Assisted Translation Tool to allow for updates. 

Thanks in advance for your valuable time. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon, 

Kind regards, 

Marta
