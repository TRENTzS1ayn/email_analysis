Good afternoon,

I recently visited your website and was wondering if you might have occasional 
need of assistance. 

I am a Japanese-English interpreter/translator based in Las Vegas, NV.

I am a court experienced interpreter with 30 years legal as well as technical 
translation experience.

Please advise to whom in your firm my credentials should be addressed, and if 
there is an online application form. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, 


James Wilson
