To Whom it May Concern,

The link to the Japanese translation of the Soap 1.1 protocol is not working
anymore.

Main page
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/Japanese

Broken link
http://www.jp.ibm.com/developerworks/link/soap.html
(routes to http://www.jp.ibm.com/)

The original page was announced by Satoshi Hada of IBM Japan 3 years ago.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-translators/2000AprJun/0050.html

We have noted this page which seems to have the appropriate content.
http://www.trl.ibm.com/projects/xml/SOAP1.1-j-ibm-revision2.html

Could it be linked to the main Japanese translation page for others to
reference?

Thank you very much in advance.

Sincerely,

Gen Kanai
