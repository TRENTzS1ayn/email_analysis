Dear Sirs,

We represent the Polish group of the Mozilla browser users [MozillaPL - 
http://www.mozillapl.org ]. Very often we struggle with Polish 
webmasters who create and develop sites that do not conform neither to 
the (X)HTML specifications, nor to the Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0 (which may be found at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505).

Unfortunately, quite a number of those sites are the Polish Government 
sites, which seems very embarassing to us. Therefore we would like to 
translate into Polish the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, to 
help Polish webmasters understand the idea of web documents' accessibility.

We start with WCAG 1.0 but we would also like to continue in the future 
with the checkpoints list [available at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html], "Techniques for WCAG 
1.0" [http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/] and "Accessibility Features of 
CSS" [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS-access].

We expect to finish the translation in the middle of October.

Yours faithfully,
Tadeusz Dudkowski
Stanis?aw Ma?olepszy
