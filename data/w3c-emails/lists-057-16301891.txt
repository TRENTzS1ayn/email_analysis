Hello

I would like to start translating W3C TR to Catalan (also spelled as
"Catal?" in your languages list).

I have a couple of questions too:

- Should I do anything else before starting?

- May I choose any Technical Recommendation I like (supposed it is not
being translated by anyone else)?

Thank you and regards
