Thank you very much.

I would ask you the following favour, to make the lists of all the 
translations more complete.

- Could you give me your name in original scripts, too? With non-latin 
scripts, we prefer to have the original there, too.

- Could you give me the word 'Telugu' in, well, 'Telugu', ie, in 
original scripts?

- Could you give me the following sentence in Telugu:

"Telugu translations of W3C documents".

To see what I would like to achieve, look at the following pages, 
recently submitted by your colleagues:

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byLanguage?language=mr for Marthi
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byLanguage?language=bn for Bengali

Sincerely,

Ivan Herman
