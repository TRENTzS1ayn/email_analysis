Narashimha,

thank you. However, there seem to be a (minor) problem. Neither the 
attached file nor the translation itself appears properly on my screen 
(I tried to different browsers, running Win2K). Looking at the source, 
the character encoding is set to iso-8859-1, which is obviously wrong. 
Interestingly, you did set utf-8 in the meta statement of the attached 
file, but it is still unreadable, I suspect the encoding went wrong 
somewhere (maybe it is safer to put this info somewhere on the web, 
rather than send it through an email...)

Can you set these?

Thank you again

Ivan

P.S. I want to particularly thank you for the attached information, it 
is clear that you spoke to your colleages...
