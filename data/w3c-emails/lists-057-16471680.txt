Hi *,


although just in coordination with the German W3C office -- I'll soon start
to translate the Ruby Module (see <http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/>) into German.
Are there any remarks and important things to notice (except the necessary
copyright and legal notice)?

I should be able to finish the translation within four to six weeks and will
publish the URL for the translation here, if this complies with the usual
procedure. By the way, who is responsible for the corresponding listing at
<http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=ruby>?


All the best,
 Jens Meiert.
