Hi,

I'd like to provide translation in Afrikaans for as many of the
specifications
as humanly possible, for example
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS or any others
Afrikaans is 1 if the 11 OFFICIAL Languages of South Africa and can serve
well to for those who speak:

Flemmish
Danish
Dutch

Please advise me on where to from here!


Regards,
Lloyd Africa
