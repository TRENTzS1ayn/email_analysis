I agree. There has to be something the list administrators can do about
the spam. I haven't even been able to delete one of the messages from
this weekend for some reason. If enough of us "complain" about the junk
to the senders, maybe we can flood their mailboxes and "discourage"
further messages. They usually provide a separate email address where
they receive legitimate replies which is different than the faked "From"
address.
