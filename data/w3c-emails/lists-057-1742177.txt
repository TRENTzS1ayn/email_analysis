Hello!

Recently I've send a question about the credit for a translation (in the
list archive it's the file .../1998JanMar/0027.html). Until now there's no
response. I'm sorry for urging you, however, could someone of the W3C staff 
please send a short note about the status of my question. We (Henning Behme 
and I) would really like to translate the three parts of XML (XML 1.0, 
Linking, and Style), but we'd like to know if we're credited for our work.

Thanks for any answer!



Bye,

  Stefan.
