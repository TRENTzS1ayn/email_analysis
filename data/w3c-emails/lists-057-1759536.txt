Dear Translators,

I am really sorry you are being bothered by spam messages.

The w3c-translators@w3.org list up to a few weeks ago was only open
to people subscribed to the list. However, the list serves as the
place for anouncements of translations, by people who are not necessarily
subscribed to the list. For this reason, we opened the list to general
access. However, this makes it vulnerable to spam, so we may have to
reconsider this decision.

If you have any suggestion or preference on this issue, please mail
me or Gerald Oskoboiny, <gerald@w3.org> or Dave Raggett <dsr@w3.org>.
Dave is currently the maintainer of this list.


Regards,   Martin.
