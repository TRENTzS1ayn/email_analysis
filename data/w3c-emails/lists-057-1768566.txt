Dear translators,

in our translation of HTML 4.0 into Italian we are experimenting some
difficulties about the following paragraph:

|line 418 - file: "links.html"
|
|type = content-type [CI]
|     When present, this attribute specifies the content type of a piece of
|content, for example, the result of dereferencing a
|     resource. Content types are defined in [MIMETYPES].

Can you explain in other words this sentence: "the result of dereferencing
a resource"? What does "dereferencing" mean?

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Michele Diodati - Liber Liber (http://www.liberliber.it)
