I have a question about the second sentence of the last paragraph in
section
 8.4.4.
-------------------------
For right-to-left flow, the horizontal distance between the left side of
a b
ox and the right side of the preceding box (or left side of the parent
box i
s no preceding box exists) is similarly determined by the source
element's '
margin' properties.
-------------------------
I wonder about the word " preceding".

I agree with Martin. I also no longer see the text in question
in the spec, so we may have cleared up the problem.
