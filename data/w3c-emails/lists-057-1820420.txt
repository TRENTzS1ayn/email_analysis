Dear translators,

I have a new question. Our team decided to integrate in our Italian
translation of HTML 4.0 the corrections listed at
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html40-updates/html40-errata.html, substituting
the original wrong sentences with the correct ones. What do you think about
this idea? Or do you think that it is better to translate the original
English document, including its mistakes without substituting nothing at
all? But does it have a sense to translate something of wrong knowing that
it is wrong?

Thank you in advance for your answer.

Ciao at all,
Michele Diodati
