In html40-errata.html, we have divided the errors into two groups:
very small errors (typos, editorial mistakes, etc.) and larger errors
that may cause confusion. 

I think that translators may correct small errors with no problems.

However, if they think they have encountered a larger error, they
should (1) tell the HTML editors (so we can add it to the errata
sheet (2) leave the error in the translated version, perhaps
with a translator's note.

The problem is that a translator might think something is an
error when in fact it may not be. 

Thank you for your hard work,

Ian
