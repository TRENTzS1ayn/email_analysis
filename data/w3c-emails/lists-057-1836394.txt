Thanks Martin and thanks to Joseph (who mailed me privately and pointed me
to the new IPR FAQ).


The FAQ now reads (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html):

--
5.6 Can I translate one of your specifications into another language?
[...]
This disclosure should be made in a header and/or footer that wraps the 
translated W3C specification.
--

The example file at 
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/translation-example.html
contains such a header with the name of the translators.


That is exactly what we want, thanks. One last question remaining:

May anyone who uses the translation _remove_ the wrapper, or is a translation
protected by the same copyright conditions as the original spec (i.e. is
removing the wrapper a violation of the copyright)?

(We prefer the second choice of course ;-)



Regards,

 Stefan.
