Your wrapped and translated version will be a derivitive work of the W3C
version. You will own the copyright on the "derivitive" work and can
preclude people from removing the wrapper. Furthermore, a condition of the
W3C to allow you to make a derivitive work is given in our policy, and from
the W3C point of view, we would rescind our grant to make a derivitive work
if you failed to make it clear that the wrapper must stay on.

(Keeping it on protects your efforts, as well as the integrity of the
document.)
