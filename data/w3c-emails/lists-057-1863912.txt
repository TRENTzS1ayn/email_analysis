Dear tranlation teams,

The translation of the HTML Specification represents an ideal
opportunity to *specify* how to mark-up HTML with the objetive of having
(aligned) *multilingual parallel texts*. Document marked in such a way
will be easy to compare to check the correctness of the translation,
harvesting terminology and other Language Engineering applications.

Interested parties please have a look to the relevant sections of the
lapsed Interned-Draft:
