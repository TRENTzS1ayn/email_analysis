Mr. Diodati,

Excellent question, however I've become involved with the translation
efforts mainly through policy and intellectual property concerns. Since this
is an editorial issue, I'm cc'ing w3c-translators@w3.org and the HTML 4.0
editors. My initial response would to do a literal translation, including
the errors. Another possibility, as you say is to, is to make note where you
made the corrections, perhaps using a different color text or some such
thing, but I am personally less comfortable with that.
