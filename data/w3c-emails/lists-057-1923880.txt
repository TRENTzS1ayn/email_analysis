Makes sense.

This is good for HTML, that it even has an errata sheet, but other specs may
not and I'd like to keep people constrained.

This seems reasonable, but I hesitate to even mention this in a sense, it
makes are  policy that more complicated in a sense. I think this may be one
of those instances where the official policy is, "please translate
literally" but "if you delete a 'the the' we aren't going to complain." In
the specific instance of HTML4.0, the "minor typographical errors" could be
something we accept.

Agreed. If the other editors of the HTML spec don't mind having the "minor
typographical errors" corrected in translations, I'll be happy to follow up
with Mr. Diodati. (Or you can even, please cc: me.)
