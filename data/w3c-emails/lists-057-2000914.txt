I completely agree to Samira point below.

But it is obvious that the translation of typographical error such as
"the the"
by "le" into French does not change the English specification. But for
the
semantic errors, it will.
I think that it is more a question of conformity to the English
specification
than a question of ethics. It is in fact a question of OBJECTIVE. Our
objective is to do translations of an English version as it was fixed
at a given moment.
