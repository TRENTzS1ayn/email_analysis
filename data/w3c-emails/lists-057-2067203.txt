OK.

My target was to transform the example

<p xml:lang="en-GB">What colour is it?</p>
<p xml:lang="en-US">What color is it?</p>

into an example which is understood by German readers. Since there are no 
subcodes for German dialects registered with IANA, I could only use a 
language code as the first subcode segment.

My Swiss German isn't very good ;-) and I just found this example...

So the following would be a better example?

<p xml:lang="de-DE">In welcher Stra&szlig;e wohnst du?</p>
<p xml:lang="de-CH">In welcher Strasse wohnst du?</p>


(To prevent problems with you're Japanese setup I wrote the sharp s as a
character reference &szlig;)


This example is a bit closer to the original "color"/"colour" example.

Sorry, I misunderstood this. And the translation example mentioned above
(http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/translation-example.html) has a
similar link:

----
This Japanese version translation is: 
       http://www.jis.org.jp/Pub/JIS_A_4002 
 and it can also be found at: 
       http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-PICSRules-980303j.html 
----

I will remove the link in our translation.



Thanks for your feedback, Martin!



Regards,

 Stefan.
