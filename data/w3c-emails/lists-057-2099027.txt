A few definitions:

"Parallel Texts 
    Texts that are translations of each other. For example, the
Treaty of Rome in English and Spanish are Parallel
    Texts. Parallel Texts could be aligned to several levels. 

Alignedness 
    It is a quality of Parallel Texts; for example, the Treaty
of Rome in English and Spanish are Parallel Texts and
    they should be aligned. The interesting part is aligning
Parallel Texts automatically. 

Level of Alignedness 
    This is a metric of alignedness. According to which depth it
is possible to identify the Linguistic Objects, the
    texts are aligned at: 
        Document level: the trivial case; i.e., Parallel Texts. 
        Paragraph level: not too hard to achieve. 
        Sentence level: desirable and possible to achieve. 
        Term level: it needs tagging for automatic alignedness. 
        Word level: it needs tagging for automatic alignedness. 

    In this context, sentence is a part of a text delimited by a
dot, semicolon or similar; i.e., it has little grammatical
    meaning and the main interest is to identify Linguistic
Objects."


Parallel texts without any marking are parallel text.  But
parallel texts with marking can be *easily* aligne (without the use of
more costly techiques such as linguistic, statistics, etc) and the
result is *certain* (i.e., this sentece is the translation of this one
because the marking around say so).

[Carrasco Benitez Manuel]  
Without specifications there would be many different marking
system (the same from a functional point of view).  With a
specification, there are more chances that the would be compatible
products, that the main stream browsers include aligning capacities,
etc.

From here, other Language Engineering technique could follow;
e.g, automatic harvesting of Linguistic Objetcs (terms, senteces, etc).

The bottom line is to reduce the cost of translation
(translation is very expensive) and to increase the quality.

[Carrasco Benitez Manuel]  
Execellent idea.  I could take a small section in two languages
(e.g., English and Spanish) and mark it up. Comments ?
