Hello Tomas,

Many thanks for your mail.

Thanks for copying these in. I remember them very well.

What is needed in addition to <DIV>, <SPAN>, and ID, in HTML?
If anything more, how should it look like?
What would prevent a small browser company from producing a browser
with alignement capacities? What's the reason nobody seems to do it?

That's very interesting. It could help search engines.

The problem is that in many cases, the original authors don't
know that the document will be translated (the EU in this respect
may be an exception). So the original authors don't think about
how to make translations easier.

I'm seeing this almost weekly now, with a very small example, the
W3C press releases. For the last few (XML REC, MathML PR, CSS2 PR),
they were translated here into Japanese, and they are served
language-negotiated, as it should be. The main problems are:
- That we don't get final enough versions early enough (is getting better)
- That there are too many "buzzwords", and they are extremely
  difficult to translate if you don't know all the technical content.
- Also, that "buzzwords" may be okay for the US press, but not for the
  Japanese press, for various reasons.
- That for the Japanese, different things may be of interest.

So e.g. in the case of XML, we just did a rewrite. The document is
parallel, but below that, not much of a chance for alignement.

Yes, please.
