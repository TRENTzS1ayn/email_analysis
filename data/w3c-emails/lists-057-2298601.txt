Hello Yule,

[I have reduced the cc to w3c-translators@w3.org.]

I also apologize for the problems at W3C. Can you tell me when you
wrote, and to whom (if possible in private)? This is the first time
I have seen a message from you on w3c-translators@w3.org, which is
the official mailing list for translations.

The working draft you mention has been replaced by the actual HTML
4.0 recommendation, and is not available anymore from the
http://www.w3.org/TR/ page. This may give problems. Have you
seen the HTML 4.0 Recommendation? Are you planning to update
your translation?

I have had a look at this site. As far as I understand, the
actual translation is at http://makesure.ml.org/html40/cover.html.
Is this correct?

I'm sure we can fix this problem very soon.
