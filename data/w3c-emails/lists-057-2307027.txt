I want to help translation of Html 4.0 spec. in Romanian. I talked with the
person who is already in list of translators for Romanian and she (is a
she!) is happy to helping her. But I want to be mentionated in that list of
translators (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html40-updates/translations.html).
How can be this done?

Best regards,
Cristian Ignat
