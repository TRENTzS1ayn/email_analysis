Hi everybody,
this message for advicing you that the Italian translation of HTML 4.0 was
completed and published on website http://www.energymedia.net/cougar and
that it will be also soon available on
http://www.liberliber.it/progetti/html40/index.htm.
I'll be very grateful to W3C for updating the translation list.
Thanks for your attention.
Best regards,
Daniele K. Gabriele
