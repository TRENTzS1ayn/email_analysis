According to the current W3C rules, translation is automatically permitted
once you send a notice to this list. [but the permission could be retracted
later in case we would find that something is wrong]

I have to make a slight correction here: W3C staff does not have time to
do any kind of quality check on translations. We might occasionally have
a look at a translation, or somebody else might, and if we find errors,
or we learn about errors, we will ask for correction.

But anyway, I know that you have a long experience in translating such
documents, and that you and your comitee are working very carefully,
so I don't see any problems.
