Hi!

The Norwegian Central Information Service is currently working on 
web-guidelines for the central (government) administration in Norway. 
We wish to include the WAI Accessibility Guidelines as an appendix to 
our own publication, and will therefore have to translate your 
guidelines to Norwegian. The translation will be done by a 
professional agency. How often will the guideline-draft be updated? 
Has this document -or other versions of the guidelines - been 
translated to Norwegian before (by someone else)?

sincerely
