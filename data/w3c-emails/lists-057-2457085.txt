As I have told you earlier, you don't have to ask for permission.
You just have to inform us through this list.

Again as said earlier, the W3C team does not have the resources to
check or control any translations. I'm rather sure that you will
do a good job, but that's not the issue here.

Anybody can translate W3C Recommendations if s/he respects the
rules. No particular qualification is required to start.


Regards,   Martin.
