Dear Xiaoyang,

For the requirement, please read "W3C Intellectual Property FAQ"
at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate .

I, as an amateur translator, have taken that no qualifications
or resistrations are required. We have only to
1. post the notice to this list on publishing the translations,
2. inclure some items into the translated specifications,
3. and, agree some terms.

If I have misunderstood something, plese notice me. > all

Let's enjoy translating together.

Thank you.
