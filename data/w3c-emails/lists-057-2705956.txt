Hello

I am a fairly new member of the HTML Writers Guild. While sufing your site I
discovered that you are still looking for help in translating different
documents. I would be more than happy to help you with this. 
My native language is German. I have translated before, mainly articles for
Computer magazines.

Please let me know wether or not you are interested in using my skills.

Best Regards
Natalie Engel
