We don't give any instructions, but here are some pointers,
for you and others:

W3C's policy on translations:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate
This tells you the conditions under which you can translate,
and when and what you have to tell us about what you are doing.

The archive of this list:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-translators/
Here you can find others that are interested in translating
to the same language.

The TR page (i.e. the list of things that may be translated):
http://www.w3.org/TR/

The rest is up to you: You decide what you want to translate,
how much time you want to take, and whether you want to work
together with somebody else or alone.

Happy translating!     Martin.
