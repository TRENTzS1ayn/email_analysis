Hello,

I had previously sent a message about this topic, but
it didn't appear in the archive (I must add I wasn't on the list
at that time).

I have now decided to start to write a German translation
of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
(http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT).
My native language is German. I will try to publish
the results regularily and would be glad about about any
feedback or suggestions from people that can understand German.
