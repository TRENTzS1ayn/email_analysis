Dear editors.

Now, "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" is available 
in Japanese(iso-2022-jp,LF) at 
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~bd9y-ktu/WEBc_f/wai-pageauth.html 
and it is manifested in it that the Japnese version is under 
your copyright.

By the way, I have it in mind to translate "Techniques for Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" to japaneses, while HTML 4.0 
and CSS1 have been already available in japanese. I hope that an 
associated set of them is eatablished in japnese as in english normative.

Thank you
