Hello,

I wish to volunteer as a translator for the Web Contents Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0 (www.w3.org/TR/WAI-CONTENT) into Dutch. I'm a
computer science-student and I'm visually impaired so these Guidelines
have my special attention. I hope that some other people volunteer as well
on the Dutch translation so we can work together because, in Dutch, "vele
handen maken licht werk". 

Greetings,
Rob Arntz.

(My translations from English into Dutch are better then from Dutch into
English so don't panic beacause about the bad English I used in this
mail).
