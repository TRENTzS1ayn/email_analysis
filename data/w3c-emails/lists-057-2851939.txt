Dear Editor.

Please tell me about the following issue.

The translation of "wai-pageauth.html" into other languagues should 
have the english "wai-pageauth-tech.html" since the "wai-pageauth.html" 
is the recommended document but a "wai-pageauth-tech.html" is just a note 
which will be updated frequently.

Thanks

Yasutaka Kato
