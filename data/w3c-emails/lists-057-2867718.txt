Hi!

Just want to let you know that I'll begin with the German translation of
http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet in the next days.

The translation will be available at

http://www.mintert.com/xml/trans/

It is planned to translate all XML related specs (at least the core: syntax,
style XSL*, linking, schema, ...) and publish it at the above adress.
Currently the German translation of XML-1.0 is already available (as
announced about a year ago). 

Further translations will probably not begin before another spec becomes a
(proposed) recommendation (Yes, I know, REC-xml-names already IS a
recommendation ;-).


As soon as the translation of xml-stylesheet is available it will be
announced on this mailing list.



Ian, if there's a list for translators of xml-stylesheet, please add my name
and either my mail address 'stefan@mintert.com' or the above URL (from which
my adress is accessible by following the links), or both.

Thanks in advance!


Bye,

  Stefan.
