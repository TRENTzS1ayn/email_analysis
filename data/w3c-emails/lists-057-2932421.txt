Dear Translators,

Based upon various requests, we have created a new page,
"Translations at W3C", http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/.
This page is linked from the W3C home page (http://www.w3.org/),
under "Technical Reports", and from the Technical Reports page
(http://www.w3.org/TR/).

We hope that this page helps to improve the translation activities.
If you have any comments, please feel free to send them to the
list for discussion or to myself.

We are also looking into further improving the information flow
on translations. In particular, we are looking into the following:

- Changing from email-based notification to form-based notification.

- Creating mailing lists for discussion (not for notification) on
  translations in languages that have a high translation activity.

- Creating some support for glossaries in order to help people
  with terminology.

All these require some implementation effort, and so we cannot
promize anything at the moment. But we would very much like your
input in order to assess priorites and get further ideas.


Looking forwards to your comments,    Martin.
