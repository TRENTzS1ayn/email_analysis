Dir Sirs,

I believe that I could help you in the translation to French of the CSS2
Recommendation.

What are the conditions to become a w3c-translator ?

While I don't speak English perfectly, I understand it without any
problems and I do be able to translate any technical text. I'm especially
interested by the translation of technical vocabulary, which have no
direct, litteral traduction in French.

Sincerely yours,

Nicolas Lesbats
