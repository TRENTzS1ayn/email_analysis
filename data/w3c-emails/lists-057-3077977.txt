Hello.
My downloaded version of HTML4 specifiacations speaks of the effort of
translating this document. I felt pretty confused recognizing that it
still was not converted into German. As I?m just helping to transpose a
little shareware into German I think I should offer you some help.
Please tell me if I can be of any use for this project.
best regards
