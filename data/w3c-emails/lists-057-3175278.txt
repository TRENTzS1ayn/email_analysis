[Patrick Andries]  I suspect this is a rhetorical question.

     [Patrick Andries]  Which brings forth another question : 
will the W3C standards ever become ISO
standards ? Could a country, let say Canada, make  XML,
for instance, a national standard and present it to the ISO
as a proposed international standard ? In this way, these
standards would have an officially approved (quality) translation
in all the countries that care to have one, as was the case for
SGML.
