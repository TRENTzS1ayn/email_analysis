Well, I wouldn't mind if you could give a good answer.
The fact is that we just don't have one.

Yes, indeed. There is work on making HTML an ISO standard.
However, this is a very short document, mainly containing
the DTD, and refering to the W3C Recommendation for all the
rest. Otherwise, the rewriting of the spec would have introduced
too many incompatibilities.

The Japanese Standard Association already issues translations of
some W3C documents as what they call "Technical Reports". This
gives them an "official" translation, without having to make it
a standard. But these "official" translations also have their
problems. I have heard that for a publication in a book, the
translation has to be adapted because the "official" language
is too particular and difficult to understand.
