Adding a link takes five minutes. If any problems are discovered, we
can also remove it in five minutes. Hosting means that we have to
check a lot of things, it's much more work.

So why don't you try and submit a translation if you have one?

W3C is not the only organization providing stable URIs, is it?

We are not shy. We are trying to achieve a maximum of effect with
a minimum of effort. We currently barely manage to make sure that
the Recommendations produced are appropriately internationalized.
My personal opinion is that this is more important than having
the translations hosted.

What is the original problem? I doubt that there should be a problem
to find a site to host a translation. It actually should add value
to that site. That's actually why quite some translators want to have
it on their site.

Also, because the translations are done by volunteers, they are
frequently done piece by piece, especially if they are large.
We couldn't host partial translations, and handle all the updates.
There are also cases where there are two or more teams, and this
would mean that we would have to favor one of the translations,
or host two differing translations.

What do the other translators on this list think?

Regards,   Martin.
