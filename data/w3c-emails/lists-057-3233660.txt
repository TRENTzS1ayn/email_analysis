That was not the point at all.  Whether it hosts a translation or not, I'm
quite sure the W3C will link to it with a fat disclaimer saying "we do not
vouch for this translation, we haven't checked it, it's not official, we're
not responsible, etc. etc.".  So it doesn't need to "check a lot of
things", hosting or not.

Soon.  Translation is underway and I was inquiring to Ian about what we
could do with it.

I don't see why you oppose these two.  Internationalizing the specs
*before* they are approved is entirely distinct from translating them
*after* they are published. And since the translations are done by
volunteers, no W3C resources need be consumed for hosting, except for a
small amount of disk space and bandwidth.  This doesn't hurt the i18n
effort at all.

I had asked Ian where a translation of XML1.0 would go.  There is no
placeholder link inside the XML spec, as there is in HTML4, pointing to
translations.  This question is also unresolved, independent of the hosting
issue.

That's circular.  The translations are made by volunteers because the W3C
won't expand any resources on them; and the W3C won't expand any resource
on translations because they are made by volunteers.  I'm beginning to
suspect that the sentence in the Process about translations being welcome
is not worth the electrons it's written in.

Then don't.  That's not the issue.

Or ask them to reconcile and submit one, of potentially better quality.
