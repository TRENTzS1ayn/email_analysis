Translation of HTML 4.0 into Korean completed.
 
It is now available at <http://trio.co.kr/autohtml.html> for public.

Bug corrections and refinement will be carried out continuously.
 
Since Korean translation of the specification is not available before this,
I hope you could assist me to notice it widely in Korea.
 
Thank you, and good bye ?
 
Taeho Lee
