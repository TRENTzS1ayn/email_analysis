I joint you on Jan. 1998, but has not been active due to an overload (sorry).
However now I can start the translation to Hebrew.
My questions in regard to that are:
(1) Is the html4.0.zip version still in effect or I have to download a new one?
(2) Did anybody from Israel start translating?
(3) If a Hebrew translation has been started, what are the parts that still need
translation?

Regards,
