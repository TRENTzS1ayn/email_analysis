To find the newest version of a spec, please always check
http://www.w3.org/TR/. For HTML 4.0, you can find:

Proposed Recommendations
              24 August: HTML 4.01 Specification - This document is an upgraded
              Recommendation, first issued 18 December 1997, revised 24 April 1998 -
              Review Ends 22 September 1999 

and
HTML 4.0 Specification 
              18 December 1997, revised 24 April 1998. Dave Raggett,
              Arnaud Le Hors, Ian Jacobs

This means that if you start now, what you want to end up is a translation
of HTML 4.01 when and if it becomes a Recommendation.
