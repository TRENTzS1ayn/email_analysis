Hello Fabio,

Many thanks for your work! A few comments:

- We don't need an email or zip.
- Please make sure to have the relevant stylesheet.
  http://wwwest.uniandes.edu.co/~l-arcini/target_files/xml.css
  is currently not accessible, and that causes problems on some
  browsers.

- Please make sure that you have a section at the top,
  ended by a <HR>, that says that this is a translation,...
  as requested in the Copyright FAQ.
- Also, at the same place, say that this is an annotated
  specification (the annotations I tried resulted in 404 not
  found)

- There are a lot of words with some upper-case letters, e.g.
  estAn, apEndice, sirviO.
- Some English text is left, e.g. "2.10 White Space Handling
  In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use "white space"...

Please feel free to ask if anything is unclear.

Regards,   Martin.
