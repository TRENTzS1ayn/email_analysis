Hi Dave,

I've translated the XHTML 1.0 Proposed Recomendation (1999/12/10) into
Spanish.
There are two possible URLs where you can give a look a tell if the W3C
gives its approval to the translation. I know it still is a Prop. Rec.,
but I think it is important to the Spanish speaking comunity to have an
idea of what's going on.

Thanks in advance,

Juan Luis Lara.
