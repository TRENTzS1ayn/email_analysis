Many thanks for this work. This is a very good example
of how to distinguish between the translation itself
and comments on the translation.

Can I ask for two improvements:

- In the references, there is a pointer to Japanese tranlation
  of the namespaces spec. Shouldn't the whole sentence be in
  a box, rather than just the link itself?

- Can you please add some info to your server or as a META
  tag to make sure the character encoding of the document
  is correctly identified? Please see
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.2.2
  for details.

Many thanks and kind regards,   Martin.
