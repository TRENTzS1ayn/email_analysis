Hello Dave, Juan:

Using the W3C logo, directly from the W3C site, is okay if done
correctly. Please see the example at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/translation-example.html
referenced from the Copyright FAQ
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate.

However, there are a few other things that can and should
be improved:

- Please try to make sure that the 'W3C Proposed Recommendation'
  icon starts at the same height as the actual translation,
  not before.

- Please put the disclaimers on the translation (i.e. "(Los posibles
  errores presentes en este documento"...) in the header before
  the translation.

- Please add a sentence saying that the normative version of the
  specification is the English version found at the W3C site.

- Please move all logos of translators to the header.

- Please make sure that all browsers know the character encoding
  of the document. Please see
  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.2.2 on how to
  do that.


Regards,   Martin.
