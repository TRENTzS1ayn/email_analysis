Hello:
According to your requirements, I inform you that I am working in the
translation of the CSS2 Specification into Spanish.  
In fact, I began the work a couple of months ago by way of exercise (because I
was not sure of being under conditions of concluding it).  
Due to the extension of the work I glide to publish it partially in
http://carlos-benavidez.com.ar. (...and finish before next century).  
Greetings
