Translation of XML 1.0 recommendations(W3C Recommendation 10-February-1998)
has been completed.

It is now available at http://trio.co.kr/webrefer/xml/xml10.html for public.

I tried to keep as it is.
However, small little modifications have been made as followings;
1) marked translator's note in diffent color
2) optional view feature with frames have been provided
3) link site to an English marked with translation note color in front show
'English'
4) removed styles not in use
5) contacts to translator and complete URI have been added in translator's
note area
6) links to other W3C documents in Korean has been add as above

I hope you would link in W3C appropreate page, and, if you have any request
to modfy, please let me know.

In addition, for visitors' conveniences, is it possible to split such big
files as this and CSS1 into several smaller files, ?

Bests regards,
Taeho Lee
