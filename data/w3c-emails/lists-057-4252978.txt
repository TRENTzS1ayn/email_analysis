Dear Translators,

After a page with German Translations and a page with
French translations, we now also have a page with
Japanese translations, at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/Japanese
and linked from
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/#Specifications.
[please press 'reload' to make sure you have the newest version]

Regards,   Martin.
