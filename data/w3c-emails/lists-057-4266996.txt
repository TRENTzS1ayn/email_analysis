Dear Sir:

I am a software engineer from China now working for an American IT company 
in the e-business area, I have been used nearly all the new technologies 
such as XML and I want to share with others.

I found there is no Chinese translation version of some new standards and 
drafts, so may I volunteer to do this job from now?

Thank you very much.
