Hello Matthew,

Please note that terms showing up in translations may or may not
be 'accepted terms'. In some cases, there are already accepted
terms, and translators are familliar with them. In other cases,
there are just no accepted terms as of yet, and translators have
to come up with some, which is quite a difficult task. Some of
these terms may end up to become well accepted; some others may
not. Finding good new terms is hard work, with quite a bit of
trial-and-error involved.

If anybody on the list has some experience from his/her translation
work with creating/selecting terms, please share!

Regards,   Martin.
