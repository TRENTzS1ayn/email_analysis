I've translated the WCAG and I'm now localizing the Mozilla browser into
Norwegian. One resource I've found of great help in this work, is the
Microsoft's translation glossaries at <URL:
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/newup/glossary/ >. These contain
translations for every word and phrase in all Microsoft products
(Windows, Word, Internet Explorer &c.) (which have been translated into
your target language). I'm not sure it contains much info on XML terms,
but at least the IE glossary should contain some web related terms.

Novell <URL: ftp://ftp.ege.edu.tr/pub/Novell/updates/tresorce/gloss/ >
has also released their glossaries. There are much smaller then the MS
ones, but still useful.

And at <URL:
ftp://dev.apple.com/devworld/Tool_Chest/Localization_Tools/Apple_Intl_Gl
ossaries >, you'll find the official MacOS glossaries, available in 34
languages and several different formats.
