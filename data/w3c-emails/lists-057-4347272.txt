Dear Sir:

I wish translate HTML 4.0 specification into Bengali for the following reason:

1. There are more than 150 million Bengali speaking people in the world
2. They live in India, Bangladesh which are now hot for software development

I will use standard Bengali font that is widely used now for WWW, Sulekha Font.

Pls reply.

Thanks and best regards.
