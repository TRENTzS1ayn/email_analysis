Hi,

I'm currently working on the translation of the XHTML 1.0 specs to
Dutch. The work in progress can be viewed online at
http://users.chello.be/ws35943/w3/TR/xhtml1/

On this page you will find a "progress report", with a link to the
translated parts. As soon as the translation is complete, the progress
report will be replaced by the result.

A remark for W3C personnel: On
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations.html the link for the Dutch
translation of XHTML 1.0 is currently pointing to an incomplete HTML 4
translation. I suggest to replace that link by
http://users.chello.be/ws35943/w3/TR/xhtml1/ The name and e-mail address
next to the link are correct. :-)
