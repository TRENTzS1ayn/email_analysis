Could someone of W3C replace the link to the Dutch translation of XHTML
1.0 please?

Your page to be modified: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations.html
Old link: http://www.playgarden.com/html4/index.htm
New link: http://users.chello.be/ws35943/w3/TR/xhtml1/

I already mentioned this briefly in my previous posting on the
translators mailing list. But you may have overlooked the request to
link to the new page. That's why I repeat this in this separate posting
now. :-)
