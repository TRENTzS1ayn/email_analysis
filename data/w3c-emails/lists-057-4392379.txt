To all

My name is Deny D. Sabri from Jakarta-Indonesia. Currently I work for PT. 
Adhi Widya Dasa - System Integrator for Sybase Indonesia. I really like to 
know more about XML-I believe others friends of mine too, but I can not 
find book in Indonesia with XML subject.
I order to help me learning XML and mybe my friends in Indonesia I would 
like to translate some of the documentations and publish it on internet.
Is it possible ?

Regards
Deny D. Sabri
