We are pleased to inform the W3C-translators community that
Nagora-Consultants
intend to contribute to the translation of XSLT, XPath and DOM into
french.
A team of 4 XML Experts and 4 consultants is planned to work on the
subject during the coming
6 months. We ask the community if somebody is also looking at, or has
already started, such translations.

Sincerely,

Jean-Jacques Thomasson
