Hello,

I and Naohiko Uramoto of IBM Research, Tokyo Research Laboratory want to
translate the current draft of XML Schema Part 0 to Japanese.  We have read the
conditions stated at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/ and
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate and agree on 
them.  We
plan to complete the initial draft in the first half of May and post it on 
IBM's
developerWorks for Japanese page.

Please let us know if we can go ahead with this effort.

Regards,

Hiroshi Maruyama
