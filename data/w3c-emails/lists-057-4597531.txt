Hello,

IBM Tokyo Reaserach and Microsoft Japan have jointly translated
the current W3C Note of SOAP 1.1 into Japanese.
The original document is at http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/

We have already published at IBM Japan's developerWorks:
http://www.jp.ibm.com/developerworks/link/soap.html

Of course, before translating it,
we have read the conditions stated at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/
and http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate and agree on 
them.

We hope our translation is introduced at W3C Translation page:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/Japanese

Best Regards,
Satoshi
