That's great news! I look forward to the translation. We do
not generally have the good fortune of having people
translate our Notes, and so I did not plan ahead by
including a link in the document to a page of translations. 
Therefore, when you have finished, I will publish a new draft 
of the Note that includes a link to yours and future translations.

Thank you,

  - Ian
