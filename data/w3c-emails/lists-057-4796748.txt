Dear Translators,

I have just updated the Translations page at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/ to include
a search for the mailing list of this archive. This should
make it easier for people to find anouncements of translations,
and thus collaborate in volunteer efforts and find the
translations themselves.

However, for this to work, it is very important that you send
in your anouncements (as required by the Copyright FAQ), and
that you include

- The language to translated to (or are planning to translate to)
- The name of the specification you plan to translate (ideally
  title and URI)
- If applicable, the URI (web address) where the translation
  can be found.

Any suggestions for further improvements are very welcome.

Regards,   Martin.
