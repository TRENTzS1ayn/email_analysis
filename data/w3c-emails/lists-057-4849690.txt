You cannot charge W3C anything; that's the essence of volunteering.
However, we give the right to translate our work to anybody who
complies with the rules (as given in
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate).
Some translators do translations for a book they are writing,
or for a company they are working for, and thus get some money
for the translation, but most of them are mainly interested in
making W3C specifications better available to people around
the world.

We are very grateful to the many volunteers doing a lot of great
work with their translations. Thank you everybody!


Regards,   Martin.

Dear Sirs,
  
As a French and Italian translator, I would like to help translating some documents, for instance when I am off.
  
How much could I charge for it as a volunteer ?
  
Yours sincerely.
