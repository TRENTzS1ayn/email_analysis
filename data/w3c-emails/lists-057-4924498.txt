            hello,

 i would like contribute to the efforts for a 
 slovak/cshech translation in order to spread out
 the knowledge about the html programming and news 
 in those countries. 
 Please send me a mail if you are interested in this
 offer. 
 i am ready to work on that topics as soon as you will
 give me the right to do it. 

 i will then contact the other translator in order to avoid 
 the overlap. I will work on both french/english actual text. 
 
                                    Best Regards,
                                  
                                         Elena Paulova



ps : you could contact by email to 
                     e_paulova@hotmail.com
