Hi...
I'd like to translate both HTML 3.2 and CSS 1 specifications into
Polish; yes, I am aware that those documents are old - I'd treat this
work as an exercise before translating something newer and bigger (and
I'm sure SOMEONE will find the translation useful). Basically, I'd like
to know if there's any translation of the above documents in progress?
Thank you.
