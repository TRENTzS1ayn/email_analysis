Lieven Smits, prof at Ehsal Belgium, is interested in doing the
coordination of the translation to Dutch. He invited Mark Bliek and me
(Bart Martens) to translate parts under Lievens supervision. However, I
noticed that Pierre van Rooden and Andy Camps wrote on this mailinglist
that they're both also interested in this translation work. In the
meantime Andy Camps has already started translating the HTML 4.01
specification to Dutch. The progress of his work can be followed on his
webpage http://www.playgarden.com/html4/index.htm . So, if someone else
is also interested in translating to Dutch, please contact Andy Camps
andy.camps@wanadoo.be or Lieven Smits lieven.smits@prof.ehsal.be . Also,
please publish all news on translating the HTML 4.01 or the XHTML 1.0 on
this mailinglist w3c-translators@w3.org . The archive of this
mailinglist can be consulted at
