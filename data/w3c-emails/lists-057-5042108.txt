Hello Carlos,

Many thanks for all your work on translations. I have looked at it,
and have one request:

We are not very happy with the banner adds, but understand that
sometimes that may be unavoidable. However, we would like you
to make sure that it's clear that W3C is not related to these
adds or the products they advertize. So on
http://carlos-benavidez.com.ar/css2/cover.html, please put the
banner add into the white box that contains the information about
the translation. On the other pages, such as
http://carlos-benavidez.com.ar/css2/about.html,
probably the best idea is to create a box similar to the one
on the first page, and put the banner add and the comment about
the translation into it.

If you have any problems with this request, or any questions,
please feel free to contact me.

Regards,   Martin.

Martin,  
  
    The inconvenience is that the banner is added automatically by my server
and I don't trust if it remains in the place that I choose.  
    On the other hand, I have placed a red line just below the banner and a
legend in Spanish which says "Important note: The W3C have no relations with
the information located above this line, neither with the products nor
services advertized there". I?ve performed the same explanation in my home
page.
   I hope that attachment would be enough for the searched purposes.  
   Greetings and excuses for my answer delay, you know, we are on holidays
time. 

   Carlos
