Dear Sir/Madam,
This is Jack from USC. I am a Ph.d student in Computer Science Dept.. here
in SC who are interested in XML technology. I think it is great idea to
introduce XML to the non-English speaking world. I found there are couple
of translation versions, but there is no Chinese version. I don't know if
you have already had a translation. If not, I am willing to work on the
translation so that we can make more people from China, HK and Taiwan be
aware and use of this advanced technology.
I am also interested in working on translating other standard documents to
Chinese under your permission.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Best
