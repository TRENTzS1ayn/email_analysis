Dear translators and staffs.

We are a Japanese translation team and have started
translation of HTML 4.01 spacification at
<http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~sd5a-ucd/rec-html401j/>.

If you want to help us, you are welcome.
And offers of joint work, espaccially from JIS technical
reports editors, are very welcome.
