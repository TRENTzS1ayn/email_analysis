Hello, everyone,

I am new to this list, and I did not see this question in the
archives.

In this question, I will be referring to the French and Spanish
translations of XHTML 1.0 which are located at:

French: http://www.la-grange.net/w3c/xhtml1/
Spanish: http://leo.worldonline.es/jlgranad/xhtml/xhtml1.htm

An object model is a model for an object in any language, I am sure.
But...

In French we have:
     Mod?le Objet de Document HTML
     = an object model of an HTML document.

In Spanish we have:
     Modelo del Objeto Documento de HTML
     = a model of the HTML Document Object

Have I understood these translations correctly?
Is only one of them correct?
Is the HTML Document Object Model:
     (1) an object model of an HTML document;
     (2) a model of an HTML document object?
Or, is the translation of this simply language-specific?

Thank you,
   - Zeno
