Thank you very much for your prompt response.  I agree that in
English, the distinction is unimportant; the phrase is clear without
any analysis.  However, I wish to translate the phrase correctly, so I
must examine such things.

Please allow me to include the following separate excerpts from the
DOM, which have been cut from different paragraphs:

In the first sentence of the second excerpt, we are told that the name
was chosen because DOM is an 'object model'.  In the last sentence of
the second excerpt, we are told that a document may be composed of
multiple objects described by the (object) model.  Because of these
two statements, it seems clear that we are not speaking of a 'document
object' at all, but an 'object model' describing possibly multiple
objects within a document.

We were discussing the following two possibilities:
   (1) an object model for an HTML document;
   (2) a model of the HTML document object.

Surely, these are different, because from the DOM, we have seen that
the second translation must be incorrect.  There is a third which we
were not discussing:
   (3) a Document Object Model for HTML.

I think that our remaining (1) and (3) are closer in meaning than (1)
and (2).  In the first excerpt, we are told that "the Document Object
Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML
documents".  I can find nowhere in the specification where the DOM
refers to HTML or XML, only to HTML documents or XML documents.
Perhaps in an exercise of redundancy, one could say 'the HTML Document
DOM' or 'the XML Document DOM', but that would be silly.    Because of
our above discussion of the 'object model' and the pairing of 'HTML
documents' and 'XML documents', I believe that (1) is the correct
translation (or concept).

Your comments helped me immensely and I thank you for them.  If you
can see any flaws in my reasoning, please let me know!  Otherwise, I
will go with 'HTML-document object-model' or 'an object model for an
HTML document'.

Thank you,
