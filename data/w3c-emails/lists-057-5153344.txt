Hello,

I would like to volunteer to translate the DOM specification or any 
specification to Indonesian language.

I am originally from Indonesia, and I have been working with XML in some of 
my last projects.

So, please notify me of the specific rules that I must follow in the 
translation.

Regards,

Suriyanto Lee
