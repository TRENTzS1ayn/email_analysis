Hi Pei Jianfeng,

I checked http://widget.home.chinaren.net/. What I saw is only Title and few 
lines translated. Even header not be set properly. I hope you can get 
everything done before annoucing. This is not a plce for your "annoucware". 
Actually I am translating this document into Chinese now.

See you next time.

Yu Hai an.
