Dear Sirs,

Let me introduce myself: my name is Taavi Valdlo and I am Secretary of
Estonian IT Standardization Technical Committee.

With Your kind permission we are intended to translate into Estonian
Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (W3C Recommendation).
Translation will be made by Uuno Vallner (uuno@rk.ee) by request of our
TC.
We will fulfil all statements of W3C's translation policy.
We plan to develop translation mainly electronically, possible also as
printed document through national standardization system.

Best regards,

Taavi Valdlo
