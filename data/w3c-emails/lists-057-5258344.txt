Hello Taeho,

I'm sorry to be so late with my answer. I was ill with a serious flu.
I started to write an answer to you last week, but I started some
checks and got into various problems. Please see below:

Many thanks for your work.

There seems to be some Javascript that handles this, and on Netscape
I indeed saw no frames for some time, but on MS IE, when starting
at the page that switches between versions, all I get is
a blank page.

You don't need a separate reference site. All you would need is a
separate reference page. We could even add a link to that from
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/, maybe.

The translation in particular of HTML 4.01 must have been a lot
of work. (http://trio.co.kr/webrefer/html/cover.html)
But can you please remove the 'new' icon from it?
(or move it up to the section about the translation)

I'm not sure it's necessary to mark each of these in the document.
It looks as if links to the original are more frequent. So one
idea would be to only mark links to translations. Also, I would be
very surprised if there suddenly was a Korean translation of
the MIT, INRIA, or Keio page. These pages, though linked from
our technical reports, are not governed by our translation policy.
I'm sure that a Korean reader would be almost as surprised to
find a Korea translation of these as myself, and therefore on
these items, expressly indicating that this is a link to an original
doesn't seem to help much.

But there is always some cases where it's difficult to decide
what exactly 'exact' translation means. Comments from others
on how they handle links to other documents in their translations
(i.e. link to original, link to translation, or both) are
apreciated.

There is a W3C stylesheet referenced in the original, which should
work for Korean, too. If it doesn't, please tell us what needs to
be fixed.

If you clearly say that for each part, I don't think it should
be a big problem. However, I'm still wondering why you use all
these frames and Javascript,... which doesn't really shortend
download times, or does it?
