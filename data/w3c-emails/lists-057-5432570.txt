Hi, My name is Luis Sarmiento, I'm from El Salvador. I would like to know 
more about the volunteer translator team.

I want to know how can I be a volunteer and how I'll make public my work.
Please, e-mail me all the information needed. And I thank you for the 
attention to this e-mail.

My like area is the HTML.

Luis Sarmiento.
