Hello,

I would like to volunteer as a translator for the HTML 4.01 spec into
Portuguese. I've already mailed some of the translators listed in the W3
translation page but none answered back. I don't know how's the
translation going. Who should I contact to know it?

Thanks in advance,

Georges Kormikiaris
