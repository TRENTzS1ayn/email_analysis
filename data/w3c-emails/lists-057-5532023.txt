Dear W3C,

My name is Takahiro Mashiko and I'm a graduate student in
the master's program at Graduate School of Commerce,
Waseda University, Japan.

Now I manage a website including contents of website
creating, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheet, etc.
I'm curious as to the accessibility, especially the
structure of web authoring tools.

So, I translated "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
1.0" into Japanese according to W3C's "Document Copyright
Notice," and published on my own website since 16 July 2000.

URL is...

I would appreciate your response.


Best Regards,
