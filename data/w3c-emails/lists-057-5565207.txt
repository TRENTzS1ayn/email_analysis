I've attached a Brazilian Portuguese version of the WAI Quicktips, since
the language differs somewhat from Portuguese as spoken in Portugal -
specially in the use of anglicisms, which is very common here but not so
in Europe. The differences are not very deep, but some words are spelled
completely different, and some are very awkward to us!

Cheers,
