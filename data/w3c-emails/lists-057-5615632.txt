It's not a problem of English or Japanese, it's that the disclaimer
doesn't say all the things it should say. From:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#translate

2.Prominently disclose in the target language the following 3 items:
         1.the original URL, the status of the document,
           and its original copyright notice.
         2.that the normative version of the specification is
           the English version found at the W3C site.
         3.that the translated document may contain errors from the 
translation.

Point 1 is done inside the translation (by just translating the original).
Point 2 is done by you in the Note at the beginning.
Point 3 is missing. It can be added e.g. as

[everybody, please excuse me to use Japanese here]
 x 
in http://www2.airnet.ne.jp/sardine/docs/WD-xhtml-basic-20000210/Overview.html,
or as  x , 
 x 
in http://www.trl.ibm.co.jp/projects/xml/xmlschema-0j.html,
or however you like.

Regards,   Martin.
