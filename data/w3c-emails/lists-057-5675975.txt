Dear sirs,

Further to the previous e-mail, we would like to confirm if our translation
is going to be published on W3C web site and if W3C set up the linkage to
our web site accordingly.

Would very appreciate your prompt reply. Thanks for your kind attention.

RGDS,
Angela

Dear sir,

We finalize the web site deployment.  The document is posted on
http://www.twtec.org.tw/English/REC-xml-19980210-tw.htm

Actually, we provide two paths to link the document. Readers can find XML1.0
spec linkage both on Chinese version as well as the English one.  And in the
header of the document, we also describe that the spec is located on two
paths.

Thanks for your kind attention.

RGDS,
Angela
