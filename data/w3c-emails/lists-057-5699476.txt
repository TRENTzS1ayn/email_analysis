Hello Yoshito,

Many thanks for your continued translations efforts.

Please note that the copyright FAQ speaks about specifications
(http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#translate),
and that the CSS test suite is obviously not a specification.
Also, it is joint work by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU),
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and W3C.

I have therefore contacted the responsible people to check whether
they agree with the translation. In case they do not agree, I may
have to ask you to remove your translation. Of course, I hope I
do not have to do that, but I can't promise anything.

In the future, please announce that you plan a translation
before starting the actual work.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask (in English
or Japanese).

Regards,   Martin.
