Hello.

I have just finished the Interlingua version of the WAI QuckTips. I
send it attached to this message.

I have also published it online (URL disclosed to this list only):
http://www.nautilus.com.br/~ensjo/ia/w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/

For those who still are at lost about what Interlingua is, check this
extensive description: http://www.interlingua.org/ (Introduction to
the Interlingua--English Dictionary).

Since interlingua is highly readable by Europeans, mainly Romance
language speakers, maybe others would like to cooperate in
translating W3 documents into Interlingua.

A revider,
