Hello,

I would like to inform you that I will coordinate a group of people that
starts translation of XML 1.0 Recommendation to Polish in a few days.

I have important question related to this project: XML 1.0
Recommendation is available as XML file, which we would like to use to
produce an XML file with translation. Could you provide me with DTD for
this spec and some XSLT stylesheets to transform the result to HTML?

Or should we use HTML version as a source, and produce HTML translation?

Regards,

Szymon
