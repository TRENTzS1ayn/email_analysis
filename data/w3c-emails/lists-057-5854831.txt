Dear Madam or Sir:

I would be willing to volunteer as a translator into GERMAN of the following
documents hosted on your website:



Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0

http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/full-checklist.html

List of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/checkpoint-list.html


I work as a professional web developer, but have also worked as a translator
and in software localization in the past. I currently deal with issues of
accessibility and have noticed that the mentioned documents so far are not
available in other languages.

Please let me know if you are interested in having these (or closely
related) documents translated into German and would be interested in adding
them to your archive. Of course, I would peform this task free of charge.

Sincerely,

Thomas Ringmayr, PhD
Berlin, Germany
