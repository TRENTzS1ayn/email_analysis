The W3C "hosts" the WWW Security FAQ and now that you raise the issue I 
wonder about its copyright status. However, I presume Lincoln holds the 
copyright and agrees that it be distributed under the W3C license, and 
consequently translatable if the conditions are met.

I'd recommend that if you follow the conditions [1] then you may translate 
it provided that you provide a copy to Lincoln, perhaps he can find it a 
public home. If Lincoln agrees to this (he's cc:d), I see no problem.
