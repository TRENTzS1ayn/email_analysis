Dear Thomas!

The documents you mentioned are already translated to German. The
translation was done by Rene Hartmann:

http://people.frankfurt.netsurf.de/Rene.Hartmann/WAI/checkliste.html
http://people.frankfurt.netsurf.de/Rene.Hartmann/WAI/checkpunkt-liste.html
A link from the W3C site can e found at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS


I'm currently working on a project with the goal of translating all W3C
recommendations to German.  Maybe you're interested in joining this
project. More information can be found at:

Any help is appreciated!
