Dear W3C staff,

as part of our German translation project, we would like to begin with
the translation of XLink and XPointer within the next few weeks. Both
specs are candidate recommendations. Is there any information available
if and when theses specs will become recommendations? Are changes to the
specs expected?

Thanks in advance!


Regards,

  Stefan.
