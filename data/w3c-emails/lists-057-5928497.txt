Hi!

I just want to let you know that the translation of XSLT and XPath to
German begins in a few days. This translation effort is part of the
German recommendation project I announced earlier.

The status of our ongoing effort of translating these two and other W3C
RECs will be announced on this list and on 
http://mintert.com/w3c/trans/de/


Bye,

  Stefan.
