W3C does not currently publish the actual translations on www.w3.org.

There should be a link to your translation on
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations.html. I have asked the maintainers
of this page to add one.

The WAI quick tips are an exception, in that they are actually
published at www.w3.org, and this one is indeed listed on
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/Translations.html
and published at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/qt.ia.htm.

Just as an asside:
