Hello W3C,

I teach HTML in Berlin, Germany, and was enthused by Dave Raggett's short
and excellent introductions to HTML and CSS. I have translated these pages
into German for my pupils and would like (in accordance with your
Intellectual Property FAQ 5.6) to inform you about the publication on
http://www.siteform.de/tutorials/Overview.html
http://www.siteform.de/tutorials/Style.html
http://www.siteform.de/tutorials/Advanced.html (under construction)

Only two small mistakes found on http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html
don't been taken over by me:

The "margin-top" property specifies the space above and the
"margin-below" specifies the space below.
         ^^^^^\
               replaced with "bottom"

The size attribute can be used to select the font size as a number
from 1 to 6.
           ^^\
             replaced with "7"

I would be lucky, if these translations received your approval.

Thank you and best wishes, also to Dave Raggett,

Ren x von Bulmerincq

p.s. My translations from English to German are much better than from German
to English.
