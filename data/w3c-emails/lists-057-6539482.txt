Dear Sirs,

I recently joined that mailing-list, and would be really pleased to
contribute
translating XML related documents.

Still, like many of us I do not have an extensive spare time. So I would
like not to take the responsability of translating of a full document, but
only a part of it.

Hence, I propose my help to anyone already busy with an English to French
translation needing a hand.

Regards,

Jan Rendek
