When you finish the translation (or even before it's completely finished),
you can put it up somewhere on the web. The URL you provide would be
the URL of the place where you put the translation.

You can start to translate any of the W3C specifications.
You will find W3C specifications at http://www.w3.org/TR/.
You can decide by yourself which one to start translating.
Some of them are much longer, some are shorter. Some are
more technical, others are easier to read.

For more information on translations at W3C in general, including
pointers to various already translated specifications, please see
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/.

Please don't hesitate if you have any more questions.

Regards,    Martin.
