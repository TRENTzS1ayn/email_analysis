Dear Martin

Thanks for your response. I went to http:/www.w3.org/TR and then went to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml [XML 1.0], http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/ [HTML 4.01 Specification], http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ [XHTML 1.0: The Extensible Hypertext Markup Language] and to http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/ [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines].

I understand all these would count as specifications and could  be translated.

Now, the first query, Gujarati does not have the Latin-Western character set. So how does one get through the problem? I could certainly edit/translate the documents in Frontpage or other HTML editors using my Gujarati font [Vakil.ttf] which is phonetic in nature. However, the users would have to download the font to be able to view the document. The font can always be put up on the site to be downloaded. Is this how one could go about it? Or are there other methods of overcoming the problem?

The second thing is that I do not own a server nor do I own a domain name. I do have a small website on geocities but I don't think that's a good idea. I would be against hosting the translated specification on the geocities page. So, how does one go about it?

Hoping to hear from you,
Regards
Roomy
