Correct. If there is anything else on http://www.w3.org which you would
want to translate, you would have to ask for permission (rather than,
as for specifications, to just notify us).

You indeed need an encoding. There is an Indian standard on encodings
for the various Indic scripts, and you can use this one. An alternative
is to use an Unicode-based encoding, i.e. UTF-16 or UTF-8.
The problem in this case is that the browser has to do some work.
We should check which browsers support which languages. Internet
Explorer shows Gujarati in various places, so that may be a good
sign. We can move the discussion for this to a more appropriate
list if we need to.
The advantage of using a standard encoding is that it is well-definde,
so that it may easily be converted to something else if needed.
Are there any other Gujarati web pages around? How does your font
look? As a TrueType font, what kind of supporting tables for
rendering does it come with?

Well, one solution would be to host it on geocities temporarily. Another
would be to ask somebody else in India or elsewhere to host it.
