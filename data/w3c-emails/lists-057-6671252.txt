We don't have any kind of certification. Anybody can translate a specification,
and people who read it can judge the quality of the translation, and recommend
it to others (or not). That's the way the Web works :-).

Another idea is to ask some other site, e.g. a site in India dealing
with Web standards, authoring,..., to host it. I can imagine there
should be sites that would be glad to do so. But it's of course your
choice.

Please take your time.
