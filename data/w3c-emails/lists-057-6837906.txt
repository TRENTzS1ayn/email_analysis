Good day.

I'm working at a software company named SMILMEDIA.Inc in Republic of Korea 
and my name is Doo-ah,choi. I'm always appreciating you for your efforts to 
the new world.

This email is containing 2 requests.

1. SMILMEDIA  wants to translate SMIL specification2.0
     into korean language.
2. SMILMEDIA  wants to provide that specification2.0 translated on its 
website, 
<http://www.smilmedia.com>http://www.smilmedia.<http://www.smilmedia.com>com

I read all words of "information on translation" in Copyright FAQ. And we 
agree with it.

The translation was completed last week and we are planning to provide it 
on our website 30th or 31th december in this year if you confirm.

Please send your answer as soon as possible.

Thank you for your kindness.

                                                          Your best regards
                                                                  Choi wrote.
