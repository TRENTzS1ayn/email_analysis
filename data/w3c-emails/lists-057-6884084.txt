Thanks Martin.

Unfortunately,I am too busy to correct
all these problems right now.
Because I have my own job.
I work at ISP help desk.

So I have maked the page permission 000.

I just intended to translate those
pages for my own personal use and
for some other freinds.

I wish I can spend more time to the
translation task in the future
then I could correct all those of
problems which you just pointed out.

I will keep my pages permission 000
until the day comes.

Thanks a lot.
See you.
