Hello,

I?ve finished the translation of the XHTML Basic Recommendation.

A Pre-version is now available under
http://www.duckflight.de/TR/xhtml-basic/w3.orgTRxhtml-basic-
de.html for you to review, if you like.

Tomorrow I like to add four or five explanations at the end of the 
document for english terms I left untranslated.
After that, it should be really finished.

For any Comments or Suggestions please write to 
stefan@duckflight.de.

Regards,
Stefan
