Hello, this smilmedia.inc in korea.

We translated smil 2.0 specification(although it is based on sep. 2000 
version) into korean. And we informed about it. But the link is chaged 
because there were some problems in character code.

New link is

<http://www.smilmedia.com/spec/spec1~7.htm>http://www.smilmedia.com/spec/spe 
c1~7.<http://www.smilmedia.com/spec/spec1~7.htm>htm

Please change the link on w3c website.

Thank you for your kindness.

                                                  your regards
                                                   Choi wrote
