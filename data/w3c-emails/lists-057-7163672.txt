Hello translators!

I want to speak about three subjects:
1. A lot of people are volunteering to translate W3C
documents, especially small ones (like XHTML1). Why
not remind them that the smallest DOES NOT mean the
easiest? I took a look at the new XHTML1 Russian and I
found that the author is using completely different
language comparing to which is used by Julia Podanyova
and me (we both translate XHTML1 into Russian). So if
there's no way to stop this chaos just place a warning
at the translations page saying that people should be
more careful in translating specs.
2. Please remove me (temporarily) from the list of
translators of XHTML1. According to point (1) of this
message I decided not to let the people see
translation in progress. I will make it perfect
(you'll see)
3. I have updated http://W3C.N3.Net which is actually
http://TheCroll.Narod.Ru/W3C/index.html. Unfortunately
the page is in win-1251 but the server does not allow
to configure the documents' encoding. I will move to
another server in a while. Thus, will you place a link
to http://W3C.N3.Net on your page?

Thank you for your assistance,
Best regards,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.
