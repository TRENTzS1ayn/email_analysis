Hello,

I have finished the Italian translation of Dave Raggett's introduction to
HTML and CSS, starting at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Overview.html .

My translation is on line at the following URIs:

http://www.diodati.org/w3c/raggett/Overview.html

http://www.diodati.org/w3c/raggett/Advanced.html

http://www.diodati.org/w3c/raggett/Style.html .


I know these files are simple introductions and not standard
recommendations, but I think they are very useful for Italian beginners :-)

Regards,
Michele Diodati
