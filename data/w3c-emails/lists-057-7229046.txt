Dear Sirs,

I have noted that a Danish translation of the
document "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0
(Second Edition), W3C Recommendation 6 October
2000" has not been provided yet. We are two Danish
computer scientists, Palle Due Larsen and myself,
who would like to do this job. Unless you have any
reservations, we will prepare a Danish translation
and notify you when it is finalised.

Best wishes,
Per
