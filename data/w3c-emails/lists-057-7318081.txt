Hello Mr. Dave,
as said by Mrs. Susan from News of W3C, I need a specific
permission from you. I have translated into Indonesian your files "Getting
Started with HTML" thinking it could be very useful for beginners in
Indonesia.  I had not read carefully W3C's FAQ about copyright and
intellectual property, and I already published freely my translations of
your documents at http://www.ai3.itb.ac.id/Tutorial/MenambahStyle.html. My
question is, am I to remove these translations or can I have your explicit
permission? 

Thank you in advance.

Best Regards,

JPN. Sumarno
