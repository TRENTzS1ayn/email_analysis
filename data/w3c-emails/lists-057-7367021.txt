Hello Radik,

Many thanks for your work.

Please add some comment at the top of the document
according to the Copyright FAQ
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html#translate.
Please integrate the sentence just before 'this version' (where
you say that you are the translator) into this comment, and use
a different background.

Please make sure that Appendix J has a different background, to
make clear that it's something you added (very good idea to have
a glossary).

Regards,    Martin.
