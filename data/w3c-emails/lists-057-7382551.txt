Hi translators, I'm Omoti at Japan :)

I have finished the Japanese translation for 
HTML Home Page

The original URL
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/

My Japanese translation
http://www.net24.ne.jp/~omoti/w3c/markup/markup_ja.html

I really thank to Dave, Mimasa, Martin, and all other
people who gave me the translation permission and
to people who kindly helped my work.

Thank you !
