Dear Martin

XML 1.0 (second edition) Russian translation placed on
http://www.online.ru/it/helpdesk/xml01.htm will be updated this week (new
translation notes and background). Right now I am about to finish
translation of XML Path version 1.0 into Russian (independent from Oleg
Tkachenko, Israel). Also in work are XName and XSLT specifications.

The best wishes
Radik Usmanov
