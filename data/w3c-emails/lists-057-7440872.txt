Partial translation should be OK, so long as you follow the requirements
described in 5.6 of the W3C Intellectual Property FAQ, at:

    http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate

It sounds similar to annotation.  5.8 of the W3C Intellectual Property
FAQ might be relevant in this case.

    http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#annotate

I think so long as those summarized parts are clearly represented
as such, i.e. clearly distinguishable that those are not literal
translations but summaries, that should be OK.
