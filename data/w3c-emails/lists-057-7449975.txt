Dear Mr. Kobayashi,

Many thanks for your effort to start translation of the XSL
specification.

I agree with Masayasu that it is okay to make a partial translation.
As a volunteer effort, and for a large spec, this is the best way
to work towards an eventual complete translation. Other volunteers
could contribute missing parts.

In addition to the requirements in the W3C Intellectual Property FAQ,
please make sure that you clearly say that it is a partial translation,
and that it is clear which parts are translated, and which parts are
missing.

Yes. The summaries could either be in a separate document, or could
stand in for those parts that are not yet translated fully. Later,
somebody could replace them with the actual translations.

Many thanks again and kind regards,     Martin.
