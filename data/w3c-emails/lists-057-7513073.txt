Dear Sirs,

I have been working for the last 6 months to translate the RDF Specifications into Korean and the translations will be completed May 30, 2001.

1) Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification(W3C Recommendation 22 February 1999)
2) Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schema Specification 1.0(W3C Candidate Recommendation 27 March 2000).

I am a professor of the Department of Library and Information Science, Yonsei University and also working for the president of the Bibliographic Information Processing Society in Korea. 
 
The Korean translations would be published at 
<http://dewey.yonsei.ac.kr/courses/metadata/rdf/index.html>.

This notice is submitted to satisfy the terms on "W3C IPR FAQ":
  1.. the original URL, the status of the document, and its original copyright notice. 
  2.. that the normative version of the specification is the English version found at the W3C site. 
  3.. that the translated document may contain errors from the translation. 
I would like to hear your opinion.
Thanks in advance.
