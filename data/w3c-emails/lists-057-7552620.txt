Hi, please look into this matter I already commented in 19/04/01.

The proposed actions I suggest you to take are labeled 1. and 2. at the end 
of the message.

I insist: I have not translated the <15 October version> as implied in the 
webpage. http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS

Regards, Rafael Romero

 >Hi I am Rafael Romero, and I would like you to reflect the situation 
regarding Spanish translations of WCAG10 correctly at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS
 >
 >I did take active part in translation of PAGEAUTH-0414 (W3C Working Draft 
14-Apr-1998) which is now at 
http://acceso.uv.es/accesibilidad/estudio/PAGEAUTH.htm
 >
 >However, this is an obsolete version. In fact, I point there to the new 
translation of  WCAG10 (W3 Recommendation May 5 1999), made by Carlos Egea 
and Alicia Sarabia, at http://www.geocities.com/carlos_egea/wcag10.html
 >
 >The '15 October 1999 Spanish 
translation'  <http://www.accesosis.es/~carlosegea/PautasWAI.htm> that you 
reference was also made mainly by Carlos Egea and Alicia Sarabia (not me). 
However I think it is better to reference the last one from these 
translators which is already online.
 >
 >In summary, I would suggest you do these two changes at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS:
 >
 >1. Eliminate the reference to 'Rafael Romero and Carlos Egea Garc x . 
(Added 19 June 1999)...' which is obsolete (and I am not one of the main 
translators).
 >
 >2. Include a new reference saying:
 >Carlos Egea Garc x  <mailto:Carlos.Egea@carm.es> and Alicia Sarabia 
Sanchez <mailto:AliciaM.Sarabia@carm.es> WCAG10 Recommendation may 5 1999.
