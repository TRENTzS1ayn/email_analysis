Hi, please look into this matter regarding Spanish translations of WCAG:

The proposed actions I suggest you to take are labeled 1. and 2. at the end of the message.

Please note: I have not translated the <15 October version> as implied in http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS

Regards, Rafael Romero


>Hi I am Rafael Romero, and I would like you to reflect the situation regarding Spanish translations of WCAG10 correctly at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS
>
>I did take active part in translation of PAGEAUTH-0414 (W3C Working Draft 14-Apr-1998) which is now at http://acceso.uv.es/accesibilidad/estudio/PAGEAUTH.htm
>
>However, this is an obsolete version. In fact, I point there to the new translation of  WCAG10 (W3 Recommendation May 5 1999), made by Carlos Egea and Alicia Sarabia, at http://www.geocities.com/carlos_egea/wcag10.html
>
>The '15 October 1999 Spanish translation'  <http://www.accesosis.es/~carlosegea/PautasWAI.htm> that you reference was also made mainly by Carlos Egea and Alicia Sarabia (not me). However I think it is better to reference the last one from these translators which is already online.
>
>In summary, I would suggest you do these two changes at http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS:
>
>1. Eliminate the reference to 'Rafael Romero and Carlos Egea Garc?a. (Added 19 June 1999)...' which is obsolete (and I am not one of the main translators).
>
>2. Include a new reference saying:
>Carlos Egea Garc?a <mailto:Carlos.Egea@carm.es> and Alicia Sarabia S?nchez <mailto:AliciaM.Sarabia@carm.es> WCAG10 Recommendation may 5 1999. http://www.geocities.com/carlos_egea/wcag10.html

>Best regards, Rafael Romero.
