Dear Martin and Friends!

It was a tough job but, celebrating the first month anniversary of the
document, I finished the "XML Schema Part 0: Primer" translation into
Spanish.

Now it's available at:
http://www.aafunky.com/w3c/xmlschema/xmlschema-0es.html

Hope you could link it so people would know about it.

Thanks!
