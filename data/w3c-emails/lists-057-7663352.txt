Hi translators !

I've finished translation of XPath 1.0 spec into Russian. 
URL of the original document is 
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116.html. 
And URL of my translation is 
http://www.tkachenko.org/xpath/REC-xpath-19991116-ru.html.

Thanks to Martin and other people for their help.
