Hi I am Rafael Romero, and I would like you to reflect the situation 
regarding Spanish translations of WCAG10 correctly at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS

I did take active part in translation of PAGEAUTH-0414 (W3C Working Draft 
14-Apr-1998) which is now at 
http://acceso.uv.es/accesibilidad/estudio/PAGEAUTH.htm

However, this is an obsolete version. In fact, I point there to the new 
translation of  WCAG10 (W3 Recommendation May 5 1999), made by Carlos Egea 
and Alicia Sarabia, at http://www.geocities.com/carlos_egea/wcag10.html

The '15 October 1999 Spanish 
translation'  <http://www.accesosis.es/~carlosegea/PautasWAI.htm> that you 
reference was also made mainly by Carlos Egea and Alicia Sarabia (not me). 
However I think it is better to reference the last one from these 
translators which is already online.

In summary, I would suggest you do these two changes at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS:

1. Eliminate the reference to 'Rafael Romero and Carlos Egea Garc x . (Added 
19 June 1999)...' which is obsolete (and I am not one of the main translators).

2. Include a new reference saying:
Carlos Egea Garc x  <mailto:Carlos.Egea@carm.es> and Alicia Sarabia Sanchez 
<mailto:AliciaM.Sarabia@carm.es> WCAG10 Recommendation may 5 1999.

Best regards, Rafael Romero.
