Hello Alicia, hello Carlos,

Many thanks for your translation of WCAG to Spanish. I have
just had a look at it based on the notice below from Rafael
Romero.

There are a few easy but important changes that I request
to please make as soon as possible:

- Remove the two long icons at the top:
   <img SRC="W3c.gif" ALT="World Wide Web Consortium." height=48 width=307>
   <img SRC="wai.gif" ALT="Web Accessibility Iniciative." height=48 width=283>
   Only very specific pages on the W3C site itself are allowed to use these 
logos.

- If you want to use a W3C icon, please use the small icon:
   <A href="http://www.w3.org/" title="Go to W3C Home Page">
   <IMG height="48" width="72" alt="W3C" 
src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home"></A>
   Please put it at the same place as it was in the original.

- Please move the comments about the translation from the inside
   of the translation to before the horizontal rule, and if possible
   use a border and a different background color. Please also say that
   the normative version of the translation is the English original.

Please make these changes on all your translations.

Many thanks again,    Martin.
