Thank you very much for your translation.  I have added your translation
to <http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations#xhtml-basic>.

One comment: character encoding of your German translation is labeled as
ISO-8859-1 in the Content-Type HTTP header.  In that case, you should add

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

at the beginning of your document.
