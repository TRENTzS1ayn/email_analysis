To the W3C Translators,

This e-mail follows a request for a permission to translate some of the
exemples found in "Curriculum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0".

Included in attachement, is a zipped archive.  The archive contains a
PowerPoint presentation and the translated exemples from the curriculum
by C. Letourneau and G. Freed.  The first two slides of the PowerPoint
presentation contain the required notices for translated material.  The
links to the copyright material are active since the 3 documents
regarding copyrights (W3C Intellectual Property Notice and Legal
Disclaimers, W3C Document Notice and License, W3C Software Notice and
License) were copied to the "Slides" folder in the zipped archive.

The PowerPoint presentation and the translated examples will be used in
live presentations for small groups of people.  At the moment there is
no intention of puting the information on the Web.

I agree to the redistribution terms of the W3C document copyright
notice.

I'm confident that the material now meets all of your copyright
requirements.

Mario Boutin
