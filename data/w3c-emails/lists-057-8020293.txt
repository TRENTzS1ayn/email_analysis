Dear Mr.Martin

Your suggetions make sense and I accept them.

Certainly the permissipn is not explicitly given, even if the
translation has W3C Copyright at foot of the web page and it
was talked about a little at past when "Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0 x jp)" is telled in this mailing list.

Now, W3C Copyright including three items is at top of documents at
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~bd9y-ktu/html4rec_f/IPR-FAQj.html and
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~bd9y-ktu/html4rec_f/COPYDOCj.html.

However, as you point it, these documents is old in version, so
they must be adjusted to the latest version.

I tell it again in this mailing list when the latest translation
is available.  For a while, can I remain them to be old verion ?

Thank you for your suitable suggetions.
