for the french translation, you have the list

w3c-translators-fr@w3.org

By The Way, XML has been translated by the Fran?ois Yergeau group. 
The list of french translations is available at:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/French

XML 1.0  - http://babel.alis.com/web_ml/xml/REC-xml.fr.html
Maybe you are speaking about XML 1.0 Second Edition.

We need translators for the french HTML 4.01 version.
