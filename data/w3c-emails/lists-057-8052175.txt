Hi,

I've completed the translation of the XHTML 1.0 specs to Dutch. The 
reference for a Dutch translation of XHTML 1.0 on the page 
<http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations.html>http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/transla 
tions.html points to a loaction that is no longer being used. I do not know 
what Bart Martens did with his translation.

I suggest that the next two references are added to the page 
<http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations.html>http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/transla 
tions.html
    * http://www.playgarden.com/w3c/TR/xhtml1/overview.html: translated by 
<mailto:andy.camps@playgarden.com>Andy Camps - for the XHTML document, 
original at <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/>http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/
    * http://www.playgarden.com/w3c/TR/xhtml-basic/overview.html translated 
bij <mailto:andy.camps@playgarden.com>Andy Camps - for the XHTML-Basic 
document, original at 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/>http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml<http://www.w3. 
org/TR/xhtml-basic/>-basic/
For the XHTML-basic document I've also translated the comments in the DTD 
at the end of the document. I'd like to publish this translation to. Please 
let me know what to do. The question is: Can we translate the comments in a 
DTD?

I'd also like to make the above translations available in the PDF-format, 
ziped html and the palmtop doc format. The last one by converting it trough 
<http://pilot.screwdriver.net/>http://pilot.screwdriver.net/.
Since it is a request to convert a translation of a spec I'm posting this 
question in this group and not at site-policy@w3.org.

Thanks

Andy Camps
