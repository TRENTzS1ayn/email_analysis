My take would be that as this is part of the document itself,
it is not a problem to translate it assuming that the introduction
says that this has also been done.

But it may be that the DTD is under a different licence than the
rest of the document. Masayasu, Joseph, can you help?

I don't know exactly how it would look in palmtop doc format.
Joseph, can you help?
