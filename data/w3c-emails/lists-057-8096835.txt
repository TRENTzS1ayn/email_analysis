DTD's are a bit of both, but live under the software license. Since the 
intent isn't really to create a new DTD (I'm assuming it will use the same 
identifier/namespace as the English one?), but a translation of an existing 
one with respect to the comments (but not element types) I'd expect it'd be 
good form to follow the translation procedures resulting from the document 
license.

As long as it complies with [1] I have no problems.
