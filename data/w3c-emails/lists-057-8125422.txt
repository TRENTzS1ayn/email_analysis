Hi translators.

I am translating

Intellectual Property FAQ
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html

and have a question about this phrase

What is "the comments email list" ?

Yasutaka Kato translated this sentence as
"You must contact to the authors related to the document"
at
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~bd9y-ktu/html4rec_f/IPR-FAQj.html

Is that OK?
