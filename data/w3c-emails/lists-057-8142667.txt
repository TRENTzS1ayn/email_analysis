In most cases, W3C technical reports include an email address for
comments, errata reports, etc. in the "status of this document"
section.  For example, in the case of DOM Level 1 specification [1],
the status of this document section says:

    Comments on this document should be sent to the public mailing
    list www-dom@w3.org.

So if someone wants to translate DOM Level 1 specification, that
person should sent a notice to w3c-translators@w3.org and
www-dom@w3.org.
