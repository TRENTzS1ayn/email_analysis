For the record, you are welcome to translate <http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/>,
so long as you follow the conditions suggested by Martin.  Although
I'm maintaining that page now, most of the contents were written by
Dave Raggett, the former HTML Activity Lead, so I have contacted Dave
and he is happy to have translation of that page.

If I had extra time, I would have tried to translate that page into
Japanese by myself ...
