Please note that "by language" lists at
<http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/#Language> are not
comprehensive; those are mostly maintained by volunteers in W3C 
Offices or host institutions, e.g. a list of German translations
is maintained by folks at W3C German Office.  We are sorry that
we don't have an Office in Russia (yet).
