If the status of some translations is not up to date,
that's either because the progress has not been reported
or because the report has been lost somehow.

According to the Copyright FAQ, each completed translation
has to be reported to this mailing list. You can easily
check whether that has been done by checking the mailing
list archive. If the translation hasn't been reported,
please try to make sure that it gets reported as soon as
possible.

If it has already been reported, then we apologize
for not having made the update. In that case, just
send a mail to this list with a pointer to the original
mail in the archive, and we will follow up quickly.

As for a page that lists all the Russian translations (or all
the translations in some other language for which we don't
yet have a page), if somebody wants to volunteer to put up
such a page, please contact me personally, so that we can
work on the details.


Regards,    Martin.
