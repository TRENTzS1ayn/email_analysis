Hello W3C!
Hello translators!

I would like to translate the XInclude Working Draft 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xinclude-20001026.

As far as I know, I have to ask for permission to do that and publish 
it.

I translated most of the WD for my own purpose (better 
understanding), so half is finished electronically and about half on 
paper. 

If You allow me to publish it, I would finish the e-version soon.

I will keep it up to date or remove it, as soon as a new version will 
follow.

Regards,
Stefan Schumacher
