Subject:A note about terms in XHTML 1.0 spec

The People!

Has anyone checked the terms in the Terminology
section of W3C's XHTML 1.0 spec?
To my mind the spec contains not the explained terms.
So, is there a need in them? Maybe you have to put the
needed ones into the XHTML 1.1 spec?

Buy,
with best wishes,
Croll.
