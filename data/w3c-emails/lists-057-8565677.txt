Hi translators :)
I am Omoti at Japan.

I need to read and understand and agree to the

W3C Intellectual Property Notice and Legal Disclaimers
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice.html

There is already a Japanese translation of this document by
Yasutaka Kato at
http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~bd9y-ktu/html4rec_f/IPRnotediscl.html

but it is 2 years old.

So I am considering to translate the document into
Japanese language for myself.

Could I have a permission to translate the document?

And Do I have to send this mail to other list or person?

Thanks.

Omoti
