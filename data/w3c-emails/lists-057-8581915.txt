To:w3c-translators@w3.org

Omoti, try mailto:site-policy@w3.org , they could help in this case
(probably you received their e-mail before :).

Similar problem :
I am considering to translate "XML in 10 points" into Czech language.
Could I have a permission to translate the document?
And Do I have to send this mail to other list or person?

Thanks.
