Translators,

Hello, I'm Atsushi Enomoto, in Japan.

Now I've trying to translate some modules of DOM Level 2.
As yet, I've translated "Events", "Views", and
 "Traversal" section of "Traversal and Range" into Japanese,
 and now trying "Range" on.

As yet, I don't have appropriate place to put these translates,
but I'd like to ask to have them open, someday. Would I?

Thank you.
