In http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/#Volunteer I found the 
following:

"For notifying us about starting or completing a translation (required), 
to find other volunteers to help you translate large specifications, or 
to discuss questions you have when translating, we have 
created the w3c-translators@w3.org mailing list..."

Regards,
Fotis
