Martin,

I have requested permission, with the following mail. to
translate "XML in 10 points" in Greek a week ago, but I haven't got an
answer yet.

Following the conversation with Petr Riha to the list for the translation
in Czech of the same document I believe that I should wait for an answer,
since this is not a specification. (Petr got a "herewith granted
permission")

I was very well defined for which documents you need permission
for translation. But it is not clear how you will get the permission
to do the job.

Regards,
Fotis
