Hello,

Many thanks for your translation. Sorry for the delay.
Please send all anouncements to w3c-translators@w3.org,
not to me personally.

Please also clean up the markup in your pages, to remove
the tons of mostly if not completely useless style information
included by MS Word. This will make downloading of the file
much much faster.

Regards,   Martin.
