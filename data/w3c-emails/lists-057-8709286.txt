I agree with your view Martin. By specification, I (at least) mean those 
documents in http://www.w3.org/TR/ . These documents are stable; other 
documents on the site may not be and we might not want to encourage the 
translation of these documents which would lead to dated/erroneous pages 
being common in a foreign language domain.

For XML in 7 points, we should publish it as a TR (technical report) or be 
prepared to consider specific translation policies for it.
