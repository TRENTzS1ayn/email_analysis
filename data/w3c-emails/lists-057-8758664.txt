Hi translators :)
I am Omoti at Japan.

I am considering to translate

Document Notice
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents.html

into Japanese language.

There are already several translations on the net,
but I'd like to have my own version.

Could I have the permission to translate the document?

Regards.
