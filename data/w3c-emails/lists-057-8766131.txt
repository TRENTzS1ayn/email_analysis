Yes, you can get permission, under the same conditions
as you got for another legal document.

By the way, on
http://www.net24.ne.jp/~omoti/w3c/consortium/legal/ipr-notice-20000612_ja.html,
there are very big gaps between paragraphs. Also, you link to the
permission to translate, but that link
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-translators/2001JanMar/0080.html
goes to something else.

And please use a subject in your mail next time :-).

Regards,   Martin.
