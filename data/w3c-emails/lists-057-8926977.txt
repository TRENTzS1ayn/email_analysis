Hello Choi,

Many thanks for your translation!

It took some work, but I found the spec at:
http://www.malbob.com/spec/%bd%ba%c6%e51~7%c0%e5.htm

Please do not use URIs that have characters encoded according
to local conventions. This will not work across the Web, nor
with XML or XLink.

To identify the character encoding of the document, please
do not use "ks_c_5601-1987". According to
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets,
this refers to Nr. 149 in the ISO registry, i.e.
http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/149.pdf, which means
only the two-byte part of "iso-2022-kr" or "euc-kr",
but not the one-byte characters contained in your document.

Therefore, the document also doesn't validate:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.malbob.com%2Fspec%2F%25bd 
%25ba%25c6%25e51%7E7%25c0%25e5.htm

Please use either "iso-2022-kr" or "euc-kr", as appropriate.

Also, if you can work a bit on the style of the document
(ideally, keep the original style), I guess it would be
easier to read.

Thierry - Can you add the translation to the SMIL translation page?

Regards,   Martin.
