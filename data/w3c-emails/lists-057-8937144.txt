Martin,

Should I link tothis URI that have characters encoded ?
http://www.malbob.com/spec/%bd%ba%c6%e51~7%c0%e5.htm

This translation is based on the SMIL 2.0 spec dated
ww.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil20-20000921/

Which is not the current WD now available at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-smil20-20010301/

I think we should translate only REC documents as WD are not stable.

On the  SMIL translation page available at
http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/SMIL/translations
We already link to a Korean translation of (SMIL) 1.0 Recommendation
