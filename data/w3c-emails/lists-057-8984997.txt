Hello W3C!
Hello translators!

I started to translate the PR of XML Base and it should be available 
this week.
I?ll send a notice with the URL, when it?s done and I?ll keep it up to 
date, until it becomes a REC.

...and one more question:
Is there a translation of "Namespaces in XML" available in 
German? 

Thanks for Your answer in advance!
Stefan
