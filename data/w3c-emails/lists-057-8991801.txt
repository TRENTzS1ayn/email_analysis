Hello W3C!
Hello translators!

The Proposed Recommendation of XML Base is available in 
German at:

http://www.schumacher-netz.de/TR/2000/PR-xmlbase-20001220-
de.html

Any comments and suggestions are welcome!

I added a term to encourage people to read the status section 
carefully. 

I update the PR as soon as the status changes.

Happy workin and say welcome to spring. :-)
Stefan
