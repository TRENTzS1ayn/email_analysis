Hello W3C-Webmasters!

The translation of XHTML is available now at:
http://www.schumacher-netz.de/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-
20001219-de.html

Old URL was:
http://www.duckflight.de/TR/xhtml-basic/w3.orgTRxhtml-basic-
de.html

The old URL is still working, but all future translations will be 
placed at schumacher-netz.de, so it would be kind of You to 
change it. (It has a nicer file name anyway. ;-) )

The translation at duckflight.de is modified to link to the new URL.

I?m sorry for the inconvenience, but I haven?t had the time to finish 
the site at schumacher-netz.de sooner. The URL will not change 
again in the next few centuries. (approximately)

Thanks,
Stefan
