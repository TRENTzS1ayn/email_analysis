Hello translators,

I hope I'm not bothering you. I WILL update the XHTML1
spec Overview.html as soon as I have a new dictionary
installed. Is it ok? I just want to make sure the
translation has a few if any errors. I don't want to
let out of my machine some "trans-lations" containing
thousands non-Russian words and errors.

Of course I will do everything Mr. Duerst advises. And
I will make sure the document is valid XHTML1.

By the way, can I insert the following into the spec:
for example "&nbsp;" between XHTML and 1.0, huh? Or
between HTML and 4?

Thank you for your assistance.
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.
