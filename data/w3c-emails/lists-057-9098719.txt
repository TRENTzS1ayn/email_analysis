Hello translators!

Will you please check the following links:
http://W3C.N3.Net
http://Translations.N3.Net
http://TheCroll.Narod.Ru/W3C/index.html

The first two are redirects for the last one. This is
what we have for Russian translations. I hope I put
everything I have found there. Will you make it sure,
Mr. Duerst, please?

Send you comments to this list or to kroll_@yahoo.com.

Thank you.
Best regards,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.
