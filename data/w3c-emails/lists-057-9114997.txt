Hello translators, hello Martin.

I also tried to read this page with my Opera5 and IE4.
There were the same problems. I thought it was my
browsers (see, I have IE2 installed above IE4:-), but
my friend said everything was ok, he was able to read
the page in Russian without any additional changes of
encoding and so on. Now I see it's server's problem. I
don't know how to configure it. Will try to send a
letter to the server's owners.
Here you are some ideas:
1. Move to another free server with UTF-8 support
(where to find?)
2. Create additional pages with different Russian
encodings (cp1251, koi8-r, ibm866, mac, ibm855, pure
unicode charachters, utf-16 and "transliteration"). A
lot of work, but worth doing.

Let me explain about the translators list. It should
be clear for Russian viewers whether translation is
done or is being prepared. The page says: translation
is DONE by Name Surname or translation is being
PREPARED by Name Surname, so the users are able to
understand. Where can I find the difference between
those being translating and those ready to translate
by the way?

I will place an English version there if someone helps
me to translate.

Is it ok I placed the "W3CRussia" logo at the page or
do I have to remove it?

Thank you for cooperation.
Best wishes,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.
