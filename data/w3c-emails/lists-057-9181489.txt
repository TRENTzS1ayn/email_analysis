Hello Choi,

Thanks for the changes! In the future, please send such announcements
directly to w3c-translators@w3.org. Can you please give the document
a real <title>?

Also, please note that you can keep the original W3C style and markup;
this usually looks better than creating a new style. Microsoft also
provides some additions to MSWord in order to remove the unnecessary
and very bulky markup overhead that isn't really HTML.

Regards,    Martin.
