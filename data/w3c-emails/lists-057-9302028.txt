Hello dear Sirs!

Will you give me a permission to translate the following into Russian please:
1. "XML in 10 points" by Bert Bos
2. The entries with Russian names, middlenames and surnames
on various W3C pages containg information on translations
for me to maintain a page with Russian translations of W3C's documents.
3. "Design Guide" by Bert Bos
4. "W3C in 7 points"

Hmmm, or tell me if no permission's needed. Or if you won't let me translate these things.

Thank you.
Best regards,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov (http://Croll.Da.Ru, TheCroll@Yahoo.Com)
