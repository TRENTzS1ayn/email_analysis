I found that this already exists at
http://thecroll.narod.ru/W3C/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points
but this gets served as text/plain, so that many browsers
just show the page source. (please see e.g.
http://www.delorie.com/web/headers.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthecroll.narod.ru%2F 
W3C%2FXML%2F1999%2FXML-in-10-points).
At least it's text/plain;charset=windows-1251, so the
Russian is readable in the source. But please change it
to text/html;charset=windows-1252. Thank you.

http://thecroll.narod.ru/W3C/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points.html
gives a 404 (which takes a long time because of all the
other information on that page). This is okay because there
is no requirement that an HTML page end in .html.
