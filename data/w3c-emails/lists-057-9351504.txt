Hello Alexander,

Sorry for never sending an answer to your message of two weeks ago. I
was on holiday at the time. However, I did make all the corrections
that you suggested. Thanks a lot for taking the time to send them.

Sure, you can translate it. I'll be honoured!

Please, let me know when it is finished, so I can make a link to it.
Or, if you wish, I can put it on our site.
