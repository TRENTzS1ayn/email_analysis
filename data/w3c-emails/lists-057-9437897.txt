It's not really a big problem. But in general, we very much prefer
to receive another request (everybody is buisy, and so sometimes
some mails get overlooked). You don't have to wait for two weeks
for that.

I have looked at the pages. They look quite nice in general.

But the advertisement is really bad, just in general and even
more so because it overlaps with the W3C icon (at least on my
browser). I think there should be a sentence at the top that
tells the reader who provides this nice service, but on the other
hand makes clear that this is not part of W3C. I just haven't
thought up a good wording yet. Joseph, do you have any idea?

The validator icon can be copied, but the W3C icon should be
referenced directly. Please see
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/logo-usage-20000308.

Also, I would add a link from the Russian to the English version
and back. It's very nice to have both versions!

Personally, I would put the finished translations at the top, but
the order is completely up to you.

I think at the bottom is okay. It's a short document.

On the translation itself. This is only for documents not on the TR
page (for which you need an explicit permission). The documents
linked from the TR page contain their own dates, and each dated
document doesn't change.

I do NOT want the source. But my browser insists on displaying the
source, because the HTTP header says text/plain;charset=windows-1251
instead of text/html;charset=windows-1251. So you have to change
the server settings.

I don't know how to do that with your server
(Server: Microsoft-IIS/0.92 (OS/360) ASP/7.315.0284 CJK support)
but I guess that if you change the document name to include .html,
it will work.

Here in Japan, we have been thinking about a good translation for more
than 3 years, and are still not happy :-(. And I have heard similar
things from other languages. I think the basic idea is that W3C is working
on making the Web better, because there are still many things that
can be improved a lot.
