Hello dear Sirs!

Thanks for attending my letters. Let me say a few more words for the topic of the mailing list. (I hope this will not be considered spam.)

>But the advertisement is really bad, just in general and even

I just wanted to say that the service where the pages are stored has been completely FREE and completely ADS FREE for years. I just logged in once and the guys told me there will be the banner. I thought you were joking when I read your letter. I stand for no ads at all. So the pages are now at the new server and you may check'em.
http://Croll.HotBox.Ru/W3C/Consortium/Translation/russian.html for English version
http://Croll.HotBox.Ru/W3C/Consortium/Translation/russian-ru.html for Russian one.

This ads trick was a big mistake and I hope that www.narod.ru will pass away soon. I will pay 20 bucks a months for no ads, heheh.

This is okat now, I hope.

Hmm, check this out, but I hope to add some kind of flags instead of links in the future. What do you think?

I will change XML in 10 points according to what you told me in the nearest future.

Will you tell me your browser and OS brands please? And tell me how (if) XML in 10 points works on the new server, do I still have to add .html?

Thanks for explaining "the full potential".

Best wishes,
Alexander "Croll".
