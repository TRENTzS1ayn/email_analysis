Bonjour,

I am with the Information Management Division of the Treasury Board of
Canada Secretariat.  We develop IM standards and guidelines.  We cite the
document entitled "Date and Time Formats" in one of our guidelines document.
Since we have to issue the guidelines in both French and English, we need a
French version of the "Date and Time Formats" document (or an equivalent).
We have searched for a French translation and found nothing.  We would like
to translate the document following your translation guidelines.  We are
ready to make the French translation available to the Internet community
once it is completed.

We are seeking for your approval.
Thank you, and have a nice day.
MCC
