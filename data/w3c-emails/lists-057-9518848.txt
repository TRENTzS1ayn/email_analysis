Arggghhh

Thank you very much for your translation.

I was in the process of doing it too, too bad coordination, and lost 
time for other works.
http://www.la-grange.net/w3c/REC-CSS1/

So I will point on yours and stop mine. Please when someone is 
starting a translation say it first on the Mailing-List. Second for 
french translation go on w3c-translators-fr@w3.org.

Thank you.
