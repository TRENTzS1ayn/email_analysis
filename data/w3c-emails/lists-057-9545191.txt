Hello.
Our names are   Ho-Kyung Lee and Soon-won Song ,
We are studying XML SCHEMA and are translating the XML SCHEMA SPEC to Korean.

As we are almost finished translating the XML Schema Part 0: Primer, We 
would like to request W3C for a permision for putting this info on our 
website at <http://www.xmlgo.net>http://www.xmlgo<http://www.xmlgo.net>.net

Our final draft can be viewed at
<http://xmlgo.net/temp/xml_schema_spec_part0.htm>http://xmlgo.net/temp/xml_s 
chema_spec_part0.<http://xmlgo.net/temp/xml_schema_spec_part0.htm>htm

If there is anyone in Korea who already requested the permission for Korean 
version of XML Schema Spec, would you be able to send us   the details please?

Thank you in advance.
