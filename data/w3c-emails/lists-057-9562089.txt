Dear Sir,

I worked for Gold Mail Box (HK) Limited, the secretariat of Schools Zone, a
non-profit-making organization serving the schools in Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Macau and Mainland China.

I want to translate your WAI Quicktips Reference Card and to produce a
bilingual version (English/Chinese) for distribution to our teachers who
teach Web authoring.

Currently I am not one of your volunteer translators.  I need detailed
advice on how to proceed.
