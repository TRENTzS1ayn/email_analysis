Hello translators!

I've decided to translate W3C "Date and Time Formats" note.
I have come across some problems.
I need you help.

Here you are:
1. W3C HTML 4.01 spec says there should be no " signs in HTML. They are to be replaces with &quot;. But the note is full of these.
2. The example uses Eastern Standard Time, USA. Do you think I need to change it to meet the needs of the Russian users (for e. g., do I have to change it to Baghdad time (which is Moscow time)?)
3. What is CVS Log? What is CVS?

You may check my translation in progress at http://croll.hotbox.ru/W3C/TR/NOTE-datetime (status is also being translated)
Any ideas/suggestions?
Best regards,
Alexander Savenkov.
