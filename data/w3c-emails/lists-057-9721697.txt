CVS stands for "Concurrent Versions System".

CVS is a version control system. Using it, you can record the history of your source
files. 

For example, bugs sometimes creep in when software is modified, and you might
not detect the bug until a long time after you make the modification. With CVS, you
can easily retrieve old versions to see exactly which change caused the bug. This
can sometimes be a big help.
