Martin,
I reflect on the comment made by Alexander re only accepting subscribers.
The idea of W3C is an open forum concept and restricting only subscribers to
submit translation seems to be absurd. Today's technology provides ways and
means of investigating spam mail and restricting its access. We need to be
open to all new and exciting ideas and innovation, I don't know any mail
list which does not suffer the occasional spam attack!

Hello Alexander,

This is a good idea, and we are already doing that.
The problem is that the two recent spam mails came
in despite this arrangement; we are currently investigating
why this happened and what we can do about it.

Also, please note that people who just want to send
a single mail don't have to subscribe to the list.
Mails from non-subscribers get to me, and I forward
them to the list (if they are not spam, of course).

Regards,   Martin.
