Hello Ahmed,

Please read my mail. I explicitly said that everybody, whether
subscribed or not, can send mail, and it will come to me if they
are not subscribed, and I will forward it to the list. For example,
all mails on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-translators/2001JulSep/
that say (by way of Martin Duerst...) are such cases.

Regards,   Martin.

P.S.: Everybody, please don't send any more mails about this spam problem.
       Thank you.
