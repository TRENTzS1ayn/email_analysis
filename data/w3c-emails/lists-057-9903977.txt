Hello everyone.

That's quite a long letter, so those who are not interested or cannot
help please don't waste time reading it. I invite everyone to check if
the suggested corrections will ever be done.

In this letter:

1. People who volunteered for translation into Russian
2. People whose e-mail addresses are down
3. People who disappeared
4. People who replied
5. Errata for translations page
6. Translations that were not submitted
7. Translations that are not listed at W3C
8. Translations with no permission
9. Starting a translation
10. Russian translations for W3C issues
11. Useful links

1. The page for Russian translations of the W3C docs lists the
following people with their e-mail addresses: Nikolai Chuvakhin,
Aleksey Borisovitch Shcherbakov, Julia Podaniova, Radik Damirovich
Usmanov, Alexey Peshehonov, Irina Kovaleva, Pavel Bogomyakov, Oleg
Kolosov, Alexander Pyramidin, Hans Kort, Vlad Maluk, Alexander
Belopolsky, Roman Kurakin, Anton Ulyanov, Pavel Veretennikov, Nicholay
Gradetskiy, Oleg Tkachenko and Alexander Savenkov.

I have sent e-mails to *all* of the above-mentioned people recently,
saying that I maintain the page for Russian translations and so on. I
explained that the pages at W3C server are obsolete and I need an
update for this information. I also asked if they still want to help
and if there are any translations that are not submitted to
w3c-tranlators@w3.org list. The results of this e-mail poll are
frustrating.

2. The e-mail addresses of the following people are down. That is I
received an error letter immediately after sending my mail. Here you
are: Alexander Belopolsky, Nikolai Chuvakhin, Anton Ulyanov, Hans
Kort, Alexey Borisovitch Sherbakov, Pavel Veretennikov. I may put at
your disposal the mailer daemon's messages for all of these.

3. The two previous sections listed people who exist and who *may*
exist (but changed e-mail addresses). But what happened to those ones
who returned nothing? They are as follows: Alexey Peshehonov (listed on CSS2
translations page), Pavel Bogomyakov (CSS2 translations), Oleg Kolosov
(CSS2 as well), Alexander Pyramidin (I have found his page on the web
and he recently submitted some translations, so this one's alive),
Vlad Maluk (listed on HTML 4.01 translations page), Roman Kurakin
(HTML 4.01 translations) and Oleg Tkachenko (this person has also
submitted a translation recently).

I ask everyone if this people are still needed in the lists? Should
they be removed? Where are the logs of the messages they sent to W3C?
What this people said? Was it a bad joke? I'm not asking why people
don't reply to me. I'm asking if they are to be listed (except two).

4. Nevertheless, some people replied. They are: Radik Damirovich Usmanov,
Julia Podaniova, Irina Kovaleva and Nikolai Gradetskiy.

Radik explained that his e-mail address at CSS2 translations page does not
exist. See section 5 for Radik's mail.

Julia was very angry with my letter, she imagined it was rude
(I must say it wasn't, but all people are different). See sections 5,
6 and 8 for futher details on Julia.

Irina (listed on CSS2 translations) added one more link to point to her partial
translation of CSS2 and said that she's not going to continue the translation because
similar already exist. Furthermore, Irina is not happy with the entry,
representing her translation on CSS2 translations page. See section 5
for this.

Nikolay (HTML 4.01 translations) told me that his surname is totally
incorrect. Section 5 explains this. Nikolay mentioned that he is not interested in
HTML 4.01 anymore, so he's not going to translate it. He said he is
working with XML Shemas now. See also: section 9.

5. Here's errata for various W3C pages that (in my opinion) should be
fixed. Radik Usmanov's new e-mail address is: RUsmanov@luxoft.com . Irina
Smith's another copy of CSS2 translation is at
http://www.kontragent.ru/~ivk/css2/cover.html . Irina said it's
ok to write Irina Kovaleva, but she prefers Irina V Smith, so why not
change this entry to meet her requirements. On the other hande the
entry at W3C HTML 4.01 translations page says that Nikolay is
"Gradetsk", while his real name is Nikolay Gradetskiy. Julia
Podaniova's CSS2 translation is now located at
http://loc.stack.ru/projects/CSS2/cover.html instead of
http://loc.stack.ru/CSS2/cover.html. Alexander Pyramidin's
XHTML Modularization translation is not located at
http://pyramidin.wallst.ru/xhtml-modul/overview.html instead of
http://pyramidin/wallst.ru/public_html/xhtml-modul/overview.html. It became a common practice
to change URIs of the documents without any announcements.

6. As I said Julia Podaniova was quite angry with my e-mail. I hope
that was the reason she (or the company where she works) didn't submit
these translations: apart from HTML 4.01 spec (which she submitted) I
have found HTML 4.0 translation at
http://www.stack.ru/~julia/HTML4/cover.phtml . I don't know the
author, so I put the company's name as the author of the translation.
The company (called Stack - Software Projects Department) also created
XML 1.0 translation which is located at
http://www.stack.ru/~julia/XML/REC-xml-19980210.html . One more
surprise. Julia's name appeared on XHTML translations page, saying
that here XHTML 1.1 translation is in progress. To my knowledge it is
not XHTML 1.1, but the W3C working draft 5 January, 2000. And it's not
in progress - it's finished (see
http://www.stack.ru/~julia/XHTML/xhtml11.phtml for translation).
That's not the end. See section 8 for more.

7. Radik Damirovich Usmanov reported he has translated W3C HTML 3.2
spec into Russian long time ago (1997). He has also said that Dave Raggett
promised to make a link to his work from W3C site. He never did so. Or
did I miss anything? Radik's translation is available at
http://www.online.ru/it/helpdesk/html32.htm .

8. I would like to continue the story of Stack Software Projects
Department here. As far as I know you kneed a special permission to
translate documents other from Tech Reports page. So why there's
nothing for the following: Dave Raggett's Intro to HTML - Basic HTML
(found at http://www.stack.ru/~julia/Guides/Guide.html), Intro to HTML
- Advance HTML (http://www.stack.ru/~julia/Guides/Advanced.html) and
Intro to HTML - Adding A Touch of Style
(http://www.stack.ru/~julia/Guides/Style.html) . All of these are done
by the famous Stack.

9. Nikolay Gradetskiy and Irina V Smith wished to start a new
translation. The reason I write this is to find a group of Russian
people for on-line communicating and translating. I apply for
information to Martin and other W3C members. You have enough
experience with online communicating so why not help us to do the work
we can do *together*. This way we could translate large specs quickly
and efficiently.

10. I've decided to mirror all Russian translations at the page for
Russian translations. Also, I would like to have links to all the original
documents from this page. If anyone has any ideas about that please
write to me.

11. These links would be appropriate for those who are interested in
Russian translations.
1. http://Croll.HotBox.Ru/W3C/Consortium/Translation/russian.html in
English,
http://Croll.HotBox.Ru/W3C/Consortium/Translation/russian-ru.html in
Russian, or http://W3C.N3.Net/ (redirect to the first one)
2. http://loc.stack.ru/ - Stack Software Projects Department
3. http://pyramidin.wallst.ru/ - Alexander Pyramidin's page for his
translations

With best wishes,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.

P. S. If you don't want to flood the list with the messages addressed
to me only please send your mails to TheCroll@Mail.Ru . Thanks.
