Hello everybody,

Just a few comments:

They usually get done. But it may take a few days, and
sometimes some get forgotten. A gentle reminder, e.g.
after a week or two, is appreciated in such a case.

People often change their mail address. It's frustrating,
but it's not surprising.

People are often volunteering for a translation because they
are interested in a specification and they think it's nice
to be a translator. But then some of them find out that it's
actually quite a bit of work. And somehow, sooner or later,
they give up. But it's quite easy to forget to tell anybody
that you gave up, it sounds much less impressive than when
you plan to start.

I think we should take this as a strong compliment to those
who have actually worked hard and finished a translation!

Also, if one (or even more) translations are available,
it may make sense to remove the other volunteers from
the list.

If you really have to change an URI, please announce it to this list.

What kind of information are you looking for?

Well, I think the main points would be:

- Create a list of the important terms and their translations.
- Split up the spec.
- Do the translations.
- Review each other's work.

The equivalent pages with only the finished translations are listed
at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/#Language. W3C provides
lists of translations for some other languages, but we cannot
cover all languages, unfortunately. Thanks to Alexander for maintaining
the pages with the Russian translations.

Note: You still have to annonuce translations to this list
(w3c-translators@w3.org) to conform to the IPR FAQ and because
we keep lists of translations for each specification.


Regards,  Martin.
