About the issue of hosting the translations in stable URLs, I think that
it would be good if  W3C could itself host the pages of those who dont
want to worry about the URL continuity.
It means no more endorsement from W3C than the one it now gives by
making links to the aproved translations.
It wouldnt have a significant impact in terms of space usage either.

 (I apologize if this idea has been already discused  in the list...  )
