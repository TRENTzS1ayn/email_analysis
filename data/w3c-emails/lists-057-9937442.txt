Hello translators,

Who would like to start a new translation into Russian?

In your mail please mention: which specification/document you would
like to translate, how much time are you going to dedicate to it and
your previous experience with translating.

According to what Martin Duerst suggested our translation would go
like this:
- Create a list of the important terms and their translations.
- Split up the spec.
- Do the translations.
- Review each other's work.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
Alexander.
