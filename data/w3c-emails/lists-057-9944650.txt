I am interested in J2EE and UML specifications now. 
But they are not W3C's materials.
I translated HTML 1.0 specification 8 years ago. 
But it was not W3C's material in 1993.
The W3C is huge and all-powerful, but the World is greater.

Sincerely Your
Radik Usmanov

Hello translators,

Who would like to start a new translation into Russian?

In your mail please mention: which specification/document you would
like to translate, how much time are you going to dedicate to it and
your previous experience with translating.

According to what Martin Duerst suggested our translation would go
like this:
- Create a list of the important terms and their translations.
- Split up the spec.
- Do the translations.
- Review each other's work.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
Alexander.
