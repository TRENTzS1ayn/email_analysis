Hello translators,

I'm sorry that I have to write so many letters to you, but that is
needed to ensure a translation's quality.

Two questions about 'W3C in 7 points'. If you can help please write to
thecroll@mail.ru, not to the list.

1.  Flexibility is the necessary companion of distributed systems,
and the life and breath of the Internet, not just the Web.

Sounds a bit strange. Can you suggest any exact
translations/rephrasing please?

2. 'Cooler multimedia'.

Can anyone paraphrase please? We don't have the word 'cool' or 'cooler' in Russian.

I saw a lot of translations of WAI QuickTips. As far as I know they
are not listed on W3C TR page, so will you give me a permission to
translate the tips?

Thanks,
Alex.
