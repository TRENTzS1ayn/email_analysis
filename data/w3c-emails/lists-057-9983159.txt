I have started the translation of the "XML Path Language (XPath)  Version
1.0" Specification:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116
into Spanish.

I intend to include the corrections to the known errors listed in:
http://www.w3.org/1999/11/REC-xpath-19991116-errata
in my translated version.
This inclusion will be stated clearly on the top of the page, so I hope
this wont be considered to be a semantic change to the spec.
