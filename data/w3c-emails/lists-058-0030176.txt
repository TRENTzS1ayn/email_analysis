Hello all!

There is a review version of XML Events online.
Anybody interested is invited to review the translation. Comments and 
suggestions are welcome.

English version:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xml-events-20031014

German translation:
http://www.schumacher-netz.de/TR/2003/REC-xml-events-20031014-de.html

The review period should last until next week. However, the URL above 
is no subject to change.

Feel free to link to the translation as soon as you wish.

Happy working,
Stefan
