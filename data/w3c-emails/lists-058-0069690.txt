Dear Members,

We have translated the "Putting Mathematics on the Web with MathML"
document into Hindi, the national language of India. We would like to
put up the translated document on the W3C website so that it
is available to a larger audience.

The link to the translated document is:
http://people.csa.iisc.ernet.in/gaurav/np/MathMLinHindi.html

The link to the original English version of the document is at:
http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/

We have also written a page that contains our names and the title
of the document in both English and Hindi. This is for your
reference. The URL of this page is:
http://people.csa.iisc.ernet.in/gaurav/np/names.html

Eagerly awaiting a positive response.
Kindly let us know if any changes are required.
