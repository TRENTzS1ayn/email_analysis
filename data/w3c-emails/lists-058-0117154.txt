Respected members,

We, P.Sivaram Prasad and K.Siva Basava, students of Indian Institute of
Science had previously translated the WAI-Quick Tips to our native
language (Telugu).

Now we have translated the WAI home page.

We would like to put this one also on the list of translated pages at
the w3c.

The following is the link for the translated document:

http://people.csa.iisc.ernet.in/siva/wai-initiative-w3c/WAI-Initiative-Telugu.html

Our names in "Telugu" are in the attached file.

Please do the needful.

Thank you.
