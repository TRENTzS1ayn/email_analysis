Hi, I have already the Curriculum to WCAG 1.0 tranlated to Portuguese, but
before to put in on-line, I'd like to make some adjustments in the
Portuguese.

Seems me that this content was made using the SlideMaker or other similar
tool. I'd like to know if the Consortium have a linear version before pass
it through slidemaker. Maybe is more easier for me to clean the English. If
so, please send me the URI where I could made a download.

Thanks,
Jorge Fernandes
