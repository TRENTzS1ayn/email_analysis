Thanks so much, again, for your help with this.
We are still missing translations in French, Dutch, German and Japanese 
(volunteers welcome!) but we'll put the new interface with all the 
translations as soon as we can.

I just noticed (a bit late, sorry) that the translations you submitted 
have somehow mangled the markup. Maybe the tool you used does not 
support XHTML? It seems to have transformed everything into HTML4 while 
keeping the XHTML Strict doctype... Nothing that can't be fixed, 
hopefully, but unfortunate.

As a general note to all translators, try to be careful when 
translating a document to not modify its markup, just the content!

Thank you.
