Why do you translate W3C's recommendations?

I think many people in the world doing the same thing--translating and
preaching W3C's recommendations--with me.

I am very curious what kinds of motivation make so many people do this kind
of job?

Can you share with me why you translate them and how you do it? Team or
along? And what is the url.

Thanks!

Sincere
