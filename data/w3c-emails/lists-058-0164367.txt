Hi Olivier,
Nice to hear from you (smile).

Yes, I know it. And I'm deeply sorry for it. : (

I have to check why this conversion occurs. The tool I use is really helpful for
translations.

I think I corrected one or two files before delivery. Please let me know if I
can help you.
All the best,
Marta
