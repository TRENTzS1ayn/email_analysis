Don't be sorry. Your translation is very good and very welcome, and it 
is only unfortunate that your tool had some issues with the XHTML 
Markup. I suspect it has been developed for HTML4 only, and does 
support the XHTML markup used for the interface you helped translate. 
It could be a good idea to contact the developers of this tool and ask 
them whether they support XHTML.

in any case, you are not to blame for this minor problem, and I 
apologize if my original message somehow implied that. I am, on the 
contrary, very grateful for your help, and the markup changes caused by 
this tool should not be a big trouble.

Actually, I am curious which tool that is... Maybe others on this forum 
use it as well, and could exchange experience on how to use it with 
XHTML Markup?

If you find out that your tool supports XHTML and thus can painlessly 
convert the files you sent me to XHTML, that would be welcome. 
Otherwise, please do not worry anymore about this, I should be able to 
fix the markup easily.

Once again, thank you very much for your help.
