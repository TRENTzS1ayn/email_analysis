Sir,  
According  "#5.6 Can I translate one of your specifications into another language?" at 
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate  I'd like inform that  I've completed the translation to brazilian portuguese,  for the Basic and Advanced Tutorials located at W3CSchool and I've published it at http://www.maujor.com/tutorial/introtut.shtml
Thanks.
 Maur?cio Samy Silva
