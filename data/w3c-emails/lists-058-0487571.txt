Hi!

This is to inform you all that I just completed a translation into 
Italian of the ATAG 1.0.
It is available at: http://www.cblue.org/traduzioni/atagit1.html

Please list it in the W3C translations page. If there's a different 
procedure to get translations published, let me know - I went through 
the materials on how to contribute to W3C but could not find a precise 
description of the steps to take once the translation is ready.


Roberto:
Hi Francesca, just done it some weeks ago :(
