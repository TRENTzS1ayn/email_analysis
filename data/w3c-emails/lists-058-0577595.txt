This is really alarming! I am under the impression, correct me if I am
wrong, that the W3:
 develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software,
and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential and not for spam mail
advocating a get rich schemes!!!!!!!! It is not a forum for Tesco bashing
lies and false allegations.

> Hi,
> First I like to introduce myself and let you know why I'm contacting you.
My name is LEO and I received your name as someone who is looking for a
real, INTERNET BASED business that you can work from your home, WITHOUT ANY
RISK! OUR PROGRAM IS LITERALLY NOTHING TO START! Thank you for your
interest.

> Your e-mail address has been provided to me through one of the following
methods:
> You submitted a classified ad or link to one of my pages or you were sent
to me by one of several "lead-generating" organizations as a result of
having filled out their "request for information" form.
> Through a series of these messages you will learn everything you need to
know about us, our company, and best of all how you can launch your own
online business.
>
> Of course you can contact me at any time.
>
> Over the next few weeks I will be providing you with information that will
allow you to make hundreds (even thousands) of dollars, weekly! If, at any
time you'd like to be removed from my mail list, simply remove yourself with
the link provided at the bottom of the mailing.

> Our company, Freestore Club - Prepaid Living, is a division of a 5 year
old, stable, extremely well managed corporation named LightHouse America.
The company is not only solid and stable but also has tremendous integrity.
ALL checks are always paid on time and the company owner and management are
down to earth, caring entrepreneurs just like you and me!
>
> Now, what we are not is.... ANOTHER TYPICAL DEAL, our business model is
EMM, Exact Method Marketing! You will learn how to build a business from
home without having to do any selling, recruiting and product distribution.
Most of us can't sell and the company knows that. They also know that
RECRUITING IS SELLING, and that's why most people fail in NETWORK MARKETING.
>
> Over the next few days, in a series of emails, you will learn the what,
why and how of EMM Vs NM. If you don't want to wait then visit my website
(you'll get your own...FOR FREE!) and you're welcome to browse. In fact,
enroll IT'S ZERO TO JOIN! But, be careful, you just might find yourself
experiencing the thrill of your life...WE ARE HOT, because WE MAKE SENSE!
