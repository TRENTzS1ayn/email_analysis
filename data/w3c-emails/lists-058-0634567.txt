File now is translated, see the German version attached. Since it has to be
used in the same location as the original document, I ask to copy it there.
-- Note: There are some terms I perceive as to be kept 'as is', so don't worry
if some specific terms haven't been translated.

An alternative (and temporary!) location for this file is 

    http://iokaste.erde3.net/var/WCAG1-Conformance.html.de

I'll now also start to translate the following documents, but since I'm not
that fast as Roberto, it will last some days again ;)

All the best, and merry christmas,
