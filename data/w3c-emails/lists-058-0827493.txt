NineSigma Funding Opportunity:
Development of Test Method for Paint and Solvent Odor

Funding Organization: General Motors Corporation 

Project Objective: NineSigma, representing General Motors Corporation is seeking proposals (technical and cost) for development of new test methods and instrumentation for rapid, repeatable assessment of the odor characteristics of paint materials and solvents.
