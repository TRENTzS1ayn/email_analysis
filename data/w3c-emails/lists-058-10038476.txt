CMcCN:: "Priority 1 for standards and conventions which are essential to
accessibility, priority 2 for those that are important to accessibility,
and priority 3 for those that are beneficial to accessibility. (See the
definitions of priority)"

WL: This presumably leaves the decision as to "essential, important, and
beneficial" up to the author.  That's fine with me since if somebody is
going through all these hoops to achieve conformance she will be
meticulously careful to be objective in this matter.  I vote "aye" for
the reword.
