I agree we need to take a "look at the forest".

One of the parts of the forest [seems larger than a single tree] is the two
major tasks you mention:

>1. resolving the user interface access issue:

I believe this is a larger [larger than even WAI] issue
that affects other guideline groups such as UA and tools and should be
dealt with at a more general level.  I agree with Jon when he said:
"use of plateform specific accessibility APIs and the techniques document
provides information related resources.  I think that trying to develop
specific guidelines that work across all plateforms is beyond the resources
and the scope of the working group.  I think you also run the risk of
diluting the message of including features that make web content more
accessible." Many of the guidelines for including features that help make
the content more accessible include inferences to making the user interface
accessible as well so we won't necessarily run the risk of missing the
importance of making the interface accessible.

>2. Techniques

I agree we need to make them as complete as possible.  In fact, I believe if
we can't provide a convincing technique with even a vendor or two implementing
some variation of the technique we don't have a valid checkpoint.  As I help
make Web pages more accessible, the Webmasters keep asking "Now, how do I do
that?" and there isn't always a good answer.

I agree that by fleshing out the techniques we can point out weaknesses in
wording and intent and have some real data on implementations to quibbling over.
