FYI - Product Managers are usually marketing folks.  While they may have
some input into the design of a product, they rarely have the ability to
make commitments.  I notice that a bunch of folks listed are marketers and
such and that's fine - a good foot in the door.  Just take what they say
with a grain of salt <smile>

It's my opinion that if the AU group wants to be effective, they should look
at the market share for HTML generators, pick the top 3 and get buy off from
the decision makers.  Otherwise it's a academic exercise.
