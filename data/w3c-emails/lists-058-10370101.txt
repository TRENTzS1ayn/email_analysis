That is 12noon on the West Coast of the States.  While I personally do not
have much trouble with that, I do often have lunch appointments at that
time.

We have been trying to find a regular AU conference call time that is
generally convenient and doesn't conflict with other WAI group call times.

The proposal is to hold a one and a half hour call every 2nd week on
Tuesday at 3:00pm Boston time beginning January 12. How is this time for
everyone?
