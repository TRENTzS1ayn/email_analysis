What is "accessible markup"?

It needs to be spelled out.  For example, is <ABBR> accessible markup?  A
list of immutable tags and attributes should be provided.

The Guideline 4.4 - Ensure that conversion tools produce and retain
accessible markup and content

is essentially restating techniques from other guidelines. If we beefed up
the current technique 4.1.1 to mention conversion tools as a specific
example, then the declaration of scope which is currently in the
Introduction makes it clear that the guidelines apply to such tools.

(Conversion tools allow the user to save a file as HTML although that is
not the usual format of their input files. This covers both desktop
publishing packages which can save as HTML, and translation tools which
convert between formats, such as PDF to HTML conversion tools)
