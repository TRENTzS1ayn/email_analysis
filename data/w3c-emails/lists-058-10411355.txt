Currently the definition is 'as specified in the Page Author Guidelines'.
(section something or other)

I think that is correct in spirit. Although PAGL is still a WD it has
become fairly stable, and will almost certainly be a recommendation by the
time we settle this document.

As a proposal, I suggest we make the follwing definition:

Accessible markup
Markup which conforms to the W3C Page Author Guidelines [ref]

  What is "accessible markup"?
  
  It needs to be spelled out.  For example, is <ABBR> accessible markup?  A
  list of immutable tags and attributes should be provided.
