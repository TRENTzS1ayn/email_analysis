WL:: "Have the CAST people been brought to bear..."

BK: "Can you clarify what you mean by this statement?"

I hope so.  Since Bobby is often proposed as a "validator" to be used by
authors, and by inference by their tools, it might be significant to
know if the folks at CAST have, e.g., studied any relationship between
the tools used to author web sites (which is often contained in the
document) and the resulting accessibility, and if so what they've
learned and if they have communicated this to the authoring tool makers?
