Those URLs are a press release - not a specification for what tags and
attributes need to be preserved.

The original question was :

<<
The Guideline 4.4 - Ensure that conversion tools produce and retain
accessible markup and content
>>

What is accessible markup?  How does it differ from inaccessible markup?
Maybe this is semantics, but 4.4 is vague.

Are you trying to say that an Authoring Tool should not strip ALT attributes
when converting web sites?  Then say that.

Are you trying to say that an Authoring Tool should use <LABEL> tags for
form controls?  Okay, then say that.

See my point?

Or a link to the accessibility features of HTML 4.0 and CSS-2 which is here:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/HTML4-access
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/CSS2-access

Although no one's fully implemented HTML 4.0 nor any of CSS-2.
