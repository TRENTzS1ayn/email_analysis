I agree entirely and like I said, it's a good start.

It's also my experience that marketers are quick to make commitments and
proclamations, but do not actually have the authority to effect the product
in a way they suggest.

I've often found that putting pressure on the product managers often has a
trickle effect. It can go all the way up to top management. Often times the
engineers and programers want to implement features such as full HTML 4.0
or CSS-1 compliance but management tends to not care so much about features
as getting the product out on-schedule. That's where users come in....if
the customer-base applies the right pressure, things can change.
