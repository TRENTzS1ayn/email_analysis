Regarding the new draft, could everyone please post your comments to the
list before next Tuesday. In general if we could adhere to a one week
turn-around for comments we can keep to the schedule we have set out for
ourselves. The document will then go out to the interest group for review
and then become a new public working draft (following revisions of course).

Thanks Jutta
