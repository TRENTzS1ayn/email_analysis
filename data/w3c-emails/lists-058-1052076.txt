To whom concerned:

I've translated XML 1.1 Recommendation at

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/

into Japanese. I did it on xml file with downloadable xsl and dtd file
from the site with some modification under w3c software licensing.

I will put it on my web site at

http://www.junkscripts.com/w3c/xml11/

It is still in the first draft, and will be proof-read, but
it is good time to inform here,

best regards,

Hidetaka Shimizu
