I think in this restructuring we inappropriately catagorized guidelines
that refer to either:

1. making the authoring tool interface accessible to authors with disabilities

or
2. Making sure that the authoring tool produces accessible web sites.


2.8 refers to guidelines to make the tool accessible for authors with
disabilities not to making the site accessible and is in the wrong place

3.1 and 3.2 do not refer to accomodating authors with disabilities, but to
encouraging all authors to use the access prompting and support in the tool
and therefore belong in section 4.

I agree with Daniel that we can probably merge a number of guidelines.
