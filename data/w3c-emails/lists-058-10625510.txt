I have updated the meeting agenda at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-12jan99.html so it is very specific about
document revisions - basically I have culled from the list everything I
could find that was a proposal to change the document in a specific way.

If this is a good format for the agenda say so, and I will continue to do
it. It took a while to do it retrospectively, but could be done at a
reasonable speed through the lead up time.

Charles
