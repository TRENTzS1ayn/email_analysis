Disagree.  The user should have the right to turn off the "valid
HTML only" checker.  Why?  Because there are some well meaning
authoring tools out there that will happily remove "invalid" HTML
such as LONGDESC, ABBR, etc, in the name of validity.  Of course,
these tools were made when only HTML 3.2 existed.

I agree 100% with Daniel here.

Why not?  Isn't that what DTDs are for?  (And doesn't the W3C
offer multiple versions of their style sheet depending on what
browser is autosensed?)

Plus, XML _will_ produce something close to "multiple varieties
of markup".  Insisting that there is only one true HTML may be a
good rhetorical stand to take, but the authoring tool makers AND
the front-line designers have to live in the real world, and they
should be able to produce whatever is fitting for their circumstances.

I believe accessible code should be the _default_, however, and you
have to go out of your way in order to deliberately turn stuff OFF.

www.hwg.org is the same way :) -- decently accessible with lynx,
but aie, information overload.

By the way, hi to everyone who doesn't know me.  My name is Kynn
Bartlett and I'm the President of the HTML Writers Guild.
