It is partially addressed in the scope of the document - see section 1.1
'this document applies to (everything that makes web content)'.

It is also discussed (well, mentioned) in the issues document under 'scope
of guidelines'

  It occurs to me that we should consider talking to the authors of
  various packages for programming languages, that generate HTML
  as part of a CGI library.
  
  For example, CGI.pm for Perl lets a programmer create scripts that
  generate HTML, using perl routines.  E.g.:
  
       hr;
  
  This produces an <HR> tag.  There is the potential to generate non-
  accessible HTML as the "raw markup" is hidden from the programmer;
  likewise, there's potential here to increase accessibility on a
  number of sites that use these standard libraries, if we can get
  accessibility considerations included in future releases of the
  code.
  
  This sounds like an authoring tool issue -- I'm a newbie, have we
  addressed this before?
