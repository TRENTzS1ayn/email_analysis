Maybe we should add something allowing for Authoring Tools to have
different levels of "checks." In the preferences, a user says they only
want to program in HTML 3.2, (default being 4.0), and as they program, they
are told when something is NOT accessible according to HTML 3.2...

going to snore away. They don't care about many of these issues because
quite a lot of them are running 386/486 machines with Nescape 2.0.
