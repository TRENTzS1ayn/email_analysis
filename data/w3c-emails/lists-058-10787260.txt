Hi folks,

I've read your WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines draft and I agree globally with 
it.
After a second read I have some minor remarks:
  
  - Section and subsection titles are clear for me, but sometimes paragraphs
    contents are too general to be very useful for an authoring tool developer
  
  - I like the section Sample Implementation. Why you don't integrate its
    content as examples or suggestions in previous sections and sub-sections?
  
  - Clearly solutions should be different for HTML filters (Word2HTML) and 
HTML
  editors. Why you don't suggest different solutions.
  
Regards
     Irene
