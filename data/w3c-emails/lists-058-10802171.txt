It means that if cannot understand the language, you cannot present it
to the user.

To take a concrete and relevant example.

Supposed I define an XML DTD: DDML, with the following element 
  <DDCHOSE alaplace="http://www.some.org/text" bits="some.bits">

What are you doing to do with it as a UA developer ?

Nothing til you know it's a multimedia piece, with bits being the
animation bits and alaplace being the textual equivalent.

It is accessible markup in itself, since I provide a way to hook an
accessible version of my multimedia piece, but since its semantics is
not defined in any published spec, it's only accessible to those who
use my reader for instance.

Interoperability means it has a published specification that allows
one to write a reader independently of the authoring
process. Accessibility means this reader can serve any media.
