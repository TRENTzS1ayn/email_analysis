Dear Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group Member:

The revised charter for the WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group
(AUWG) has been sent to the W3C Advisory Committee for review. The new
charter is provisionally in effect until February 10 at which point it
becomes final unless comments are received from AC members. It is now
linked from the AU home page at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU>.

W3C has re-opened the Call for Participation for the AUWG. It is
particularly valuable to have authoring tool manufacturers (including HTML
editors, conversion tools, site management tools etc.) participating
directly in the group, and WAI encourages their participation. 

All previous AUWG members who intend to participate actively in the AUWG
must re-apply for AUWG by reading the charter at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter-19990109>; agree to the terms of
participation; fill out the Call for Participation at the end of the
charter; and sending it to <wai-au-call@w3.org>. W3C non-Members must
indicate their area of technical expertise. After one month, inactive
participants will be removed from the mailing list but will still be able
to follow the discussion through the public mail archive.

Please note also that there is a face-to-face meeting of the AUWG scheduled
for March 1 and 2, hosted by Lotus Development Corporation, in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA. All active members of the Working Group are encouraged
to attend. Information on the meeting is available on the W3C Events
Calendar <http://www.w3.org/Member/Eventscal> and pre-registration is
required by Friday, February 19.

If you would like further information about the working group or the
meeting, please contact the Chair, Jutta Treviranus
<jutta.treviranus@utoronto.ca>, or the W3C staff contact for AUWG, Charles
McCathieNevile <charles@w3.org>.

Thank you,

Judy Brewer
