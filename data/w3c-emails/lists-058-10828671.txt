We need to get a revised copy of the working draft to the IG group for
review so that we can publish a new public working draft on schedule. The
following is a draft in which we have attempted to make the changes that
were agreed upon by the group.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-WAI-AUTOOLS-19990112

The most glaring ommissions are that we have not yet been able to draft a
merger of the four guidelines as discussed in the conference call and that
we have not divided checkpoints into techniques and checkpoints. With those
provisos, do people agree that the document reflects the present consensus
of the group? This doesn't mean that you are personally happy with the
document, but that no changes have been made without the agreement of the
group.

Please respond by 5pm Thursday.

Thanks Jutta
