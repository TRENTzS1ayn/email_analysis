This would need to be clothed in mre general terms, but is a technique
that could be helpful for some tools. (Insert Charles' standard Booby
caveat here - email for details)

>Subject: Integrating services like Bobby into your browser

>One of the problems with using accessibility services such as Bobby (or
>similar web-based HTML validators) is the hassle of having to enter Bobby's
>URL, or go to your bookmark, having first copied the page you want to check,
>and then paste it into the URL box.
>
>Something we've been looking at recently is integrating web-based services
>more closely with web browsers.  This can be done in Netscape by dragging
>links to Netscape's personal tool bar.  Rather than just add a static link,
>you can add a link to the underlying CGI script, and tell the script to
>process the current document.  So that when you're viewing a page, you can
>click on the link in the toolbar and a new window will be created with the
>output from the Bobby analysis.
>
>Examples are given at the URL:
><http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/accessibility/bobby/interface.html>
>
>There are a number of issues to be considered for this type of interface.
>The main one is probably change control, if the underlying CGI program
>changes.  Also there needs to be comprehensive documentation on the
>allowable options.
>
>I'd be interested in comments on this suggestion.
>
>Would it be useful for CAST to host a page from which the links could be
>copied?
