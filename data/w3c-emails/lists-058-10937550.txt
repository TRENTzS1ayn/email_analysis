Hi Daniel
    Thanks for the message.
     On one level I agree with everything you say (i.e. there's a need for
an architecturally coherent metadata framework ).  On the other hand we
sometimes need to be pragmatic.
    Let me give you an example.  One could have a personalised web site in
which access by people with disabilities came through a Betsie-type proxy,
which could strip out confusing information such as file size.   On the
other hand file size metadata could be provided to those who need it.  The
process is not easily reversible.  (Systems designers are likely to come up
with more sophisticated "magic.")
   I would argue that the Page Author guidelines should be pragmatic.  They
can be updated to recommend storing such metadata in RDF - when the RDF
schemas are defined and supporting tools available (which could well be
several years away).
     My concrete suggestion is that:

2.5.8: [Priority 1]
The authoring tool must never insert rule-generated description  text into
the document (default "alt"-text) or a properties field  (place-holder
"alt"-text).

should say:

 "The authoring tool should normally not insert rule-generated description"

and then explain why, but allow software vendors the options to allow
automated ALT generation.

I think this should be an educational issue rather than a WAI rule (I
suspect that customers of authoring tools may pester software vendors for
this facility).

What do the software vendors think?
