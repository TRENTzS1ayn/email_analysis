I'm inclined to agree but one of the problems I am dealing with regarding
MS FrontPage's implementation of ALT attributes and the Mozilla group's
implementation of various HTML elements and attributes in the new layout
engine for NN 5.0 is that without some sort of SUGGESTION or guidance
regarding the optimal way to implement this will lead the project team to
pick some random means to display an element. This can lead to serious
problems when the product is released all because that contact between
recommendation editor and product manager has not been made.

I also suggested a "warning" box pop up if a user uses a "blank" ALT attribute:

say "Are you

What are your thoughts on that?
