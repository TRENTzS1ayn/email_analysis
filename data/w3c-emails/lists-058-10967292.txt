Hi,

I'm not sure about presenting three different options to users who may
lack previous exposure to accessibility issues. i.e. In this case option
1 looks to be the easiest. As far as the guidelines go, this idea is
very low level. I think the guidelines should stick to higher level
directives and let the tool-makers deal with how to implement them.
