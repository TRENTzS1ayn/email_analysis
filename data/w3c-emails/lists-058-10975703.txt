I started a thread on GL related to promoting the use of ALT = "" and
I want to mirror it here, since AU needs to do something as well.

Namely, in the ALT dialog, there should be a way to say that you want
ALT = "", different than the way one leave the attribute unset.

Like:
  
    Function of the image: [                      ]
    [] click here if the image is purely decorative

and if you don't enter text, ALT="text" is generated, if you select
the toggle, ALT="" is generated, and if you don't enter text and do
not select the toggle, then no ALT= is generated (which makes it
invalid HTML).
