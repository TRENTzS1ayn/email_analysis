Amaya is a w3c testbed editor. It is freely available under W3C copyright
(which is like GPL, but there are important differences to note if you are
planning to do stuff with it - see the W3C copyright statement).

The Amaya team have started to include accessibility features in it, and I
have drafted some stuff for help files. If you are interested in playing
around with it (or providing code for something really cool like a
complete OBJECT registry with descrptive text) you might like to have a
look at http://www.w3.org/Amaya

Cheers

Charles
