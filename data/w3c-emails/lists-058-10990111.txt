To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


In a quick skim of the current document it seems that section 4 is a bit
thin, and that the important points of the User Agent Guidelines are
'hidden' in introductory text, rather than Guidelines.

I therefore propose that we add guidelines dealing with features which
make a tool accessible:

Ensure the configurability of the tool (part of this is covered in 4.1
and 4.2, but I feel that the principle should have a guideline status)

Provide interfaces for Assistive Technology. This mirrors the discussion
in the User Agent group. Currently the suggestion they are working on is a
requirement to implement the Document Object Model and provide an
interface to it, but I hope they will come to some agreement which we can
more-or-less adopt.

Thoughts?

Charles
