Dear all,

Notes about 4 housekeeping matters. Please take the time to read them.

1. Call for Participation.

Several of the returns have come back with bits which are
ioncomplete/missing.

At the bottom of the charter[1] is the form to be returned, which includes
the following statement:

   To the best of my knowledge, I believe my organization has the
following/does not have any IPR claims regarding guidelines for the
accessibility of authoring tools.

You need to delete the bits which do not apply, and if applicable
enumerate claims. This is one of the W3C standard requirements for working
group participants.

If you have not yet replied, please do so.

2. How an agenda is created

I take anything that seems like a definite proposal that comes to the
email list, and put it in the agenda. Currently proposals are listed by an
order of priority which runs:

 general structure, guidelines, checkpoints, priorities, techniques

If something is an idea not a proposal I will make a judgement call. All
hints will be accepted. Jutta, as chair, is of course the final arbiter.

The agenda will be created as soon as we can set a meeting. It will be
updated until the day before the meeting.

3. Meetings, mailing list and archives

If you are unable to attend a meeting, please send regrets to the list, so
they appear in the archives. This is particularly important if there is an
itme on the agenda about which you have something you absolutely must say,
and cannot make the meeting.

If you are unable to make a meeting, the normal W3C procedure is to
nominate a regular alternate. This obviously works better for a member
representative than an invited expert.

The minutes of the meetings are placed on the AU page[2] along with all
other important information.

Mailing lists are the usual method of day-to-day communication. Please
ensure that the subjectheadings match the content, and please read the
archives[3] if you have missed reading the list.

4. Face to Face meeting

The registration deadlines are approaching - if you intend to come, please
register[4]
