I suggest that we:

reduce the priority of chekcpoint 4.1.1 'Provide multiple views' to 2 or 3
- it is not, in itself, critical for accessibility.

Add a guidelines 4.3 (when the old 4.3 is merged into 4.2 - see last
teleconference / changes list) as follows

 Provide an interoperable interface to the Document Object.

This is important in enabling different devices to provide optimal
rendering.

Checkpoint:
Provide device-independent access to all functions of the Authoring tool
[Priority 1]

techniques
in most cases this can be accomplished by providing keyboard access, since
on most platforms other devices can mimic the keyboard.
