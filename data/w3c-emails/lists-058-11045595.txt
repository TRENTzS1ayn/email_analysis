What do you mean by two numbering systems?

The PAGL and UAGL have different tables of contents in
the two documents. One reason for this is to give users two
views of the information (e.g. for the UAGL: a "user" view,
namely, user needs, and a "developer" view, namely interfaces
the developer should be aware of). Two tables of contents
means that section 4 in one document will be talking about
something else than section 4 in the other. This was a conscious
decision.

It was also a conscious decision to define (and number)
the checkpoints in the guidelines document and use 
the same numbers to refer to them in the techniques document. 
I can see this causing some confusion, but the checkpoints
are not redefined in the techniques document, only 
referenced.

Please accept this as background information for this
dicussion,
