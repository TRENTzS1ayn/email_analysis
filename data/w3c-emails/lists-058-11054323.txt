Checkpoint 3.2.5, dealing with Accessibility help, requires a link to
validation services.

I suggest that the use of validation should be a checkpoint within 2.1
"generate standard markup", and that the use of bobby-style accessibility
evaluation is largely covered already. However it is probably a good idea
to point to available tools in the techniques document.
