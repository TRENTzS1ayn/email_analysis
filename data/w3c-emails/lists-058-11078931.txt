I have though about it a bit more. What I find confusing is that there are
two numbering systems which use the same conventions, but technique 4.3.2
does not refer to checkpoint 4.3.2.

I undeerstand the reasoning behnd the different ordering of things in the
techniques document. It might be more intuitively obvious what was going
on if the numbering system were boviously different - eg checkpoint 4.3.2
referred to techniques E.f(b) and B.f(e) or something.

(Of course it is possible this is a foolish idea.)

  What do you mean by two numbering systems?
  
  The PAGL and UAGL have different tables of contents in
  the two documents. One reason for this is to give users two
  views of the information (e.g. for the UAGL: a "user" view,
  namely, user needs, and a "developer" view, namely interfaces
  the developer should be aware of). Two tables of contents
  means that section 4 in one document will be talking about
  something else than section 4 in the other. This was a conscious
  decision.
  
  It was also a conscious decision to define (and number)
  the checkpoints in the guidelines document and use 
  the same numbers to refer to them in the techniques document. 
  I can see this causing some confusion, but the checkpoints
  are not redefined in the techniques document, only 
  referenced.
  
  Please accept this as background information for this
  dicussion,
