Sorry for the header on the last message.

Our next conference call is tomorrow on Tuesday February  9 at 3:00 pm
Boston time. The number to call is: + (617) 252 1038

The agenda can be found at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-9feb99.html

Please email me if you are unable to make the meeting.

We are trying to find another time to hold our regular meetings.
Suggestions received so far are:

>From Chuck Opperman:

"I have the following regularly scheduled meetings (Pacific Time) and would
not be able:

Mondays
10am - 1pm

Tuesdays
11am - 1pm
2pm - 3pm

Wednesday
9am - 10am

Thursday
3pm - 4pm

Friday
10am - 12noon

However, I also have many meetings that get scheduled during the week that
might prevent me from attending some occasionally.  I would suggest that a
9am to 10am (PT) on Tuesday mornings might be best for me, and accommodate
the many East Coast time zone folks as well."

>From Jan:

"It's ok withh me but I could also go later (4-5pm or 5-6pm)."

and on behalf of possible participants from Sausage in Australia anytime
before 3pm EST would be the middle of the night.

Are there any other requests, suggestions? Are later or earlier times prefered?


Thanks Jutta
