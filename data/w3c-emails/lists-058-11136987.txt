I agree, and would add (4)where quality control is important it can be a
pretty foolish thing to do. But what I was really thinking of wass those
tools which are in fact publicly available as pieces of software, and as
models for a module which could be included in an authoring tool.

It would seem sensible to add the points you raise to a discussion of
these tools in a Techniques document.

  I agree that they should be mentionned, but tools should not rely on
  outside checkers to perform checks, since (1) these may become too busy
  if a large commercial product started linking users, (2) it won't help
  offline and (3) they are not integrated with correction.
