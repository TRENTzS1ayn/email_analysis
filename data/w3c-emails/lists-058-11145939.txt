In many areas I think we can either refer to the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines, or copy the relevant sections. As far as I can see the biggest
determinant there is size.

The specific cases that Jutta has come up with need of course to be
covered within the Authoring Tool Guidelines

  Regarding Section 4:
  
  We need to identify all of the access guidelines that are unique to
  authoring tools and would not be covered in the other two types of sources
  we listed in the introduction to section 4.
  
  In earlier discussions the following unique considerations were identified:
  - the existence of graphic elements or artifacts, such as graphic
  representations of start and end tags in the document, or web pages
  represented by icons in web site managers (e.g., Hyperbolic views). These
  would not be covered by standard interface conventions.
  - recognition that the author may need a different view to edit the web
  content than they wish it to be ultimately displayed. This implies display
  preferences that do not manifest themselves in the ultimate markup or style
  declarations
  - there are strategies that would make it easier to navigate and manipulate
  a marked up document that are distinct from navigation strategies in a
  browser and text manipulation strategies in a word processor
  - authoring tools make frequent use of third party DLLs, Beans or other
  modules that are bundled and linked into the main authoring product.
  Although the main interface may be accessible these are frequently not.
  - authoring tools also make frequent use of non standard pallets and
  dialogue boxes which are covered in some of the other guidelines but might
  warrant specific mention in these guidelines.
  
  Are there any areas missed in the above list? Are there any we should leave
  out?
