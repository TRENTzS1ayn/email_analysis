There has been a fairly exhaustive (exhausting?) process which has
resulted in name changes to the three guidelines.

Authoring Tools' official name becomes

     'Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines'

which I don't think makes a lot of difference to us (smile). User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines is pretty self-evident, but the Page Authoring
Guidelines are going to be known as 

    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

This means there will be a number of minor changes - references in
the guidelines, website etc over the next little while.
