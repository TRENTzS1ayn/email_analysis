As we are planing to produce a new Public Working Draft for the by 1
March, and therefore to submit the next draft to the Interest Group for
review over the next week, I think it would be a good idea if we can hold
a teleconference to discuss any revisions they (and we) have proposed,
early in the week before the meeting.

My personal suggestions are (in order of preference)

Monday 22 Feb - 4 pm
Wednesday 24 Feb After 2pm
Tuesday 23 Feb - 4 pm (one hour later than our current time)

None of these are in conflict with the times people have indicated they
are unavailable.

Does anybody want to make another bid, or support one of these times?

Charles
