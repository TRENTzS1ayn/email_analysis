In assigning checkpoints and techniques we came upon a decision that was
not obvious:

Should the point about "Including professionally written descriptions for
all multimedia files (e.g., clip art) packaged with the software"
be a checkpoint and therefore something that must or should be done or
should it be a technique and therefore a suggested way of fulfilling the
guideline 2.6?
