Actually, it sounds like a checkpoint to me - a thing which Authoring
Tools "should" do to significantly increase the accesibility of the end
product. It is certainly not a priority 1. Techniques for this include
supporting the use of standards which allow information to be encoded with
it (such as GIF), as well as asking User Agent Guidelines to consider
providing access to that information.

  This sounds like a technique to me.
  
  The principle is:
  
      "Make it easy for users to suply alternative text."
  
  The technique is:
  
      "...by including default descriptions for things you give them."
  
  Anyone have suggested working for the checkpoint, though?
