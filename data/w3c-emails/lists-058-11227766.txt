Sorry folks, I gave the wrong URI before. The correct address is
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210

And the text itself is as follows:

2 Guidelines, Checkpoints, and Techniques

The guidelines documents have been organized to address readers seeking
abstract principles of accessible user agent design and readers seeking
concrete solutions. The guidelines documents define three terms for
different levels of abstraction:

Guideline

A guideline is a general principle of accessible design. A guideline
addresses the question "What accessibility issues should I be aware of?"
   
Checkpoint

A checkpoint is a specific way of satisfying one or more guidelines. While
checkpoints describe verifiable actions that may be carried out by the
user agent developer, implementation details are described elsewhere. A
checkpoint answers the question "What should I do to improve
accessibility?"
   
Technique

A technique is an implementation of one or more checkpoints in a given
language (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, DOM, ...). A technique answers the
question "How do I do that in HTML or SMIL or CSS...?"

The current document contains guidelines and checkpoints. The techniques
document contains practical advice on how to satisfy the checkpoints.
   
2.1 Checkpoint priorities
   
Each checkpoint in this document is assigned a priority that indicates its
importance for users.

[Priority 1]
                                                                                                            
This checkpoint must be implemented by user agents as a native feature or
through compatibility with assistive technology, otherwise one or more
groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to access
information. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for some
individuals to be able to use the Web.
          
[Priority 2]

This checkpoint should be implemented by user agents as a native feature
or through compatibility with assistive technology, otherwise one or more
groups of users will find it difficult to access information. Satisfying
this checkpoint will significantly improve access to the Web for some
individuals.
          
[Priority 3]

This checkpoint may be implemented by user agents as a native feature or
through compatibility with assistive technology, to make it easier for one
or more groups of users to access information. Satisfying this checkpoint
will improve access to the Web for some individuals.
