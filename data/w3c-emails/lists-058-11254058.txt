TIP: USING ALT TEXT TO ANNOTATE YOUR IMAGES
FrontPage automatically annotates each image you place in your Web pages
with its corresponding file name (such as filename.gif). This allows a
visitor who has turned off the browser?s ability to render images to see
alternative text or "alt text" in place of the image. It?s also critical
to use alt text on your images so that vision impaired users who use Web
page readers can get a description of the image on your
page. You may also want to replace the file name with something more
informative like "Click here to proceed" or "Picture of my product" that
gives the user a better idea of what she can expect by clicking on the
image area. 

To change the alt text, simply right click on the image and select Image
Properties from the menu. Under the general tab of the image properties
dialog box, find the section called Alternative Representation. It is
here, under the field labeled "Text" that you can replace the file name
with your custom annotation, then hit OK, and then save the page. Make
sure that the text is not too long to fit in the area allowed by the
image.
