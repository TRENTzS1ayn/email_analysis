Apparently a number of people have had problems getting into the room
block (such as it having closed early). If you have booked a room in the
Hotel but not got into the room block, please let me know as soon as
possible, and let me know when you booked the room.

If you have not booked a room, pleaase go ahead and book an ordinary room
at the Hotel and let me know so we can transfer it into the room block and
get you the better rate.

My apologies to anybody who has had trouble.

Cheers

Charles
