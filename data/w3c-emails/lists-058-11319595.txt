Actually I see this referring more to text used as longdesc than as alt.
Using 'search', 'home', 'site index' etc should be a no-brainer.
Appropriately describing my wife's painting of our apartment, which
doesn't actually look quite like our apartment, is a whole different
kettle of fish. Similarly for video description and such.

I will happily write alt text, and descriptions for reasonably simple
technical drawings, but interpreting artworks is something I find very
challenging (and also lots of fun - in my spare time I love it).

  Like at least one other person who's spoken up about this, I'm
  wondering about the term "professionals."
  
  I sense a new line of my sig coming on. ;)
