Hi Charles,

Your suggestion sounds reasonable to me. I think part
of the challenge of writing a document is deciding what
to include (to make it easier on the reader) and what
to reference (to avoid excess content that is not definitive
anyway). I think making the document readable and usable
has a higher priority than ensuring it is 28 pages
instead of 30.
