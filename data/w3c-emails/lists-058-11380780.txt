In 2.3 "author" and "they" aren't the same *number* which makes "expend"
have to reflect singular and plural, which it cannot.

In 2.5 "...may create inaccessible..."  WHY?

In 2.6 "including" is a participle whereas other techniques start with a
verb.  A typo in 2. "circulation" should be "circulate on".  "Provide an
author...selecting..." should be "electing".

In 3.3 the phrase "By incorporating..." is a dangling participle.

In 3.4.1 "Ensure that..." is not a sentence.

Picky, picky, picky.
