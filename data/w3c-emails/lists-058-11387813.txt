There are several features which have been incorporated into Amaya, the
W3C test-bed authoring tool, directly at the request of WAI. These include
help text, prompts requiring ALT text for images, and there are a number
of planned cahnges for future versions. 

Where these things have been implemented already, they would make good
examples for techniques a specific case i am thinking of is Amaya's
requirement that ALT text be provided as part of inserting an image.
