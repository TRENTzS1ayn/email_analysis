To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


There are a number of things on the issues list, and some of them seem
ripe for resolution. I propose we resolve:

That the guidelines need to address standards other than HTML. In
particular, we should cover XML in general, and W3C recommendations which
are XML subsets in particular - SMIL, MathML are recommendations, and
there are others which are being ddrawn up, such as Scalable Vector
Graphics.

The principles of seperating content and presentation, providing
alternative content where media-dependence cannot be avoided, and
assisting orientation in the documents produced by a tool, (which I have
proposed be listed explicitly in section 2, as introductory material
rather than as checkpoints, and the guidelines and checkpoints provided in
sections 3 and 4 of the current document, seem sufficient to me in terms
of guidelines. There may be some particular techniques to be applied,
although I suspect that in general they are the same as those used for
HTML.
