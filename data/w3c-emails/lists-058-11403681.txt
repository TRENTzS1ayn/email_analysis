I suggest the following:

Checkpoint x.1
The use of markup which does not conform to W3C standards must not
interfere with the user being able to access the form or function of a
document.

checkpoint x.2
Non-standard markup should not be used where it is possible t make use of
a W3C recommendation. In the absence of a recommendation, or in the
absence of widespread implementations, non-standard markup may enhance the
use of a page by certain groups. In such situations, alternatives must be
generated (see the first statement

techniques:
An example is the use of a form which includes scripted validation after
each entry to optimise the form for server-side processing. Where the
script may not be executed, there must be some alternative, such as a
server-side validation, or tolerant processing of errors.

Another example is the use of an applet to generate a series of links
which replace each other. This could either be done by providing the same
links as alternative content to the applet object, or by using SMIL to
allow the production of an accessible version, or by providing a text-only
version.
