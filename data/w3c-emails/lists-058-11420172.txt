I have submitted a couple of comments, but have one specific bone
which I deal with and feel could be made more accessible.  This is
color picking.  There are many ways to pick colors and while it is
true that one could write in the numbers, the most common practice
when using an authoring tool is to <blend> the color you want and then
apply it.  In netscape composer, ms front page and its junior express
as well as arachnophelia, there are sliders from which this can be
done.  these sliders apparently show a bit of sample text in the color
that is represented on the slider at the point of highlight. 
Rendering these colors as text on the sliders would help a great deal
and perhaps be the key in many instances to accessibility for good web
design by people with certain types of disabilities.  I like for
instance the arach approach because it allows for adjustment of the
color using three components.  hew, saturation and luminosity.  The
boxes allow you to input numbers and there are also sliders.  Some
sort of guide text would make this process more if not actually
accessible.  What should happen here is that when I pick say back
ground color, I should be able to move up and down the slider and as
the color changes as I move the slider, the name of the color is
displayed on the screen.  if I want to change it, typeing in numbers
in the thre color attribute edit fields instantly renders that change
by updating the name of the color on the screen.  this should be done
in such a way as not to appear in the color that is rendered incase
assistive technology has trouble getting at text in particular colors.
Thanks.
