The W3C has some validation tools for HTML and CSS, which has been pointed
out already by somebody. These tools are covered by the fairly enormously
generous W3C copyright, which means authoring tool developers can
incorporate them into their own software as well as pointing to them
online.

I propose that we add pointers to these in the techniques.
