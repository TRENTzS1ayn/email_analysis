I read this as an important example for the checkpoint:

Ensure that font, sizes, etc are configurable independently of teir
intended presentation.

So it would in effect be a technique for that checkpoint.

Is that a fair summary, and does anyone want to add to that?

  I have submitted a couple of comments, but have one specific bone
  which I deal with and feel could be made more accessible.  This is
  color picking.  There are many ways to pick colors and while it is
  true that one could write in the numbers, the most common practice
  when using an authoring tool is to <blend> the color you want and then
  apply it.  In netscape composer, ms front page and its junior express
  as well as arachnophelia, there are sliders from which this can be
  done.  these sliders apparently show a bit of sample text in the color
  that is represented on the slider at the point of highlight. 
  Rendering these colors as text on the sliders would help a great deal
  and perhaps be the key in many instances to accessibility for good web
  design by people with certain types of disabilities.  I like for
  instance the arach approach because it allows for adjustment of the
  color using three components.  hew, saturation and luminosity.  The
  boxes allow you to input numbers and there are also sliders.  Some
  sort of guide text would make this process more if not actually
  accessible.  What should happen here is that when I pick say back
  ground color, I should be able to move up and down the slider and as
  the color changes as I move the slider, the name of the color is
  displayed on the screen.  if I want to change it, typeing in numbers
  in the thre color attribute edit fields instantly renders that change
  by updating the name of the color on the screen.  this should be done
  in such a way as not to appear in the color that is rendered incase
  assistive technology has trouble getting at text in particular colors.
  Thanks.
