I'm not sure if I understand. Is this something like declaring a
namespace, or a DOCTYPE declaration in HTML, or otherwise giving a
reference to the syntax, or is there a seperate issue?

Certainly in the use of various XML beasties this is important, and I
suspect rates a checkpoint or even a guideline.

Would you care to elaborate for us?

  That the guidelines need to address standards other than HTML. In
  particular, we should cover XML in general, and W3C recommendations which
  are XML subsets

  Key one for XML. Give us the DTD with the document.
  I only know of one tool that gens the DTD from the document,
  and its not open source.
