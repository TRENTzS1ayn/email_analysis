CONTENT:
Authoring Tools must allow some openness or variation in coding so that new
code can be used.  (i.e.  HTML 5.0 can be written with a system that writes
to HTML 4.0).  [FrontPage98 allows this while HoTMetaL Pro 4.0 does not.]

Authoring Tools should place a standard dtd instead of a proprietary dtd
(i.e.  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> )

Authoring Tools should prompt for placing  language attributes.  (i.e.
<html lang="en"> )

GRAMMAR:
In the following section a word is missing.  The missing word is marked by
surrounding *** ***.
"2 Ensure that content produced by the tool is accessible
Authoring Tools are used to automate the low-level tasks involved in
producing Web pages. The power of this automation can
enhance the accessibility of the Web if ***IT**** is used to ensure that the
code produced promotes accessibility"
