Jamie,

thanks for your comments. The grammatical error will be fixed in the next
draft (due Friday).

The agenda may not allow for a resolution on the quesion of DTDs in the
next guidelines draft (due in a couple of days), and the issue of
extending markup is almost certainly going to require further thought and
revision. You may wish to track their progress through successive drafts,
or via meeting resolutions and the email list archives, available from the
Working Group's home page - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU

Prompting for language is required in order to meet the Web Content
Guideline calling for language to be marked up. At the moment most
specifics which are covered there are not repeated in the Authoring Tool
Guidelines themselves, unless there are special requirements specific to
Authoring Tools.

I think the concern is addressed especially in checkpoints 2.2.1 - support
accessibility features, and 2.3.2 - make use of accessible solutions,
where necessary prompting for extra information.

regards

Charles McCathieNevile

  CONTENT:
  Authoring Tools must allow some openness or variation in coding so that new
  code can be used.  (i.e.  HTML 5.0 can be written with a system that writes
  to HTML 4.0).  [FrontPage98 allows this while HoTMetaL Pro 4.0 does not.]
  
  Authoring Tools should place a standard dtd instead of a proprietary dtd
  (i.e.  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> )
  
  Authoring Tools should prompt for placing  language attributes.  (i.e.
  <html lang="en"> )
  
  GRAMMAR:
  In the following section a word is missing.  The missing word is marked by
  surrounding *** ***.
  "2 Ensure that content produced by the tool is accessible
  Authoring Tools are used to automate the low-level tasks involved in
  producing Web pages. The power of this automation can
  enhance the accessibility of the Web if ***IT**** is used to ensure that the
  code produced promotes accessibility"
