I propose that we actually adopt the following checkpoint for Guideline
2.1 - Generate standard markup

2.1.2 Provide a reference within a document to the DTD which has been used
as a URI.

Rationale:
User Agents need to know how to interpret a document. Where, for example,
several XML varieties are used, such as the modular HTML-in-XHTML which is
being produced by W3C, or MathML/SMIL included in an HTML document,
reference to the DTD is important for parsing it. Also, it is how a
document is declared to be (for example) HTML 4.0 strict, and interpreted
as such, or MYHTML, which incorporates several extensions, and for which
the DTD is available at http://rubbish.com/my.dtd 

The use of a non-standard DTD has implications about how the content is to
be represented, and it is therefore important to know what the correct DTD
is.

In HTML this is done by including a DOCTYPE declaration. XML uses
namespaces. These are techniques.

Question: Does reference need to include a URI? I am not sure.

    CONTENT:
    Authoring Tools must allow some openness or variation in coding so that new
    code can be used.  (i.e.  HTML 5.0 can be written with a system that writes
    to HTML 4.0).  [FrontPage98 allows this while HoTMetaL Pro 4.0 does not.]
    
    Authoring Tools should place a standard dtd instead of a proprietary dtd
    (i.e.  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> )
