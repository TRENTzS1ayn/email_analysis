DaveP. HTML should use a standard SGML DOCTYPE declaration. 
With HTMl this would normally provide the url for the source (developers
should provide easy ways into this)
For XML, the standard, [23] defines format.
to include version, optionally encoding and or standalone declaration.
For the XML DTD, [75] defines the requirement for external ID, most likely
to be a SYSTEM then the url.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE DOCBOOK SYSTEM "http://www.davenport.org/docbook">
for documents 'home grown', the liklihood is that the DTD could/should be
internal and part of the document. Its this type of document that is most
likely
to cause trouble. I write it as I go along, don't bother with a DTD at all.
I can
produce a well formed, but not a type valid document.

The producers should realise the problem, its possible they could derive the
DTD along the way as its produced. An internal DTD would be a real bonus 
for such documents.
