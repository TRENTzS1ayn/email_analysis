Aah. Yes. I saw that in the XML rec, but it didn't quite filter through my
head fast enough.

  DaveP. HTML should use a standard SGML DOCTYPE declaration. 
  With HTMl this would normally provide the url for the source (developers
  should provide easy ways into this)
  For XML, the standard, [23] defines format.
  to include version, optionally encoding and or standalone declaration.
  For the XML DTD, [75] defines the requirement for external ID, most likely
  to be a SYSTEM then the url.
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <!DOCTYPE DOCBOOK SYSTEM "http://www.davenport.org/docbook">
  for documents 'home grown', the liklihood is that the DTD could/should be
  internal and part of the document. Its this type of document that is most
  likely
  to cause trouble. I write it as I go along, don't bother with a DTD at all.
  I can
  produce a well formed, but not a type valid document.
  
  The producers should realise the problem, its possible they could derive the
  DTD along the way as its produced. An internal DTD would be a real bonus 
  for such documents.
