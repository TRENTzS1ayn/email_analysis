Chuck,
I think you may have missed a few steps in the evolution of the group
process. If you trace the history of the various drafts you will note that
we had a list of the critical problems with possible solutions. But then,
we decided that we didn't want simply a list of all the beefs about what is
wrong with present authoring tools and a list of do's and don't, but rather
a guiding document that communicates the principles and approaches an
authoring tool developer needs to take to ensure that their tool both
produces accessible content and is accessible to authors with disabilities.
Like the Web Content group we want this document to age gracefully but we
also want to present enough specific advice to solve today's problems. This
is why we have settled on several tiers of information. The guideline with
rationale, the checkpoint as the verifiable outcome of following the
guideline and the techniques which outline possible approaches. Given that
the intended audience is developers, your input would be very valuable in
the upcoming meeting.

Because we want to make the process of editing the document as public as
possible, Jan was posting proposed wording for edits discussed in the
conference call you missed. Perhaps we should use introductions in the
emails to give occasional viewers a better sense of the context. As Charles
stated we are trying to make sure we have the critical principles of the
approach down, then we want to make sure our checkpoints are complete, then
we will review priorities.
