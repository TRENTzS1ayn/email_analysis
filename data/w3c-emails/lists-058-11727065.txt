Where distance education is provided by the web, the tools used to author
content for that service are within our current scope. The tools used to
pass stuff around are in some cases user agents, and therefore are in the
scope of the user agent group. (examples would include soft-arc's first
class client, the only one I have used much) Often these systems are in
fact authoring tools and user agents combined, although generally limited
in their power.

There are also servers which don't have any real effect on the content.
They don't fall into the scope of any WAI group as such.

  "author" distance learning projects?  This is becoming a huge field too

  associations that seek to be the standard setters for the field.  A
  search on "distance learning" got me too many to deal with!
