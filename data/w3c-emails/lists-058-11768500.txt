Kynn,

(and anyone else who is curious) the milestone listed in the charter is to
have it public monday. We are aiming to actually put it onto TR tomorrow
(friday), but since the working group home page, email list, etc is public
anyway, if people are particularly interested they can see it from the
group home page as soon as it is there. (and for that matter, send
comments to the list, whether or not they are members of the working
group.

Charles

  Will there be a public draft on Friday?  (Did I misunderstand or is
  this the plan?)  I have some interested people who would like to see
  the new draft.
