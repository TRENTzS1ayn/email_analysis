I think the techniques should be separated from the checkpoints
and guidelines, preferably in another document, but at least
after the checkpoints and guidelines. Too much detail inline
will distract readers from the flow of more abstract discussions.

One reasons to create a second document is to save download
and printing times. The Web Content Guidelines alone
are about 20 pages. The Techniques document is almost 50. 
If you want a reader to digest the ideas, the Guidelines
document should be kept as short as possible.
