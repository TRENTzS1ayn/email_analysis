I think this is a general documentation question: when to
quote (and how much) vs. when to reference alone. I don't know
that there is a general solution to this problem. Nonetheless,
I suggest quoting where shared context is required, otherwise
just reference.

Also, there should be additional WAI NOTES soon to allow
further referencing of some shared definitions.

Please also alert the Web Content WG when you discover
an important dependency.

For reasons cited in another email (size, download times,
readability), I propose two documents. Also, this would make the
AU guidelines consistent with the other two, which is not primordial
(the three look slightly different anyway), but would be beneficial,
just like using the same nomenclature for the rating system (even
if the meanings of the priorities differ slightly).
