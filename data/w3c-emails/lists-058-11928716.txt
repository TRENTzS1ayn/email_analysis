Hello all,

To keep up the momentum of the face to face meeting, we will hold our next
teleconference at 3:30 EST this coming Monday, unless there is a member who
objects. The number to call is 1.617.252.7000.

Thanks to everyone who took the time and effort to attend the face to face
meeting. Due to everyones contributions and the team work we made quite a
bit of progress on some confounding and thorny issues. Our next working
draft should reflect this.

Thanks again.
Jutta
