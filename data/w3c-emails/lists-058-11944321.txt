Thanks everyone for coming to the meeting. I think we made significant
progress, which can only be ascribed to the members of the group working
cooperatively and working productively. I personally enjoyed the chance to
meet some of you in person, and look forward to our next meeting.

Particular thanks to Mark Day and Lotus for hosting us in a congenial
environment, Jutta for doing the chair thing, and Ian for doing most of
the scribe thing.

Hope everyone is now safely home and feeling inspired (grin)

cheers

Charles
