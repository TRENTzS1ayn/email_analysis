It seems we should think about the material in the definitions section.

In the specific case of the discussion about prompting and alerting it
seems that what is there goes far beyond a definition, and would actually
be good material to have available in the techniques, perhaps with a  much
shorter version where we feel it is necessary to define a term (e.g.
intrusive and non-intrusive prompts).

There are also definitions of things which are not mentioned at all in the
document - should we remove them (and reinstate them from a previous
version if we want them back), or should we just leave them there for now.
Personally I am in favour of removing them, since it gives us a better
idea of how far we have to go when there is stuff missing than when there
is extra content.

Cheers

Charles
