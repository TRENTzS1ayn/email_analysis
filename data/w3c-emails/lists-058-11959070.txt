I thought we decided to remove all priorities (e.g. replaced them with
X) until we work out new definitions for priority and until we apply
these definitions to all checkpoints.

Also, in the current definition of checkpoint/priority I would want to 
see the emphasis put on the 'Ensure that content produced by the tool
is accessible" part, not the "Accessible environment" part.

For instance:
  A checkpoint answers the question "What must/should/may I do to make
  an authoring tool (and the content it produces) accessible?" 
should be
  A checkpoint answers the question "What must/should/may I do to make
  an authoring tool produce accessible content (or be accessible to
  all authors)?" 


Or for the [Priority 1] definition, instead of:

  This checkpoint must be implemented by authoring tools, otherwise one
  or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to
  access some function of the tool, or some content produced by
  it. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for some
  individuals to be able to use the authoring tool or its output.
I'd use

  tool). Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for some
  individuals to be able to use the output of the authoring tool (or
  the tool itself)
