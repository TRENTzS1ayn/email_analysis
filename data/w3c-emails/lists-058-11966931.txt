We gave Priority X to everything which we thought had not had some
dicussion of priority. All priorities are still (like everything else)
open for negotiation - see the status section of the document.

I disagree with putting the focus on one or other aspect of accessibility.
Although I feel that in teh big world it is more important that all tools
produce accessible ooutput than that all tools are accessible, a decision
like that is beyond the scope of the group, whose charter is to provide
guidelines on how authoring tools can be accessible in both areas.

My suggestion with the deifinition of checkpoints would be to remove the
parnethese altogether, or to change the wording in parenthese from (and
the content it produces) to (including the content it produces)

  Also, in the current definition of checkpoint/priority I would want to 
  see the emphasis put on the 'Ensure that content produced by the tool
  is accessible" part, not the "Accessible environment" part.
  
  For instance:
    A checkpoint answers the question "What must/should/may I do to make
    an authoring tool (and the content it produces) accessible?" 
  should be
    A checkpoint answers the question "What must/should/may I do to make
    an authoring tool produce accessible content (or be accessible to
    all authors)?" 
  
  
  Or for the [Priority 1] definition, instead of:
  
    This checkpoint must be implemented by authoring tools, otherwise one
    or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to
    access some function of the tool, or some content produced by
    it. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for some
    individuals to be able to use the authoring tool or its output.
