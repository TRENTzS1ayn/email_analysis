Although I feel that guidelines should not ahve priorities, since they all
express things which need to be done to make the tools accessible, I think
the usability of the guidelines is enhanced by prioritised checkpoints.
There are some features which I think are important but not essential. I
think there are other featuers which are good, but are not actually
important for accessibility. I don't want those things to disappear from
the document, but I could not support the argument that a registry of alt
text (for example) was crucial to accessibility in the same way as I could
support an argument that including ALT text with imgaes is crucial for
accessibility.

I do think that we need to clearly identify the problems which are caused,
and that we should use a priority definition strictly rather than be
overly concerned about the statistical balance of priorities.

  checkpoints we can but I don't want to.  The whole thing is a *top
  priority* and one person's "can't use without" is another's "that would
  be nice".
  
  I still propose 3.1.3 to emphasize that just a text view is not enough
  and that the "structure tree" is important to authoring and not just to
  navigating.  In Amaya, if I'm not mistaken it is possible to do certain
  editing functions directly from the structure view?
