I agree that we should be referring to the checklist and not the
technniques. I think this came about because the checkpoints were at one
time called techniques. If this is the case and there are no objections I
will make the change in the next draft.

I don't think we need to put a copy of it directly into our document,
except perhaps in an expanded version of our document which included
techniques inline.

cheers

  which is more appropriate.  In fact I think we should start immediate
  consideration of creating our own edited form of the latter for
  inclusion in our document.  The checkpoints document is central to our
  efforts (as well as those of EO) and it should be tailored to fit the
  explicit needs of other Working Groups.
