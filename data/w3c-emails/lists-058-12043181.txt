Agreed.  I have a real problem with that whole thing anyway.

How about:

Only include automatically generated alternative content when
the meaning or function of the described object is known with
certainty.

or maybe:

"...has been identified by the author."

This allows for the author, for example, to select from a set of
"bullet points" that include ALT="*" without having to endure
a prompt for each one, as well as the author being able to check
a box that says:

[X] Always use this textual description for this particular image.
