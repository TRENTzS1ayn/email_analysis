I like the proposed wording. The rest of it I would put in a technique,
cross referenced to the alt text registry.

  Agreed.  I have a real problem with that whole thing anyway.
  
  How about:
  
  Only include automatically generated alternative content when
  the meaning or function of the described object is known with
  certainty.
  
  or maybe:
  
  "...has been identified by the author."
  
  This allows for the author, for example, to select from a set of
  "bullet points" that include ALT="*" without having to endure
  a prompt for each one, as well as the author being able to check
  a box that says:
  
  [X] Always use this textual description for this particular image.
