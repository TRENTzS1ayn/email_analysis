How will presenting a document in a structured view improve it's
accessibility?  Have you considered the potential development cost in
creating this feature?

How will knowing that a <P> tag is part of a <H1> help the accessibility of
the document?  Can you explain the rationale and the reason.

What authoring tools provide this feature?  I know that Word has an outline
view - is that what you are referring to?  How would Excel produce this
feature?

Thanks,

I agree that we need to mention a structure view. I think it can fit into
the navigation guideline because this would refer to navigation for editing
not browsing and it would include controls to move around, edit and switch
between views.
