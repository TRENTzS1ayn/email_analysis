As I understand it, based in part on the brief discussion at the face to
face meeting, there are two possibilities for a structure view which is
designed to increase the accessibility of an authoring tool (as opposed to
the final document, which is why the proposed checkpoint is in the new
section 3)
1. An outline view, similar to that available in MSWord, or Amaya's "table
of Contents" view
2. A formal structure view exposing the DOM tree, similar to that
available in Amaya.

Being able to navigate either or both of these trees makes it much easier
to deal with the document in an environment where scrolling through the
document is an expensive process - eg braille display, small screen, etc. 

The development cost is outside the scope of this group.

  How will knowing that a <P> tag is part of a <H1> help the accessibility of
  the document?  Can you explain the rationale and the reason.
  
  What authoring tools provide this feature?  I know that Word has an outline
  view - is that what you are referring to?  How would Excel produce this
  feature?

  I agree that we need to mention a structure view. I think it can fit into
  the navigation guideline because this would refer to navigation for editing
  not browsing and it would include controls to move around, edit and switch
  between views.
