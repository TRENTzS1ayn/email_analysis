Bruce, your question has pretty well nothing to do with the topic matter
for this list, so we are unlikely to provide a lot of help.

I would refer you to the help pages at search engines such as Alta Vista,
or to Webmasters' organisations. However I suspect that many people who
are attempting to live on the proceeds of this knowledge will be reluctant
to give it away freely, although if you look hard enough you will find
someone who will. A bit of practical experimentation should give you
some good clues. Or ring the boss at Yahoo and ask him.

  Hello.
   My name is Bruce Mc Daniel.  I am a grad student at UNR in Reno,
  Nevada.  Currently, I am taking a class called "Doing Business on the
  Web."  As part of the requirements I am doing a research project that
  asks the question...
   "Assuming you have a great web site in place, how do you get people
  to come to your site?
  --How do you go about making it easier for people to find your site?
  --What can be done do help
  search engines find your site?"
   Also, I would like to assume both scenerios: 1. You have a very small
  budget. 2: You have a very large budget.
   I guess I am looking for those secrets that webmasters know but are
  afraid to tell.
   I would appreciate your help, advise, or guidence with this matter.
   Thank you.
