aloha, all!

while charles and jutta have expressed the view that a structure view is a
good idea, they have both opined that it fits into navigation....  as a
totally blind page author, however, i find this too restrictive a
distinction...  while i agree with jutta and charles that it fits into the
navigation section, i also agree with will that it is an integral part of
checkpoint 3.1

why?  web sites (at least those that are worth their weight in bytes) are
not built in isolation--the author must be able not only be able to
navigate a structured view, but be able to interact with the structure
view, which means editing one portion of the site whilst reviewing the
site as a whole...  otherwise, i fear that, when authors such as myself do
make the move to an authoring tool, we will be forced to edit/author pages
in isolation...

gregory.
