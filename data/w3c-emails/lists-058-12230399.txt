I cannot agree more with what you said. By harping on these two issue we
would be limiting the amount of accessibility we could recommend authoring
tools contain or produce. Especially if we use the excuse "no one will
implement it due to the cost incurred." 

Besides, concerned individuals will always step in to help with the
enforcement of standards. Look at the Web Standards Project. They've taken
CSS 1 and HTML 4.0 and made the Web development community aware of how
unimplemented these recommendations are. Currently, Netscape is rewriting
their browser to become as compliant as possible and Microsoft has even
admitted it now recognizes Web developers as a potential client and user.

We should not limit ourselves because we think our recommendations will
interfere with a company's cost or product-to-market schedule. If the
companies do not implement our AU Recommendations, a new group will spring
up to educate the public to ask for those features or buy a different product.
