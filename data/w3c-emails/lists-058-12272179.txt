For many years the indefinite pronoun (as to gender) was always
presented as "he" and in more enlightened times became "he or she" or
occasionally "(s)he".  Many of us use "she" as a sort of compensation
for the many years of the dreaded "all *MEN* are created equal".

The point of this is that although it may be true that many (or even
most) of the software guidelines about accessibility mention the
features we seek to emphasize in Section 3 of our document, it is still
worth our while to remind the huge proportion of tool authors who have
ignored these requests that at least in the case of authoring tools it
is important to consider the items we point out in our guidelines,
checkpoints, and techniques.

If we are being redundant, so be it.  This pitifully small array of
points about accessible interfaces is *IMPORTANT* even if the developers
of Web authoring tools already know about it.  If they are already
implemented then there is no problem with having them "bloat" our
document somewhat.
