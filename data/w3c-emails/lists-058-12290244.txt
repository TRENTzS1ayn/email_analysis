No, it isn't that either. It is a question which is beyond the scope of
the current group. The question of prioritisation is, for this group, a
question of the degree to which users with disabilities need the feature.

Prioritisation of checkpoints according to cost, implementation
difficulty, etc is intimately bound up in the development and management
processes of each developer individually. That is beyond the scope of this
group, is not an issue I particularly want to spend time on, and is
unlikely to be an issue which, unless the companies concerned are prepared
to provide substantial detail on their inner workings, (which would
surprise me, as I said in my earlier message) this group will ever have
sufficient information to approach sensibly anyway.

As I said earlier today, the offering of alternative solutions is within
the scope of this group.

  I agree with this sentiment.  This problem of "implementation cost" isn't
  one of creating checkpoints, it's of prioritizing them.
