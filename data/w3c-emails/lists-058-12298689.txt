This is precisely the job of the working group. A problem was outlined at
the face to face meeting, was elaborated on during the teleconference, and
has been further explained on this list. Solutions have been proposed. If
there are alternatives we are missing, propose them to the list. We can
only select from the ideas which are available.

This is, in part, why I am not yet ready to express my ideas as
checkpoints. The placeholder in the document was put there by agreement of
the group at the meeting, with the recognition that we would require
further discussion. The primary medium for communication within this group
is this email list.

So here we are. If the problem is still unclear, or there are better
solutions available, please say so. If you are merely concerned that this
proposal is being given a higher priority than it merits, please allow
that to be discussed when that is the question on the agenda.

  Another area where cost should be considered is alternatives.  If the
  problem is that the document editor is unaware of the hierarchy of the
  information, then how can that be presented?  A structured view is one way,
  what's another?  Surely there are other possibilities.  Jutta mentioned
  several times yesterday about the visual formatting information.  However
  that information is already available to speech output products - why are
  they not representing that to the end user?
  
  In short - State the problem.  Propose some solutions.  Write the
  checkpoints.  Unfortunately, it *appears* that a checkpoint was thought up,
  put into the document and then everyone is racing around trying to justify
  it.  Let's get those justifications into the document.  Let's get the
  alternative solutions into the document.
  
  If we can agree on the problem, and present some possible solutions, each
  with various trade offs, it becomes much easier to get one of the solutions
  implemented.
