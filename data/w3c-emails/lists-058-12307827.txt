I believe that the issue of mouseless manipulation
(keyboard/voiceinput/whatever) is so important as to be included
specifically in our document despite the fact that referred-to items may
specify it.

One of the most important parts about our work is that we hope to
encourage tools that are competitively usable by PWDs since they are
significantly underemployed and could readily get utilized as web
builders if the tools available factored them in.  How important is this
to us - very.  There is a growing shortage of competent techno-folk (you
just can't get good help anymore!) and the "Promise of the Web" can best
be fuliflled by folks who create it, not just those who use it.

Of course it is vital that authoring tools produce accessible output but
it is way past time that we shut out this section of the population by
making efforts to enable them to to use the tools somehow be considered
of "lower priority" - this is unacceptable not only to me but also to
"the people" as expressed in a series of laws *requiring* accessibility
- not just in the U.S. but all over the world.
