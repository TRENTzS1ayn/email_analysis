  So you feel that the last 10 weeks have produced a stable section 2 and now
  it's time to work on section 3?

CMN:
No. I think that we have worked a long time on section 2 at the expense of
section 3, and that in the interests of achieveiing what the group is
chartered to do we should turn our attention to section 3 for a little.

CO:  
  If so, I couldn't disagree more.  Section 2 is by no means complete, stable
  or even useful yet.  All the big issues of generated content have not been
  discussed in depth, for example:
  
  Prompting for ALT text
CMN:
Actually this has been discussed in considerable depth. I refer you to
minutes of meetings and the email list.
CO:
  Requiring <label>
CMN:
This is addressed by guidelines 2.2 and 2.3
CO:
  ALT vs. TITLE on <AREA>
CMN:
This problem only arises due to a non-standard implementation of HTML.
To the extent that predicting arbitrary failure to implement standards is
possible (ie only in retrospect), if we feel that the reference to the
WCAG (where the topic is covered) is insufficient we could make it more
explicit. However you have suggested we not do this, fairly consistently,
in the past week. If you have an alternative suggestion, please make it.
CO:
  Use of style sheets
CMN:
See checkpoint 2.2.2 and my statement above.
CO:
  NOFRAMES and NOSCRIPT
CMN:
These are covered by 2.2 and 2.3
