Our next teleconference call will be March 24 at 3:30 EST, the number to
call is
+1-617-252-7000.

As chair, I wish to apologize for the less than productive conference call
last week.  To avoid recursive discussions about process in the upcoming
call I will employ some more proactive measures and enforce protocol that
should ensure that we get through the agenda.

As usual the agenda will be linked to the AU home page.

Jutta
