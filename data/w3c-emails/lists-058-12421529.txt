At the face to face meeting we resolved to highlight the most important
points of general accessible software design in the introduction to what
is now section 3, and to make it clear that many of the basic requirements
were dealt with in other documents to which we would refer.

Are you proposing this addendum as part of such an introduction (which I
think is a sensible opint to include)? This is the assumption I am using
in drawing up the agenda.

I would add to mouseless operation the requirement to implement
appropriate interfaces for assistive technologies, and the requirement to
implement software in accordance with Operating System conventions.

The other point I think is important is the need to have a User Interface
which is not dependent on visual rendering. As well as being covered in
other guidelines it seems that this is implicit in the requirements 
for authoring-tool specific needs, so I would propose not including this
point in such an introduction.

(keyboard/voiceinput/whatever) is so important as to be included
specifically in our document despite the fact that referred-to items may
specify it.
     
One of the most important parts about our work is that we hope to
encourage tools that are competitively usable by PWDs since they are
significantly underemployed and could readily get utilized as web
builders if the tools available factored them in.  How important is this
to us - very.  There is a growing shortage of competent techno-folk (you
just can't get good help anymore!) and the "Promise of the Web" can best
be fuliflled by folks who create it, not just those who use it.
