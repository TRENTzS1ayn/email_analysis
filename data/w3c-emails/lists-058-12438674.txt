  CMcCN: "Are you proposing this addendum as part of such an introduction"
  
  WL:: I was at first proposing it as either that or as a checkpoint but

  matter I'm leaning towards the latter.
  
  Alan Cantor replied to my IG post that true mouselessness is pretty much

  CMcCN: "I would add to mouseless operation the requirement to implement
  appropriate interfaces for assistive technologies, and the requirement
  to implement software in accordance with Operating System conventions."
  
  WL:: OTOH I think these are well covered in referenced documents

CMN: Certainly. I was imagining a (longish) sentence in the introduction
which touched on all these points, and referred to other documents.
