It is possible to use BGSOUND in a way which is accessible, which is to
use it in conjunction with alternate presentation(s) of the content
pointed to by the BGSOUND element.

While BGSOUND does not, as far as I know, provide by itself any way to
introduce that content, I don't see any difficulty in using BGSOUND in an
authoring tool where the necessary alternative content is made available
in a way consistent with W3C DTDs (for example, a textual transcript being
made available. Some of this is provided in a way which may appeal to more
designers by the OBJECT element of HTML 4, since it allows for cleaner
presentation of a range of alterntive content types.

  Then we need to make sure somewhere in the "validation and checking
  section," the authoring tool mentiones that certain elements specific to a
  single browser are not accessible....like BGSOUND.
