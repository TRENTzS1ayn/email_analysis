The problem we are trying to solve is that a graphic display has a much
higher 'bandwidth' than media such as speech or even braille. In order to
edit a document effectively an author needs not just the structured views
which are called for in the User Agent Guidelines - Guideline 6.2 in
http://www.w3.org/WAI-UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990309 - which is an important
aid to the production of a structured document, but they have a need for
efficient navigation of a document.

In many cases that could be met by allowing navigation of the document
structure. It may be that there are other cases, and that we could ask for
an ability to read the document in a structured way, and an 'assisted
navigation system' - i.e. we broaden the definition of the checkpoint. I
think to do this we would need to give examples in techniques, and I think
that it would be too ill-defined. I am not putting it as a proopsal,
since I think it would not be very clever, but I thought I'd float the
possibility.
