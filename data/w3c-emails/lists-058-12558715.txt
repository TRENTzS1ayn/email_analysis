A visually oriented tool, which allows visual formatting, may
heuristically determine structure and check with the author whether the
assumptions are correct, and apply structural markup (which is what is
needed for accessibility, unless we have User Agents which have this
capacity) to make this explicit in a rendering-independent way.
