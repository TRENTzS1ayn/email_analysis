Because the Web is still so largely inaccessible, even to people like
Tom Fowle of Smith-Kettlewell I asked him to read the guidelines and
report if there was any renewed hope that he'd become a Webber:

TF: I've read through the content and authoring tools guidelines:
About the only thing that seems missing to me is any mention that
authoring tools must conform with the needs of screen readers or other
access systems on the platform for which they are intended.  E.G.
in winderz, MS active accessibility as only a basic start.
 
TF: It might be there I just didn't hear it.

WL:: I think the aspect of section 3 that might cover this is that if
the tool is designed to run on "X" then the tool should be eminently
accessible via screen reader, brl, or whatever???
