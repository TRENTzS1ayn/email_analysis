I think we want a guideline that says 'implement accessibility features
for the platform' or something like that. Although we don't want to repeat
the work which exists, there are a few things we ought to point out.

The primary requirement is that standard operating system conventions are
followed. This seems like a P1 checkpoint if we accept such a guideline,
and we should, in techniques, refer to various documents which exist for
different platforms.

In particular, user configurability of input device(s) and output devices,
and the implementation of standard program interfaces to allow assistive
technologies to be used. I imagine that these issues are covered in the
average set of standard processes, but they are sufficiently basic that I
would like to see them abstracted as checkpoints.

This has particular relevance for determination of conformance. As Rob
Cumming and others have pointed out, a method to measure conformance is
likely to be crucial for the adoption of these guidelines. As Jutta has
pointed out, it is crucial to make it clear that the platform-specific
guidelines must be met, which is why I have suggested that as the first
checkpoint. These other requirements are crucial. They ought to be met by
fulfilling the first requirement, to implement standard systems, but in
cases where that does not happen they must still be met.

So I am working on a proposal which will look something like the
following:

Guideline 3.X Ensure that the tool is an accessible piece of software 

rationale: Tools need to implement standard accessibility features for the
platform they are on, so that assistive technologies can be used.

checkpoints:
3.x.1 Implement the tool using standard operating system conventions and
accessibility conventions [p1]

techniques: see the various documents we can think of (I can think of four
off the top of my head)

3.x.2 Ensure that user input devices can be configured

techniques: In most cases this is satisfied either by 3.x.1. In systems
where this is not true, but where it is possible to reconfigure the
keyboard, which applies in many systems, providing complete keyboard
control will satisfy the checkpoint.

3.x.3 Ensure that output devices are configurable

techniques: I'm not sure exactly. Which is one of the reasons this isn't a
proposal yet, just the outline of one (grin). An example is that in an
environment where audio and visual output is generally available, it is
possible to specify that no audio output should be used, and anything
which defaults to audio output (eg a warning beep) should be rendered
visually.

3.x.4 Implement standard program interfaces

techniques: implement relevant w3c DOM specs. provide hooks for controls,
so assistive technologies can interface with the program. (implement 3.x.1
for some good system where these things are well organised)

any thoughts on this?

  About the only thing that seems missing to me is any mention that
  authoring tools must conform with the needs of screen readers or other

  accessible via screen reader, brl, or whatever???
