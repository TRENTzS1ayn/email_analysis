To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


Measuring comfomance to these guidelines in some way is necessary for us
to determine the extent to which they have been adopted, and as Rob
Cumming pointed out, some simple way to measure conformance is going to be
extremely helpful in getting these guidelines adopted by manufacturers.

The conformance test being used by the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, which essentailly provides three levels of conformance - all
P1 checkpoints are satisfied, all P1 and all P2 checkpoints are satisfied,
or all P1, all P2 and all P3 checkpoints are satisfied.
