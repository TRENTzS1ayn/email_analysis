I came down with the flu on Sunday and have felt bad all
week long; I'm caught up enough with most things that I
will actually listen to my wife and stay in bed tomorrow,
but barring any miraculous recoveries overnight I don't
think I'll be able to make (let alone say anything at)
the conference call tomorrow.

Sorry.
