"Checking, validating and where necessary repairing markup."

Perhaps "possible" instead of "necessary" or just leave out "where
necessary" since one should *always* repair markup in need of repair.

"Do not generate description text or insert place-holder text [except
human-authored description text] when the meaning or function of the
described object is known with certainty." [my brackets]

The placement of the bracketed part emphasizes a possible
misunderstanding of this checkpoint.  It might sound like "don't insert
text if you know object's function"!

"Integrate applicable accessibility features in any discussion of the
help system"

What is a discussion of the help system?

"The author may need a different view to edit the web content than they
wish it to be ultimately displayed."

The old "author...they" and "wish it to be" problem.

"Ensure the rendering used while authoring of independent of styles..."

The "too many 'ofs' problem."

That's enough for now.
