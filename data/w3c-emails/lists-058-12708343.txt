Someone's been messing with the style sheet for the draft document.  A
few weeks ago the vertically readable "tab" at the upper left of the
document was present in Opera but not in NetScape, last week it
disappeared from Opera, now it shows in both!  Unlike most CSS stuff
it's not text so it must be one of the images - if so it doesn't have
any alt attribute!
