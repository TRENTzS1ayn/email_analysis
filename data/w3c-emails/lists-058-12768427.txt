1. Next face to face meeting:

As mentioned at the last face to face meeting, the next face to face
meeting of the working group is planned for Toronto, on Saturday and
Sunday May 15/16. An official announcement will be made in the next few
days.

There will possibly be a further face to face meeting in June, before we
try to issue the guidelines as a proposed recommendation.

2. Associated Documents - Issues, Changes, Member list, etc

The Issues list is currently out of date - I hope to update it this
afternoon

The history of Changes should now be up to date.

A list of group Members will be published shortly. In order to be an
active member you must have filled in and returned the form at the end of
the charter, to the email address listed with that form. Most people who
have been participating this year have done so, but please note that if
you only returned a form last year, your membership has lapsed.
(instructions for joining are on the group page)

3. Meetings

Please send regrets if you are unable to attend a particular meeting.

Reminder that the next meeting is also scheduled for a Wednesday, since
the mondy is a holiday in some countries.
