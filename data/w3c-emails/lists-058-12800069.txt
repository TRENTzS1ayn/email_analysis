From a recent ig post: "Please, avoid to send messages in HTML.
Thank you
Paolo"

This might alert us to what the future may (probably *will*) hold for
the globality of the WWW (nee internet).

What we include in "authoring tools" must account for the probability
that even email will be generated in something like XML before we go
much farther.  When HTML email is as easy (think "unlimited" bandwidth)
as current straight text postings, it is likely that the "network is the
computer" prediction will mean our communications will include not just
the quaint "ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT..." signature but also letterheads,
logos, streaming whatever and therefore: the guidelines must stay not
only terse, but abstract (not HTML-specific); the checkpoints must be
heavily slanted towards usability by our friends/clients; the techniques
should be able to grow exponentially with the possibilities provided by
the technology.

Sorry about that Paolo, but sending messages in HTML can only be avoided
*very* briefly and what we need to do is forget about proscribing and
get smart with prescribing.
