I forget what I raised before.

2.3.5 needs wordsmithing - it's just too convoluted.

2.5.2 "removed" should not have a "d" on the end.

2.7.2 I may have mentioned this before: what is a "discussion of the
help system"?

3.2.1 has already been noted as requiring grammatization.

3.4.2 perhaps: "Allow the author access to a text version of any site
maps or other structural representations."

It is very encouraging that *all* of the guidelines and checkpoints are
at a level of abstraction that should account for the tools' use in any
markup situation.  

The GLs are not specific to HTML or even to our current conception of
what an "authoring tool" might be.  I have no idea if as much can be
said for the WCGLs but I hope they have taken into account that the Web
of 2001 might be very different from that of 1999. 

As the "desktop" becomes more or less permanently connected to the
internet we must be ever watchful that our objectives are kept in the
minds of those who design all the "cool" stuff that seems to be coming
right along any day now.
