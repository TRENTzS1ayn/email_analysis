I think 2.7.2 (Implement applicable accessibility features in any
discussionof the help system) is really about integrating accessibility
into the look and feel - covered by guideline 2.4 

Maybe it is a technique for checkpoint 2.4.2, or a checkpoint under that
section.

Any opinions?

I also think that this is one of the areas where the distinction between
section 2 and section 3 is meaningless. I therefore think Ian's proposal
to merge the two sections has merit, and should be revisited.

  2.7.2 I may have mentioned this before: what is a "discussion of the
  help system"?
