I don't think merging the two would confuse the reader. I think that if
done right it would strengthen the message that accessibility of the tool
and accessibility of the output are parts of making a tool accessible, and
that both things are necessary.

The overlap is primarily in the sections identified by Jutta - 2.6 and
2.7, but it seems to me a clear overlap rather than a dubious one.

  I feel the two sections should not be merged. They address two very
  distinct principles: 2. generate accessible content and 2. have an
  accessible user interface. Even in the sections where there might be a
  dubious overlap such as 'integrate help files' and 'allow user
  configuration', there are still clear distinctions and merging them would
  only muddy the waters and confuse the reader. Integrate help files and
  allow user configuration are general software accessibility principles that
  we will probably only cover by reference in section 3, so the overlap is a
  mute point. 3 does not fit into 2 in any other way. Trying to make 2 more
  general to accomodate the principles in 3 would weaken the message.
