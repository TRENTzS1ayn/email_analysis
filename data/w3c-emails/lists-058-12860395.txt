I agree with Jutta. I think that the two parts of "making the tool
accessible" are clearly different and any attempt to merge the meaning
does confuse the issue. Obviously the two parts are related and thus
should remain part of the same document, but I have not heard a
convincing reason why anyone would be helped by placing the two
guideline sections into one long list.
