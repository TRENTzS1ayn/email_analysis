SUMMARY OF ACTION ITEMS:

   All: Review techniques as assigned.

   CMN: Review 25 Feb draft to propose verbiage for the
               following points (related to 2.2.2):
   
        - Use accessible standards.
        - If possible, use applicable W3C standards
        - Ensure that proprietary extensions to formats used
          by the authoring tool do not make content inaccessible.

   Ian: Propose clarifying Note to 1.5 that includes
                information about selection, editing e.g.,
                of a block, ease of selection.

   Ian: Send proposal for introductory text 
               to WG (already sent to CMN).

   Gregory: Review tersification of 1.3


Agenda 1) Review of techniques (DEADLINE: ONE WEEK)

   William/Gregory: Guideline 1.
   Charles: Guideline 2.
   Ian:     Guideline 3.
   Dick:    Guideline 4.
   Jan:     Guideline 5.
   Jutta:   Guideline 6.
   Kynn:    Guideline 7.

Agenda 2) Wording of 6.2 
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0393 
 
   DB: Don't like "presentation". Is this style?

   CMN: Prefer "nature"
 
   GR: Prefer "nature"

   DB: What are we trying to get at? Severity? Type?

   JR: Prefer "nature"
   
   Resolved: Ian will repropose if he can come up with something
             better, otherwise "nature".

Agenda 3) Priority of 1.1 
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0418 

   CMN: Knowing relative importance is not entirely a minus.
        Developers must understand their own guidelines. Will
        encourage development of good guidelines.
        Checkpoints needs a priority since must be checked.
        Should be relative. Intelligent people will have to
        make intelligent decisions. 
 
   JR: "Use" is sufficiently vague. Should only be "absolute"
       Priority 1.

   DB: I like wording of CMN's proposal.

   Resolved: Adopt CMN's (relative wording) proposal for 1.1.

Agenda 4) Scope of 2.2
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0384 

   Resolved: Change first sentence of Guideline 2.2 from
   "The first step towards producing content is conformance
    with standards, which promotes interoperability." to
    "Conformance with standards promotes interoperability
     and accessibility."

   Resolved: Checkpoint 2.2.2: Change "Extensions to W3C Recs"
    to "Proprietary extensions to W3C Recs". 

   IJ: I'm not sure why this is limited to W3C Recommendations, in fact.

   CMN: I agree that can be generalized.

   JR: Is this in scope.
 
   CMN: Yes. You could extend GIF and create accessibility
        features, and this would be in the scope of the WG.

   IJ: Proposed: 
        "Ensure that proprietary extensions to formats used
         by the authoring tool do not make content inaccessible."

   GR: Perhaps we need to resurrect version from 25 Feb Draft.

   CMN: We know that W3C specs don't cover everything. 

   Action CMN: Review 25 Feb draft to propose verbiage for the
               following points:
   
        - Use accessible standard.
        - If possible, use applicable W3C standards
        - Ensure that proprietary extensions to formats used
          by the authoring tool do not make content inaccessible.

Agenda 5) Wording of 1.4 and 1.5
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0413 

   IJ: Checkpoint 2.1.3: Propose changing from "Enable navigation
         and editing via the structure of the document" to
        "Allow the author to navigate and edit the
         document based on its structure."

   CMN: Proposes clarification:

      a) Allow the author to navigate the
         document based on its structure.
           NOTE: Minimal satisfation of this checkpoint
                 means allowing the user to navigate
                 element by element. Once the user has
                 navigated, the user must be able to
                 edit the document.

   DB: What does navigate mean exactly here?

   CMN: Move insertion point around. Think of "vi", which
        distinguishes viewing from editing mode. The two
        cursors don't move together (which is odd). In MS Word,
        you move scroll bars, which doesn't move insertion
        point. You need to be able to do both together.

   DB: Are we trying to tell people how to navigate?

   CMN: We're requiring a certain functionality. Others can
        co-exist, but you must be able to navigate and then
        edit. Need to be able to move (and edit) more than
        character by character or line by line. Might move
        paragraph to paragraph.

   DB: Proposes: "Ensure that the editing 
              view allows navigation by document structure."
  
   Resolved: Adopt this wording. 

   IJ: What is the difference between editing the document
       and editing the structure of the document?

   CMN: Gross level editing. Need more than to be able to
        extend the selection more than by character by 
        character.

   IJ: I think the term is "structured editing"

   DB: We're talking more about selection than editing. Need
       a means for the user to be able to set the selection
       easily.
             
   CMN: I think you need to mention editing since selection
       not always bound to editing.

   IJ: Proposes: "Ensure that the editing 
              view allows structured editing."

   IJ: How easy is it to verify this checkpoint? When have
       you satisfied the checkpoint (e.g., you can select
       tables but not headers)?

   DB: And how easy must it be? We want accessible selection
       and editing.

   CMN: 
     a) Want to pick up a piece of structure and move/copy/paste  
        as that structure. (Retains is properties as that object).
     b) Second requirement is being able to do this in a useful
        way.

   GR: "Allow the user to user to edit a structured tree view
       (or linearized version) of the document."

   DB: By the way, navigation from header to header is not
       obvious. Type A to type A navigation not obvious.

   CMN: Not required. Element to element sufficies.
        HotMeTal, Amaya, Word have outline views you can navigate.
        Word lets you move paragraph to paragraph. That would
        do the trick. 

   Action Ian: Propose clarifying Note to 1.5 that includes
                information about selection, editing e.g.,
                of a block, ease of selection.

   Action Gregory: Review tersification of 1.3

Agenda 6) Introductions to guidelines
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0385

   Action: Send proposal to WG (already sent to CMN).

Agenda 7) Moving forward to last call.

   a) Techniques need to be fleshed out before document goes
      to last call (Tim Berners-Lee requirement).

   CMN: Working on the techniques is really helpful to clarify
        the document. For this reason alone, well worth
        ensuring that techniques are fleshed out.

   Jutta: After techniques review next week, will estimate
          last call date.   

   William: When does Director review?

   IJ: No formal program for the Director to read the document.

   CMN: But the Director review comes after AC Member Review. 
       (and before PR as well).

Agenda 8) Accessibility of Amaya.
   http://www.w3.org/Amaya/

   CMN: We recognize accessibility problems. I'm going to
        Grenoble next week to talk to Amaya Team.

Next meeting: 14 July 1999
