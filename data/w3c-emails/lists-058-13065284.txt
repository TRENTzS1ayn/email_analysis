I propose that we replace checkpoint 2.2 with the following:

2.2: [Priority 1] 
     Ensure that content is created in accordance with a published
standard.
     This ensures that it is possible to create User Agents which are
aware of the standard being used, and relevant accessibility features.
For example, produce content whicvh conforms to a W3C specification
(see also 2.1). (CMN: I think this is sufficiently self-explanatory not
to require techniques beyond the example).

2.3: [Priority 1] 
     Do not use a document type which precludes users' access to
content or function of the document. 
     Some document types are inaccessible, and certain modifications to
existing types can reduce the accessibility. Both of these cases must
be avoided. (The techniques section for 2.2 applies to this checkpoint)
