We've been dealing with minutiae in the guidelines document (except, of
course the important techniques/samples part) for quite some time.  I
think what Jason White says (in a slightly different context) applies:

JW:: "It is easy to read absurdities into the guidelines by considering
individual checkpoints in abstraction from their context in the document
as a whole. However, this is not an appropriate strategy of
interpretation. I do not wish to imply that anyone has been
misinterpreting the text deliberately. Rather, I would suggest that the
tendency to concentrate on each checkpoint in isolation, for the purpose
of judging compliance, naturally leads to the overlooking of important
contextual details."

We should opt to get going in the last call department because within
the core of the WG we are pretty ready.  In fact IMHO we are much
farther along than the GLs were when they began the rather intense and
lengthy process with IG and the director.  We are quibbling about words
like "nature" and just one step back and seeing that it's all now
reasonably well covered in just 7 (count 'em  - seven) guidelines is a
job well done up to this point.
