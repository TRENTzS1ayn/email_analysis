From the guidelines:

> Techniques for 5.1:

> - In point-and-click environments, the visibility and ease of use of program features is often closely linked. Accessibility solutions may be given priority by their precedence in the ordering of menus, toolbars and lists, by their placement in dialogs, and by the availability of right-click and other shortcuts.

JR: - The simplicity of shortcut keys is also an important indicator of
importance.

> - If there is more than one option for the author, and one option
>   is more accessible than another, place the more accessible
>   option first and make it the default. For example, when
>   requesting alternative content for an image, offer an unchecked
>   option for empty alternative (i.e., alt="", implying the image
>   has no real function) with the cursor positioned in the text
>   entry for an "alt" value, rather than offering the filename as
>   a default suggestion, with the null "alt" value selected. 

JR: Not a great example; Edit- ... For example, when the user has
selected text to format, the use of CSS for colour should be emphasized
rather than FONT.




> Techniques for 5.2:

> - Ensure that accessible authoring practices can be easily
>   accessed by the author in a natural, intuitive fashion.

JR: Edit - Ensure that author can utilize the tool's accessible
authoring features by the same interaction styles used for other
features in the program. For example, if the tool makes use of onscreen
symbols such as underlines or coloration change rathher than dialogs for
conveying information, then the same interface techniques should be used
to convey accessibility information.

JR:- The same fonts, text sizes, colours, symbols, etc. that
characterize other program features should also characterize those
dealing with accessibility.

JR: - The important point is that authors should never receive the
impression that the accessibility features are alien or unnecessary to
the routine production of web content.
 


> - Include considerations for accessibility - such as the "alt"
>   and "longdesc" attributes of the IMG element- right below the
>   "src" attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an
>   "Advanced..." button. 

JR: Edit - give higher consideration to important accessibility
properties - such as the "alt" and "longdesc" attributes of the IMG
element. For example, the input fields for these attributes might be
placed immediately below "src" in a dialog box for higher visibility.
Placing them below other more obscure attributes or in child dialogs
would greatly diminish their visibility.

> - Allow efficient and fast access to accessibility-related settings
>   with as few steps as possible needed to make any changes that
>   will generate accessible content. 

JR: edit: ...any changes that will contribute to the production of
accessible content



> - Do not set accessibility features off to the side as some
>   optional "module"; rather, make them a part of the core operation
>   of the authoring tool.

JR: Edit - "the accessibility features are designed as integral
components of the authoring tool application.They are not plu-ins or
other peripheral components that need to be separately obtained,
installed, configured or executed."



> - The "factory settings" default configuration for the authoring
>   tool should favor accessible solutions "out of the box", for the
>   benefit of newer users. 

JR: Edit - "the default installation of the authoring tool includes all
accessibility features enabled. The author will always have the option
to disable these features later on."



> - A help page that describes how to make an image map should include
>   adding alternative content for each AREA in the MAP as part of the
>   process. Any examples of code should give either block content
>   with text links, or AREA elements that all have relevant ALT
>   attribute values. 
> - When a user creates a frameset, suggest the main content page and
>   a navigation bar as the content for NOFRAMES.

JR: the two preceding techniques are just a couple of the possible
practices that a tool might integrate. The techniques should be a higher
level of abstraction. Recommend REMOVAL.
