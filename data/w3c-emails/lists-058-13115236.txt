After reading several of the referred-to documents in the techniques 
list, I became convinced that there should be an "ambience" kind of 
lead-in that emphasizes the need for the developer to become 
immersed in this stuff.  We are not going to be able to make many 
specific objectively testable checkoff items but must depend on the 
"intent-to-conform" on the developer's part. The "any intelligent 
reader" attitude should prevail - after all this is not casual reading 
matter for some random web surfers.  

1.1 The notion of what priority level this checkpoint should have is 
less important than securing the cooperation of the folks developing 
the tool.  Almost any of the references are fairly comprehensive 
and they are also mostly almost identical.  It should be priority 1 to 
do this stuff but there should be some way to reward intent. At 
some point there will have to be negotiation as to whether 
conformance is sufficiently complete to warrant a "seal of approval" 
- in whatever form.

1.2 "author...their" number problem - we've been using "her" with 
singular referents - in this case we could change the number to 
"authors" instead.

"the way the document looks or is rendered when published." 
might be successfully curtailed.

"audio style sheets" might warrant a definition or link to 
example/description.

1.3 "Enable the author to view a document in its "source" mode." 
Since the "tersification" mandate need only apply in the raw 
guidelines document, this should be expanded so people like me 
have some idea what it's talking about.

"Allow the author to specify that filenames or alternative content 
are rendered in place of images or other multimedia content while 
editing." Might be "...in place of, or in addition to..."

"Include attributes / properties of elements in a view of the 
structure." warrants an example.

"An authoring tool may offer several views of the same document." 
...preferably with simultaneous updating when edited.

1.4 "To minimally satisfy this checkpoint, allow navigation from 
element to element." Perhaps expand this to something that will 
*ideally* satisfy like a user-configured "structural leapabout" similar 
to a search function.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
