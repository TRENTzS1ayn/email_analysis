aloha, all!

although this may fall in the realm of wordsmithing, i thought it important
enough to bring up on-list

Current Wording:(9 July draft)
1.2 Allow the author to change the editing view without affecting the document
markup. [Priority 1] 

GJR's Proposed Wording:
1.2 Allow the author to change the editing view without changing the document
markup. [Priority 1]

why? changing is more forceful and more to the point...  affecting is too mild
a word, in my opinion--we need to explicit state, in the strongest possible
terms, that the document markup _MUST NOT_ be changed...

just my halfpenny's worth (with a nod to charles and apologies to ian),
gregory
