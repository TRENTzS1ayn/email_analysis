aloha, all!

based on the discussion of checkpoint 1.3 during the 7 July teleconference,
i find Checkpoint 1.3 extremely unclear...  hence, i propose re-wording the
current 1.3 and adding a separate checkpoint.

in recent drafts--including, he added redundantly, the current, 9 July,
draft located at:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990709/>
Checkpoint 1.3 reads:

1.3 Allow the author to display and edit each element, object, and
property. [Priority 1]

i propose splitting this checkpoint as follows:

1.3 Allow the author to display and edit the properties of each element and
object. [Priority 1]
1.X Allow the author to display a non-visual equivalent of each element,
object, and property. [Priority 1]

as for numbering, i would advocate that the new checkpoint--if approved--be
numbered 1.4, and that the numbers of the current 1.4 and 1.5 be
re-numbered 1.5 and 1.6, respectively...

gregory.
