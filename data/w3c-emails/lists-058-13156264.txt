In regard to having a checkpoint "split" from 1.3 that specifies "non-
visual" format availability, I just wonder how the authoring tool will 
do that?  I understand how the author's screen reader will do it if it's 
text.  I seem to remember "textual equivalent" from somewhere in 
the document and that might be more appropriate?
