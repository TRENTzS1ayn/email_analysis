I'm not certain that the splitis the best way to do it. I would prefer a
reminder note in the checkpoint that access to editing and rendering objects
must be accessible, so there must be appropriate equivalents for visual
representations, but I would hope that 1.1 already covers the requirement to
make things available in an accessible way in general.

  text.  I seem to remember "textual equivalent" from somewhere in 
  the document and that might be more appropriate?
