Hello,

As per my action item of the 7 July telecon, here's proposed 
text for the introduction. Comments from Charles are 
delimited by <CMN> and </CMN>. 

  <p>To understand the accessibility issues relevant to
    authoring tool design, consider that many users may be creating
    documents in contexts very different from your own:</P>

<CMN> 
      I would trim this and relate it more directly 
      to disabilities, then follow it
      with a sentence noting that although many of the requirements in
this
      document apply equally well to users of mobile devices, etc etc,
this
      is specifically targetted to address the problems of disabled
users.
</CMN>
  
  <UL>
     <LI>They may not be able to see, hear, move, or
         may not be able to process some types of 
         information easily or at all.
     <LI>They may have difficulty reading or comprehending text.
     <LI>They may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse.
     <LI>They may have a text-only screen, a small screen, or
         a slow Internet connection.
     <LI>They may be in a situation where their eyes, ears, or
         hands are busy or interfered with (e.g., driving to work, 
         working in a loud environment, etc.).
    </UL>
  
  <P>The guidelines in this document are designed to help authoring tool
  developers understand, and thereby reduce, accessibility barriers to
  the creation of Web content.  In these guidelines, the
  term <em>authoring tool</em> refers to a wide range of software,
  including:</P>
  
  <ul>
  <li>
  Editing tools specifically designed to produce Web content (e.g.,
<abbr
  title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> HTML editors, SMIL
  authoring packages);
  </li>
  <li>
  Tools that offer the option of saving material in a Web format (e.g.,
  word processors or desktop publishing packages);
  </li>
  <li>
  Tools that translate documents into Web formats (e.g., filters to
  translate desktop publishing formats to HTML);
  </li>
  <li>
  Tools that produce multimedia, especially where it is intended for use
  on the Web (e.g., video production and editing suites);
  </li>
  <li>
  Tools for site management or site publication, including on-the-fly
  conversion and Web site publishing tools;
  </li>
  <li>
  Tools for management of layout (e.g., CSS formatting tools).
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <P>An <em>accessible authoring tool</em> is accessible software that
  produces accessible content for the Web. For information about the
  production of accessible content this document defers to the Web
  Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].
  
  <P>This document does not directly address the general design of
  accessible software.  Instead, users may refer to the Techniques
  Document ([AU-TECHNIQUES]), which lists references to vendor-specific
  software accessibility guidelines.
  
  <P>This document does, however, discuss design issues directly related
  to accessible authoring tools. On such issue is automation. Authoring
  tools should automate the mechanical aspects of content development
  for two reasons:</P>
  
<CMN> Seems like an uncomfortable segue. Do we need it here?</CMN>

  <OL>
  <LI>In many cases, it is easier for the tool to 
  ensure that generated content meets the requirements of the 
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
  <LI>Automation allows users to reduce
  repetitive work and to concentrate instead on accessible authoring 
  practices that require human creativity 
  (such as authoring alternative text).
  </OL>
  
  <P>In addition to automation, the guidelines discuss how
  documentation, navigation mechanisms, prompts, the adoption of system
  conventions, and other features will result in authoring tools that
  allow users to create content regardless of disability.
