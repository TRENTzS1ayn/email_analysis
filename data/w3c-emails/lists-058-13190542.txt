Checkpoint 3.1:

  a) Add Note about SMIL 1.0 accessibility features. To appear
     soon.

  b) Add link to UAGL Techniques, which will
     have useful information for tool developers

Checkpoint 3.2:

  a) I don't think the current techniques apply as
     they are addressed by checkpoint 3.1 techniques.

  b) Instead, add or refer to what is covered in the
     section on Validation in WCAG 1.0 [1]. These are
     techniques to help people create documents that conform.
     Checkpoint 3.1 is about how to create accessible documents.

Checkpoint 3.3:

  a) Same comment as above: I don't think the current
     techniques apply as they are addressed by 
     checkpoint 3.1 techniques.

  b) What distinguishes a template from a document that
     would deserve special attention? Users must
     be able to choose, fill out, edit a
     template in a device-independent manner. I can't
     think of much else right now.

Checkpoint 3.4:

  I need more time to think about this one!
