I first reviewed the previous version but then noticed just this morning
that the July 13 draft had been posted.

This is what's there:

Implementation: The authoring tool is shipped with many ready-to-use clip
art and other images. For each of these images a short "alt-text" string and
a longer description have been pre-written and stored in an "alt-text"
registry. When the user selects one of these images for insertion, the
alternative text and long description are offered for editing and approval.
Whenever the user includes another image, the tool keeps the reference to
that image and the associated "alt-text" and long description in the
"alt-text registry". When a text alternative offered by the tool is edited,
the tool adds the new text to the registry, and offers both entries when the
image is used again. There is an option to mark any entry as the default. 

This seems OK for images, but inadequate for other multimedia content
mentioned in the guideline such as audio and video. How should the authoring
tool deal with captions, etc.?

Also, are we recommending that the authoring tool maintain references for
images, etc. from other applications? If I use a JPG image once, and then
import it again later (rather than reusing what's already in my authoring
tool), is the authoring tool supposed to remember it and associate it with
the alt text I used the first time?
