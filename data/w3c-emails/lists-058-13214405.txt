The checkpoints are 

Use applicable w3c specifications

and

Proprietary extensions must not make content inaccessible

For the fisrt one I suggest that we actually include in the techniques a
brief list of the current recommendations, and an even briefer note about
working drafts which are expected to become recommendations in the future, as
well as providing the reference to them.

For the second checkpoint, I think we should refer to the WCAG. I will also
write up a short proposal, but it will not be today.
