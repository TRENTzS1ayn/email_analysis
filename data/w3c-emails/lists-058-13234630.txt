Guideline 7. Promote accessibility in help and documentation

The issues surrounding Web accessibility are often unknown to
Web authors. Help and documentation should explain accessibility
problems and solutions, with examples.

DEFINITION:  'Documentation' includes electronic help files,
printed documentation, interactive tutorials, manual pages,
context-sensitive help and other instructional/reference
materials.  [In techniques below, "help text" and similar
terms have been replaced with 'documentation' or eliminated
altogether if clear from context.]

Checkpoints:

7.1 Integrate accessible authoring practices in all applicable
    help topics. [Priority 1]

Ensure that accessibility solutions are present in all documentation 
descriptions of markup practices (e.g., IMG elements should appear 
with "alt-text" and a "longdesc" attribute wherever appropriate).

Link from documentation to any automated correction utilities.

Link those mechanisms used to identify accessibility problems 
(e.g., icons, outlining or other emphasis within the user 
interface) to help files.

If documentation is provided in HTML format, ensure that the
documentation itself is in compliance with WCAG. [new, KB]

Model accessible design practices in tutorials.  (For example,
include an exercise in which authors are expected to provide
ALT text for images.) [new, KB]

7.2 Explain the accessible authoring practices supported by the 
authoring tool. [Priority 1]

Include documentation for all accessible authoring practices
supported by the tool.

Document the tool's compliance with the WAI Authoring Tool
guidelines and compliance level.  [new, KB]

Provide examples of all accessibility solutions in help text, 
including those of lower Web-Content-Priority.  [Moved from 7.1]

Implement context-sensitive help for all special accessibility 
terms as well as tasks related to accessibility. [Moved from 7.1]

Include a current version of all applicable W3C standards (e.g.,
HTML 4.0, CSS levels 1 and 2) in documentation.  [new, KB]

Include a current version of the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines in documentation. [new, KB]

Link to or provide URLs for more information on accessible web
authoring, such as:
  * Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
  * W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
  * HTML Writers Guild AWARE Center
  * CAST'S Bobby Service
  * W3C HTML Validator
  * W3C CSS Validator
  * Platform-specific or operating-system-specific resources,
    such as Microsoft's web accessibility page if a Microsoft
    product
  [new, KB]

Include a tutorial specifically on checking for and correcting
web accessibility problems. [new, KB]

7.3 Do not use inaccessible markup in examples. [Priority 1]

Ensure that documentation examples conform to the Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].  [deleted
term "triple-A", KB]

Clearly label as "inaccessible" any examples which display
practices that reduce accessibility. [new]

7.4 Emphasize the universal benefit of accessible design. 
[Priority 3]

When explaining the accessibility barriers of non-deprecated
elements, emphasize appropriate solutions rather than
explicitly discouraging the use of the element.

Explain the importance of utilizing accessibility features 
generally and for specific instances.

Emphasize accessibility features that benefit multiple groups.

Take a broad view of accessibility-related practices; for example,
do not refer to ALT text as being "for blind users" but rather
as "for users who are not viewing images." [new, KB]

Avoid labelling accessibility features of the tool with a
"handicapped" icon, as this can give the impression that 
accessible design practices only benefit disabled users.
