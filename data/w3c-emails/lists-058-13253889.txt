Thanks to Jim Allan for taking minutes. They are posted at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-14jul99

There are a number of statements that are assigned to the wrong people.
Please remember that it is often difficult on the phone to distinguish
people's voices, so unless you have a wierder accent than mine please try to
remember to say who you are. If anybody can identify errors please send mail
to the list and I will correct the minutes. Also, a general rule is that the
scribe can always stop and request clarification. This is the only way we can
get a good record of the meeting, and they are important documents, not least
because the editors have to work from them.

Cheers

Charles McCN
