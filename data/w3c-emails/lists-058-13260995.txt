To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


I have been in Grenoble the last couple of days working with the Amaya team
(w3c's testbed browser/editor) on what needs to be done to implement the
guidelines as they are currently. It was a pretty useful experience.

There were a couple of guidelines which it was not rapidly obvious how they
could be implemented, and for the Amaya team perhaps the biggest barrier to
compliance is 1.1 - the program was not designed to be accessible, so it is
going to take a bit of retro-fitting. However although meeting the
requirements will require some work, it is clear that it can be done even by
a small team who are at the same time being called on to implement every new
technology of the w3c as a proof of concept.

The checkpoint which seemed most difficult to understand in terms of how it
needed to be implemented was 4.2, and I will ahve a bit of a think about it
over the weekend. Most of the others seemed to be pretty straightforward
without resorting to the techniques document. Amaya has a user interface
which is in some cases very different from the widespread tools, so in some
cases the techniques used are quite interesting.

I will attempt to write up the techniques currently used or proposed over the
weekend where they are new ideas.
