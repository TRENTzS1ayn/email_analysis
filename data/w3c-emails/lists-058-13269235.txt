I strongly support the idea that one of our internal "desk checks" is the
ability to create at least one implementable technique to satisfy each
checkpoint. I am not sure whether we want to formally label each technique
(since they get well into the area of user interface and other questions whch
should be resolved by developers). I think the idea of explaining minimal
conformance to a checkpoint as a note in the guidelines document is better
where it is appropriate.

checkpoints are 'please do this'. Techniques are all just ideas about how - I
would hope that we can come up with three or four techniques for each
checkpoint which are contradictory, in the sense that they assume different
user interfaces. This is the best way of making the point that user
interfaces differ, and solutions need to be appropriate to the particular
user interface of a tool (which is in fact a checkpopint - Grin).

  Each technique is associated with a checkpoint.  Therefore, it may
  be useful to label techniques with the following:
  
       [Partially]      This technique partially satisfies the
                        associated checkpoint.
       [Minimally]      This technique minimally satisfies the
                        associated checkpoint.
       [Completely]     This technique completely satisfies the
                        associated checkpoint.
  
  This may make it clearer which techniques are just "extra ideas"
  and which ones are "please, please do this".
  
  Also, this may help us to organize our own thinking on techniques
  if we REQUIRE ourselves to create at least one [M] or [C]
  technique per checkpoint.  If we can't provide at least one
  satisfactory solution per checkpoint, then there is something
  wrong with that checkpoint!
