genda and new draft are now online

See the group page for links everywhere - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU

I will be in Sophia tomorrow, and hope I will be able to attend the call - if
not, I send my regrets in advance. I will try to send a further discussion
(more detail) from my meeting with the Amaya team in Grenoble.

Regarding my action item from the last meeting, to investigate further
information about accessibility of markup languages in general, I have been
at the WAI Protocols and Formats group meeting today. That group has agreed
to make available a preliminary set of notes on the topic which we could use
in the relevant part of the techniques document. Hopefully it will be
available some time next week.

Cheers

Charles McCN
