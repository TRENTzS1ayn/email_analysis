Ian, Wendy and I will be together, and we will probably all be unable to make
the call. So unless something happens to change that I am sending regrets for
us all (and Bruce is still away I believe).

Unfortunately I have not had time to work out a new proposal for 4.2, but
based on the experience of working with the Amaya team on an implementation
plan that we need to clarify how that checkpoint can be fulfilled. (the
techniques document offers strategies for doing the things we want, but the
checkpoint as written is not really possible to verify.


Cheers
