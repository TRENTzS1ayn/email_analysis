aloha, y'all!

whilst my rewording of the current (20 July 1999) checkpoint 5.1 was approved 
during the 21 July teleconference, i would like to further propose that:

1) the current 5.2 (which is a P1) be renumbered 5.1
2) reword the current (20 July 1999) 5.1 as follows, and re-number it 5.2
(retaining P2 status)

--- begin reworded 5.2
5.2 When presenting the author with a choice of implementation strategies,
ensure 
that the highest-priority accessible authoring practices are among the most
obvious 
and easily initiated by the author. [Priority 2]
--- end reworded 5.2

NOTE 1: the rewording of the current 5.1 incorporates Kynn's proposal that
the word 
"among" be added.

NOTE 2: the rewording was approved during the 21 July teleconference

NOTE 3: personally, i believe the current 5.1 is a P1, rather than a P2,
but that's another argument for another time...
