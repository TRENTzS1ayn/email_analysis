The PF group has drafted some thoughts about accessibility of document types
(profiles is the term that Al Gilman favours to make it clear that this is
not the same as an XML DTD in the strict sense, although it encompasses that
usage). They are now publicly available, although they are not formalised as
a deliverable of the group. However I prpose that we incorporate them into
the techniqes for checkpoint 2.3 (we can update them as often as the PF group
does, or we can adapt them as we see fit.

they are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/xmlgl
