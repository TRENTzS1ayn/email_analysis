One of the things we should have before wego to last call is a good set of
techniques. These need to be both general abstracted principles which are
explained, rather than listed for verification, and specific examples of how
it might be done, which of course makes all sorts of a ssumptions about user
interfaces etc. That is not a problem, so long as those assumptions are clear
from teh technique text, since the techniques do not have to be implemented,
but are merely provided in a separate document as further guideance to
developers wishing to implement the checkpoints and looking for ideas, or for
several different explanations in order to better understand the checkpoint.

One of the questions that we might want to answer is whether the techniques
are satisfactory as a list of points, or whether we should be trying to
create a more flowing prose framework for them. Alternatively we can let the
document go to the wider review audience of a last call and see if it is
raised as an issue.
