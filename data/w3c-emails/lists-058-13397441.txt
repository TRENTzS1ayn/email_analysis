Sorry I will not be able to join in Wednesday's call.  I will be on a plane
again.  Last call I was on a plane.  Life/work has been busier than I had
expected since our last face to face in Toronto.  Some progress has been made
with another IBM HTML authoring tool development team.

Regards,
Phill Jenkins
