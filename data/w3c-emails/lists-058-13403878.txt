Charles,

Unfortunately, we don't have much data back about whether people
like/find useful the WCAG Techniques document. I think that the
document needs to be readable on its own, which to me implies that
some wrapper prose is necessary.

How to get this done? Should the editors generate prose? The Working
Group?
