The major point I was trying to make is that there are cases where a
broad-based, abstract introduction is helpful, and others where a minutely
detailed example is the most use. Often different people will look for
different types of technique in the same checkpoint, so I think we need to
have them all. I am inclined to agree with Ian that we can add prose wrapping
after the last call (and I expect that part of monitoring the guidelines in a
post-recommendation phase will be to further refine the techniques based on
longer and more extensive implementation experience, even if the guidelines
themselves are perfect in version 1.0).

(I will write up the details of my meeting with the Amaya folks, and my
thoughts on the one checkpoint that seemed problematic)

  Mahalo, Gregory, for that comment. It would suffice then to
  alert people that prose will be added after last call.
