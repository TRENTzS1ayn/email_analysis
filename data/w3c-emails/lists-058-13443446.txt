(In the july 9 draft, checkpoint 4.2 requires prmopting authors for
structural information.

This seems to me redundant - the only times the tool knows about missing
structural information are when it is doing a check of the accessibilityas
per guideline 6, or when htat information is a standard type of alternative
content as per checkpoint 4.1

I suggest we investigate removing 4.2, and splitting its various techniques
between 4.1 and appropraite checkpoints in guideline 6. This should make it
easier to understand what is required of a developer.
