Gregory, I agree - "we desperately need more of this type of review." But it is
very difficult to get. When I visited the Top Page developers in Tokyo earlier
this month, I tried to get them to be involved. They were not willing to take
the time to participate.

Top Page in the US is Home Page Builder in Japan. My understanding is that Home
Page Builder is the top selling web authoring tool in Japan. They are
implementing a neat accessibility checker for the next version. Checking alt
text, for example puts the user in an situation to easily to fix the problem,
when alt text not present.

You can select which features you want checked. The default will be to check for
alt text for active images, for page titles, EMBED Loops, and OBJECT Contents. I
believe all Syntactic features can be chosen for checking.
