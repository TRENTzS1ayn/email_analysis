Here are my thoughts on the techniques for Guideline 6:

Techniques for Guideline 6

Generally:
Do we wish to mention linking in Bobby, A-prompt or other checking and
verification tools?

6.1 States: Highlight problems detected when documents are opened, or when
an editing or insertion action is completed.
I would change the second phrase to " or while the author is editing."
I propose adding a reference to spell checking within a word processor:
"Access concerns can be highlighted using strategies similar to spell
checking within a word processor. Access alerts within the document can be
linked to context sensitive help."

6.2
We have "Allow authors to control both the nature and timing of the
correction process." as a technique. Do we want to change the checkpoint to
include correction process?
Thus it would read:
"Allow users to control both the nature and timing of accessibility alerts
and the associated correction process." [Priority 2]
6.3
Do we want to add:
"To make correction more efficient, the author can be given the choice to
make corrections by type of error and where appropriate to make site-wide
changes."

6.4 There were several specific problems that led to this checkpoint,
should we be more explicit about the access concerns here?
Do we want to change this checkpoint to "When changing or removing?" to
catch swapping of standard markup to proprietary markup?

6.6 Do we want to change this checkpoint to read: "Allow the author to
perform or specify tag transformations." In order to cover tag
transformations that are already happening during conversion. We want the
author to be able to specify what the transformation will be. Should we
have somewhere a checkpoint stating that the transformation should favor
accessibility?

There are some grammar corrections needed in the remaining section.
