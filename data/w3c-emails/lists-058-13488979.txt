Unfortunately I wasn't able to talk to the FrontPage and Office folks about
GLs 4 and 5 but hope to send their comments to the list by next week.

aloha, ian!

what we desperately need is the input of persons actually slash intimately
involved in the development process, which is why i am particularly
interested
in dick brown's report on his action item -- viz, to show the techniques for
GLs 4 and 5 to FrontPage and Office team members, so as to solicit their
opinion...  we desperately need more of this type of review, and we need to
take advantage of those WG members (such as bruce roberts) who are actually
involved in the design and implementation of authoring tools...  we also
need
to hear what the Amaya developers had to say to charles, vis a vis that
tool's
conformance the AU GL, so as to fine-tune and strengthen not only the
techniques document, but so as to ensure that we haven't over-tersified the
GL
before taking it to last call...

only after we get input from developers on the techniques, should we worry
about "wrapper prose",
gregory.
