aloha, y'all!

During the 28 July teleconference, it was decided by all in attendance that the
current Checkpoint 6.4:

quote
When removing unrecognized markup, alert the author (according to a
configurable schedule). [Priority 2] 
unquote

needs to be re-worked.  Thus I propose the following:

6.4 When the tool encounters markup which it does not recognize, ensure that it
alerts the author, but that it does not change the unrecognized markup without 
the author's consent. [Priority 2]

Which is a sentiment which is, perhaps, more clearly stated thus:

6.4 When the tool encounters markup which it does not recognize, ensure that it
alerts the author. The tool should not change the unrecognized markup without 
the author's consent. [Priority 2]

I would also advocate the addition of the following note:

NOTE: This should be implemented on a user-configurable schedule.
