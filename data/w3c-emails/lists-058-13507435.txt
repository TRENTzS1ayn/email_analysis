I woulod suggest domething along the following lines:

Allow the author to override any removal of unrecognised markup.
Notes: 1. This need not be a default option. 2. The author may have included
(or imported) markup which is more accessible than that recognised by the
tool.

  During the 28 July teleconference, it was decided by all in attendance that the
  current Checkpoint 6.4:
  
  quote
  When removing unrecognized markup, alert the author (according to a
  configurable schedule). [Priority 2] 
  unquote
  
  needs to be re-worked.  Thus I propose the following:
  
  6.4 When the tool encounters markup which it does not recognize, ensure that it
  alerts the author, but that it does not change the unrecognized markup without 
  the author's consent. [Priority 2]
  
  Which is a sentiment which is, perhaps, more clearly stated thus:
  
  6.4 When the tool encounters markup which it does not recognize, ensure that it
  alerts the author. The tool should not change the unrecognized markup without 
  the author's consent. [Priority 2]
  
  I would also advocate the addition of the following note:
  
  NOTE: This should be implemented on a user-configurable schedule.
