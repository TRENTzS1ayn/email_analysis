I propose we remove this checkpoint, as it is redundant with 4.1 (which
should have a note on it to make the requirement for information like
title of abbr as well as alt of img explicit, and with 6.1 and 6.3 I
propose that the techniques and examples given be distributed as
appropriate to those checkpoints.
