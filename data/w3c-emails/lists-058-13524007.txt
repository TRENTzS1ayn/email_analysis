aloha, y'all!

since i have yet to receive an agenda for this afternoon's meeting, and
since one has yet to be posted to the AU web space, i would like to ask
that consideration of the following be added...  please note that the
following items are listed in chronological order

1. discussion of the my proposal that checkpoint 1.3 be reworded and
(perhaps) split, along with William and Charles' follow-up comments -- for
the beginning of this discussion, consult:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0013.html>

2. my proposal for the re-organization of Guideline 5, contained in:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0036.html>
upon which, no one commented -- William, i feel your oft-articulated pain!

3. my proposed re-wording of Checkpoint 6.4, along with Charles' comments
-- consult:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0055.html>
and<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0056.html>
