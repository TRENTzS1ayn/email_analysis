There will be a meeting today from 3:30 to 4:30 (note shorter time). As
Charles is in transit and I cannot publish to the W3 site there is no
agenda on the site, and the minutes of last week's meeting have not been
posted.

The phone number to call is: +1 (617) 252 7000

The agenda for today is:
1. Review of techniques for guideline 7 (Kynn).

And the three agenda items suggested by Gregory:
1. discussion of the proposal that checkpoint 1.3 be reworded and
(perhaps) split, along with William and Charles' follow-up comments -- for
the beginning of this discussion, consult:

2. proposal for the re-organization of Guideline 5, contained in:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0036.html>

3. proposed re-wording of Checkpoint 6.4, along with Charles' comments
-- consult:
