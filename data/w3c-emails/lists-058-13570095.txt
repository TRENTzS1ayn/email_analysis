Please feel free to forward this to the group at w3c-wai-au@w3.org if you feel
that it is useful.  Note that I am not subscribed so will not see reactions
but will check the archive.

I should add one comment to my original email.  CAST's approach to Universal
Design for Learning assumes that all mainstream products, including curriculum
materials, should be pedagogically sound, fully accessible, and meet
additional requirements pertaining to multiple representations, maleability of
content, multimple means of control, and provide for various forms of
expression.  We intend for this to serve all learners, and by the way, be
fully supportive of those with learning, sensory, and physical differences.

That electric door opener is a wonderful support for me when I enter CAST with
the burden of laptop, handheld, and brief case.  I don't really need the
button - but it's great for everyone, just like well designed curbcuts.

Chuck

Chuck,

Does that mean you are happy with a suggestion to avoid the use of
disability-specific iconography, as a possible technique for helping to
emphasize the universal benefits of accessible design? If so, can I (or you)
forward your response to the authoring tools list (publicly archived) at
w3c-wai-au@w3.org for the group, who were interested in your answer to the
question?

Charles

  Hi Charles,

  The wheelchair sign is most often considered an icon for physical
disabilities
  so it is probably smart to avoid it when generalizing to sensory, physical
  and cognitive disabilities.  We did it in Bobby on the helmut to make it
clear
  that this was about disability in a way that would be unmistakable
worldwide.
  We had mixed feelings about doing it but felt the benefits outweighed the
  liabilities and would do it again today if starting over.

  I would suggest finding a better way and would be pleased to change Bobby
when
  a better method is proposed and agreed to.

  Hope all is well,
  Chuck

  Chuck,

  The Authoring tools group has a checkpoint in our draft guidelines
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990728 under the guideline to promote
  accessible design within elp and documentation, which says "emphasise
  universal benefits of accessible design". One of the techniques which has
  been proposed, and will be in the next internal working draft, is to avoid
  the use of disability-specific iconography such as wheelchair signs.

  We thought you guys might have an opinion on whether this is a sensible
  suggestion or not.

  Charles
