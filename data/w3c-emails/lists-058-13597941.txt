There is a new draft - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-199990805

The minutes for the 28 july meeting are now linked from the home page. I got
them after I had done the draft, and there are a few things that have been
decided but not incorporated. I will update the changes history (for the last
couple of drafts) and see how many changes have been decided buyt not
incorporated - if there are lots, or if people ask for it, I might do another
new draft this evening.
