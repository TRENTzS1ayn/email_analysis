Dear all, I have updated the changes list, and there are only technique level
changes that are outstanding, so I suggest we wait until the next draft to
incorporate them (all of a week).

I have also done a re-organisation of the AU page to bring it into line with
the other guideline group pages. There has been some improvement in the
markup, and hopefully also in the usability of the page. Comments are
welcome, as are suggestions about how to improve the page. I'm also curious
about how often people within the group use the various pages.
