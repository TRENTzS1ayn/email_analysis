I suggest that we place guidelines which have relative priority the same as
those which have priority 1, except in the case of 1.1, which I suggest we
leave as 1.1.

I also suggest that we retain 2.1 in its position despite the fact that it is
P2.

So in the reordering I have in mind the changes would be to put 6.2 after the
current 6.4, and 4.4 after the current 4.1.
