Dear Sirs,

In 1999 I translated the first edition of the XML specification to swedish with the help 
of my partners Gustaf Liljegren and Jan ?stberg. 
Now we have updated the translation from the 1st to the 3rd edition and continued 
with the XML 1.1 specification. Six years of XML implementation experience has 
given us a good opportunity to improve the translation, we think. 

Today we have published the new translations on our web site 
http://www.xml.se/xml/REC-xml-sv and http://www.xml.se/xml/REC-xml11-sv
