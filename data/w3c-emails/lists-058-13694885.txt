Here's an issue: does it have to be for the Web? Does an intranet count?
in the UAGL, we are facing a similar puzzle: we say that documentation
must conform to the WCAG. Does this mean electronic documentation
only? Documentation for  the Web only? This is an open issue for the
UAGL WG.

I don't like the previous transitional sentence, but I don't have
a substitute for now.

The word "Accompanying" will confuse people. In WCAG we say
"In a separate document..."

I propose simplifying the above sentence to:

"A separate document, entitled "...." [AU-TECHNIQUES], provides
suggestions and examples of how each checkpoint might be satisfied.
It also includes references to other accessibility resources 
(including software accessibility guidelines) that shed additional
light on how a tool may satisfy each checkpoint.

Propose replacing "," by full stop. Then start next sentence
with "Please note that while..."

Change "is intendetd as an informative adjunct to" to "complements"

Change comma to full stop.

Any interest in mentioning changes in technology? That may be part of 
queries.

I don't like the term "yet". It sounds ominous, almost threatening.
I understand that this may refer to people aging, but it's not necessary
editorially.

Propose changing "but who are in a variety of situations which give
them similar needs" to "but with analogous functional requirements."
