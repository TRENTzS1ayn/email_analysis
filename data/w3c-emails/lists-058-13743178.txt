aloha, ian!

there is only one answer to your question:
        >Does an intranet count?
and a simple one at that -- yes, of course it does

i firmly believe that all of the WAI's work applies equally to any medium --
such as educational CD-ROMs or the next generation talking book -- that
utilizes what were once referred to as quote web-based technologies unquote,
whether the markup language used is be SMIL, HTML, XML, PML, SVG, etc. -- or
some combination thereof...  in an interoperable universe, isn't the medium as
irrelevant as the platform?  clearly, all of the WAI's work applies to all of
the recommendations issued by the W3C, does it not?  and our verbiage (see, for
example, checkpoints 2.2; 3.1, 3.2 and  3.3) seems to suggest that our work is
equally applicable to the work of other consortia -- such as NISO, ISO, and
IETF -- upon which the W3C's work has dependencies...

since the web site through which one updates one's multimedia encyclopedia is
covered by the WCAG, shouldn't the presentation of the multimedia
encyclopedia's content also be guided by the WCAG? and, shouldn't the tools
that create the CD-ROM and the dependent web site be covered by the AU
Guidelines?  why, then, should there be any doubt whether the intranet (or
intranets) of the company or companies that produce the CD-ROM and/or the
associated web site (and the tools that are used in the all four processes) are
covered by (relevant) WAI guidelines?
