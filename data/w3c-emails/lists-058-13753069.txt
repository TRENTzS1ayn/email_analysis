In general I agree with Gregory - if a network is created using Web
technology then it is in our areea of interest. In practical terms what does
that mean for the guidelines? Nothing much, so far as I can see, unless we
want to put in a line saying that we think intranets are included in this.
Personally I'm not sure that it is that important or valuable, but I don't
have a strong feeling on the matter.
