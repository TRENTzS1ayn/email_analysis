To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

Along with these regrets I would like to call attention to a mindset
exam in connection with the AU guidelines/checkpoints/techniques: we are
almost entirely attending to these insofar as they deal with a major
league authoring tool and there should be a probably separate addressing
to the developers who would make it surpassingly simple to put stuff on
the Web without any knowledge of anything on the part of the publisher.

It is hard to conceive of a word processor that attends to all our
urgings about making all docs deal with accessibility issues, etc. It is
difficult to imagine that a graphics program will do much if anything
and if we could hit the ALT="text" base pretty hard it might be all we
can hope for. 

Anyway, I feel that we've attended too little to this area so perhaps
some suggestions about content covering *just* the "save as HTML"
problem would prove fruitful.
