Folks,

please note that this meeting would be on at the same time as the ATIA
meeting in Orlando, Florida. If the time is impossible for anyone please let
us know as soon as possible - at the moment the next closest possible times
are a week earlier (which will cut into the time available for last call
review) or ten days later (which will possibly push our schedule back
further).

cheers

Charles

  Dear all,
  
  a "heads-up". Hoping that we will have a last call review shortly (see my
  next email) we are planning a face to face meeting at which we can resolve
  issues raised, and generally tidy the document up (write up lots more good
  techniques). At the moment we are talking to a potential host in the Boston
  area about a meeting on thursday and friday 7-8 October. More details as they
  come to hand.
