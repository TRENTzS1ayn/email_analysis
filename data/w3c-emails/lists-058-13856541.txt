currently it reads "do not use inaccessible markup in examples [p1]"

I propose that we change it to

"Clearly identify any missing accessibility features in each example. P1"

An alternative possiblity is to make it P1 for features which are
web-content-priority-1, p2 for those which are web-content-priority-2, etc.
But i think this is a general P1, consistent with the application of priority
1 to checkpoints which require the author to be guided towards accessible
design.
