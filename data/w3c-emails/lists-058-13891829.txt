I "hear" you Gregory,

  as always, your cool reasoning has tempered my intemperate wrath...  i "see"
  where you are going with this, and will try to take a whack at wording (or at
  least a technique or 2) myself...
  
  and, although i can "see" the justification and precedent, i am wary of using
  sliding priority ratings on this checkpoint, and would advocate that it be P1,
  due to the delicate, nuanced, and sensitive nature of the problem with which we
  are grappling...
