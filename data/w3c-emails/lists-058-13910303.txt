Please, Charles,  tell me why -

Generating accessibility content, including ... expansion for acronyms... is
one of the most fundamental requirements of accessible content.

I believe acronym expansion is irrelevant for access.

Also the wording is strange, "generating AC ... is one of the most fundamental
requirements of AC!!!"
