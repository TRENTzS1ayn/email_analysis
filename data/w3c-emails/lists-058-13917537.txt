I grant that acronym expansion is less critical than many other features, and
would happily exchange the example for another - so unless usggestions are
forthcoming, I'll put my mind to finding another.

And yes, the wording is rather circular isn't it. Better work on that too.

  Please, Charles,  tell me why -
  
  Generating accessibility content, including ... expansion for acronyms... is
  one of the most fundamental requirements of accessible content.
  
  I believe acronym expansion is irrelevant for access.
  
  Also the wording is strange, "generating AC ... is one of the most fundamental
  requirements of AC!!!"
