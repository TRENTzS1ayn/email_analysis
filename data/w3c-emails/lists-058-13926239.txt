Following Jim Thatcher's comments I have a modified proposal for the
guideline 4 introduction...
  
  Generating equivalent content, such as textual alternatives for images and  
  audio descriptions of video, can be one of the most challenging aspects
  of web design. Along with the necessity for structural information it is a
  cornerstone of accessible design, allowing content to be presented in a way
  most appropriate for the needs of the user, without constraining the
  creativity of the author.
  
  Automating the mechanics of this process, by prompting authors to include
  the relevant information at appropriate times, can greatly ease the process
  for authors. Where such information can be mechanically determined (e.g., the
  function of icons in an automatically-generated navigation bar, or expansion
  of acronyms from a dictionary) and offered as a choice for the author the
  tool will assist the author, at the same time as it reinforces the need for
  such information and the author's role in ensuring that it is used
  appropriately in each instance.
