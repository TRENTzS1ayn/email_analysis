Features:
? W3C Validation (automatic) 
? CSS Properties lists (Safe List, CSS 1&2, Netscape4, IE 4&5, Opera, etc?) 
? Warnings and tests 
? Preview Panes 
? External Browser Previews (based on documents and CSS alone) 
? Batch CSS attach (inline and link) 
? Style inspector (feedback about warnings and potential problems per browser
and spec) 
? Full integration with  Homesite 
? $50 

I particularly like how knowledgeable it is about the style sheet support in
various browsers. 

Should we mention this editor in the techniques document in the style sheet
section? 

I am forwarding this to AU as well since I thought AU would be interested in
how it validates documents and tests for various browser support.
