An authoring tool developer commented that parts of Guideline 6
"Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content"
drift too far into prescribing exactly how designers are to design their tools.

He agrees with 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 :
6.1 Check for and alert the author to accessibility problems. (Priority 1...
6.2 Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems. (Priority 1 for ...
6.4 Allow the author to override any removal of unrecognized markup. [Priority
2]

But feels that 6.3, 6.5, and 6.6 are too prescriptive AND not required for
generating accessible content:

6.3 Allow users to control *both* the *nature* and *timing* of accessibility
alerts. [Priority 2]
6.5 Provide the author with a *summary* of the document accessibility status *on
a configurable schedule*. [Priority 3]
6.6 Allow the author to perform element transformations. [Priority 3]

These three are really techniques and possible design features for meeting the
first 3 checkpoints.  The "how and when" of checking or alerting or assisting
are part of the design of the tool and not always under control of the user.
Requiring a feature [Priority 2] to allow the user to have control of both the
nature *and* timing is a tall complex development order, is unclear which alerts
[all?] are applicable, and is unspecified about definition of *timing/schedule*
and *summary*.   For example, is providing only one choice on timing adequate?
Either at time of image insertion and/or when executing the access checker
function?  Is a Green, Yello, Red indicator summary adequate, or does it need to
be a log file for each element of the page?

The proposal is to move these 3 into the techniques documents *or* make them all
[change 6.3] priority 3 AND simplify/clarify the checkpoint wording.  For
example:
6.3a  Allow users *some* control over the accessibility alerts. [Priority 3]
6.3b  Allow users *some* control over the format/nature of the accessibility
alerts. [Priority 3]
6.5  Provide a summary of the accessibility status. [Priority 3]
   in the techniques include a list of suggestions, including # of images
without ALT=text, etc.
   delete the part about the configurable schedule

Quoting from the techniques document: "The art of attracting users' attention is
a tricky issue. The way users are alerted, prompted, or warned will influence
their view of the tool and their opinion of accessible authoring. "  is the
concern express here with 6.3, 6.5, 6.6.   I believe we can be more exact in the
checkpoint wording in a future release of the guidelines once we get more
techniques implement by authoring tool developers AND we get more data on which
techniques are more effective.  I believe we are now relying more on our "wants"
and "ideas" of what will be effective and we need to work more with developers
on implementing the basics.
