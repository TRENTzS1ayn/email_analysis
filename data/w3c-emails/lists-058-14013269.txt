aloha, charles!

i promised twice today to think twice before i posted after one a.m., but,
after thinking twice about it, it occurred to me that the only reason
checkpoint 6.6 is a P3 is that table navigation is a P1 requirement for a
dependent user agent, so i suppose you would not be placing an undue burden on
a blind author to require him or her to ALT-TAB (or spawn a new shell) to run a
dependent user agent in order to hear (and/or feel) if his labor has born fruit
or been in vain...  i just hope that he or she is using a triple-A authoring
tool, that produces quote content that conforms to the W3C's Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines unquote...
