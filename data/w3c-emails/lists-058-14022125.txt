Hi Gregory.

One of the nice things about inheriting the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines in the way we do is that it means that it is, for example, a P2
requirement that tables make sense when linearised.

Our guidelines rely on the Web Content Guidelines to have correctly
prioritised their requirements. This is not a bad thing - otherwise we would
all end up spending our time doing other people's work.

I do take your point, but I think that transformations, as provided by 6.6
wouldn't really solve the problem - it is reliance on guidelines 3 and 4 that
are going to prove more helpful, along with checkpoints 6.1, and 6.2.

  i promised twice today to think twice before i posted after one a.m., but,
  after thinking twice about it, it occurred to me that the only reason
  checkpoint 6.6 is a P3 is that table navigation is a P1 requirement for a
  dependent user agent, so i suppose you would not be placing an undue burden on
  a blind author to require him or her to ALT-TAB (or spawn a new shell) to run a
  dependent user agent in order to hear (and/or feel) if his labor has born fruit
  or been in vain...  i just hope that he or she is using a triple-A authoring
  tool, that produces quote content that conforms to the W3C's Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines unquote...
