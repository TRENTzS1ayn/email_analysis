I doubt this has anything to do with the URL suffix, at least, not on Bobby's
end.

For example, Bobby can do just fine on the following URLs:

     http://www.ci.fullerton.ca.us/
     http://www.ci.fullerton.ca.us/index.shtml

>      Cannot analyze file with privacy suffix "*.shtml"

shtml is not necessarily a privacy suffix; it is commonly used to indicate 
parsed HTML containing Server Side Includes.  (Incidentally. *.shm
is a nice looking 3-letter form of this than *.sht ...)

I don't have an answer as to why it's getting 'permission denied' when
Bobby tries to access that file -- perhaps it's some sort of server
configuration that dislikes Bobby's non-standard user agent type?  It
could be server-side scripting gone horribly wrong.
