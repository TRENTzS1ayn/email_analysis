From the E & R document: "It is imperative that any tool have features
that assist in reminding, without nagging; in helping, without
demeaning; in suggesting, without demanding. We hope that the techniques
in this document, implemented in software programs, will gently guide
authors
along the path to more accessible documents." might fit in the AU
