This is a long way from comprehensive, and only tries to cover tools which
are currently developed, so notables like AOLpress weren't listed. I would be
interested in a better list too, so if anyone wnats to add their favourite
(or leaast favourite, or any othe kind of) tool, I'll try to collate them.

Note that I have used "things that produce web content" as my rough
definition of what constitutes an authoring tool

  Any assistance is appreciated.
  Thanks!
