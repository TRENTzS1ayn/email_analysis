Those of us using some variant of Unix have a very different toolset, usually  based on general-purpose text editors and scripting languages. vi, emacs, perl, sed, etc. 

Looking at specialized, not general-purpose, tools, I use Webmaker (part of the KDE environment) for HTML, and weblint and tidy to catch my mistakes. Gimp for image editing and cvs for version control round it out nicely.

A couple of other Unix HTML options:
  asWedit
  CoffeeCup

This is a long way from comprehensive, and only tries to cover tools which
are currently developed, so notables like AOLpress weren't listed. I would be
interested in a better list too, so if anyone wnats to add their favourite
(or leaast favourite, or any othe kind of) tool, I'll try to collate them.
