Adam,

thanks for these.

I have excluded plain-text editors such as vi, and general purpose tools such
as sed. I have drawn a slightly arbitrary line - since emacs has both an
html mode with hotkeys for including various html commands, and a browsing
mode (w3 - very popular amongst blind users, for example) for review, should
it be included?

Do you have URIs for the asWedit and CoffeeCup?

Cheers

Charles

  Those of us using some variant of Unix have a very different toolset,
  usually based on general-purpose text editors and scripting languages.
  vi, emacs, perl, sed, etc.
  
  Looking at specialized, not general-purpose, tools, I use Webmaker (part
  of the KDE environment) for HTML, and weblint and tidy to catch my
  mistakes. Gimp for image editing and cvs for version control round it out
  nicely.
  
  A couple of other Unix HTML options:
    asWedit
    CoffeeCup

  This is a long way from comprehensive, and only tries to cover tools which
  are currently developed, so notables like AOLpress weren't listed. I would be
  interested in a better list too, so if anyone wnats to add their favourite
  (or leaast favourite, or any othe kind of) tool, I'll try to collate them.
