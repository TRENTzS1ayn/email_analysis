3.1 Implement all accessible authoring practices that have been defined for
the markup language(s) supported by the tool

Marja-Riitta suggested we change this to
    
    - Give support to all accessible authoring practices ... (?)

and I propose:

Support all accessible authoring practices...  

I think we mean 

Provide the user with the ability to use all accessible authoring
practices...

But it seems long-winded. However that may be valuable.

What do people think?
