    Guideline 1 (introduction)
    
    - what is a compressed view of a document? An outline of headers? List of
    images, tables or links? Visual image of the whole doc shrinked to fit a
    window.

I think we should substitue the words "A simplified means of presenting the
structure (for example a structure view, or the ability to navigate by the
structure alone)" for the words "A compressed view"
