A search mechanism is extraordinarily useful for an author for whom it is
difficult to manually search a document. In an image editor it is useful to
be able to identify parts of an image (pixels, layers, elements, vectors)
with particular properties. In a database it is often vital to be able to
find a particular entry without having to do a complete manual search - this
is one of the challenges in database programming

So should the ability to search be a seperate requirement? I remember
discussing this, but not including it at any pooint, and I can't find it in
any of the old drafts I looked in.

    - techniques talk about element to element navigation as a minumum demand.
    Should we ask a little bit more? Go from header to header or link to link.
    What about search?
