  A search mechanism is extraordinarily useful for an author for whom it is
  difficult to manually search a document. In an image editor it is useful to
  be able to identify parts of an image (pixels, layers, elements, vectors)
  with particular properties. In a database it is often vital to be able to
  find a particular entry without having to do a complete manual search - this
  is one of the challenges in database programming
  
  So should the ability to search be a seperate requirement? I remember
  discussing this, but not including it at any pooint, and I can't find it in
  any of the old drafts I looked in.

      - techniques talk about element to element navigation as a minumum demand.
      Should we ask a little bit more? Go from header to header or link to link.
      What about search?
