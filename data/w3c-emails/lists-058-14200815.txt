Note that I have added the proposals resulting from Marja's comments on the
draft to the agenda tomorrow - a couple of rewording proposals, and the
question of including search functionality separately from structure-based
navigation. I suggest we do not run according to the order listed, since the
first listed issue was raised by Phill.

  Phill will be late.  I have to give a presentation on accessibility to a hundred
  folks until 3pm central time - so I'll be at least 30 minutes late.
