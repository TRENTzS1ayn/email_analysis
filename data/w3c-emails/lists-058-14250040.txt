I support/agree with Daniel's proposal to

>My proposal is:
>  - move guideline number 1 to the end of the list
>
>  - reorder the goals in "1.2 Checkpoint priorities" to be
>    1.The authoring tool generates accessible content by default
>    2.The authoring tool is user configurable
>    3.The authoring tool encourages the creation of accessible content
>    4.The authoring tool itself is accessible

with one addition.  Remove Goal #2.  "Making the tool "user configurable" is a
TECHNIQUE for achieving the other goals 1, 3, and 4.  It is also related to my
issue already on the agenda about the "scope of configurability".

>I would like the AU group to decide whether or not their priority is:
>first "deliver accessible content to the Web per WCAG", and then "make
>mainstream AU tools itself accessible", or the other way around.

I believe the priority is to "first deliver accessible content to the Web per
WCAG, and then "make
mainstream AU tools itself accessible" - for many reasons including Daniel's:

>Say you're a developer of html editor within a software
>company. Either you care about accessibility of the UI, and you
>already have a set of guidelines to comply with (from Microsoft or IBM
>or Trace) or don't care (but still, you know that kind of guidelines
>exist, but you just don't care).  Here comes this new set of W3C AU
>guideline.  First thing you see by skimming thru it is that it's just
>another set of UI Accessibility guidelines.
>
>In both cases (you already care or you don't) your reaction is to
>ignore/postpone its use because you already have what you need
>(something or nothing), and/or it's something you not doing at this
>stage of development.
>
>Of course there will be people smart enought to understand the two
>aspects, when I see how people get confused by much simpler things
>when they first look at novel approaches, I'm _sure_ lots of people
>will *never* understand that these guidelines are also (and
>principally) about the generated markup, not just the UI: because this
>is a novel set of guidelines.
