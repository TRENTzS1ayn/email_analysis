Sorry, it's not part of the standard distribution yet. It's pretty nice, but still in early beta. On a positive note, when I was thinking of features I would want added in, ALL of them were in their to-do list - and it's moving along rather quickly. The closest counterpart on the Windows side would be Homesite. Webmaker hasn't gotten to that level yet, but I suspect it won't be long.

Hi Adam,

Could you give us an URL for Webmaker? It's not very visible in the KDE site (at least, I wasn't able to find it), and it's not available in my Linux distribution.
