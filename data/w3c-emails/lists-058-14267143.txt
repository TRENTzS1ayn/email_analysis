I go along with Phill's modified version of Daniel's proposal.

(the long answer:

I do not agree that there is a difference in priority between the two
questions, but I think that is almost immaterial. We have created a priority
scheme, which means that ordering, while it will probably lead to differeing
first impressions, is not relevant to the priority of meeting checkpoints. I
prefer to have the current ordering, but I do not think the ordering change
proposed will be a big problem, and I would therefore rather have the
consensus, based on the fact that I don't anticipate any new issues arising
in the discussion.)

  with one addition.  Remove Goal #2.  "Making the tool "user configurable" is a
  TECHNIQUE for achieving the other goals 1, 3, and 4.  It is also related to my
  issue already on the agenda about the "scope of configurability".

  I believe the priority is to "first deliver accessible content to the Web per
  WCAG, and then "make
  mainstream AU tools itself accessible" - for many reasons including Daniel's:
