The arguments promulgated in favor of moving the guideline concerning
the accessibility of the tool to the rear of our bus are specious.
Although it doesn't really matter where they are, the forgoing sentence
is true.

If we are reduced to this "issue" as worthy of discussion on our telecon
then it is clearly well past time to put this document to bed as last
call.
