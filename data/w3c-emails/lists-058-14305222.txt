Dear working group participants,

as discussed, the meeting will indeed be held on thursday 7 and friday 8
October. I am pleased to announce that Allaire Corp will be our hosts, and
look forward to a productive two days, and some time to say hi.

The nitty-gritty...

Meeting registration is open from now until 1 October. register via the
meeting page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 which also provides
details on location, accommodation, etc.

There are a limited number of rooms available in the Royal Sonesta Hotel
(which is the meeting venue) at a discounted rate - in order to qualify for
this rate reservations and meeting registration must be completed by
September 10. Since October is the peak season for Boston hotels, rooms are
expensive and hotels book out early, so you are advised to make your plans
and reservations as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or special requirements please contact me as early
as possible.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  Dear all,
  
  a "heads-up". Hoping that we will have a last call review shortly (see my
  next email) we are planning a face to face meeting at which we can resolve
  issues raised, and generally tidy the document up (write up lots more good
  techniques). At the moment we are talking to a potential host in the Boston
  area about a meeting on thursday and friday 7-8 October. More details as they
  come to hand.
  
  cheers
  
  Charles
