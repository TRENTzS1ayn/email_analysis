"tiresome intrusion" may be a bit strong, although it's good to
acknowledge this. How about "disruption of their normal work pattern."
or "imposition on their normal work pattern."

So should the "configurable" part be removed from this checkpoint as
well?

This checkpoint seems to vague to me. I think there needs
to be more information about the purpose of the transformations.
The techniques emphasize transformation of style elements to structural
elements. I realize one may not want to overconstraing the types
of transformations, but that would be more useful to start with.
The transformation of structure to style (e.g., don't use BLOCKQUOTE)
is also helpful.
