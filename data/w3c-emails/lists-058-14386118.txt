aloha, ben!

welcome to the AU WG!  one of the issues with which the WG is grappling right
now is "how implementable are the AUGL as currently written?"  the WG,
therefore, would be extremely interested in your (and your colleagues')
comments on the guidelines, and the associated techniques document, when you
have the opportunity to review them thoroughly...  (note: you can find the
latest working group draft at:<http://www.w3.org/wai/au/wai-autools> 

i am also quite pleased that you took my introductory comments to the article i
circulated to the list in the manner they were offered -- as constructive
criticism...  as someone who has used Cold Fusion in the past, i eagerly
anticipate working with you and your colleagues at allaire...  and, based on my
perusal of your company's web site, i am tantalized by the possibility that
allaire is in an ideal position to apply the AU guidelines to its existing
products with great facility... 

gregory.
