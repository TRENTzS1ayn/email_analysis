One last thing: one of the most important aspects of designing a tool
for Web Authoring is that it attend closely to the notion that access to
the Web does not mean "read only" access, but "read/write" access.  If
there are "technical" reservations to focusing strongly on the ability
of PWDs to use the tool for *FULL* read/write access to the Web, they
should be relentlessly stamped out <g>.
