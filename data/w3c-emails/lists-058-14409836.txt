CMN Yes, I think so.

IJ:  
  This checkpoint seems to vague to me. I think there needs
  to be more information about the purpose of the transformations.
  The techniques emphasize transformation of style elements to structural
  elements. I realize one may not want to overconstraing the types
  of transformations, but that would be more useful to start with.
  The transformation of structure to style (e.g., don't use BLOCKQUOTE)
  is also helpful.
CMN:
I'm not exactly clear what you are suggesting. The checkpoint technique
itself gives two examples based on structural transformations. Should the
current techniques exaplin those examples further? Should they include
transformations which remove mis-used structures? How does the tool know, or
should such changes be author initiated? The latter seems like a good idea -
it is something I find very useful in Amaya. Automagically identifying the
problem seems to be 6.1. Maybe we should cross-reference this to helping the
author.
