Charles,

Thanks for the replies. I've replied to a few of them again below. 

I do encourage the group to make the introduction etc. as clear as possible
before sending for last call, since it will help people who haven't been
staring at this document for months to better understand the context, and
therefore be able to comment on the guidelines and checkpoints.

- Judy

JB What I meant was to suggest that the WG drafts what you plan the last
call "status" section to say, so that the group discusses it, and that it's
specific to AUWG's interest when it goes out, rather than just boilerplate.

JB I thought it would short-cut some of the confusing part of that
paragraph; but I'm not wedded to the document using that word. Maybe
someone can volunteer to work over that paragraph.

JB There is a discontinuity with the current flow. If the goals stay there,
they need more context, for instance a clearer subhead or transition. It
says "Checkpoint Priorities" and then gives "document goals." You don't
want the unfamiliar reader, who is basically who you want to reach, to get
lost anywhere unnecessarily.

JB A good example for motor would be use of voice recognition, which
frequently requires correction and backing-up, or use of single-switch
access, for instance via an eyebrow switch, puff-and-sip switch, tongue
switch, etc., which can slow down input considerably. Pick whichever
examples seem easiest to understand.

JB I don't understand; the authoring tool might "use" any one of a number
of languages in its programming, but what matters for the AU Guidelines is
what markup language the authoring tool _generates_. E.g, "Generate
document markup languages that enable accessibility" would work fine from
my perspective. Perhaps I am missing something here.

JB OK... and unfamiliar readers of this document will definitely get
meaning from this? Perhaps it would help to explain this phrase a little in
the text.
