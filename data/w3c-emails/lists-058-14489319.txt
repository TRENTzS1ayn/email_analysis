  JB What I meant was to suggest that the WG drafts what you plan the last
  call "status" section to say, so that the group discusses it, and that it's
  specific to AUWG's interest when it goes out, rather than just boilerplate.

  JB I thought it would short-cut some of the confusing part of that
  paragraph; but I'm not wedded to the document using that word. Maybe
  someone can volunteer to work over that paragraph.

  JB There is a discontinuity with the current flow. If the goals stay there,
  they need more context, for instance a clearer subhead or transition. It
  says "Checkpoint Priorities" and then gives "document goals." You don't
  want the unfamiliar reader, who is basically who you want to reach, to get
  lost anywhere unnecessarily.
CMN2
Right. Another approach: "The checkpoints are prioritised according to their
importance for an authoring tool to meet 4 goals...", or some clearer way of
saying that.
(Although I have proposed elsewhere changing this to three goals)

  JB A good example for motor would be use of voice recognition, which
  frequently requires correction and backing-up, or use of single-switch
  access, for instance via an eyebrow switch, puff-and-sip switch, tongue
  switch, etc., which can slow down input considerably. Pick whichever
  examples seem easiest to understand.

  JB I don't understand; the authoring tool might "use" any one of a number
  of languages in its programming, but what matters for the AU Guidelines is
  what markup language the authoring tool _generates_. E.g, "Generate
  document markup languages that enable accessibility" would work fine from
  my perspective. Perhaps I am missing something here.

CMN2 The idea is that there are languages which enable accessibility, and
languages which do not. A tool might be a very good tool for people with
disabilities, but producing markup in a language which precludes
accessibility (for example by not allowing for alternative content). I guess
we need to clarify this in the checkpoint.

  JB OK... and unfamiliar readers of this document will definitely get
  meaning from this? Perhaps it would help to explain this phrase a little in
  the text.

CMN2 Obviously. How about something like "For example, in an automatically
generated navigation bar, it is clear that "search" is appropriate for a
buttn linked to a search function"
