One of the questions that last calls and propsed recommendations brings up is
"Is anyone else implementing this? Have they done so or have they announced
their intention to do so?"

How much implementation is enough? How long should we wait for it? I think
this is a question that we should resolve at the end of last call rather than
the beginning, when we know our likely continuing schedule with more
certainty (did we get a lot of comments in last call, or very few? What
issues were raised?). Implementation is important as a reality check for the
guidelines and checkpoints, and in many cases checkpoints already have wide
implementation. Being able to point to implemenations will both help us to
expand the techniques document to help cover the needs of a range of a
developers, and demonstrate that checkpoints are achievable.
