Two problems: 

1. Transforming HTML that conveys structure into structural markup is
tautological (unless you mean into non-HTML markup, but that doesn't seem to
be the case)

2. This requirement, and the scope of the guidelines, goes beyond HTML. A
number of the suggested techniques are not HTML at all. It is a (P3)  
requirement for an XML editing tool
