To: Charles McCathieNevile<charles@w3.org>, WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

As discussed in last week's meeting we will limit the discussion of the
guideline order to no more than 20 minutes. At the beginning of the
discussion I will create a list of people who wish to speak on the issue.
We will then limit each statement such that we have time for everyone's
point of view and time for rebuttal and discussion. After 20 minutes we
will either reach a resolution or vote.

Could everyone please read all the list messages pertaining to the issue
before the meeting.

Thanks Jutta
