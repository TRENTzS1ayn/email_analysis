Given the discussion regarding the checkpoint priorities section between
Judy and Charles I propose the following rewording of the section (I have
not addressed the number of goals or the ordering of the goals):

Start revision -

1.2 Checkpoint Priorities

Each checkpoint has a priority level. The priority level reflects the
impact of the checkpoint in meeting the goals of this document. These goals
are:

1. That the authoring tool be accessible
2. That the authoring tool generate accessible content by default
(3. That the authoring tool be user configurable)
4. That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible content.

The three priority levels are assigned as follows:

[Priority 1]
If the checkpoint is essential to meeting these goals
[Priority 2]
If the checkpoint is important to meeting these goals, and
[Priority 3]
If the checkpoint is beneficial to meeting these goals.

- End revision

We should probably also explicitly state the goals in the introduction.

  JB There is a discontinuity with the current flow. If the goals stay there,
  they need more context, for instance a clearer subhead or transition. It
  says "Checkpoint Priorities" and then gives "document goals." You don't
  want the unfamiliar reader, who is basically who you want to reach, to get
  lost anywhere unnecessarily.

Right. Another approach: "The checkpoints are prioritised according to their
importance for an authoring tool to meet 4 goals...", or some clearer way of
saying that.
