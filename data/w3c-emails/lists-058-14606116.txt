I have been unsuccessful in managing my calendar and will be late again joining
the call.  It's a final review with the production folks making a CD-ROM that
will, among other things, have a copy of the WCAG on it...

 Could the agenda be arranged somewhat to accommodate my late arrival?

My proposal:

Checkpoint 6.6 (Transformations)
Checkpoint 6.3 (configurability)
Guideline Order
Last Call


Regards,
Phill Jenkins
