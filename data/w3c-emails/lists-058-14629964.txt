I would suggest adding to the last sentence of the 1st paragraph

>... It does address accessible design
>considerations specific to Web authoring tools.

such as conformance to accessible standards (i.e.,
HTML 4.0), accessibility checking and correcting,
prompting, appropriate documentation and help,
and navigation mechanisms.

PJ:  This is one of the "main" purposes and the
majority of the "meat" of the document and should
be briefly introduced in the introduction.(strikethrough:
)
