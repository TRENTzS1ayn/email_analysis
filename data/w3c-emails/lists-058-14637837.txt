JB2 Right. I believe if you use the word "produce" or "generate" it is
sufficiently clear.

JB2 That example is clarifying. I realize that other checkpoints do not
have accompanying examples, and so to use one here would change that
pattern; however I find almost all the other checkpoints to be adequately
self-explanatory, but do not find the following phrase self-explanatory
"except in cases where human-authored text has been written for an object
whose function is known with certainty." 

You could integrate the example above into the phrase without having to
throw in a whole extra sentence for the example: 
"...except in cases where human-authored text (for instance, "search") has
been prepared for an object whose function is known with certainity (for
instance, a button linked to a search function)."
