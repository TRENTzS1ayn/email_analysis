  JB2 Right. I believe if you use the word "produce" or "generate" it is
  sufficiently clear.

CMN3
How about "Ensure the tool produces markup in a language that enables
accessibility.
  For example, a tool must not produce markup only in languages that do not
allow equivalent alternatives for media-specfic objects such as audio or
images."

  JB2 That example is clarifying. I realize that other checkpoints do not
  have accompanying examples, and so to use one here would change that
  pattern; however I find almost all the other checkpoints to be adequately
  self-explanatory, but do not find the following phrase self-explanatory
  "except in cases where human-authored text has been written for an object
  whose function is known with certainty." 
  
  You could integrate the example above into the phrase without having to
  throw in a whole extra sentence for the example: 
  "...except in cases where human-authored text (for instance, "search") has
  been prepared for an object whose function is known with certainity (for
  instance, a button linked to a search function)." 
  
CMN3
Actually there are clarifying examples or notes on a handful of checkpoints,
so it isn't a particular problem where necessary. The tension is between
having a self-contained document, and providing so much information that the
techniques document doesn't get read.
