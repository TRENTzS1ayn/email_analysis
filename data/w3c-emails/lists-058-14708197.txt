Phil,
The sentence you cite refers to making the tool accessible to authors with
disabilities. The examples you cite refer to ensuring that the content
created is accessible, with the exception of "navigation mechanisms."

I take your point that we need to give examples of what we do include and
taking Judy's comments as well I propose the following re-revision of the
middle Introductory paragraph:

 Begin re-revision:

An accessible authoring tool is accessible software that produces
accessible content for the Web. Thus the goals of this document can be
stated as follows: that the authoring tool be accessible to authors
regardless of disability, that the authoring tool generate accessible
content by default, and that the authoring tool support and encourage the
author in creating accessible content. Because most of the content of the
Web is created using authoring tools, they play a critical role in ensuring
the
accessibility of the Web. Since the Web is both a means of receiving
information and communicating information, it is important that both the
web content produced and the authoring tool itself be accessible.

For detailed information about what constitutes accessible content this
document relies on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
[WAI-WEBCONTENT]. This document provides guidelines for designing authoring
tools that generate web content that conforms to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines and that support and encourage authors to create
content that conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This is
achieved by taking steps such as conformance to accessible standards (i.e.,
HTML 4.0), accessibility checking and correcting, prompting, appropriate
documentation and help. Similarly,this document does not address general
accessible software design but relies on other sources. It does address
accessible design considerations specific to Web authoring tools such as
providing flexible editing views, navigation aids and access to display
properties for authors.
