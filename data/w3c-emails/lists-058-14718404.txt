As per Judy's suggestion I propose rewording the Guideline 1 introduction
to reflect a cross disability concern and improve the continuity and flow:

The proposed rewording is:

The authoring tool is a software program with standard user interface
elements and as such should follow relevant user interface accessibility
guidelines. In addition to applicable general interface accessibility
guidelines there are interface design considerations that are specific to
Web authoring tools.

             One such consideration is that the author may need a different
presentation to edit the Web content than the one they wish ultimately to
be displayed. This implies display preferences that do not manifest
themselves in the ultimate markup or style declarations.

            Another consideration relates to the process of navigating and
manipulating the document while authoring. Authoring Web content requires
editing a potentially large and complex document. In order to edit a
document the author must be able to locate and select specific elements,
efficiently traverse the document, and quickly find and mark insertion
points. Authors who use screen readers, refreshable braille displays, or
screen magnifiers can make limited use (if at all) of visual artifacts that
communicate the structure of the document and act as sign posts when
traversing the document. Authors who use keyboard and mouse alternatives
must make tiring repetitions of movement commands to navigate the document.
There are strategies that make it easier to navigate and manipulate a
marked-up document. Using the structure of a web document, the author can
be given an outline view of the document which allows the author to both
get a good sense of the overall document and to navigate that document more
easily.
