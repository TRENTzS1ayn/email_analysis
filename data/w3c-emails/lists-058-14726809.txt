In response to Judy's comments regarding the last sentence of the first
paragraph of Guideline 3 I propose the following rewording:

Old wording:

Methods for ensuring accessible markup vary with different markup
languages. If markup is automatically generated, many authors will be
unaware of the accessibility status of the final product unless they expend
extra effort to make appropriate corrections by hand. Since many authors
are unfamiliar with accessibility, these problems are likely to remain.

Proposed new wording:

Methods for ensuring accessible markup vary with different markup
languages. If markup is automatically generated, many authors will be
unaware of the accessibility status of the final product unless they expend
extra effort to make appropriate corrections by hand. Since many authors
are unfamiliar with accessibility, the onus is on the authoring tool to
generate accessible content, and where appropriate, to guide the author in
producing accessible content.

Jutta
