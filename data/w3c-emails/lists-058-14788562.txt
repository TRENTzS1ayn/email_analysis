aloha, y'all!

i know that this is probably the last can of worms anyone in this WG wants
opened at this particular time, but, having recently installed a number of
currently available authoring tools in preparation for evaluating  them against
the AUGL, i've been wondering why the User Agent guidelines have a checkpoint
(number 1.3) covering the accessibility of the installation process [1] when
the AUGL doesn't?

the only explicit references to installation that i could find were in the AU
Techniques document:-- both are listed under Checkpoint 5.1, and neither
addresses the concern about an accessible installation interface in a manner
similar to that utilized in the UAGL

begin first quote
The accessibility features should be designed as integral components of the
authoring tool application, not plug-ins or other peripheral components that
need to be separately obtained, installed, configured or executed 
end first quote

begin second quote
The default installation of the authoring tool should include all accessibility
features enabled. The author may have the option to disable these features
later on. 
end second quote

i have no problem with addressing this concern in the techniques document, but
i did think it an important enough issue -- even if just from a WAI GL to WAI
GL compatibility point of view -- to raise before we enter last call...

gregory.
