In view of the almost incredible resistance to making the tool
accessible it seems clear that we must "spell out" that in order to use
the tool, one must be able to install it. This should be a "throwaway"
line in the intro to Section 1 (or whatever number it winds up as):
"...and, of course, in addition to being accessible to users with
disabilities, the installation of the tool must be possible for such
users without resort to help from temporarily able-bodied colleagues."
or some such. Some things that should "go without saying" obviously
don't go without saying.
