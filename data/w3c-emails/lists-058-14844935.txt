The new draft is now available -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990901

Please note that the sample implementations in the techniques document have
not been reordered yet. I will do that for the Last Call draft on Friday. I
have also not yet updated the changes or issue list - again, both of those
will be done for Friday. First I need a bit of sleep and some food *grin*

Thanks everyone for the hard work on getting to this stage. Although there is
a long way to go, getting to last call is a big milestone.

Happy reading...

Charles
