I've read through all the other W3C documents. Most of them take the
approach of defining element, attribute and property under document as
well. As a result there are none that offer a more expanded definition of
the term document on its own but only as it is made up of elements,
attributes and properties.

Ian you had a definition from the CSS document (which wasn't in their
glossary) could you send that to the list so we can recycle it.

Thanks Jutta
