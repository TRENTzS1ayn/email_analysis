I looked it up in Webster via "Do The Right Thing" (A really neat service
from Gerald Oskoboiny, maintainer of the Kinder Gentler Validator, sysadmin
at w3c and all-round nice Canadian) and the definition there seemed deficient
too. But it gives (among some things that do not really apply):

a writing conveying information
a material substance having on it a representation of thoughts by means of
some conventional mark or symbol

I think we can (and in practice already do) rely on the common understanding
of the term, broad and ambiguous as that necessarily is, and live without our
own definition.

  attributes and properties.
  
  Ian you had a definition from the CSS document (which wasn't in their
  glossary) could you send that to the list so we can recycle it.
  
  Thanks Jutta
