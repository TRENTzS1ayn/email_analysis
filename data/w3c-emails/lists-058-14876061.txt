Plagiarizing heavily from the Web Content guidelines I propose we add the
following definition:

Web Content, Information, Structure and Presentation
Web content is content to be viewed by a Web browser and published on the
Web or an Intranet. Web content consists of the information to be
communicated, the structure of the information and the presentation of the
information. The Web content information refers to the message to be
communicated to the reader through natural language, images, sounds,
movies, animations, etc. The Web content structure refers to how it is
organized logically (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of
contents, etc.). The Web content presentation refers to how it is rendered
(e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional graphical presentation, as a
text-only presentation, as synthesized speech, as Braille, etc.).
