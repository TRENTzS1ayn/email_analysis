Hi Jutta,

1) I am uncomfortable with a definition that begins "Web content is
content..."

2) Also, "Web content consists of the information" is followed by
   "Web content information refers to the message". So, by transitivity,
   is content the message?

3) I don't think you need to consider the message of information
   as part of content. 

I find these definitions a bit unwieldly. Can we tweak yours and the
WCAG 1.0 definitions as follows:

a) Web content is information published on the Web or an Intranet
   and viewed by a Web browser. Authors represent information
   in a variety of ways on the Web, including through natural 
   language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc. 

b) The structure of Web content refers to its logical organization
   (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of contents, 
   etc.). 

c) The presentation of Web content refers to the way it
   is output to the user (e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional
   graphical presentation, as an text-only presentation, 
   as synthesized speech, as braille, etc.)
