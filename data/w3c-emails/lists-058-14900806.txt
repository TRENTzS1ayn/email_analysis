How else do you want to define document?

Refer to "Source Document" (from [1]).

Source document 
        The document to which one or more style sheets refer.
        This is encoded in some language that
        represents the document as a tree of elements. 
        Each element consists of a name that identifies the
        type of element, optionally a number of attributes, 
        and a (possibly empty) content. 

Maybe refer to the Web Characterization Terminology [2]
(though they don't define document).
