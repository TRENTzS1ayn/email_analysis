The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines are now in last call.
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS

Well done everybody. As well as the W3C working groups who have been invited
to look at it, this is effectively the last chance for general comment.

Comments are invited, and should be sent to the group's mailing list, up
until 4 October. This will give us a couple of days to read the last-inute
comments befoer our face to face meeting, at which we will hopefully resolve
all issues raised and ask the director to issue the document as a proposed
recommendation.

In the meantime, it would be helpful to focus our attention on the techniques
document and work on developing a comprehensive set of techniques.

One way of doing this is to do a conformance test of your favourite authoring
tool. If it meets the requirement in some way that is not suggested by the
techniques document, please describe the technique. This will help make the
techniques document more useful for users and developers of documentation,
who may not have considered the technique as benefitting accessibility, or
may even not have realised that the technique could be used to solve a
particular problem.

cheers
