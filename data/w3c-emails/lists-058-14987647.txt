DJW (on Amaya list) says "One of the reasons for the fact that most web
pages are invalid HTML is that people validate them with browsers which
attempt error recovery, so they end up designing for the error recovery
behaviour, not to the specification."

I think this is a lovely "sound byte." Our guidelines emphasize
validation and it might be worthwhile to point out that validating with
a browser is less than optimum.
