I just got off the phone with one of the Deans of Orange Coast
College (a southern california junior college) -- if you've been
following Cynthia Waddell's posts on IG, you know that California
community colleges are required to attain at least level single A
compliance with the WCAG.

The chap who called me said that his technical people advised
against using FrontPage 98 because it didn't produce accessible
web pages -- and he wants to know what does.

I didn't have an answer.  I still don't have an answer.  The HTML
authoring tool industry should be ashamed of the fact that I don't
have an answer.  But at least this group is working toward that
goal.

I know that we will complete our guidelines, and I know that we
will be able to evaluate existing tools against our standards, and
I know we'll have a "what's okay and what's bad and what's better"
answer soon -- "soon" being on the order of several months.

Right now, though, Orange Coast College needs an answer -- they
want to do the right thing, they just want to know what that is.
They want to know which software they should start training their
instructors to use.

Anyone got an answer that's more useful than mine?  I mumbled something
about FrontPage being not quite as bad as it used to be, and about
Dreamweaver apparently being decent -- but I don't use a web editor
myself (all coded by hand or via perl script) so I have no direct
experience.

Thoughts?
