Most important - if you haven't registered yet, don't forget.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 for the details.

Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people
want to eat for lunch.

The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey
if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille.

Possible substitutions:

baked Scrod (fish)
chicken caesar salad
hommus roll-up sandwich with salad
salad with crab cakes
churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions

I will do this in the following way:

If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear.

It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be
compatible with what people can't do.

The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday.

No response will not be considered a vote for the default - it will be
considered a vote for "whatever gets chosen"

Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that
people like helps the meeting go well...

cheers
