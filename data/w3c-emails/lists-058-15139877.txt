You only have one type of conformance listed in the document.  I know there
was discussion a few months ago related to the issues of the authoring tool
being accessible and producing accessible content.  It was brought to the
attention of the coordination group.  

I was wondering if there was any discussion about having two types of
conformance, instead of the one listed in the last call document? 

Conformance types I was thinking of:
1. Conformance in creating accessible web content
2. Conformance for an accessible interface and compatibility with assistive
technology

It seems to me that two levels would give developers more managable goals
to target their accessibility resources and highlight to consumers the
level and type of accessibility of authoring tools as developers increase
the accessibility of their product.  

I checked the AU issue list to see how it was resolved, but there was no
reference to when or how the issue was resolved.
