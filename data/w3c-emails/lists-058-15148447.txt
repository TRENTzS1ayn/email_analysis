I could not find a checkpoint that seemed to directly address the issue of
automatically generating accessible markup.  For example if somebody is
importing (pasting) an image of a microsoft excel generated chart into
their web authoring tool, the tool could automatically generate a text
equivalent table (or even a linearized version) for the long description of
the image.  The text title of the chart could be used for the default
alternative text.  The user could be prompted if they wanted to use the
excel title or change it.

It seems it could be part of Checkpoint 1.4, but I did not see this type of
example in the techniques for it.

It seems this kind of concept fits more under guideline 3.
