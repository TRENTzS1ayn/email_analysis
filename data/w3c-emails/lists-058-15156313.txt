Checkpoint 3.3 Provide pre-written alternative information for all
multimedia files packaged with the authoring tool. 

This checkpoint doesn't seem to make sense to me.  To me it sounds like you
are trying to say that if an object being inserted already has
accessibility information associated with it, use that information as the
default accessibility information.  The words "Provide pre-written" sound
like the authoring tool should have some special knowledge of the object
being inserted.

Maybe reqording the checkpoint to read:

"Use imported information to automatically generate accessible markup"

This would also incompass more than just mult-media objects.  Any object
that has information that could be used to generate accessibility markup
could be used.  In a previous e-mail I discussed a excel chart as an example.
