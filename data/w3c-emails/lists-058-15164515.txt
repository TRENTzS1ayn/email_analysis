Checkpoint 3.4: Provide a mechanism to manage alternative information for
multimedia objects, that retains and offers for editing pre-written or
previously linked alternative information. 

Maybe this should be part of a more general checkpoint to make sure that
the user can edit any accessibility information.  This is the only
checkpoint that specifically states the ability to edit accessibility
information.  Other checkpoints dance around the issue of editing by using
the words prompting, checking and correcting.  But if an author enters
accessibility when they are prompted for accessibility information, will
they have an opportunity to change the information? I assume that during
checking no accessibility problem will be found and therefore no
opporntuity to correct it based on other checkpoints that would potentially
allow for editing.
