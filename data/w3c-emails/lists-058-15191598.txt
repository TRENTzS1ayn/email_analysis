In guideline 7 there is a more specific requirement that the author can edit
anything. The requirement behind this checkpoint (as a Priority 3 - i.e. it
is not essential or important to ensuring accessibility, but it is
beneficial) is for a support mechanism to keep track of the accessibility
work that the author has already done, so that it can be partially automated
and the author can concentrate more effort on the creative aspect than on the
mechanical repetition.

If you looked at this in light of guideline 7 and it was not clear, do you
have a suggestion as to how we could make it more obvious?

  Maybe this should be part of a more general checkpoint to make sure that
  the user can edit any accessibility information.  This is the only
  checkpoint that specifically states the ability to edit accessibility
  information.  Other checkpoints dance around the issue of editing by using
  the words prompting, checking and correcting.  But if an author enters
  accessibility when they are prompted for accessibility information, will
  they have an opportunity to change the information? I assume that during
  checking no accessibility problem will be found and therefore no
  opporntuity to correct it based on other checkpoints that would potentially
  allow for editing.
