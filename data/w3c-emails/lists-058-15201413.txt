Is there a checkpoint that deals with saving (caching) accessibility
information of an object so that it can automatically be used in the same
or another document?

For example if I have an image that I use as a logo.  Does the authoring
tool need to prompt me each time I insert the image for the ALT and
LONGDESC information?

Maybe the prompting could be part of a configuration checkpoint to have it
always prompt, prompt only for second time, ....

It seems that the checkpoint should be under guideline 3.
