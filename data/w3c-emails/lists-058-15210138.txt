The intent of this technique is to require information that the authoring
tool can understand, and that has been hhuman authored, specifically in the
context of mulitmedia objects although there may be other applicable
situations.

In the case where information can be automatically generated (ie it is
included in the native format which is imported or converted) it should be
covered by checkpoint 1.4, as you suggested in your previous email. Do you
have a suggestion about  how we could clarify this? (Beyond including your
example in the techniques, which I suggest we do - thank you.)

  This checkpoint doesn't seem to make sense to me.  To me it sounds like you
  are trying to say that if an object being inserted already has
  accessibility information associated with it, use that information as the
  default accessibility information.  The words "Provide pre-written" sound
  like the authoring tool should have some special knowledge of the object
  being inserted.
  
  Maybe reqording the checkpoint to read:
  
  "Use imported information to automatically generate accessible markup"
  
  This would also incompass more than just mult-media objects.  Any object
  that has information that could be used to generate accessibility markup
  could be used.  In a previous e-mail I discussed a excel chart as an example.
