This approach is based on a particular model of user interaction where the
user is expected not to deal with the markup. In fact many of the most
popular authoring tools are markup editors, and directing the user away from
the markup is counter to their whole interface, and would therefore
contravene guideline 5 (integrate accessibililty into the overall look and
feel).

Guidelines 4 and 6 should cover the necessary requirements in the type of
interface you are suggesting, and your suggested scenario would be a valuable
addition to the techniques for the relevant checkpoints. Thank you again...

cheers

  The techniques talk alot about allow the author to edit the markup.  While
  this important and useful it would be, I think just as important to
  emphesize prompting the user for functional information and hiding the
  underlying markup as much as possible.  Fo exampel when inserting an image
  the tool could ask author not just for the ALT text and LONGDESC url.  But
  ask them first the purpose of the image, is it a:
  1. Decorative logo
  2. Image of person, place or thing
  3. Chart or graph
  4. Button or link
  ....
  
  The dialog would route the author to the appropraite accessibility
  questions related to the purpose of the image.  The ALT and LONGDESC for
  IMG or the proper OBJECT markup would be generated based on the answers and
  questions the people were asked during the dialog.
  
  Could this approach be highlighted in the text of checkpoint?
