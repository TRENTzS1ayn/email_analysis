This is in fact the intent of checkpoint 3.4 (see the thread on that

  Is there a checkpoint that deals with saving (caching) accessibility
  information of an object so that it can automatically be used in the same
  or another document?
  
  For example if I have an image that I use as a logo.  Does the authoring
  tool need to prompt me each time I insert the image for the ALT and
  LONGDESC information?
  
  Maybe the prompting could be part of a configuration checkpoint to have it
  always prompt, prompt only for second time, ....
  
  It seems that the checkpoint should be under guideline 3.
