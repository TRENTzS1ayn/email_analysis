Would it be useful to have a guideline that highlights the need to separate
form from content.  The checkpoints for this guideline could highlight the
use of style sheets for sperating style from content.  It could also
directly deal with the accessible authoring practices related to tables and
frames.  It also highlights an important concept of HTML and CSS.

Example:
Guideline X: Allow the author to separate device dependent rendering
information from web content

Checkpoint X.1: Support the use of style sheets for font size, font face
and font styles 

Checkpoint X.2: Support the use of style sheets for element and document colors

Checkpoint X.3: Support the use of style sheets for the spatial layout of
web content

Checkpoint X.4: Support the use of NOFRAMES 

Checkpoint X.5: Support style sheets for rendering of generated speech

Checkpoint X.6: Support style sheets for audio rendering (volume, pitch..)
