Responses in JRG:
JRG: You may want to provide a link to the conformance discussion in your
issue list.  I am sure that many companies during proposed recommendation
will want to review the discussion that lead to this group decision.  Since
it is a potential hot button issue during proposed recommendation you may
also want to outline the different options the group considered, the
process that was used to reach consensus and why group reached this
consensus.  You may also want to include references or statements from the
developers participating in the working group that they felt that this was
a resonable conclusion.

JRG: Again I think the two types of conformance just gives more detail on
what are the authoring tools capabilities and gives developers a chance to
focus their resources on shorter term compliance while they learn more
about the other type of conformance.  Sometimes smaller carrots are easier
to chew that one big carrot.  As a person who would like to have
able-bodied instructors on campus use tools that support accessible markup,
I would like to see the two types of conformance.  Since it may take a long
time for many tool developers to make their tools more accessible to
assistive technologies and build in accessibility features.  I think you
also need to stengthen the checkpoints in guideline 7.  I would recommend
adding a checkpoint related to supporting the keyboard for all functionalities.
