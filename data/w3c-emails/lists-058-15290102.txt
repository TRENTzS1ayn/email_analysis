Checkpoint 1.2 (produce content conforming to WCAG) is supposed to handle
this, since that is a major theme of those guidelines. The alternatives we
considered were to copy the guidelines entire, which seems redundant (for the
same reason that we refer to, rahter than include the content of, the User
Agent Guidelines) or to provide a summarised version of them, and we have
decided not to do that since knowledge of those guidelines is essential
anyway.

  Would it be useful to have a guideline that highlights the need to separate
  form from content.  The checkpoints for this guideline could highlight the
  use of style sheets for sperating style from content.  It could also
  directly deal with the accessible authoring practices related to tables and
  frames.  It also highlights an important concept of HTML and CSS.
  
  Example:
  Guideline X: Allow the author to separate device dependent rendering
  information from web content
  
  Checkpoint X.1: Support the use of style sheets for font size, font face
  and font styles 
  
  Checkpoint X.2: Support the use of style sheets for element and document colors
  
  Checkpoint X.3: Support the use of style sheets for the spatial layout of
  web content
  
  Checkpoint X.4: Support the use of NOFRAMES 
  
  Checkpoint X.5: Support style sheets for rendering of generated speech
  
  Checkpoint X.6: Support style sheets for audio rendering (volume, pitch..)
