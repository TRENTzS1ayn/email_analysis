7.1 Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and
conventions (Priority 1 for standards and conventions which are essential
to accessibility, Priority 2 for those that are important to accessibility,
Priority 3 for those that are beneficial to accessibility). 

How does a developer know what are the priority 1, priority 2 and priority
3 standards and conventions for satisfying this checkpoint?

I looked at the technique, but it just gave a list of references to design
guidelines. 
Do the design guidelines define the priority 1, 2 and 3 standards and
conventions?
