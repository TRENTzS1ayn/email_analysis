I think the word "preserve" seems to indicate the original intent is that
somebody has done something somewhere else to add accessibility information
to the object and this checkpoint seems to be saying make sure you keep it
around for use in this authoring tool.  

In the excel case I stated nobody really did anything special for
accessibility, but there is information available that can be used to
generate accessible markup.  I think a term like "generate" accessible
markup is a different concept than the current word "preserve".

You may want to describe more the difference between "human authored" and
"automatically generated" accessibility information.  I would suggest this
be done through checkpoints, since it seems like two fundamentally
different concepts to me.

I think the use of multi-media in 3.3 is limiting.  Why not "pre-written"
accessibility information for any object be used as the default?  Is there
something special about mult-media?
