I think this approach is short sighted if this is truely the operational
model of the working group.  I think that there are more and more people
generating HTML that have no concept of HTML markup.   Tools that can guide
the user to add appropriate accessibility information without the user
understanding the markup is going to be critical if Web Content is going to
become more universally accessible.  I remember Damiel telling a story at
the first WAI meeting several years ago about a person giving an HTML
authoring workshop at one of the WWW conferences that did not even know the
fundamentals of HTML makrup language.

I think the guidelines should at least discuss these types of techniques in
the techniques document.  I would hope there would be more direct
references in the checkpoints and guidelines.
