I think this is a real issue that the AU Guidelines needs to address. 
Here are a couple of options:

1) This is a "reasonable person" type checkpoint and it is up to
   developers to make reasonable choices. Required action: Just
   ensure that this is clear in the Guidelines.

2) Even reasonable people require guidelines, so add some
   scope to the checkpoint. For instance:
       a) Apply variable priorities (as shown above) for 
          standards and conventions that prioritize requirements.
       b) For other standards and conventions, this checkpoint is
          Priority 1.

3) Drop the variable priorities altogether.

4) Drop the checkpoint.

I propose option 2.
