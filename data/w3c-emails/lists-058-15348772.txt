Proposed: Add a cross-reference from checkpoint 4.5 to Guideline
3 of WCAG (Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.). 

4.5 Allow the author to transform presentation markup that is misused to
convey
            structure into structural markup, and to transform
presentation markup             that is stylistic into style sheet
markup.. 

Also, add a similar cross-reference and comment
as a technique to checkpoint 2.2.
