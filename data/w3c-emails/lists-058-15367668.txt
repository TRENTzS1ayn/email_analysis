I think that it is covered by the fact that we reference and require
conformance to the GL document in production of content, and the User Agent
guidelines are cited as guidelines which may be applicable (for example to a
preview mode, or an editor that also functions as a browser).

  One of the issues in WC and UA has been the specification and use of
  natural language (English, Japanese, French.... ) of the document and
  support the inclusion of natural language information.  I noticed that is
  mentioned in the AU techniques for Checkpoint 3.1 and 4.1, but no
  checkpoint that deals with the issue directly.  You may want to consider
  adding a checkpoint for compatibility with both user agent and web content,
  since web content has an entire guideline on the topic and user agent has
  several checkpoints.
