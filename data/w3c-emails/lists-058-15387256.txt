The Authoring Tool Accesiblity Guidelines are not intended to be used as
guidelines for authoring by people who know nothing or very little about
markup languages - that is the role of the Web Content Guidelines and the
various instructional materials based on them.

Making the document seem more like it would suit such people as a substitute
for WCAG would be a grave error, since it would provide a false security, at
the expense of being useful for developers trying to create accessible
authoring tols, and people who are trying to understand the requirements for
an accessible tool. In particular, the guidelines explicitly require
knowledge of the WCAG (in order to fulfil checkpoint 1.2 - the group has
decided to have no techniques for that checkpoint lest anybody mistakenly
think that they were a substitute for knowing the requirements).

One of the intended groups of people using the guidelines (one of the more
important ones if people are going to continue to create their own content)
is developers of tools which can be used by people who know nothing about
markup languages. However that is not the only audience. checkpoints such as
4.2, 5.2 and 6.2 are intended to address the need for tools which may or may
not presume any knowledge of markup. In a tool like HomeSite which is a
source-code editor it is perfectly reasonable to guide the author with help
and checking, and allow them to edit the source code however they wwant to.
It is not reasonable to expect source-code editing as a way of meeting P1
WCAG requirements in a WYSIWYG tool, which is the kind of tool that may be
being used by someone with no markup knowledge, and it would in fact
contravene checkpoint 5.1. If no help were provided, in either case, it would
contradict checkpoint 4.2.

So while the techniques you suggest are extremely valuable, I think they
should not be incorporated as checkpoints. (In any case, this will be
discussed by the Working Group).

  I think this approach is short sighted if this is truely the operational
  model of the working group.  I think that there are more and more people
  generating HTML that have no concept of HTML markup.   Tools that can guide
  the user to add appropriate accessibility information without the user
  understanding the markup is going to be critical if Web Content is going to
  become more universally accessible.  I remember Damiel telling a story at
  the first WAI meeting several years ago about a person giving an HTML
  authoring workshop at one of the WWW conferences that did not even know the
  fundamentals of HTML makrup language.
  
  I think the guidelines should at least discuss these types of techniques in
  the techniques document.  I would hope there would be more direct
  references in the checkpoints and guidelines.
