I will update the issues list to link to the minutes of the various
discussions of this issue (including, of course, this email thread).
Selecting individuals' opinions seems to me to have the potential for being
seen as questioning the role of the working group, and the value of the input
provided by anybody whose opinion is not selected, so I am not inclined to do
so.

Most individuals do not need a completely accessible tool (as described by
the guidelines). Some people do not need particular features to enable them
to use the tool; some do not need any documentation exaplining accessible
authoring practices; some do not need any validation or prompting. However
the current guidelines are designed to enable tools which can be used, and
produce content that is useful to people regardless of disablity, as per the
working group's charter.

cheers

  Responses in JRG:
  JRG: You may want to provide a link to the conformance discussion in your
  issue list.  I am sure that many companies during proposed recommendation
  will want to review the discussion that lead to this group decision.  Since
  it is a potential hot button issue during proposed recommendation you may
  also want to outline the different options the group considered, the
  process that was used to reach consensus and why group reached this
  consensus.  You may also want to include references or statements from the
  developers participating in the working group that they felt that this was
  a resonable conclusion.

  JRG: Again I think the two types of conformance just gives more detail on
  what are the authoring tools capabilities and gives developers a chance to
  focus their resources on shorter term compliance while they learn more
  about the other type of conformance.  Sometimes smaller carrots are easier
  to chew that one big carrot.  As a person who would like to have
  able-bodied instructors on campus use tools that support accessible markup,
  I would like to see the two types of conformance.  Since it may take a long
  time for many tool developers to make their tools more accessible to
  assistive technologies and build in accessibility features.  I think you
  also need to stengthen the checkpoints in guideline 7.  I would recommend
  adding a checkpoint related to supporting the keyboard for all functionalities.
