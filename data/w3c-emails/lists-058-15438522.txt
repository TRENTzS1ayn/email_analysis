I think one of the purposes of the guidelines is to educate people on what
is important to implement.  Both WC and UA could have just said implement
the specification and made no other reference to natural language in the
guidelines document.  I think that since the other groups have allocated
guideline and checkpoint space to the issue, the authoring tools group
would want to have a supporting checkpoint for consistency with the other
guidelines.
