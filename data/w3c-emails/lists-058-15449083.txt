JRG: I don't think my message indicated that the authoring tool guidelines
were for people who did not understand markup, my comments were intended to
have checkpoints related to authors who do not understand markup.

JRG: BINGO!  I think this is one area that the guidelines should be very
strong, with strong supporting checkpoints.  The majority of web content is
being developed by people with little or no understanding of the markup
language.  Developers of tools should build into there tools (maybe through
configuration) different levels of support of adding accessibility information.

I think my comment relates most directly to checkpoint 3.1.  It would be
nice to have that checkpoint or another checkpoint highlight the need to
guide the author through creating accessible content.

Checkpoint 6.2 seems to hint at this but seems to be more of a totorial
function

However that is not the only audience. checkpoints such as
>4.2, 5.2 and 6.2 are intended to address the need for tools which may or may

JRG: For 5.2 why not just have a list of highest priority features to
implement for accessible authoring.
