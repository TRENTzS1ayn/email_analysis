aloha, jon!

i am adamantly opposed to splitting the conformance statement for the AUGL --
the goal of the AU WG, as spelled out in its charter [1], is to produce a
document that will assist software manufacturers to develop authoring tools
that not only produce accessible content, but which are themselves
accessible...    check the wording of the charter and the introductory text
carefully, and you will see that the accessibility of the tool and of the
content that it produces is not an "either-or" proposition, but that the 2 are
inter-related and (at least for the purposes of the AU WG and AUGL)
inseparable...

splitting conformance as you suggested would lead to the most pernicious form
of cyber-ghetto-ization, in which disabled individuals would be forced to rely
upon others to produce content for them, rather than reclaiming their
inalienable right to create content for the web by themselves...

it is not unreasonable to ask developers to ensure that their software is
accessible, for -- just as the first step towards the accessibility of web
content is use of valid markup -- so too is intelligent and conscientious
programming the first step towards building an accessible application...  all
we are asking the developers of authoring tools to do, therefore, is to
exercise care and to follow _published_ guidelines and standards in developing
their tools' interfaces...

allowing developers to produce authoring tools that are not themselves
accessible is akin to awarding the Martin Luther King Freedom Award to the
editor of a major publication who has always taken a strong stance on equal
rights and integration, but who belongs to a country club that won't extend
membership to blacks, Jews, or women...

gregory.
