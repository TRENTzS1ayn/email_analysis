Is it satisfactory to resolve this by proposing the use of online services or
of external tools and plug-ins as a technique?

  in considering the question "what dependencies exist between ER and the
  Authoring Tool Guidelines (AUGL)?" i have concluded that there is at least one
  clear cut dependency, namely the possibility of rolling an existing evaluation
  and repair tool into an authoring tool, so as to allow the user to retrofit
  existing pages/sites, as well as providing accessibility checks and validation
  for newly created pages/sites...  the evaluation and repair tool (ERT) need not
  -- and probably should not -- be bundled into the authoring tool, but, rather,
  should be accessed online, thereby ensuring that the authoring tool is making
  the latest version of an ERT available to the user, rather than saddling the
  author with an antedated pre-packaged version...  there is precedent for such
  an integration -- Allaire's HomeSite, for example, allows one to use some
  online utilities/engines to check things such as broken links, so why shouldn't
  an authoring tool also make an online ERT available to its users?
  
  providing a mechanism whereby your pages and/or sites can be checked via an
  online ERT is an easy out for smaller developers who can't afford to develop
  and maintain their own ERT, but who want to satisfy as much of the AUGL as
  possible with the programming time available to them...
  
  as for where this fits into AUGL, i'd say Guideline 4: "Provide methods of
  checking and correcting inaccessible content"
