We are the Web Accessibility Initiative and the last word means
something like "first".

Accessibility to the Web is *read/write* access and the old "captive
audience" notion simply does not apply.

The incidence of authoring tools (and, thankfully other software) that
are accessible to PWDs is increasing dramatically and for us to hedge in
our guidelines would be unthinkable as well as unforgivable.  

In short: if it does not conform, it is not conformant.

If this puts too great a burden on someone trying to recommend a tool
for TABs to use to put out accessible Web materials, too bad.
