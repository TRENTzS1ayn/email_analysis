>Hi,
>
>To coincide (almost) with the release of Office 2000, Microsoft have
>published a white paper regarding the use of Office to generate HTML
>documents.  It discusses certain features of the Office suite, how they
>are mimicked in HTML and how these pages are rendered by Navigator and
>IE.  I've crudely put a copy on my own site for those among us who
>aren't keen on sending Microsoft personal information just for the sake
>of reading their documentation:
>
>  - http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/2000/downloadDetails/o2kbcwp.htm
>  - http://roesti.cs.jcu.edu.au/standards/
>
>A few brief notes of my own:
>
>  - Internet Explorer supports more standards than other browsers (though
>    no mention is made of how well each is supported, of course);
>  - Office applications have different ways of translating their
>    respective documents to HTML, in order to maximise the number of
>    features that can be translated;
>  - Internet Explorer handles Office-generated files much better than
>    other browsers;
>  - Navigator is particularly prone to crashing while viewing HTML
>    documents generated by Office;
>  - Web page designers should be wary of their target audience and which
>    browser/s is/are most likely to be used.
>
>It fails to mention that Office makes very little attempt to generate
>good HTML code or to support other browsers.  For mine, it just goes to
>show that Microsoft have no intention of complying with standards other
>than their own, and have no interest in standards unless it means
>everyone switches to IE.
>
>Hope you find this interesting.
