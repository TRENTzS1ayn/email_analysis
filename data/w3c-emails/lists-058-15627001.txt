Due to a lack of agenda items that must be discussed in the teleconference,
we will be postponing tomorrow's meeting. As many people will be in transit
next Wednesday afternoon, our next meeting will be the face to face meeting
on October 7 and 8.

Please take a look at the techniques and adopt a section of the techniques
to convert from point form to prose. Could everyone also recruit people and
companies to review the last call draft before next Monday.

Thanks
Jutta
