Being able to activate a link via the keyboard is pretty urgent, and making
sure there is a focus in each window (that doesn't disappear).

If it is easy, exposing the home and stop buttons for the keyboard would be
good too.

  I read the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines and the accompanying
  documents. I guess you did a great work.
  
  There is only one point which embarrassed the Amaya team. It's the fact that 
  the ATAG refuses to consider an authoring tool which generates accessible 
  information but it's not itself accesible.
  You can easily understand that the conformity will be harder to obtain for a
  WYSIWYG authoring tool than a simple converter.
  After a long internal discussion, the Amaya team finally agreed with that
  position, considering that a WYSIWYG authoring tool should be compliant with
  the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines too.
  
  The Amaya team will follow authoring tool accessibility guidelines.
  Our plan is to process step by step because we don't have the manpower to
  work at the same time on the user interface, XML, CSS, I18N, HTTP and 
  accessibility.
  If there is a very very urgent thing that we have to introduce in the next
  November Amaya release, please let we know.
