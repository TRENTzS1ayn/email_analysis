I think the guidelines document should make a stronger statement on 
keyboard support for accessibility. One way would be to move some of the 
bullets out of the techniques document and make them checkpoints. 

7.a Provide Keyboard access to all authoring functionalities through 
standard keyboard input device APIs supported by the operating system

7.b Document all keyboard bindings. 
Make as many keyboard bindings visible in menus and context sensistive 
help systems to increase their visibility to all users

7.c Provide logical navigation order for the keyboard interface

7.d Provide customizable keyboard shortcuts for common functions
