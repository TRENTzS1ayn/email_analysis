aloha, irene!

thank you for your comments on the AUGL...  

as you and the amaya team finally resolved, accessibility is a two-way street
-- to have produced guidelines that did not address the accessibility of the
tool being used to create accessible content would have been tantamount to
telling those users, such as myself, who is blind, and judy, who cannot use the
mouse, that it is sufficient to have accessible content created for us, but
that it isn't important to endow us with our inalienable right to create that
content for ourselves and for others...

but enough with pilosophy (or is it sophistry?)

the most urgent need is for a viable keyboard interface with which to interact
with amaya...  since i can't tab from link to link i can't test out hyperlinks,
nor can i test navigation controls, such as ACCESSKEY and TABINDEX...

so, i'm sorry to report that, at least from my perspective (or, rather, lack
thereof), the most urgent things which need to be introduced into the November
release are user interface enhancements -- to wit, (at least a modicum of)
keyboard support, plus the introduction of a system caret / cursor that ensures
that each window amaya opens is focusable...

these enhancements would allow users such as judy and myself and countless
others to actually use the authoring tool being developed and promulgated by
the organization for whom we have been involved/working in drafting these
guidelines...

thanks again for your feedback, and for your willingness to work with us,
gregory.
