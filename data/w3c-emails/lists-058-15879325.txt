I think one other issus in authoring tools is orientation.  How does the
user know what options are currently available?  

For example: 

1. Are they editing an element, attribue or content?

2. Where are they in the document tree?

3. I think there are some more, but these are the ones I came to mind off
the top of my head.

I don't see this issue mentioned in the guidelines, but I think some type
of mention of this issue is important.

I would recommend adding a guideline or some checkpoints related to "Allow
users with disabilities to remain oriented to the authoring tool functions
and document they are editing".
