This discussion should really go on in www-amaya@w3.org - I have forwarded it
there. Please drop the authoring tools group from the cc on replies.

Actually Amaya provides a "links" view, so you should be easily able to move
through the links. How to do that probably needs to be better documented. I
will probably try to provide documentation for keyboard control in a single
page, as well as noting it throughout the general documentation. In either
event, the CVS tree is the place to get the latest version of the
documentation, which I hope will have some substantial updates for the next
expected release version, due in November I think.

  aloha, irene!
  
  thank you for your comments on the AUGL...  
  
  as you and the amaya team finally resolved, accessibility is a two-way street
  -- to have produced guidelines that did not address the accessibility of the
  tool being used to create accessible content would have been tantamount to
  telling those users, such as myself, who is blind, and judy, who cannot use the
  mouse, that it is sufficient to have accessible content created for us, but
  that it isn't important to endow us with our inalienable right to create that
  content for ourselves and for others...
  
  but enough with pilosophy (or is it sophistry?)
  
  the most urgent need is for a viable keyboard interface with which to interact
  with amaya...  since i can't tab from link to link i can't test out hyperlinks,
  nor can i test navigation controls, such as ACCESSKEY and TABINDEX...
  
  so, i'm sorry to report that, at least from my perspective (or, rather, lack
  thereof), the most urgent things which need to be introduced into the November
  release are user interface enhancements -- to wit, (at least a modicum of)
  keyboard support, plus the introduction of a system caret / cursor that ensures
  that each window amaya opens is focusable...
  
  these enhancements would allow users such as judy and myself and countless
  others to actually use the authoring tool being developed and promulgated by
  the organization for whom we have been involved/working in drafting these
  guidelines...
  
  thanks again for your feedback, and for your willingness to work with us,
  gregory.
