Thanks for your comments and time Sho.

I will forward your remarks (they're not too late). 

1.1 and 1.2 are similar, except that they refer to different documents (1.1
refers to "whatever there is", with some suggestions for particular languages
in the techniques document, while 1.2 refers specifically to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.

Cheers

Charles

  Hi Charles.
  
  Please feel free to forward my remarks to the list (I hope it's not too late).  I haven't had time to give more specific examples, but an example of how the language could be made more clear/specific up is:
  
  OLD: Produce content that conforms to w3c's web content accessibility guidelines
  NEW: The authoring tool should provide a way to author content which conforms to
       the w3c's web content accessibility guidelines.
  
  Of course, at this point, Guideline 1.2 seems very similar to guideline 1.1
