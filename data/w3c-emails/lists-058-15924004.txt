I think the following should be mentioned in the techniques for 3.2:
If x.gif is labeled with alt="x", it would seem like a good idea to
automatically insert alt="x" the second time x.gif is used. I believe
it is covered in the checkpoint (last phrase), but I think it should
be covered in the notes or example.

3.2 Do not insert automatically generated (e.g., the filename)
or place-holder (e.g., "image") equivalent text, except in cases
where human-authored text has been written for an object
whose function is known with certainty. [Priority 1]
