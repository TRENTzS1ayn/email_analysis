4.1 Check for and alert the author to accessibility problems.
(Priority 1 for accessibility problems that are
[Web-Content-Priority-1], Priority 2 for accessibility problems that are
[Web-Content-Priority-2], Priority 3 for accessibility problems that are
[Web-Content-Priority-3])

A. In the introduction before 4.1it says that some users want to
check everything at the end, others want to be prompted along
the way. Checkpoint 4.1 seems to say check and pompt along
the way. Is the intent here to say "...At some point in the authoring
process the author must be able to check for and be alerted to
accessibility problems...?" I hope so.

B. There are many Web-Content checkpoints that cannot be
checked by an authoring tool (by any tool, for that matter).
Somewhere I read that we should be checking for
"checkable" things. This checkpoint must say that. As it is
it is impossible to comply.
