Wording on 1.1 has confused tool developers.  Authors [users of the tools] don't
implement authoring practices, the authors "use" the tool that implements
practices for the markup languag(s).  Once the tool developer read the
techniques they better understood the intent of 1.1.  In other words if the tool
allowed the user to directly edit the source, the tool then ensured that the
author had a way to ensure that the markup could be accessible.  Proposed
re-wording for 1.1:

1.1 Ensure the authoring tool implements an authoring practice that the user can
use to create accessible content for the markup language(s) supported by the
tool. [Priority 1]

Make it clearer in the techniques doc that the tool doesn't have to implement
ALL the techniques to meet 1.1
