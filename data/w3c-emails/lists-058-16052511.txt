Just found the following:

1.3 Ensure that templates provided by the tool conform to W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].
              [Priority 1 for level-A conformance, Priority 2 for double-A conformance, Priority 3 for triple-A conformance]

Very confusing: I first read it to say that for better conformance,
this point has lower priority. Didn't make sense at all.

One way it makes sense to me is to say "Priority 1 stuff of the *Content*
guidelines is required for level-A conformance of *Authoring*".
The other way round, it can also make sense: "Level-A conformance
stuff from *Content* GLs is Priority 1 for *Authoring*.

Anyway, I guess a clarification is necessary.

Regards,   Martin.
