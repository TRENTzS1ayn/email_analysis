Gregory's post re help accessibility raises another serious question:
how difficult must access be before the priority level is raised from a
state of inconvenience to that of impossible? If we require his level of
expertise (which from first-hand witnessing is startling) as a decision
point then we may not be strict enough. Some priority two items should
probably be reconsidered as P1s if only Rosmaita and three other people
can use a feature.
