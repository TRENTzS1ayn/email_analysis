I agree with Jim that 4.3 could be written clearer.  My proposed wording:

4.3 Allow the author to over ride the tool's removal of unrecognized accessible
markup. [Priority 2]
     Notes:
     1. The author may have included or imported markup that is not
     recognized by the tool, but which enhances accessibility as
     determined by the author.
     2. Author over ride need not be the tool's default setting.
