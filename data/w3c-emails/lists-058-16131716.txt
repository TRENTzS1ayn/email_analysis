More specifically, if a browser claims to support a certain kind of access
natively, and some user can't get to that type of access, you have a
condition of non-compliance.  Manufacturers and independent testing
organizations will be measuring level of compliance.  Independent users will
be reporting non-compliance.  Both ultimately get to the same information,
but the route is different.

Subject: Re: Proposed Note about developer-level information

Crossposted to AU, for whom this question also arises.

I agree with Ian that it makes sense to allow developers, consumers and
third
parties such as rating bureaux the ability to test conformance and make a
claim of conformance on their own behalf, or for a product they have tested.

It is of course nearly impossible for someone who does not know the code of
an implementation to be certain whether they follow some of the checkpoints,
and they have to rely on statements by the manufacturer. This is no
different
to a claim that browser X supports CSS - until I have run it through a
complete test suite how do I know whether the manufacturer is telling the
truth? On the other hand, anyone else can run it through the test suite,
since they are publicly available.

Just like with PICS rating services, individuals differ in how much they
will
trust a claim (There are some PICS services I think are very good, and
others
I find sufficiently inaccurate as to feel that the world would be better
without them. Like any other service really).

A possible approach would be to use an RDF schema of some kind (if the RDF
schema language becomes a recommendation it could be omre formally
expressed,
but it is not necessary) to set up a rating bureau. It would make an
interesting research project perhaps.

  The following responses are my opinions:

  I think developers should be able to make conformance claims.
JRG

  I think consumers should be able to make conformance claims.

IJ
  Setting up a third-party agency (or several) to verify conformance
  might be useful, notably if the agency gave feedback about the usability
  of the guidelines, errata, etc. I doubt W3C has the resources to
  serve as an agency itself, though it should be responsive to questions
  from rating agencies (as part of life-after-Rec).

  Labels and rating systems suggests using PICS
  for implementing solutions (refer to rating systems [1]).
