I agree that we need to make it clear that the user has the power of
override. However the thesis of 4.3 is that the tool doesn't know that it is
trying to remove something taht is there for accessibility. Perhaps we should
cross-reference 4.3 from guideline 2.

  I agree with Jim that 4.3 could be written clearer.  My proposed wording:
  
  4.3 Allow the author to over ride the tool's removal of unrecognized accessible
  markup. [Priority 2]
       Notes:
       1. The author may have included or imported markup that is not
       recognized by the tool, but which enhances accessibility as
       determined by the author.
       2. Author over ride need not be the tool's default setting.
