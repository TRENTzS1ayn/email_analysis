checkpoint 2.1 says to use applicable W3C Recommmendations.
Since these guidelines are being published by the W3C, this may
give the appearance of bias.

Are these guidelines meant to be adopted by companies not using 
W3C technologies?  If so, I think the guidelines should be
standards body neutral, as well as vendor neutral.

time left to search the list archives.
