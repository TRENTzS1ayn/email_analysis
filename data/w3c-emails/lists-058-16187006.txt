Comments from tool developers agree that "6.2 Ensure that all documentation
examples show how..." are beneficial to achieving accessibility.  They agree
that without at least good examples the result *may* be inaccessible markup.
But, having "all documentation" as a priority 1 - essential to ... is unfounded.
The working group should either lower the priority to P3  for "all"
documentation - or - maintain a P2 for at least examples of all the features
supported by the tool.
