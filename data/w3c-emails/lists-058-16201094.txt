While we who know how to create accessible pages are doing it without
the support of our tools, the rest of the people who are building web pages
do not manage to make them accessible. The alternative to this is to educate
every author as to the requirements of accessible authoring, and a rough idea
of how to get around the tool, before they start using it.

Since that is clearly impractical, I suggest that 5.2 remain at P1 and 5.1
retain the priority 2 that was proposed and accepted by the working group
during the last call period.

  obvious discontinuity and can affect user acceptance - but, none of the reasons

  definition of Priority 1: essential to...  The developers agree it is beneficial

  without integrated tools.   Proposal to lower to priority 3
