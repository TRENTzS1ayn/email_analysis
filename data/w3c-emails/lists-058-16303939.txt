Hi:

Thanks for including me in your response.

My concern is for the authoring tools professional who is not an access
specialist, and who is not conversant with all the other sources of
information regarding how to make help accessible--which, to my mind,
includes keyboard commands. If this person doesn't see the requirment on
the requirments list, it is dificult to blame them for not supporting a
requirment that was never specified.

Let me turn the question around. What is so problematic about specifying
this requirment? Is it less elegant? Is it ... well, let me not speculate,
but simply ask. What's wrong with putting this in the reqs? And, if it
doesn't go there, where does the industry get its check list of "required
things" to fix?
