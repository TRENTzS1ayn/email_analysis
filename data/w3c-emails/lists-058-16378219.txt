if 7.1 does include all things sub and supralunar, then doesn't it also demand
that in order to satisfy 7.1, one must offer full keyboard access -- for the
help system, as well as for the manipulation of the tool itself?  keyboard
access (unlike documentation) is mentioned specifically in the Techniques for
7.1 under the header "Input Device Independence"  -- and is specifically
addressed in our sister document, the User Agent Guidelines (guideline 2:
"Ensure keyboard access to user agent functionalities")  -- as well as in the
referenced guidelines issued by Trace, IBM, and Microsoft -- all of which
outline the principles of accessible software design -- not to mention the
standards documents, such as those promulgated by EiTAAC, which are also
referenced in the AU Techniques document...
