Just a reminder that we will have a teleconference at the regular time
today. The information is linked from the AU page: www.w3.org/WAI/AU.

I will be late for the teleconference (we are having a disability awareness
day here at the university and the keynote speaker had an accident so I
need to fill in from 3 to 4pm). Charles will chair the meeting in my place.
