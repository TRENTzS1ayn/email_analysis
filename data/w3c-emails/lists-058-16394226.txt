After much consideration I firmly believe that both checkpoints 4.1 and
4.2 should be Priority 1. Although the underlying acessibility problem
may be of a lower priority, the process of checking, alerting, and
assisting have P1 importance. The notification can state that the item
to which the author's attention is called may be of a lower priority,
but there is *no* excuse for not notifying or assisting her.

In this general vein, it is vital that authoring tools show the way and
although the content produced may for some unfathomable reason be less
than triple-A conformant, the tool itself (in order to be even A) must
notify the author of all levels of accessibility problems.

I cannot find where our document says that documentation and help, etc.
must themselves be accessible? In UA 12.2 et al this is explicit. Are we
depending on the tender mercies of outside references to assure that
conformant tools have accessible help?
