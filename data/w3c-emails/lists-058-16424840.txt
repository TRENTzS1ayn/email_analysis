>Hello, listers!
>Yesterday, while in search of an accessible WWW composing tool,
>I came across Amaya from the www.w3.org. Wow, I thought to my
>self, this must be the most accessible and HTML4.0-valid
>browser/editor. I downloaded the executable for Win95 and began
>testing. My surprise was, however, that while Amaya was
>HTML-correct, it wasn't that accessible at all.
>Here are some of the accessibility issues I encountered:
>
>1. the status line doesn't show enough information to provide
>the VIP user about hapening on the screen. For instance, if I
>create a table, I need to know which cell I am in and the most
>basic table properties of my table.
>
>2. Amaya would open these little windows for each action I was
>doing. Say, I wanted to highlight a part of text and create a
>hyperlink. When I selected Create a Link from the menu, there
>was no indication of where that link should be written.
>
>I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on my challenge.
>Thanks,
>Victor
