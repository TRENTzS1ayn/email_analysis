Probably, except that when we have something that people are calling
crucial information, it seems like we should make sure that it's
not simply lost in a crossreference.  If the checkpoints of the
UA checklist are considered _as important_ as the checkpoints in
the AU checklist, for purposes of AU conformity, then we should 
list both in the same place.  Otherwise we risk loss of signal via
unfollowed hyperlinks.
