The misleading phrase here is "people are calling crucial information".  Is not
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines considered crucial? - yes, but that is
NOT a reason to include those checkpoints in both places. "Accessible Help" is
less crucial than "keyboard access" to the functions of the Authoring Tool, and
the "keyboard access" checkpoint has NOT been added, nor should it be added
either.
