Gregory, does your inclusion of "the documentation distributed with the
tool" imply that printed documentation has to be accessible?

aloha, again, y'all!

to be inserted into the intro for GL7, as the final paragraph of the
introduction:

--- begin proposed addition to the intro to GL7
In keeping with the spirit of this Guideline, it is also essential that the
run-time help and any web-based help or support information, as well as the
documentation distributed with the tool, be fully accessible to persons
with disabilities. Strategies for achieving these aims are contained in the
User Agent Guidelines [_WAI-USERAGENT_].and the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines [_WAI-WEBCONTENT_], respectively.
--- end proposed addition to the intro to GL7

Obviously, the WAI-USERAGENT hyperlink would point to the References
section of the ATAG, which would necessitate the addition of the UAAG as a
reference...

And, while I'm speaking of the referenced works, would it be possible _NOT_
to include the quotation marks as part of the hypertext?  when i am using a
list of links that allows me to cycle through links by typing the first
letter of the link i am attempting to locate slash follow, i do not (as a
rule, save on WAI documents) use the quotation mark as an incremental
search activator...

gregory.
