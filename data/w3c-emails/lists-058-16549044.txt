aloha, dick!

mea culpa -- i should have typed "electronic documentation" -- believe you me,
i don't expect anyone other than the vendor of a targetted user agent or an
assistive technology to ship braille documentation by default!

it does, however, need to be made clear in the techniques for ATAG that the
term "electronic documentation" covers not only what is burned onto the
distribution CD, but any documentation and/or support mechanisms that are
mounted on the web -- they must be WCAG conformant...

so should any auto-update or auto-installation process -- such as "connect to
web", online update wizards, and the like...  

checkpoint 7.1, after all, it has been noted on this list in the past, covers
the accessibility of the installation process as well as the tool as a
whole...  hmm...  we do have techniques that address the installation process,
don't we, or have i just issued myself a new action item?

gregory.
