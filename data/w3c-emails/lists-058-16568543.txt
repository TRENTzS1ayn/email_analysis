Maybe what we should do is put something in the guidelines document to make
it very clear that the techniques include relevant refrences (not just UA
guidelines - there are others which are equally important)

  Probably, except that when we have something that people are calling
  crucial information, it seems like we should make sure that it's
  not simply lost in a crossreference.  If the checkpoints of the
  UA checklist are considered _as important_ as the checkpoints in
  the AU checklist, for purposes of AU conformity, then we should 
  list both in the same place.  Otherwise we risk loss of signal via
  unfollowed hyperlinks.
