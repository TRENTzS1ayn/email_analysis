Dear folks,

At the meeting tomorrow we hope to decide that we will ask the director for
Proposed Recommendation status for the Guidelines.

If you are unable to attend the meeting, please indicate your opinion with
your regrets (send to the list, as always).

The ageenda for the meeting is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-20oct99

Issues for consideration are changing the language of checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2
(getting alternative and structural information from the author) back to the
word prompt, and adding language in checkpoint 7.1 to make it clear that the
techniques for the checkpoint include references to specific guidelines for
various platforms and software.

Cheers

Charles
