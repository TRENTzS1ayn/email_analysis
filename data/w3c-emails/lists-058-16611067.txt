Dear folks,

I have been reminded by Jon Gundersn of an issue that was not discussed
during the last call period, which is that of multiple types fo conformance
(beyond the multiple levels we have currently).

We need to resolve this issue, so I have added it to the agenda for
tomorrow's call.

regards

Charles

  Dear folks,
  
  At the meeting tomorrow we hope to decide that we will ask the director for
  Proposed Recommendation status for the Guidelines.
  
  If you are unable to attend the meeting, please indicate your opinion with
  your regrets (send to the list, as always).
  
  The ageenda for the meeting is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-20oct99
  
  Issues for consideration are changing the language of checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2
  (getting alternative and structural information from the author) back to the
  word prompt, and adding language in checkpoint 7.1 to make it clear that the
  techniques for the checkpoint include references to specific guidelines for
  various platforms and software.
  
  Cheers
  
  Charles
