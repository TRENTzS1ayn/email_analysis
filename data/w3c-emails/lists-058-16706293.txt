Ian and Charles, here is my re-wording, refer to the 14 Oct draft for the
original http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19991014/

Note: I asked an "IBM editor" to review this also for a second opinion, but
don't have any feedback yet...

1.2 Checkpoint priorities

Each checkpoint has a priority level. The level reflects the impact in meeting
the goals of this document.

     Goals of the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines:

     That the authoring tool be accessible
     That the authoring tool generate accessible content by default
     That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible content

The three priority levels are assigned as follows:

[Priority 1]  If the checkpoint is <strong>essential</strong> to meeting those
goals

[Priority 2]  If the checkpoint is <strong>important</strong> to meeting those
goals

[Priority 3]  If the checkpoint is <strong>beneficial</strong> to meeting those
goals

[Relative Priority]
Checkpoints that refer to the generation, providing, or checking of Web content
have multiple priorities.  The priority is dependent on the priority in the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG].  It is a priority 1 for some Web
content to be available in alternative formats otherwise, one or more groups
<strong>will</strong> find it impossible to access the information.  For example
alternative text for images is a priority 1.  Therefore, it is a priority 1 for
the authoring tool to generate, provide, or check for alternative formats of
some types of information. It would be a priority 3 for the authoring tool to
generate, provide, or check for formats that one or more groups
<strong>may</strong> find somewhat difficult to access the information. For
example, expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM elements
by using the "title" attribute is a priority 3.

It is priority 1 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a
priority 1 requirement in [WCAG].
It is priority 2 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a
priority 2 requirement in [WCAG].
It is priority 3 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a
priority 3 requirement in [WCAG].
