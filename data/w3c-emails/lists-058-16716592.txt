I propose a slight rewording:

Some checkpoints that refer to the generation, providing, or checking of Web
content have multiple priorities.  The priority is dependent on the priority
in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG].

For example providing alternative text for images, and audio is a priority 1
requirement in WCAG since otherwise one or more groups will find it
impossible to access the information.  Therefore, it is a priority 1
requirement for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the author for
(3.1) alternative formats of these types of information.

Expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM elements by
using the "title" attribute is a priority 3 in WCAG. Therefore it is only
priority 3 for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the author for
(3.2) this information.

Where the numbers are linked to the relevant checkpoint. Thoughts?

  Ian and Charles, here is my re-wording, refer to the 14 Oct draft for the

  Note: I asked an "IBM editor" to review this also for a second opinion, but
  don't have any feedback yet...

  1.2 Checkpoint priorities
  
  Each checkpoint has a priority level. The level reflects the impact in meeting
  the goals of this document.
  
       Goals of the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines:
  
       That the authoring tool be accessible
       That the authoring tool generate accessible content by default
       That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible content
  
  The three priority levels are assigned as follows:
  
  [Priority 1]  If the checkpoint is <strong>essential</strong> to meeting those
  goals
  
  [Priority 2]  If the checkpoint is <strong>important</strong> to meeting those
  goals
  
  [Priority 3]  If the checkpoint is <strong>beneficial</strong> to meeting those
  goals
  
  [Relative Priority]
  Checkpoints that refer to the generation, providing, or checking of Web content
  have multiple priorities.  The priority is dependent on the priority in the Web
  Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG].  It is a priority 1 for some Web
  content to be available in alternative formats otherwise, one or more groups
  <strong>will</strong> find it impossible to access the information.  For example
  alternative text for images is a priority 1.  Therefore, it is a priority 1 for
  the authoring tool to generate, provide, or check for alternative formats of
  some types of information. It would be a priority 3 for the authoring tool to
  generate, provide, or check for formats that one or more groups
  <strong>may</strong> find somewhat difficult to access the information. For
  example, expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM elements
  by using the "title" attribute is a priority 3.
  
  It is priority 1 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a
  priority 1 requirement in [WCAG].
  It is priority 2 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a
  priority 2 requirement in [WCAG].
  It is priority 3 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a
  priority 3 requirement in [WCAG].
