In reviewing the priority of "3.2 Help the author create structured content and
separate information from its presentation", I was cross referencing with the
WCAG http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-structure-presentation and found
all of them [3.1-3.7]  to be Priority 2, so... I propose we simply edit 3.2 to
be [priority 2].

I'm not lowering the priority, just simplifies the work for the developer in
determining relative priority...
