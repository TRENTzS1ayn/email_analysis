Actually there are some structural features that are P3. I would prefer to
note the fact that in WCAG 1.0 structured features are P2 or P3 becuase

1) This is a reativ priority, and
2) Developers already need to understand relative priority - changing this
doesn't have any effect in the real world (although noting that there is no
P1 component does)

  In reviewing the priority of "3.2 Help the author create structured content and
  separate information from its presentation", I was cross referencing with the
  WCAG http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-structure-presentation and found
  all of them [3.1-3.7]  to be Priority 2, so... I propose we simply edit 3.2 to
  be [priority 2].
  
  I'm not lowering the priority, just simplifies the work for the developer in
  determining relative priority...
