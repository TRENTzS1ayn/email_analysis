Hello,

I have been receiving messages from different addresses, all of them 
apparently from the same person, some of them with infected attachments:

ezequielmartingurevich - exxel-group argentina gaius julius ceasar 
<unesco_nato_norad_ez666@yahoo.com.au>
ezequielmartingurevich <ezequielmartingurevich7177@yahoo.com>
ezequiel martin gurevich <ibm_russia@yahoo.com.ar>

Is someone else in the group receiving the same files? If so, is the W3 
Consortium aware of this problem?

Thanks so much for any reply and best regards,

Cristina
