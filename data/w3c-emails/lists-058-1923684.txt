This is a common present day phenomena!  Malicious attachments/emails are
targeted towards email lists, W3C is no exception.
I suggest that you get a good antisapm software which will allow you to
direct emails sent by one particular sender/group to a separate folder where
they can be safely deleted.
Also Enable Worm Blocking (Norton); Enables Worm Blocking to scan all
outgoing email messages and alert you if a malicious worm is detected.
Norton antivirus software allows you to see the details of a sender of a
malicious email/attachment, use this to create a message rule in Outlook so
as messages from the same sender are deleted from the server. Keep your Live
Update up to date and PRAY!
