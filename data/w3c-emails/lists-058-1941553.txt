Thank you so much to everybody!

I do have a good antivirus, update it daily, say all the prayers, etc. And 
still cross fingers! :-(

These messages from "ezequiel martin gurevich", whoever he is, are always 
sent to the list, among others. What really caught my attention is the fact 
that the sender's name is always the same, although the email addresses are 
always different.

I just wanted to share a concern with all of you.

Thanks again and best regards to all,

cristina
