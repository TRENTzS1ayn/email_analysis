Hi all,

A person from the Foundation that is hosting the W3C Spanish Office has just
started to work on the translation of the "W3C in 7 points" into Basque. The
original document is located at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Points/ 

We'll report the URI of the translated document as soon as finished.

Best,
Jose.
