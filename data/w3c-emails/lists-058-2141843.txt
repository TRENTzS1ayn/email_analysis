     Hello

     I have a few questions about a translation i have to do.

     For personal and job reasons, i have to make a translation of different 
W3C documents, specifically these ones:

     - CSS 2
     - xhtml 1.0
     - xhtml 1.1

     I know that this specifications have been translated before, but as far 
as i have to make it anyway, my three questions are:

     Can i translate it? I mean, is it legal?
     Can the trsnalations be added to the existing list?
     Can i publish it in my website?

     I supose that is not ilegal to translate it, but i'm not sure about the 
lagality of publish it because there are another translations available.

     Of course, i amallowed to publish it, i will follow all the necesary 
rules, copyright mention, normative mention, link to the other format 
documents of the same specification, etc.

     I hope to have expressed my situation in a right way.

     :)

     Bye
