Tamara,

there are others working in Portugal on translations, and in Brazil. I
believe at least Jorge Fernandes reads this list still.

In doing spanish translations Sidar has developed a group of people, so
that different people can volunteer for different chapters as a way of
getting a whole translation done. It also means that we discuss how to
translate particularly tricky parts, which slows us down but means we will
get consistent translation across a number of specifications.

I think this is a model worth repeating, if possible.


best regards

Charles
