W3C Translators is a list for people that want to help to promote W3C TR in local languages and not a translator list where people comes here for search translators.
Btw, I suggest to the list manager to allow posting only to registered members... otherwise like in christmas holidays we receive some spam.

>It is rather difficult to distinguish, especially on a busy day (usually receive over 50-nonspam emails per day), that a message was actually sent through the w3c-translators@w3.org mailing list  - too busy scanning messages. It is also rather strange to read a message from a person who is obviously the list co-ordinator (no previous introduction made) telling us, quite rightly, to keep it within the boundaries of the W3c.

>Although I quite agree that such business should be separate I also prefer to read an introductory note -from the sender - that the message does not deal with the W3c and apologies are duly made for unauthorised soliciting.
