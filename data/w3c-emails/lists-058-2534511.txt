Hello. We would like to begin translating document DOM 1 (Document Object Model Level 1) into Romanian (including diacritics). 

Here are its charactersitics:
Name: Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1, version 1 
Issue date: 1 October 1998
Authors: Vidur Apparao, Steve Byrne, Mike Champion, Scott Isaacs, Ian Jacobs, Arnaud Le Hors, Gavin Nicol, Jonathan Robie, Robert Sutor, Chris Wilson, Lauren Wood - (Errata) 
Located on W3C web site at: http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/

If allowed, we will exhaustvely translate it, this meaning that the "Errata" added by the authors will not by inserted in the Romanian version of the document, but translated as a separate corpus.
Please inform me of your considerations.

With respect,
Ovidiu Sorin - Artis Romania.
