Dear all,

 

I will start to translate XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0 into
Chinese. 

 

The original recommendation can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116 

Name: XSL Transformation (XSLT) Version 1.0

Issue date: 16 November 1999

Editor: James Clark jjc@jclark.com 

 

If allowed, I will devote myself into the translations. When finishing it, I
will publish this translation as soon as possible so that I can get more
warm-hearted instructions and suggestions. During the translation, I might
meet some technical questions and will mail the thread in this mailing-list,
wishing to get your helps! 

 

 

With respect,

 

Davidson Liang
