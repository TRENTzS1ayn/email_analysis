Hi!

The first draft of the German translation of XML 1.1 REC is available at
http://www.edition-w3c.de/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/

In fact I just merged the added and changed paragraphs and phrases of
XML 1.1 into my translation of XML 1.0. Since there was a version shift
of the xmlspec-dtd that was used for XML 1.1 I can't guarantee that my
XSLT produces 100% correct output. I have to do some proof reading; and
of course I still have to translate a few paras...
But the URI will not change, everybody is welcome to link to the
translation.

Regards, Stefan
