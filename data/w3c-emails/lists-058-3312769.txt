Are you a bit short of sun and warmth? Come to the Carnival of Rio!

 

 

Please click here to view our Carnival Live Image Camera: http://www.bitourism.com/livecams.asp  

(Please wait then for some seconds to load and refer to Parade Schedule in text attach. Axis Plug In may be installed.)

 

You will see the corner of "Posto 9" on the beach of Ipanema. It is magic! The Bossa Nova was born here, spontaneous street parties take place during Brazilian summer, sunsets are so stunningly beautiful and the most handsome locals meet here.

 

The Street Carnival happens here too. The happy "Blocos" impress with the famous Brazilian happiness and are a perfect example of sheer joy.

 

For us from B.I.T. a great opportunity to remind you of our popular Carioca-BBQ! We have right here our infrastructure with beach chairs and umbrellas, beach volley and soccer (our Brazilian team remains unbeaten!). Lobster from the grill, swimming in the sea and stretching out in the sun makes everyone happy.

 

We transmit the event from close and in higher resolution! This incentive gag is not only a comfort to those who had to stay at home, but will motivate them next year. 

 

By the way, our multimedia company offers many added values to our groups and it creates successfully home pages and CD-Roms for all segments of tourism. This is a plus for our guests - even if being it only for our excellent relations with hotels and local tourism offices. (www.Dinabit.com )

 

For sure you will understand now that our offices will be closed until next Wednesday at noon. But of course, each and every one of our staff can be reached 24 hours on his portable phone -like all the year round.
