Well, once again ;) -- Some months ago Roberto [1,2] and me (please see
the
message below; translations were attached again) translated all WAI
conformance pages into Italian and German, but they still haven't been
integrated,
though we both send two, three follow-up messages, too.

Maybe you can tell us if (and when) this will be done?


Many thanks for your time, best regards,
 Jens.
