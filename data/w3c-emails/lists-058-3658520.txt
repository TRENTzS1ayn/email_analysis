Hans-Werner,

I have a bad news for you: you are not the first one translating N3 ;-) Look at

http://localhost:8001/cgi-bin/TranslationsTechnology.py?technology=Primer-html

where a Japanese translation is already listed...

So, seriously, of course there is no problem putting this on the official list. 
Just give me the final URI when it is available and I will add it to our database

Ivan
