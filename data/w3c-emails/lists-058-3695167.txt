To W3C Members


Hello, my name is MAKI Kazuhiko.
I'm a sutudent of Kyoto University, Japan.

Recently, I privately translated the following two documents
by W3C into Japanese:

1. http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere
2. http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/

...and I'm planning to put them on my website and
open them to the public.
So I inform you of my plan as such.


I'll comply with all you require at your document below:

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate


When my translation is put on the web, their URL will be:

1. http://kazmacky.cool.ne.jp/www/translate/here.html
2. http://kazmacky.cool.ne.jp/www/translate/raggett.html

They are not on the web yet, 
but I'm going to put them in this March. 
When I put them on my site, I'll inform you again.


Thank you for reading my not-good English.
