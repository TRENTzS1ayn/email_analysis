How about collecting "boiler plate" routines that enable the author to
include certain (accessible) features in her web site?  E.g. my ISP has
little hints on how to "add a submission form to your web page."

In general there must be a way to get to *ALL* ISPs so that they can be
notified of their responsibility (liabilit?) in regard to ensuring that
all their web site authors are in conformance with the guidelines
*required* by the WAI.  In any subsequent "legal/ethical/moral showdown"
they will have complied with the requirement to "show good faith" if
they notify all their  users about accessibility's importance both from
the point of view of getting good readership and conformance with WAI
goals.
