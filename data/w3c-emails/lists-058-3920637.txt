URGENT -- to WAI AU members.

I am trying to determine whether we will be having an Authoring Tools
Working Group conference call Friday evening 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. April 17 US
EDT.  Six p.m. US EDT is the time that would appear to match 8 a.m.
Saturday here.  The phone bridge to dial into would be in Massachusetts at
+1.617.252.1038.  

I had sent this message to Jutta last week with arrangements for the call
but was unaware Jutta had left early for Australia, and she has not had
e-mail access while here.

If there is a critical mass of AU WG members who are available at this
time, we can arrange the call.  I need to know as soon as possible, please
reply to jbrewer@w3.org as soon as you get this and let me know if you
would be available to join the call.  Jutta tells me this has already been
discussed in the AU WG, and you will also note an announcement of it in the
"WAI events at WWW7" notice I sent to the WAI IG mailing list.  (See below.)

If this isn't how you want to spend your Friday evening, fine, just let me
know <grin> -- thanks

- Judy

(well, actually, whatever the equivalent time would be Friday, let's see, I
guess 5pm to 7pm Friday evening, does that sound right to you?) Can you let
me know tomorrow (Friday 4/10) approx how many callers will you have?

>Please note in any correspondence you send out that this will ONLY be
available for a two-hour period and for the specific purpose of the
Authoring Tools guidelines meeting.  Also please get people to actually
"register" with you for this call -- both those in the room at Brisbane,
and those participating on the MIT bridge, and request that they keep you
informed if their call status changes at all.  I will be staying at the
Rydges South Bank Hotel, my phone # 07 3255 0822, I will theoretically have
email access, please keep me informed of changes. Many thanks
