Subject: The number to call


As you may have deduced from Judy's message (sorry for the cross
postings) the number to call at 6pm EDT is +1.617.252.1038.  (this is a
Boston number, so you won't have long distance charges to Australia).
The conference call is scheduled for 2 hours from 6pm to 8pm EDT Friday,
which is 8am to 10am Saturday Brisbane time.

The goal for the conference call and meeting is to create authoring tool
guidelines for as many of the page author guidelines as possible, we
will begin with Images and Image Maps (Jan Richards), then move to
Frames (Scott Leubking) and if possible fit in links and style sheets.

Talk to you  or see you soon.

Jutta
