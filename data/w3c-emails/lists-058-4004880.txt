The first draft of the image and image map authoring tool recommendations
has now been placed in the repository area
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/recs.html for comment.  The structure is still
rough and we are looking for some input on the best way to phrase our
justification text to authors.

Other repository submissions can be made to me directly (Jutta is still
overseas) and I will do my best to put them up to the site within a day.
