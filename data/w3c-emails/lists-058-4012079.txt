We have a deadline of May 22 to create the draft AU guidelines. The
component pieces are slowly rolling in (see the recommendation repository
on our web site for updates). We hope to have a fairly complete document by
the end of this week. I would like to schedule a conference call for May 11
or May 13, 3pm EDST. How does this suit everyone?
