Hi all,
It appears we have a quarum for May 13th at 3:00 pm Eastern time. I had
sent a message earlier but our SMTP server was down for 2 days so you will
get an earlier message later. The number to call again is: 617-258-7910.

The agenda will be:
1. WWW 7 update
2. Guidelines timeline
3. Review of Recommendations

Jutta
