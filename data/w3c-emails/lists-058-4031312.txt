We seem to have a quarum for Wednesday May 11, at 3:00 pm EST. The number
will be 617-258-7910.

The Agenda is:

1. WWW7 report
2. Review of Timelines for Draft Proposal
3. Review of draft recommendations

Could those of you who are still sending in draft recommendations send them
in before the conference call.

Thanks Jutta
