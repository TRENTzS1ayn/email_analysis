I'd like to say that the teleconference today was very pleasant and to
read Harvey's "treatise" on tables was quite instructive.  It is
particularly appropriate for the audience we seek to reach.

I hope to do half as well in my assigned tasks.  I will be going to a
fiberfest in N.W. Washington and must go through Redmond so give me your
blessings.  I will take the laptop and try to get some writin' written.
