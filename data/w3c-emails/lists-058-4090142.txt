I learnt HTML online.  It was not difficult to learn the basics.  My 11 year
old son just taught himself basic HTML from the same source as I did.  I
liked the idea of having control over what I produced.  I use notepad and
feel very comfortable with it.  After learning the basic code, I tried
several editors and wanted to pull my hair out.  They do what they want to
do and not what you want them to do.  Or, at least to me, it seemed that
way.  I have friends who use Frontpage and do not care too much for it, but
won't take the time to learn HTML coding.

I am now reading about style sheets and learning more about HTML 4.0.  I
redid my entire sight to make it accessible.  I do not use java/script and I
have done one web page with frames, but not any more.  I, myself, do not
like frames.

But I agree with Charles McCathieNevile.  You need to provide the proper
training for the job that needs to be done.  If one does not have any
comprehension of HTML coding, why looking at a source of a page is very
daunting.  To that person, it looks like a foreign language.  And, at the
rate the internet is growing, there should be at least one person who knows
HTML at their place of business.

I also agree with Wayne Crotts that HTML editors to improve their product to
make them adhere HTML 4.0 and WAI standards.  Easier to work with, too,
would be nice.

I am still learning and will probably still be learning for ages to come.
