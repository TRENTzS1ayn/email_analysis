It is important for any authoring tool to promote creation practices 
that will lead to presentations on the World Wide Web that are 
accessible not only for people with disabilities but for user agents 
that have various capabilities or lacks thereof.

In the accompanying documentation with any tool, as well as throughout 
its help screens it shoulc be pointed out that to reach the widest 
possible audience the implementation must use the extensive facilities 
provided by HTML 4 and CSS2 so that surfers who are accessing the Web with
such facilities as WebTV, WebPhone, text or voice browsers, or even 
email renderings are not lost as participants in the author's intended 
usership pool.

Just as most effective programmer training methods urge pre-planning 
one's overall intended function, so a good authoring method should 
include a means of plotting the finished product before writing the 
first line of HTML.

By providing a skeleton with choices to help provide the *functional* 
rather than just the visual aspects of the site, the most effective tool 
will leave the author with a framework that makes for much easier 
modification, maintenance, as well as accessibility.

The major consideration is that if there are to be alternative 
presentations that they are: 1) *automatically* maintained with absolute 
equivalence; 2) easily selected, preferably before being loaded.
