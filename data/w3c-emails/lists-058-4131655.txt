Hello All,

The ALT "texst balloon" that was talked about during the conference call has
been posted to the web site at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/AU-IMG-trial.html

It is a slightly shortened version of the image recommendations already
posted (with some of the stronger language mentionned by William).

Please comment to this list so we can hammer out the quinks.

Jan Richards, ATRC
