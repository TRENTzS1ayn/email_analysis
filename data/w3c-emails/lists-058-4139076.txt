I find no "quinks" in Jan's post and feel that it represents a welcome
step back from what was formerly a rather "defensive" or at least "too
conciliatory" attitude expression.  The only "improvement" might be to
urge a prompt if an offending document is attempted to be saved without
these matters being attended to.

"Images are the most common inaccessible elements on the web" is
possibly a bit "buried" and it might serve as the TITLE of this whole
balloon in order to emphasize why we are so keen on forcing this issue.
By attaching major significance to this issue at this time we can
continue to hammer away at it with subsequent guidelines.  

Many of the items we will subsequently address will be more difficult to
explain as well as being more easily addressed by user agents, but this
one will for the forseeable future be the dividing point for our clients
and the (usually retinally chauvinistic) authors.  It will be something
like we are saying "surely your customers will want to help out in this
obviously important area - as only they can." 

The most popular "help the blind" volunteer activity is using one's eyes
to perform functions unavailable to people without eyesight like reading
or describing pictures.  The authoring tool vendor can be made to
understand that they are providing this opportunity to their user base.
