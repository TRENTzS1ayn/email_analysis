A bit of good news from Oz!  I find myself using HotDog a lot because it
doesn't arbitrarily make behind-the-back changes in one's HTML while
still providing all the clicking shortcuts for tags, etc.  It doesn't
"prettify" the code (ala Amaya and iWrite) but it works.

Now to urge prompting for ALT= attribute ever more firmly!

Hello William,

the version 4.0 final will be finalised with the final release of Pro 
5 final (alot of finals:) as well as CSS2.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact us again if you require any further assistance.
