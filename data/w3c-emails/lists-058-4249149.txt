First my apologies for being a non-participant in the list...BUT to busy
*yada yada yada*

Anyway would it be possible to add a section to address issues
concerning the accessability of  VRML (Virtual Reality MOdeling Languge)
files.

It could go under the "Other Recommendations" section.

A draft recommendation  could go as follows:

VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)

* Use of description field for Anchor nodes is manditory.
* Provide utilities to ease the creation of WorldInfo nodes for the
description of particularly important objects.
* Provide utilities to ease the creation of Viewpoints.
* Provide utilities to ease the association of Audio descriptions which
are associated with particular objects and/or Viewpoints.
