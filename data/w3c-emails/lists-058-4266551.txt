The issues you recommend dealing with are important to the WAI but I
think you should raise them in a different working group since the
Authoring Tools Working Group is designed to implement the Author
Guidelines and these items must first go through the Guidelines group
(and probably the Interest Group) before we are likely to deal with
them.
