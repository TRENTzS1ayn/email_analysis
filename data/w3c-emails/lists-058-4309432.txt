OK OK I'll buy that inclusion of VRML Accessability issues for the
Authoring Guidelines is a bit premature/immature. I must confess I am
also quite ignorant of the methodology/process being used by this group
to move issues forward, and that is certainly my fault. I am glad to
hear (from Daniel D.) that a placeholder is not necessary and that
future work in the VRML accessability domain is possible (which was all
I was trying to ensure) in the context of the W3C.
