I'd move this one at the end of the list.

Should say if it's a permanent status of just an issue with the
current version here rather than later on.

I think ALT for AREA in Client-Side Image Map should be mentioned here 
as well.

It's unclear what "appear" means here.

The usual situation is one of a page author dropping an image from the 
desktop onto her HTML editor.

How does this first guideline match this situation ?

Yes.

I'd still like to add a couple of specific examples to increase the
interest of the author.
   "... universal accessibility (screen reader, web phone, etc)" 

> Important Points for Help File Text
> 
>    * Use of the ALT text attribute is required.

maybe add "is required in HTML4"

>    * Images are the most common inaccessible elements on the web

definitively talk about web phone here.

How about in that case having the authoring tool "fetch" the ALT from
the TITLE element (not attribute) of the target HREF ?

Let's make clear we want to end up with ALT="" and not """".

ALT should be the empty string might be better phrased.

I think the D-link should be handled by the author herself, and the
guideline here should only mention LONGDESC.

same remark, "appear" is kind of vague.

Authors do not know what client-side vs server-side means.

Again, the usual scenario is one of an author making "sensitive" an
image in her HTML document by selecting the image and then clicking on 
"make a map" or something like that.

Then the authors goes into creation sensitive zones: rectangles,
circles, etc.

At that point, client-side map should be generated, and not
server-side.

That's the guideline.

If the author overrides this tool policy, then it is assumed that she
knows what client/server means and the warning should be presented.

> 1. Style and Structure
>

I'm afraid this is too strict. Authors cannot rely on CSS1 being
everywhere and they will have to use deprecated presentational markup
if they feel it's necessary for their business.

If they was a priority scheme, this could be a recommended.

This is going to be a hard-sell, they almost all use table for layout
today...



Can you remind why there is no prioritization scheme in this guideline 
while there is one in UA and GL ?
