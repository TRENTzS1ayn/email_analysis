Hello, 

Wendy Chisholm sent the following comment to the UA Guidelines list [1],
but I thought it should be shared on this list as well since the AU
guidelines address Alt-text:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The TITLE element is usually used to name the current window of the
browser.  However, TITLEs could also be displayed for titles of frames.
Another possible use of the TITLE element is to  provide alt-text for
images used as linke to pages when authors don't provide alt-text.  In
this
case, a brower could grab the contents of the TITLE element of the
document
being pointed to and use this as the alt-text.
