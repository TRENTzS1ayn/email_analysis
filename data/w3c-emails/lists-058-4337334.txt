Ian sends from Wendy: "Another possible use of the TITLE element is to 
provide alt-text for images used as linke to pages when authors don't
provide alt-text.  In this case, a brower could grab the contents of the
TITLE element of the document being pointed to and use this as the
alt-text."

WL:: I don't think this is the venue for this because: 1) it doesn't
deal with authoring *Tool* possibilities, rather is mainly for browsers;
2) it's not likely to "provide [USEFUL] alt-text for images..." since
the TITLE isn't apt to give much info about any particular IMG.
