Jan: "We may howeve want to emphasize good TITLE-ing of documents within
authoring tools."

WL:: We will want to emphasize good TITLEing, good LONGDESCing, and even
a whole bunch of other stuff but if we can't even get ALT="text" into
FrontPage, etc. the other stuff will have to follow after we finish
figuring how to solve Problem #1.  I am working on HotDog and iWrite
with mostly "we'll get back to you on that" results.
