This is a powerful safetynet type of idea - but we have to be
careful in implementation or this could cause a LOT of extra web
traffic.  and slow page loading...   if every page without alt
text does a fetch of the title for each of the links on the page.

However, if we set it up so that it is not done automatically it
should be fine.    That is, if it were a user option or done on
user request.    Then the titles would only be fetched if the
user was looking at blank image anchors and had no idea what they
pointed to.    No substitute for ALT, but a very nice safety net.

So this would really be a UA issue primarily - with titles being
important for it to work.   So I will post this (separately) over
there.

Hi,

I agree. It may be a good last chance solution for browsers but
it
shouldn't become an ALT text substitute.  We may howeve want to
emphasize good TITLE-ing of documents within authoring tools.
