To update you on the state of the Authoring Tool Guideline document. A few
weeks ago we decided during a conference call to reduce the document to  a
discussion of the structures available within authoring tools to support
the creation of accessible documents, one "trial balloon" recommendation
regarding the inclusion of meaningful alt-text and an abreviated list of
other recommendations. The thought was that this would make the document
less daunting and would allow us to evaluate the whole process from
advocating to developers, inclusion in the tools, response by users and the
effect on web pages. In discussions with Judy, Ian and Daniel we have come
full circle and are again looking at the entire document organized in
palatable chunks. We have also delayed the publishing of the document.

I also wanted to remind everyone of the Peterborough meeting, we will not
have an AU meeting. I would like to schedule an AU conference call for
Wednesday or Thursday of next week if possible at 3:00 pm EDST.  Below is a
message posted by Judy.

Thanks Jutta

Dear WAI Interest Group Participants,

Peterborough, UK, on July 24 and 25.  It is available at
