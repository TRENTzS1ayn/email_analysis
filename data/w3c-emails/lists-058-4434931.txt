In Jan's paper at http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc/rd/hm/3tions.htm is a
'summary statement': "...it seems clear that published guidelines and
pleas for cooperation have been ineffective in increasing the actual use
of accessible HTML authoring practices on the Web. In order to change
this state of affairs, the accessible HTML community must win the
cooperation of the most popular Web authoring product makers..."

WL:: Shouldn't this be our highest priority, instead of yet another set
of improved guidelines?  Anybody got any ideas of how to improve our
results in this area?
