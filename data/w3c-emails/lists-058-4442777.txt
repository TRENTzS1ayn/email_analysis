Friends  --

Some of you may not heave heard that the GCA has ... ummm ... re-organized
the November conference-event.  In 1998 there will be two separate events:

     XML'98: Enabling Business - November 16 - 18 will be:
       - chaired by Robin Tomlin and Dianne Kennedy
       - directed to management, newcomers, and users
       - include a 3-day trade-show
       - co-sponsored by OASIS (SGML Open)

     Markup Technologies: SGML, XML, and Beyond: Making Generalized
      Markup Work will be:
      - chaired by Tommie Usdin
      - co-chaired by Debbie Lapeyre and Michael Sperberg-McQueen
      - directed to technical users, developers, and designers
      - co-sponsored by The MIT Press

Unofficially, this means that there will be three days of marketing,
positioning, introductory talks, exhibits, and marketing followed by two
days of real techie-talk.

A draft of the Markup Technologies Call for Participation follows.

NOTE that it doesn't name a specific location because while I know that it
will be in Chicago I am not certain exactly where the
meetings will take place.

NOTE also that I'm sending it to you as soon as I had enough information.
Most of the web site mentioned are not yet up, but will be in a few days.

I hope that you will submit a paper (we need FULL PAPERS for peer review)
to Markup Technologies and that you will come to Chicago to join the fun.

-- Tommie

MARKUP TECHNOLOGIES DETAILS

THE CONFERENCE


Markup Technologies will focus on technical issues relating
to the design, development, and deployment of a variety of markup
technologies including but not limited to SGML, XML, HyTime,
and DSSSL.  This conference provides a two-day forum for highly technical
presentations, challenging questions from the attendees,
and lively debate on the merits of specific markup techniques.  Attendees
will be able to interact with the people who really make
markup work.  They will hear the latest breakthroughs in markup
techniques from the "troops in the data-trenches."

Markup Technologies is for the text enthusiast who is being asked
to build the infrastructure that will process and distribute data
to a varied mix of media products.  Markup Technologies is for
that document manager who needs to make data flow smoothly among
platforms and applications.

Papers at Markup Technologies must be all new material, address
some aspect of markup from a theoretical or practical
standpoint, and be detailed and rigorous.  All papers will
be peer reviewed to ensure high quality and technical merit.


TALKS

Are 30 minutes long, followed by 10 minutes for questions.
Presentations must be content- or technically-oriented;
product or service descriptions or  advertisements are not
appropriate.  Case studies should focus on the problem(s)
and approaches to solving them.  No sales pitches will
be tolerated.

All proposals will be submitted for blind review to a Peer
Review Panel to aid in selection. Talks will be chosen based
on technical merit, interest, applicability, and how well
they fit a coherent and balanced technical program.

All presenters must agree to: give their presentation and
answer questions in English, follow the Markup Technologies
speaker and audio-visual guidelines, and register for the
conference. A speaker discount will be available for one
presenter per talk, if the full paper is received on
schedule.

All papers will be published in the print and electronic
conference proceedings.


PROPOSALS

The full text of proposed papers should be submitted in SGML
via email (if possible).  Guidelines for Submission and a
DTD for submitting  proposed papers in SGML are available at
http://www.mulberrytech.com/MT98 or by email from
MT98@mulberrytech.com.  Contact Tommie Usdin at phone
+1 301/315-9631 or email <btusdin@mulberrytech.com> if you have
any questions.

Note that for Markup Technologies, unlike other GCA conferences,
FULL PAPERS must be submitted for Peer review.


PEER REVIEWERS

The Technical Committee of Markup Technologies is seeking
applicants to participate in the conference's Peer Review
Panel.  Peer Review Panel members will review several papers
to speak at the conference, suggesting whether the paper should
be accepted, where in the conference it should be placed, and
ways in which the presentation could be improved.  All papers
will be sent to the Peer Reviewers without attribution, and
any suggestions for improvements will be forwarded to the
author without attribution.  In other words, this will be a
double-blind review process.

Peer Reviews play a key role in maintaining the quality and
diversity of the presentations at a conference. If you have
any questions about the Peer Review process or the role of
members of the Peer review Panel please contact:
B. Tommie Usdinbtusdin@mulberrytech.com
Deborah A. Lapeyre dlapeyre@mulberrytech.com
C. M. Sperberg-McQueen tei@uic.edu

as a Peer Reviewer please complete the Application form at
