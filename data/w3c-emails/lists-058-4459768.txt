I have made most of the changes and placed the appendix in a separate file
to make the guidelines more manageable.

William, I did not change "Will Alt-text be used?" to your suggestion,
because I think that the point being made is that presently no "channelling"
of the author into a position where alt-text must be written exists.  I
think we should be drawing attention to how the UI can get the user to write
alt-text instead of worrying about the alt-text quality at this point
(although that is an issue).

NOTE: the change is not yet posted due to problems connecting with the w3c
site.

- Jan
