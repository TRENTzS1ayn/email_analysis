Yes, authoring product makers are important to us, both for the functionality
they provide, and making it both easy to use, hard to abuse.

I'm glad to hear that the next release of HoTMetaL will support HTML 4.0
and its accessibility features. How and when can that information be made 
public?

An idea that I discussed at CSUN was to get the attention of those 
legislators who have inaccessibled web sites, by providing an accessibility 
review of their home pages, with reminder that they are responsible to 
their whole constituency, and are excluding some. This may be illegal 
for government information, except that the U.S. house and senate members
are above the law. Instead, a more narrowly focused target would be the 
members of the rules committees first, as they determine required policy 
for the legislators, and could be more effective that way. Increasing the
awareness of legislators may make them more responsive to better laws on 
information accessibility.
