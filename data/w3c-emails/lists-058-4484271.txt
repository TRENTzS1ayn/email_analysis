An example tool would be a simple search of a site for missing
ALT="text" with an associated editor/database so that vendors could make
suggestions as to its improvement for inclusion in their products.

Perhaps a stripped-down Bobby?

This could then be furnished to every site with a .gov provenance that
was determined to have missing ALT="text".
