There are at least two major approaches to enhancing guideline
conformance by users of authoring tools:  Nag with such techniques as
being reluctant to save the document without there being alt-text tags;
rewarding the user with freebies like spell checker, alternate "preview"
modes (like text only or Lynx presentations).  As the aural mode becomes
more prevalent ("surf on your cell phone" <smile>) the author can have
the benefit of hearing what the site sounds like.  Many web authors have
sound cards and a free text-to-speech rendering will be "cool" and help
sell an authoring with that option.  Whenever the "lint" checker shows
good accessibility which is confirmed by the aural presentation, the
author can get congratulated as well as be allowed to save the
handiwork.
