The suggestion that authoring tools not save an author's work unless it is
accessible is unworkable for at least two reasons.
1. No major authoring tool software producer (Microsoft, Netscape, Adobe,
etc) would ever place such a user interface nuisance in their software.
2. Users could enter random characters to get around the checks (and the
requirement of perfectly spelled, grammatically correct Alt text is surely
taking things too far).

It is imperative that accessibility aware HTML authoring tools:
1. convince users to co-operate in the accessibility process by appearing
(and being) quick and easy to use.
2. support users to the maximum extent possible by automating tasks that
wear out user patience. (such as repetitive ALT tagging - ex. updating all
the alt text for a navigation icon)

The idea of using aural previewing is good, but remember that the author is
not always aware of the issues in involved in non-sighted navigation, etc.
and may not spot their own errors.

For those interested, I have written a short (and slightly sarcastic)
introduction to making authoring tools accessible at:
