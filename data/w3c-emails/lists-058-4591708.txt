This is assuming current authoring tool practice.

Adding a boolean radio button "Decorative: yes/no" that would have the
AT insert ALT="" in the IMG tag is a no brainer.

Or, since ALT is now required, hitting return in an empty edit box
could just mean that: decorative, and the AT would insert ALT=""
(although this one will probably be abused, so I'd rather have the AT
ask for confirmation)
