I am available for both (or any) of the conference calls mentioned. As
to background:

I am the "dean" of this stuff since I've been feeding at the blindness
trough for over 30 years.  My areas of interest are tightly focused on
trying to see to it that the fiasco the introduction of the GUI signaled
(loss of jobs, panic among blind computer users, and incredibly tedious
retrofitting) doesn't get duplicated in the WWW.

I don't think I have any expertise but I have a lot of experience.
