either day is fine, regardless of timezone.

I am a former teacher of students with visual impairments. I am currently
webmaster for the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Areas
of interest include access to interactive information (WWW or CD-ROM or
whatever is next) for people with disabilities. In the area of expertise, I
am a generalist.
