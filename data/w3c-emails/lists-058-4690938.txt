It is often opined that the ADA is without penalties for non-compliance
but here's a quote from the DOJ's ADA site: 

"Under title III the Department may also obtain civil penalties of up to
$50,000 for the first violation and $100,000 for any subsequent
violation."

While it is true that the ADA is honored more in breach than observance,
it is also true that at some point a redress of grievances is possible,
or even likely.  The cost of *not* providing accessible tools when the
vendor has been clearly informed of its responsibility could far exceed
the cost of complying.
