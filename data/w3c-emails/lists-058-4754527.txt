Here is the partial list of authoring tool developers we were targeting.
The actual list of developer is probably over 200, these are a reflection
of the market share results as of December 97. Please suggest any
additions. The Education and Outreach committee, headed by Judy Brewer,
will be contacting companies in this list and making them aware of our
efforts. If anyone has connections or influence with any of these companies
I would encourage you to use it to get additional members for our working
group.
