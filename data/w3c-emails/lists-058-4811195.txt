I would like to schedule another conference call for either Tuesday March
31 or Wednesday April 1 between 3 and 4:30 EST. How many people are
available at that time?

A number of you have not volunteered to tackle a guideline. In the interest
of time I may start contacting you directly to twist your arm to take on a
specific task. If everyone who has volunteered could email your draft to
the group by the 30th then I can compile them and send them out before our
teleconference.

The CSUN WAI meetings did not address the AU concerns  specifically but
several issues were brought up which are relevant to this group, they are:

1. Site authoring tools: Cynthia King brought up the observation that many
authors were using site authoring tools rather than page authoring tools.
We need to determine whether there are specific concerns and therefore
guidelines which would apply to site authoring.

2. Automatic Alt-text: There was a lengthy discussion regarding the
auto-alt issue. Gregg Vanderheiden summerized it as follows:

GV's Summary
1. everything important to authors; Will L's point echoed by
Chuck-authors consider everything on their pages to be content;
need to frame GLs so as to clearly delineate between
structure/content and presentation
2. err on side of including info and mark it so that it can
be excluded by those who don't want it via their UA
3. make sure that empty alt and any obviously stereotypical
strings are illegal
4. summary of discussion based on collated notes will be
posted to the IG lists
5. the topic "what to do until the browsers catch up with
the current PRs" will be addressed on list

We should add both these items to our next agenda.
