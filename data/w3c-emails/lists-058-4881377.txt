Hello,

Not much has been happening on this list.  A draft was placed on the AU
site in early July, at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS.html

I doubt very much that it is without problems, but so far there have
been no comments, re-writes, etc.  The group charter lists Fall '98 for
our first deliverables, so things need to pick up.  Industry comment is
also strongly welcomed.
