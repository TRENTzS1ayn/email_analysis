Hello:  This is Mickey Quenzer.

First of all, let me apologize for my lack of involvment in the group.

With the testing for PWWebspeak and having a grand daughter, I've been
pretty busy.

I saw this message, and thaught that it might interest some of you.

It would be good if we could help these people make their site accessable.
I
'd like to help them, but don't know how to begin.
