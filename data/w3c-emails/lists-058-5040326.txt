Karen, I just created a Lotus WordPro document, then saved it as HTML - so it
would do it's converting thing, graphics and all.  I'm no Lotus expert,  and I
couldn't find out how to add alt text while in editing/converting mode either -
but I was able to use WordPro 97 to edit the HTML source once converted - and
add the alt=text!  It is possible, although I'm not bragging.

When you view [or edit] HTML source code, you see the raw formatting codes in
the HTML document, rather than the formatting represented by the codes.

1. Choose File - Internet.
2. Choose HTML Import/Export Options.
3. Select "Import as source code" and click OK.
4. Choose File - Open.
5. Select "HTML" in the "Files of type" box.
6. Specify the drive and folder that contains the HTML file you want to open.
7. Type the name of the HTML file in the "File name'" box.
8. Click Open.
9. When you are finished viewing [or editing] the code,
      [Save as text, and rename the filename as *.html, otherwise WordPro will
save it as example source code.]
