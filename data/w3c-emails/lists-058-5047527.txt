Hello,

Today I mentioned an idea for a kind of accessibility checklist
that could be offered by the Tool to the Author. The checklist
would present key topics of accessibility (identified by these
guidelines) and indicate which ones the author had satisfied through
some mechanism (e.g., a check mark). Those that were not yet satisfied
would be unchecked. For those not yet satisfied, the Author
could follow links to information about how to satisfy them.

The idea here is to provide a mechanism that:

1) Isn't a spell-check-like mechanism for highlighting
   accessibility problems in the document body (this is also useful,     
   but a separate mechanism). The checks could be "calculated" 
   after the Author has finished an editing session.

2) Gives Authors an introduction to accessibility topics (a checklist of
10
   or so might even stick in people's minds).

3) Gives Authors a starting point to finding more info about topics

4) Gives positive feedback ("You *have* done a good job for these
topics").
