[Various implementation details]

I like the idea but I think that for inclusion in the authoring tool
guidelines it should be abstracted somewhat.

For instance we might recommend that authoring tools present positive
reinforcement when any accessiblity issues are corrected.  We may
suggest that this positive reinforcement include mention of both the
satisfied and unsatisfied issues.  However, I think we should avoid
suggesting that the checklist be activated after editing. Tool makers
may find ways to present these issues within the ongoing editing
process.
