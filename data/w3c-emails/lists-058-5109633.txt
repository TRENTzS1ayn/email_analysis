The AU guidelines documents and the evaluation we are doing of authoring
tools will be highlighted at the Advisory Committee meetings in Kyoto in
mid November. Consequently we need to get the working draft ready in the
next week and a half. We will be posting a new draft on Monday. Please
review it and inundate us with comments, revisions etc, this may be your
last chance.

We will be holding a conference call to discuss revisions on Thursday
