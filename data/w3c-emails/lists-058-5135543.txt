Carl Brown: "It seems only reasonable that our systems of public
education here in California would be encouraged to purchase web
authoring tools from developers whose products support accessible
design."

WL:: "encouraged" is way too weak an attitude - we've been "encouraging"
for years with essentially no results.  Because of federal as well as
some state and local laws we must show an attitude of *requiring" tools
that generate accessible web pages.  The "teeth" in this are that no
institution (governmental, educational, or public) required by either
ADA or Section 508 to refuse to purchase unacceptable tools comply with
the law.  The forces that shattered apartheid, women-as-property, and
other oppressions were attacked frontally by lots of sanctions.  We may
not have to chain ourselves to the doors of the procurement contractors'
offices but we can insist that our public resources are not used to
further discriminate against PWDs.
