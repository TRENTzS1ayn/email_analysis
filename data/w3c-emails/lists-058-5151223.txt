To all AU working group members:

The Guidelines Working Draft will be going out to the WAI interest group
tomorrow, November the 3rd. Could you please review it. Any comments that
come back to the list by the end of the working day today will be
incorporated before the draft is put out for interest group review.

The document that is now up is without a table of contents, this will be
added this evening. There will also be an additional recommendation in
section 3c related to conversion tools (note that there are 3
recommendation on this topic there already). The two "modules" or
implemenation examples on tables and conversion tools will not go into this
round of the public working draft.
These topics will be covered in section 3 instead and these sections may be
added at a later date.

The document will go out as a public working draft on November 11, and will
be highlighted at the Advisory Committee meeting in Kyoto. Even if you have
no specific revisions, any comments on the overall document would be
appreciated.

Thanks Jutta
