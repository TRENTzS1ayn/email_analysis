3.A.5: "... such as "alt"-text for HTML4.0, should be permitted to be
published on the Web..." is missing a "not" between "should" and "be"!

3.B.2: you might want to add a bullet about the fact that the tools will
be required to comply with these guidelines in order for them to be
purchased by any entities covered by such rules as are to be found in
the "policy document" that Judy is preparing.

3.B.4: it may behoove the vendor of authoring tools who includes such
things as "clip art" or canned videos, etc. demand of their source for
such items that they include the required attributes.

5.1: "Prompts are relatively non-obstrusive and are address a problem
before it..." the word "are" should be struck.
