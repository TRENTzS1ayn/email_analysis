Programs like Word, Notes, etc, which can be used to generate web content 
should have the same guidelines applied to them as any other authoring 
tool, except that they would apply when material is being saved as HTML. 
In other words, saving as HTML should produce a review of the documents 
as Carl suggested for authoring tools proper. Although it may indeed be 
difficult to convince manufacturers to implement these, we should not 
therefore say OK, it doesn't matter then. These programs are being used 
to generate HTML, look like becoming the greatest culprits in making the 
web inaccessible, and are increasingly popular because people are already 
familiar with them.

If these products are rated as producing inaccessible, then those 
purchasers who are looking to produce accessible material will create a 
market pressure for the manufacturers to adopt the guidelines.
