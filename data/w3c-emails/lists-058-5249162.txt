I'm only trying to say - if you see a bug:  report it!  Not everything has
to be a policy matter...

I think that rather than address specific concerns (eg I hate the way 
Word produces HTML with font markup tags) I think the real concern is 
will Microsoft implement the AU guidelines in the various tools which 
provide HTML publishing as a secondary function, such as Word, Publisher, 
etc. It seems that there is some debate as to whether we should ask this 
of Microsoft (and everyone else in the same position) and I think the 
answer is very emphatically yes we should.
