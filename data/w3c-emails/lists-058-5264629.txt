Chuck: "I'm only trying to say - if you see a bug:  report it!  Not
everything has to be a policy matter..."

WL:: The problem we are encountering is that the biggest bug is in the
"policy matters".  The fact is that the entire reason that all this WAI
effort is necessary is because the policies are bug-infested and we must
work on those very fundamental things - even though we must still try to
stamp out all the individual things that preclude inclusion.
