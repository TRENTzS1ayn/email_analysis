I would like to make a few suggestions for inclusion in the guidelines regarding the generation of ALT text by the HTML tool.

HTML tools should NOT generate 'placeholder' ALT text but should leave the Alt text blank (ALT="") or not generate the Alt attribute. Placeholder text could be generated by the tool to let the user know that some text should be added. Examples of this include "Alt text here" or "Place Alt text here". If placeholder text is generated then accessibility checking tools will only see that there is Alt text and assume the element is accessible. This should be a priority 1 item.

HTML tools should generate default Alt text with caution. If default text is generated then the user must be offered the option of changing the text. Priority 2?

These ideas were discussed on the WAI ER IG conference call on Nov. 4, 1998.

Chris
