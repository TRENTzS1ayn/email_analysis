Here are the minutes of the November 5 Conference Call:
Present:
Jutta T., Jan Richards, Karen McCall, Daniel D., Ian Jacobs, William L.,
Jim Allen, Mickey Q., Charles Mc.

1. As suggested by Daniel it was decided that this document would only
address supporting the creation of accessible documents, that the section 4
refering to making the authoring tool itself accessible would be dropped.
This was to decrease the size of the document. Subsequently at the end of
the call (Daniel was no longer present) several members strongly objected
to this decision. This will be discussed further on the list.
2. It was decided that a text only view be recommended.
3. The various approaches to seperating techniques from guidelines were
discussed. It was decided that more specific guidance was needed but that
the authoring tool differed significantly from the UA and Page Author
guidelines. Specific examples will be generated for each of the section
three guidelines. These will either be within the document, in an example
section at the end  with links or as a seperate document with links.
4. Section 5 will be expanded to bring back in the other mechanisms that
can be used to support accessible authoring.
5. Further rationale text will be added. We will insure that this is
international and not US biased.
6. It was suggested that we should check with an authoring tool developer
to see if the language and examples addressed their needs- as this is a
document for developers not the general public.
7. It was decided that there should be a guideline that states that the
authoring tool should not generate default alt- text or create place-holder
alt text.
8. All members will review the document before next Tuesday and send in
comments.
