<<
HTML tools should NOT generate 'placeholder' ALT text but should leave the
Alt text blank (ALT="") or not generate the Alt attribute. Placeholder text
could be generated by the tool to let the user know that some text should be
added. Examples of this include "Alt text here" or "Place Alt text here". If
placeholder text is generated then accessibility checking tools will only
see that there is Alt text and assume the element is accessible. This should
be a priority 1 item.

?
Authoring Tools should never set the ALT text to null (ALT="").? That
generally means that the image has no meaning and since there is a ALT
attribute, verses the lack of one, you can be sure the author is telling you
that the image has no meaning.
?
Place holder text is interesting.? Throughout Microsoft development tools
are source code comments like:
?
/* TODO:? Add code to make this work */
?
Would the "Place ALT text here", or better yet "Put image description here"
be reasonable to folks?? 
?
<<
HTML tools should generate default Alt text with caution. If default text is
generated then the user must be offered the option of changing the text.
Priority 2?
>>
?
The only time an authoring tool should generate the ALT text itself is when
it's absolutely certain of the meaning.? For example, graphical bullets
might have pre-fab ALT text.? Same with graphical horizontal rules and table
borders.
