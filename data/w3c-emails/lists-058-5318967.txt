On Nov 4 draft, I already spoke on the call about structural changes.
These are mostly wording.

- Guidelines for Development of Web Authoring Tools that 
  Support Accessibility  

I'd like it to be changed in something that reflect the generation
aspect, for Support is a vague term
How about
  Guidelines for Development of Web Authoring Tools that generate
  accessible contents.
(since document is too restrictive, as per Chuck and page as well,
since we want to cover site tools)

- In the definition of Authoring Tool 
    ... to WYSIWYG editors that
    allow markup to be produced from a browsing perspective. 
I don't parse "browsing perspective"

- definition of Generation Tool 
    A Generation Tool is a program or script that produces automatic
    markup "on the fly" following a template or set of rules. 
Is this for server side generation ? If so, we should mention server
generation tool.


- 3.1.1 Support all accessibility features of relevant languages 

I think our first guideline should be to Support the W3C standard
correctly, which includes their accessibility features.

As of today, HTML+CSS AU tools must generate correct HTML4 + CSS1.

It's OK to point at specific accessibility features, but the wording
should be clear about the importance of generating standard markup.

 
- 3.2.2 Provide rationales that stress Universal Design [Priority 1]

Should we add legislation matters into the picture ?
I think so.

- 3.2.4 Package multimedia files with pre-written descriptions 

I would like to see clip-art in the wording, to make it clearer.

- [Technique: 3.3.5.1] [Priority 1] 
   Authoring tools should never remove or modify structure or content
   that is necessary for accessibility. 

make that a "must never remove..."
