To me, this group is not about making "things" accessible, it's about
making sure that authoring tools generate accessible content.

It's not like saying I don't want to deal with accessibility of au
tools, just that it shouldn't happen here and today.
 
Again, it's a matter of personal opinion: I think we can do a better
job by focusing on this one problem. Time is of the essence, companies 
are rolling out new editors.

The suggestion that it be dealt with in UA makes more sense to me, a
AU is a UA too, one that does editing.

Size has nothing to do with it, I'v seen group spend 3 months to agree on a
single paragraph.
