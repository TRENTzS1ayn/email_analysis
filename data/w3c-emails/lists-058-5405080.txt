As I recall it the minutes are correct. The rationale was that a default 
ALT value of any kind means that validating tools will not be able to 
determine the fact that the ALT text is not human-generated (and 
computers are still not very good at reading pictures, except bitmapped 
text) and therefore unlikely to be of much value, and that if there was a 
default value it would enable authors to simply rely on it instead of 
providing a useful value.
