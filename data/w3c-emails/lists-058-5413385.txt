I'm with Chuck on this one. The fact that tools themselves must be 
accessible is an assumption of WAI (Or it ought to be if it isn't) but 
the scope of the AU guidelines is what tools need to do to ensure that 
the materials they produce are accessible - the specifics of accessible 
UI design are outside this scope, and should be properly dealt with in 
other areas. However I agree that we could valuably insert a statement 
making this explicit - more in the introduction/about this document, like 
the statement about scope which has been discussed recently in the PAGL 
group.
