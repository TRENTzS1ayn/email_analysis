It may be reasonable to present a default option for repeated images - 
the bullet list is one exmple of this, but more generally we have 
suggested taht really good systems (this probably applies mostly to those 
which handle site control not just individual pages) would collect 
databases of ALT text and LONGDESCs for images (etc). It would then make 
sense to use them...
