Charles (Chuck) asked if it would be fine to add comments into the source 
code, along the lines of Microsoft's Java development stuff, which fills 
the code with 

/* Do something or other here */

It seems that if you did an analagous thing in HTML it would be

<!-- Put ALT text and associate a LONGDESC with this image! -->

which would be fine.
