This is good, and we should consider adding it to the guidelines.  However,
my intention was to show that there is a precedent for putting "to do"
placeholder text in generated code.  So a possible, non-pri1 guideline could
would result in code like this:

<img alt="TODO:  Put description of image here">

and

<A title="TODO:  Put description of link here">

This would be in addition to any other source code commenting (not embedded
in tags).  The idea being that when the ToolTip shows up with the "TODO:"
it'll be an additional reminder to add descriptions.

Charles (Chuck) asked if it would be fine to add comments into the source 
code, along the lines of Microsoft's Java development stuff, which fills 
the code with 

/* Do something or other here */

It seems that if you did an analagous thing in HTML it would be

<!-- Put ALT text and associate a LONGDESC with this image! -->

which would be fine.
