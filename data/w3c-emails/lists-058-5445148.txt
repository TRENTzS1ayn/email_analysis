Charles (Chuck) suggested that we could have
<IMG ALT="TO DO: Fix this ALT">

That was not reallly what I had meant - I was envisioning
<IMG>
<!-- To do: add ALT text -->

The conditions under which I would be happy to support the To Do ALT tag 
are that they make the author look like a complete goose if they don't do 
it. But I thnk I would prefer no ALT text. It really comes dow to a 
question of which approach is more likely to get the user to do the job.
