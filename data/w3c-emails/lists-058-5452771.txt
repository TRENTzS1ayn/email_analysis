Hi:

I am one of the folks who helped open the "Section 4" discussion again!

Re:"It's not like saying I don't want to deal with accessibility of au
tools, just that it shouldn't happen here and today."

Response: The issues for me are:
1 "tomorrow" never comes
2. this is a short piece in the entire guidelines
3. including it promotes inclusion from the beginning  of the design
process rather than "oh yeah, we forgot, but here is a patch" kind of
development
4. it was mentioned that there might be another document which deals
entirely with this issue and perhaps the door can be left open here for
it's creation; at the end of Section 4/before Section 5 to point to a
future guidelines document (if such guidelines is generated then I would
also support a "similarly short" section linking it to this one)

Karen
