Emphasis was on the "here". 

To me, it's like if someone was saying: "let's propose a different
DHTML events syntax in section 4". I would say: out of scope. This is
for another working group (in this case PF).

How can you say that where barely no one has ever commented on it ?

I bet if we want to include it, it's going to grow substentially and
take us a lot of cycles, because we will want to do it right.

There is no "the design" here. There are two differents design task,
independent:
  - the design of an accessible interface for authoring tools 
  - the design of authoring tools that generate accessible content

I'll repeat what I have said: an web authoring tool is a web user
agent specialized in editing (doing browsing as well), so I favor
moving this section 4 in the UA guidelines and working on it there,
even if this means delaying them.
