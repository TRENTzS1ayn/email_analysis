The comments on the document from the WAI Interest group are due by
Wednesday. We need to make decisions about revisions to the document before
it goes to Public Working Draft. How many people are available for a
conference call between 4 and 5 Boston Time on Wednesday Nov. 11. The
agenda will be a series of decisions I will send out by email on Wednesday
morning.

The phone number is being determined, as both Bridges are already booked
that day. I will send out an email as soon as I know the number.
