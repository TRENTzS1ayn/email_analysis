We have to meet on Wednesday afternoon after 4, after the IG review
deadline, and to give Ian time to do his stuff to the document before he
flies to Tokyo on Thursday.
What if we shifted the meeting to 5 to 6pm Boston time? That way we would
overlap only 1/2 an hour with the Page Author meeting. How many people
could make it?
