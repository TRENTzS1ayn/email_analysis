Because of conflicts with the Page Authoring group we will shift the AU
conference call to 5pm, Boston time on Wednesday November the 11th. This
will still overlap with the PA WG for half an hour but people should be
able to attend both for most of the call.

Please note, the number has also been changed to:
617/252-1038
