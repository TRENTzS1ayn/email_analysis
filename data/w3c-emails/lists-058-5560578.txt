Chuck: "It's my opinion that the document is not suitable for outside
presentation and I've expressed that to the Chair and Judy."

WL:: "expressing" it is not as helpful as making specific comments on
the list.  I know Jutta and Judy will be able to use your input but in
view of the fact that this process has been going on for several months
and is clearly closely tied in with affecting the largest producer of
web material generators, it would be fitting if you could explain
wherein the unsuitability of these guidelines lies.  It's all very well
for us to hone the details of the document but unless there is usable
input from the intended audience (beyond "not suitable for outside
presentation") it merely adds to the frustration that has accompanied
the entire WAI effort from its inception - not to mention the fueling of
one old geezer's "blind rage" in these matters.
