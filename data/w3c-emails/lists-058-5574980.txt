I as "the Chair" have received no previous message saying the draft is not
ready for outside presentation. I have received a message saying that you,
Chuck will not have time to review the draft until late November. I echo
William's sentiment, if you have time to make large general assertions
about the document, then you probably should make time to provide some
constructive input.
