[Technique: 6.2.1] [Priority 1] 
Authors should be provided the option of displaying the tags in a text
format.

I don't know what this means.  What other format would they be displayed
in?

6.4 and 6.5 it seems to me aren't specific to an authoring tool whereas
the preceding sections are.  In other words these sections should (if
they're not already) be included in the referred to UA guidelines.
