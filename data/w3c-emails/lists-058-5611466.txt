Aaargh!!!
The registration form is illegible even with my glasses on! But now I 
have got through it and started to download my eval version I'll have a 
play with it.

Also, you could tell the people who set up the form that they don't cater 
for people who are actually interested in evaluating the product, which 
means that I will be using it in a handful of different scenarios. (It 
says will I be making a personal page or a company page. It doesn't have 
an option for 'I will be evaluating this software', which implies a 
different usage pattern, so I give answers that aren't sufficiently accurate)

Anyway, in about 10 minutes I will get to install it, and then I'll start 
looking at what we're really interested in. (Can I recommend this product 
to people...)

Cheers
