Following Judy's post it seems that we should look at plagiarising the UA
Guidelines shamelessly wherever it is relevant, and adding material as
necessary.  This will provide consistency across the guidelines, while
allowing us to choose the order in which we present particular pieces. 

The question remains in my mind what to do with software which is both a
User Agent an an authoring tool - such as MSWord, and Amaya? It seems to
me that we should refer to the UA material for guidelines on how the User
Agent component.
