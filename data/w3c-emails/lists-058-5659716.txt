Some Netscape composers but a little yellow icon where there was a tag 
that didn't have an obvious effect. Not that the yellow icons were 
obvious. I guess the idea is that these pointers should be in an 
accessible format. (Now that I think of it, maybe the yellow icons were 
pictures of tags. Since I usually think of elements and attributes it 
never occurred to me before.)
