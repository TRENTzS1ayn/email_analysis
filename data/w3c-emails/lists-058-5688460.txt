CMcCN::
I agree that this is a real problem for people who are working on more 
than one WAI activity. Since I think there is a lot of value in having 
people in multiple groups, because it can speed the co-ordination process 
in some instances, and because some people's outside responsibilities 
cover more than one area anyway, it would be good if the chairs can 
co-ordinate with the other groups more. 

On the particular call I had to drop out of the PA discussion early to 
make this call.

I prefer to have stuff relatively close together. The UA telecon 
is on at 4am local Australian time, and the others are not a whole heap 
better (I am not a morning person) so I would prefer to cluster stuff 
together rather than spread it across the week. But if clustering means that 
other people cannot get there because of outside commitments then I would 
rather spread out and have everyone there.

CMcCN::
In the minutes this is presented as a suggestion in the discussion about 
placeholder ALT text. Perhaps it should be made clear (unless someone 
disagrees) that this only applies to placeholder text.

As I see it the use of transparent images for spacing is frowned upon, in 
favour of CSS positioning. (or living without absolute positioning. small 
screens, magnified screens, etc have hassles with it...). But as I recall 
the discussion, we resolved that an exception was relevant where there 
couldbe no ambiguity about the meaning of the image. Which is the case 
for spacer images, if you must use them.
