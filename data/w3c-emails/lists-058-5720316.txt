Not quite. The use of spacer images is primarily a kluge to support 
visual layout. In some cases these images are completely irrelevant to 
non-visual media, and should be ignored completely, by providing null ALT 
values (ALT=""). This also applies to some 'eye candy', or images used to 
fill in space, although one could provide ALT="dum de dum de dum" just to 
make it as annoying to non-visual users as to visual users waiting to 
download it.

All images should indeed have ALT text. However, a null value is not 
intrinsically unacceptable as ALT text.
