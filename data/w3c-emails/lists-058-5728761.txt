I was trying to create a method where screen readers could discern the
purpose of an image. if "these images are completely irrelevant to
non-visual media, and should be ignored completely" then the screen reader
should be confident that that is the case.

Some HTML editors set the Alt text to null (ALT="") and let the user fill it
in later. If a screen reader came across an image with null Alt text then
they would have to assume that the image was not a 'spacer' and would have
to say "image".

If the image had Alt text of spaces (ALT="  ") then the screen reader could
assume that the author intended the image to be a 'spacer' and could ignore
it or pause the speech output.

P.S. This reminds me of a Seinfeld episode. It's a discussion about nothing
