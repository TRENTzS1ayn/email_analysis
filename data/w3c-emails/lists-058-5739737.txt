<<
Some HTML editors set the Alt text to null (ALT="") and let the user fill it
in later. If a screen reader came across an image with null Alt text then
they would have to assume that the image was not a 'spacer' and would have
to say "image".

Ah - the root of the issue - a HTML authoring tool should never
automatically set ALT="", but should allow the user to do.
