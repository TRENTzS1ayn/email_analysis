I agree. But it still happens.

If a screen reader comes across an image that has ALT="", can we reccomend
that it informs the user an image is there? The screen reader would still
speak "image" or "image, no alt text".

If a screen reader comes across an image that has ALT ="  " (Alt text with
spaces), can we reccomend that it ignore the image or pause it's output?

Chris
