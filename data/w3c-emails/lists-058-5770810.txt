Hi Charles,

I very much agree with your rationale, but your Guideline 
doesn't work for me.

It seems as though there are two issues:

1) Separation of views. The author may want to author under
any of N views and the user may want to browse under any of M views.

2) The user interface of the authoring tool should obey the UA
Guidelines
 and allow the user (in this case, the author) to control styles.

If think 5.1 is meant to address point 1 specifically, as point 2
is covered (or should be covered) more generally elsewhere. Perhaps
we can strengthen the wording so that the Guideline reflects more
clearly your rationale.

 - Ian
