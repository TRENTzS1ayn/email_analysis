My addition:
Exactly, the addition to the norm that we are advocating is to allow the
author to have a view that is not necessarily reflective (however
imprecisely) of the final rendered view. The author may have requirements
that his/her reader doesn't have and my need to view the document in a
different format when editing it, than it is intended to be ultimately
displayed. We are not advocating a WYSIWYG view we are advocating the
flexibility to have a view that is completely unrelated to the WYSIWYG view.
