I'm glad that other companies are getting involved, but when you say
"pledges" and she says "interested", I'm skeptical, but optimistic.

What's her email address?

Hi all,

I'm here at the Builder.com Live conference where Beth Davis of Macromedia,
(Marketing Manager for Dreamweaver), said she was very interested in
following
the AU Tools Guidelines. They've released it....we need to follow-up with
them
and hold them to their promise for 2.1.
