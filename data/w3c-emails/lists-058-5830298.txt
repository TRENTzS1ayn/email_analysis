NB This is probably a CG issue really, but I am not on that group, and it
is relevant to all members of the working groups.

The context:
Scott Luebking wrote in the User Agent group saying that the issues he had
raised with frames were not in the Issues list. (As I recall there was no
real dissent, but I may be wrong.)

The question:
What qualifies things to go into the issues list?

A suggestion:
Issues are points raised which generate discussion and dissent. Where a
suggestion is incorporated immediately it is raised, or after explanation
of the rationale, techniques, etc, it is obvious from the guidelines
document that it has been covered, and the discussion can be sought in the
mailing list.

Where it is proposed to remove a guideline other than for reasons of
redundancy (eg because it is out of scope) and there has been discussion
and dissent then that is also an issue.

By dissent I mean opinions expressed to the contrary, rather than a formal
expression of dissatisfaction. By my definition somebody who dissents at
some point in the process has presumably changed their mind in the course
of consensus being achieved.
