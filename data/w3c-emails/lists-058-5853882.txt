I hope I don't sound too much like Charles Opperman here...

One of the things I am trying to do for the AU group is get manufacturers
directly involved - the guidelines will be a lot better if we have a bunch
of them telling us what can and can't be done and why than if we have one,
or none.

Dreamweaver was on a short list of people that it would be really good to
have. So if you have a contact for them, please approach them or pass it
on so I can approach them. (Otherwise I will simply approach them  through
the 'normal public channels (TM)'
