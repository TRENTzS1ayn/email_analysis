This sounds pretty good to me.

I would actually reword number 2 as follows:

Where the Authoring Tool provides the functions of a browser (or other
user agent), such as by offering a page preview mode or a WYSIWYG editing
mode, the tool should also follow? (comply with? conform to?) the
_link_W3C User Agent Guidelines_

  I have been  giving some thought to the reworking of the user interface
  section of the guidelines. I would like to add to the introduction as
  follows:
  
  Principles to consider in making the authoring tool accessible to authors
  with disabilities relate to 3 classes of functionality:
  1) The authoring tool is a software program with standard user interface
  elements and as such should follow relevant user interface accessibility
  guidelines (links to TRACE guidelines, Microsoft, SUN, DACX,  Apple, IBM
  guidelines)
  2) The authoring tool frequently encompasses the functionality of a user
  agent or browser and as such should follow the user agent guidelines.
  3) The authoring tool has unique functionality as a Web content editor.
  Access to this unique functionality will be addressed in these guidelines.
  
  Reactions?
