Given that our old charter ran out and also given that there is now a clear
structure for WAI guidelines, we have a new draft charter up at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter-19981216.html

Could people please review it and send comments to the list by the 21st.
Please note that "reply" will go only to me and not to the list unless you
specify the list.

Thanks Jutta
