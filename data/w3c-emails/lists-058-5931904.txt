I would really like to take the 

'example: ALT tag for images in HTML 4.0' out of the guideliens in nearly
all the places. There are some cases where it is simply irrelevant to the
point of the guideline, and its frequency makes it look as though it was
pasted everywhere to save the trouble of thinking about an appropriate
example. This reflects badly onthe rest of the guidelines document.

Thoughts?
