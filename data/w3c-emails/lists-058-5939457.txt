These should be links to appropriate anchors in the example section and
should be relevant. They seem to have become one anchor as opposed to
several different anchors somewhere in the editing process. The intention
of the example section is that all the appropriate guidelines would be
illustrated in the section. Possibly we should change the text of the links
to make it less redundant or have a statement at the beginning of the
guideline section that the various guidelines are illustrated in the alt
tag example.
