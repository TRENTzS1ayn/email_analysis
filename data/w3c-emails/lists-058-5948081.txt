I think definitely we should change the text of many of the links. Even if
ALT demonstrated all examples, I think it is important to have some
diversity. And where it is not relevant, or is one of the less relevant of
possible examples, I would rather (at this stage - early working draft)
leave it out - we will have to fix some later, but I think that the
absence of a default would make us think more carefully - analagously to
(ironically) not having default ALT text...

  These should be links to appropriate anchors in the example section and

  illustrated in the section. Possibly we should change the text of the links
  to make it less redundant or have a statement at the beginning of the
  guideline section that the various guidelines are illustrated in the alt
  tag example.
