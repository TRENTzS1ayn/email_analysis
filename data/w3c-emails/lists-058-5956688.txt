Below is my first listing of product managers/members of a product team for
Authoring Tool companies. More will be trickling in today and early next
week. My suggestion is that everyone on the list send an invitation to
these people asking them to join the WAI Authoring Tool Guideline effort.
This will show them that their clientel would like their products to have
accessibility features built in.
