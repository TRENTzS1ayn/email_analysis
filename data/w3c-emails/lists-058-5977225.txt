Hmmmm.

There is a fine line between approaching people as a genuine customer base
(eg I represent organisation XXX which uses your product, and we would
like it if you did YYY, where YYY might be make your tools conform to the
WAI AU guidelines, or take part in the WAI AU process, or whatever) and
reverse-spamming people - getting lots of people to send in the same
request. Given the size and make-up of the WAI AU group I feel that a
rather more selective approach than 'everyone write to everyone and
invite them to join' should be applied - unless I use WebPagesFast 7.9, or
am going to, then I don't have much clout as a clientele except by
misrepresenting myself, which I don't want to do.

For example, I don't imagine that Microsoft would have a very convincing
argument that they are a large customer base for Amaya (although I would
happily be proven wrong - I just made that example up). *smile* 

On the other hand, the more information we have about which authoring
tools are out there, and what they do and don't do well, the better
equipped we are. And if we have a number of manufacturers active on this
list then we are likely to have a more fruitful discussion than if we have
just one or two.

  Below is my first listing of product managers/members of a product team for
  Authoring Tool companies. More will be trickling in today and early next
  week. My suggestion is that everyone on the list send an invitation to
  these people asking them to join the WAI Authoring Tool Guideline effort.
  This will show them that their clientel would like their products to have
  accessibility features built in.
