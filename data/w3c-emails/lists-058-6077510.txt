Hi!

I just finished reading the WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines document...
and I was wondering if addition of the following would be useful:

1. Allow authors to "preview" the Web page as a screen reader or a
browser such as pwWebSpeak.
This is similar to the "preview" functionality provided by many HTML
editors. I believe the more authors know of how their pages will sound
(or work) with screen readers or pwWebSpeak, the easier it will be for
them to understand why certain accessibility/universal design features
are needed.

2. Allow authors to link multiple stylesheets based on the
identification of different user agents (browsers) and allow previews
with different style sheets
This will make it easier for authors to serve different presentation
layouts depending on whether the user is coming to the site using Lynx,
Emacspeak, pwWebSpeak, etc.

I apologize if these issues have been discussed before.

Pawan...
