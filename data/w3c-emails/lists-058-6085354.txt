  Hi!
  
  I just finished reading the WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines document...
  and I was wondering if addition of the following would be useful:
  
  1. Allow authors to "preview" the Web page as a screen reader or a
  browser such as pwWebSpeak.
  This is similar to the "preview" functionality provided by many HTML
  editors. I believe the more authors know of how their pages will sound
  (or work) with screen readers or pwWebSpeak, the easier it will be for
  them to understand why certain accessibility/universal design features
  are needed.

CMN::
This feature is currently listed as priority 1, under section 5.1 of the
guidelines. My own feeling is that while it is indeed a valuable feature,
it is not strictly necessary, and the priority should be downgraded.

The topic is flagged in the issues list -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/issues.html - and I would invite you to review
that in conjunction with section 5.1.

PV::
  
  2. Allow authors to link multiple stylesheets based on the
  identification of different user agents (browsers) and allow previews
  with different style sheets
  This will make it easier for authors to serve different presentation
  layouts depending on whether the user is coming to the site using Lynx,
  Emacspeak, pwWebSpeak, etc.
  
CMN::
This one is really interesting. I will address it seperately.

PV::
  I apologize if these issues have been discussed before.
  
CMN::
For a list of issues which have been raised and those which have reached
some kind of resolution, see the issues list at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/issues.html
It is a living document which is supposed to provide a reference of what
we have thought about and what we are concerned about, so feel free to
make reference to it or to what needs to be updated in it.
