I propose some changes to the ordering of the document, and some changes
to the current structure. The following is a suggested gathering of
guidelines, which are not yet rated by priority, although I think that
should also be done. I have noted most subsections with their position in
the old document - those not noted are unchanged.

* 1 Introduction
  + 1.1 Guideline Priorities
* 2 Ensure content generated is accessible
  + 2.1 Generate standard markup
  + 2.2 Support all accessible content recommendations
  + 2.3 Identify all inaccessible markup [was 2.5]
  + 2.4 Provide mechanisms for authors to add missing alternative
    representations for the content of converted documents [was 2.6]
  + 2.5 Provide comprehensive accessibility help to authors [was 3.1]
  + 2.6 Package multimedia files with pre-written descriptions [was 3.3]
  + 2.7 Integrate accessibility solutions into relevant automated tools and 
    wizards [was 4.1]
  + 2.8 Allow the user to check for and correct accessibility problems 
    automatically [was 4.2]
  + 2.9 Ensure that all markup inserted by the authoring tool is accessible 
    [was 4.3]
  + 2.10 Ensure that conversion tools produce and retain accessible markup 
    and content [was 4.4]
  + 2.11 Offer text representations of site maps [was 5.3]
  + 2.12 Emphasize accessible authoring practices [was 2.4]
* 3 Provide an accessible User Interface
  + 3.1 Integrate accessibility solutions naturally [was 2.8]
  + 3.2 Ensure that users may configure accessibility mechanisms [was 2.3]
  + 3.3 Where relevant implement guidelines for accessible interfaces 
    [new, covers section 5.1. See
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1998OctDec/0094.html]
  + 3.3 Offer text representations of elements [was 5.2]
* 4 Sample Implementations [was section 7]
  + 4.1 Alt-Text for the HTML 4.0 IMG Element
  + 4.2 Tool: "Alt"-text registry
* 5 Promote Accessibility
  + 5.1 Provide rationales that stress Universal Design [was 3.2]
  + 5.2 Promote accessibility in all Help examples [was 3.4]
  + 5.3 Provide the author with progress feedback [was 3.5]
* 6 Terms and definitions
  (includes all terms from section 8, and 6.1, 6.2 - definitions of
prompts and alerts
* 7 Acknowledgements
* 8 References

I have left out sections 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 which are essentially
rationales, and should be integrated with the appropriate guidelines or
techniques. I have left out 2.7, since it is covered by the declaration of
the scope.
