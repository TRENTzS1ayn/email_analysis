We should continue revisiting the definition of "authoring tool" because
it is increasingly that most new software (Excel, Word, etc.) is
designed with Web publication as an option.

Although most simple text editors can be used to prepare Web pages we
have chosen only to include those that somehow "generate" markup without
depending on an author to specifically put in "<"s and "/"s or even
elements/attributes.  Anyway the current Introduction may not be general
(vague?) enough where it specifies "authoring tools, generation tools
and conversion tools" since it isn't intuitively obvious that a spread
sheet or word processor might qualify as one of those.

2.3.5 should be "an" object.

2.7.2 is still weird.  Perhaps what is meant is "any discussion *within*
the help system"?

3.4.1 should be in active voice "Make the properties of all elements of
a document accessible to the author."

3.4.2 "the site map" doesn't have much significance in a word processor,
etc. but "structure diagram" or some such probably does.
