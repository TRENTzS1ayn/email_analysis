WIlliam's comments marked WL: and my responses CMN:

On Thu, 1 Apr 1999, William Loughborough wrote:

  We should continue revisiting the definition of "authoring tool" because
  it is increasingly that most new software (Excel, Word, etc.) is
  designed with Web publication as an option.
  
  Although most simple text editors can be used to prepare Web pages we
  have chosen only to include those that somehow "generate" markup without
  depending on an author to specifically put in "<"s and "/"s or even
  elements/attributes.  Anyway the current Introduction may not be general
  (vague?) enough where it specifies "authoring tools, generation tools
  and conversion tools" since it isn't intuitively obvious that a spread
  sheet or word processor might qualify as one of those.
  
  2.3.5 should be "an" object.
  
  2.7.2 is still weird.  Perhaps what is meant is "any discussion *within*
  the help system"?
  
CMN:
agree with all of the above
WL:
  3.4.1 should be in active voice "Make the properties of all elements of
  a document accessible to the author."
  
  3.4.2 "the site map" doesn't have much significance in a word processor,
  etc. but "structure diagram" or some such probably does.
CMN:
There are two issues here. A site map and a document outline are
structures which the user should be able to navigate - that is guideline
3.3 It is also necessary to have textual information available for a
graphic representation of an object such as a site map, an element, etc.
That is sectionm3.4, but it occurs to me that it could in fact fit well
into guideline 3.2, so I propose that we merge 3.4 into 3.2.
