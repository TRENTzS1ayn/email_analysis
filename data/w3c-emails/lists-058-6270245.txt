I propose that we add a section to the guidelines outlining resources
that are available to help developers comply with the content production
guideline checkpoints. The featured resource would probably be the
ATRC/Trace A-Prompt toolkit. This toolkit is a software module that
provides HTML accessibility checking functionality that complies with
the W3C GL guidlines. The functionality (checkers, correcting wizards,
alt-text registry) include optional pre-built interfaces to speed
integration by small developers. However, large developers may simply
call the underlying functionality within their own top level interface
or use the toolkit for ideas only. The toolkit will be freely available
soon (before the AU guidelines are completed). Techniques for the
accessible interface guideline checkpoints should also be decribed in a
parallel section.
