We have the 'sample implementations' section, which I think matches what
you are proposing. I think that we should continue to emphasise that the
status of the material there is Techniques. It would make sense to put a
description of the tool/suite in that appendix, and to refer to that
description as a technique in each instance where it applies.

Is there a URI for the a-prompt?

  I propose that we add a section to the guidelines outlining resources
  that are available to help developers comply with the content production
  guideline checkpoints. The featured resource would probably be the
  ATRC/Trace A-Prompt toolkit. This toolkit is a software module that
  provides HTML accessibility checking functionality that complies with
  the W3C GL guidlines. The functionality (checkers, correcting wizards,
  alt-text registry) include optional pre-built interfaces to speed
  integration by small developers. However, large developers may simply
  call the underlying functionality within their own top level interface
  or use the toolkit for ideas only. The toolkit will be freely available
  soon (before the AU guidelines are completed). Techniques for the
  accessible interface guideline checkpoints should also be decribed in a
  parallel section.
