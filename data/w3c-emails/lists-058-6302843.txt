To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


In the next version, the techniques will be listed by checkpoint where
appropriate, although there may be some techniques which are relevant to a
whole guideline, and which will be listed as they are now.


so the markup will be something like:

<P>Checkpoints
<DL>
<DT>2.1.1 Priority 99
<DD>Do stuff right
    <P>Techniques for 2.1.1
    <UL>
    <LI>Don't do bad things
    <LI>Ask your Mum
    </UL>
</DD>
<DT>2.1.2 Priority 02
<DD>Eat your vegetables
</DL>

<P>Techniques for Guideline 2
<UL>
<LI>Do what teachers tell you
</UL>


Suggestions about which techniques belong to which checkpoint would be
greatly appreciated, just to ensure that there is no doubt.

Cheers

Charles
