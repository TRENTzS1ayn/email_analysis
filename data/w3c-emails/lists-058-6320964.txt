From http://www.microsoft.com/magazine/apr1999/wordweb/wordweb.htm

Microsoft? Word 97 offers you three methods for turning your documents
into professional-looking Web pages:

 1.Convert a pre-existing Word document to HTML using the Save as
HTML    from the File menu. 
 2.Save multiple Word documents to HTML using the Word Conversion     
Wizard. 
 3.Use the Web Page Wizard or start with a Blank Web Page.

Some formatting and other elements of Word documents ? such as animation
and character formats ? are not supported by HTML when you convert your
document to a Web page using the first two methods. Utilizing the third
strategy and some of the Word Web page authoring tools, you can quickly
prepare eye-catching documents to post into cyberspace without the
possibility of formatting loss.
