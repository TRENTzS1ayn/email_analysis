It seems that things are booking up quickly for the May 14 weekend. I have
some lower budget suggestions that are close to the University.

The following offer rooms with private bath and breakfast for under $100
Canadian (all with 416 area code):
- Casa Loma Inn 924-4540
- Annex Guest House 922-1934
- Palmerston Inn 920-7842
- Comfort Hotel 924-1222

The following are in the moderate range:
- Bay Bloor Executive Suites 968-3878
- Holiday Inn on King 599-4000
- Venture Inn Toronto Yorkville 964-1220

Descriptions for all these and more can be found at: http://toronto.com
Look for Toronto downtown hotels. The TTC and cabs can get you places
fairly fast. Toronto is a very safe city, the seedier area is east of Yonge
St. between Gerrard and Wellesley but you wouldn't recognize it as such if
you happened to end up there.

If anyone has problems finding a place to stay, please contact me and we
can help you out.
