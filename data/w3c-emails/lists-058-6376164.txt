I would like to do them weekly, so we can cover things a bit faster, and
get a better turnaround time on IG reviews etc.

I think Wednesday is probably better than Monday, since there are a number
of holidays that happen on Mondays and it is a good day to keep free
anyway (so we can all take long weekends, go to the beach, and think about
Authoring Tools - grin)

So I would suggest 3.30pm to 4.30pm, or 4pm to 5pm (Boston times) on
Wednesdays. (I also know that Ian has freed up that time, and it would be
good if he could make the calls.)
