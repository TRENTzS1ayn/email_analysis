I like it. I think some examples should be added to the techniques, but it
is a little late in Boston and I have an early start, so I might work on
them tomorrow.

  I've tossed around a variety of wordings and considered whether some
  of these should be checkpoints or techniques.
  
  The main guideline is:
  
  "Integrate accesibility solutions into the overall "look and feel""
  
  Existing checkpoint is:
  
  2.4.2 [Priority 2]
  Integrate accessibility features into the overall "look and feel"
  of the authoring tool.
  
  Should this one go entirely, as it is just the same as the main
  guideline?  Or should one or the other be rewritten?
  
  Proposed checkpoints:
  
  2.4.X [Priority 2]
        Highlight the most accessible solutions when presenting
        choices for the author.
  
        TECHNIQUE:
  
        If there is more than one option for the author, and one
        option is more accessible than another, place the more
        accessible option first and make it the default.
  
  2.4.X [Priority 1]
        Ensure that accessibility features can be easily accessed
        by the author in a natural, intuitive fashion.
  
        TECHNIQUES:
  
        Include considerations for accessibility -- such as the
        ALT and LONGDESC attributes of the IMG element -- right below
        the SRC attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an
        "Advanced..." button.
  
        Allow efficient and fast access to accessibility-related
        settings with as few steps as possible needed to make any
        changes that will generate accessible content.
  
  2.4.X [Priority 1]
        Make generation of accessible content a naturally integrated
        part of the authoring process.
  
        TECHNIQUES:
  
        Do not set accessibility features off to the side as some
        optional "module"; rather, make them a part of the core
        operation of the authoring tool.
  
        The "factory settings" default configuration for the authoring
        tool should favor accessible solutions out of the box, for the
        benefit of newer users.
  
  Thoughts?
