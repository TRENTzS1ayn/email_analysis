On reflection, I think the last two are the same checkpoint expressed in
different words. I like all the techniques Kynn has given, and think I
like the wording of the third checkpoint better than the wording of the
second - the wording of the second could be a technique for the third. 

Anyway, I have added some more technique suggestions - look for CMN: and

    2.4.X [Priority 2]
          Highlight the most accessible solutions when presenting
          choices for the author.
    
          TECHNIQUE:
    
          If there is more than one option for the author, and one
          option is more accessible than another, place the more
          accessible option first and make it the default.

CMN:
For example, 

When requesting alternative content for an image, offer an unchecked
option for empty alternative (ie ALT="" - the image has no real function)
with the cursor positioned in the text entry for an ALT value, rather than
offering the filename as a default suggestion, with the null ALT value
selected.

    2.4.X [Priority 1]
          Ensure that accessibility features can be easily accessed
          by the author in a natural, intuitive fashion.
    
          TECHNIQUES:
    
          Include considerations for accessibility -- such as the
          ALT and LONGDESC attributes of the IMG element -- right below
          the SRC attribute in a dialogue box, not buried behind an
          "Advanced..." button.
    
          Allow efficient and fast access to accessibility-related
          settings with as few steps as possible needed to make any
          changes that will generate accessible content.
    
    2.4.X [Priority 1]
          Make generation of accessible content a naturally integrated
          part of the authoring process.
    
          TECHNIQUES:
    
          Do not set accessibility features off to the side as some
          optional "module"; rather, make them a part of the core
          operation of the authoring tool.
    
          The "factory settings" default configuration for the authoring
          tool should favor accessible solutions out of the box, for the
          benefit of newer users.

CMN:
Examples:

A help page which describes how to make an imagemap should include adding
alternative content for each AREA in the MAP as part of the process. Any
examples of code should give either block content with text links, or
AREAs which all have relevant ALT attribute values.

When a user creates a frameset, suggest the main content page and a
navigation bar as the content for NOFRAMES.
