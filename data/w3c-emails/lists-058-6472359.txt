A friend writes "I think alt=" " would be effective in forcing the
webauthor to do SOMETHING but I also think we should be hounding browser
vendors to break any page on which NOTHING was done with it".

This was in response to my proposal that the default in an authoring 
tool be alt=" " *provided that this will force modification* to either
enter non-white-space text or, in the case of "trivial" graphics, a null
("").
