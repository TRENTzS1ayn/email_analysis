It is easy to visually ignore [IMAGE]. It is impossible to ignore it when
you are listening to the page.

As a user of lynx and an Opera user who has 'image loading off'
by default, I'd almost rather see [IMAGE] displayed than see " "
(whitespace), in the case of a broken web page.  (Broken meaning
something that doesn't have correct ALT text.  Naturally, I far
prefer correct ALT text to anything else.)

Why?  Because then at least I know there's something there!  In
the above scenario, the designer would be just as negligent BUT
I'd have no clue that they'd done that, since it might not even
show me any indication of an image at all.

I'm not saying that lack of ALT is acceptable, I'm just showing
why a _default_ of ALT=" " is just as bad.
