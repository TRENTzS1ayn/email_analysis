It is an error to leave out an alt attribute on various elements.

It is, from an accesibility point of view, an error not to put in a value
which is relevant. So unless a relevant value is assumed to have been
provided, the tool should not that there is an outstanding error. The
easiest way to do this is by making a validity error. I don't see that
this is a problem from an accessiblity point of view. In terms of actual
validation, the specification of HTML says some stuff about what should be
in there. The fact that it is not machine-checkable whether it is
appropriate doesn't make it correct to have "some unknown image" as the
value for each image on a website. It is just that machine validation
can't tell, whereas it can tell if there is nothing there.

  This was in response to my proposal that the default in an authoring

  enter non-white-space text or, in the case of "trivial" graphics, a null
