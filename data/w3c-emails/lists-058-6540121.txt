Oh, maybe so. seems these days I get lots of [something_unhelpful.gif] but
not much [IMAGE]

Maybe some of the message is getting through. Or maybe I did figure out
how to tell it not to show [IMAGE]

  Then this is a browser issue -- you should be using a browser that
  allows you to specify "don't display images" instead of generating
  its own text that reads [IMAGE].  Remember, Lynx creates [IMAGE],
  it's not anything defined in the HTML standard or on the HTML page
  itself!
