Actually, HPR is adding a switch to speak image if the user wants when
there is no alt=text or title. That is the right way. But a default alt=" "
would be a terrible mistake. That, or alt="" should only be used when the
author clearly understands why it should be used!!

Then this is a browser issue -- you should be using a browser that
allows you to specify "don't display images" instead of generating
its own text that reads [IMAGE].  Remember, Lynx creates [IMAGE],
it's not anything defined in the HTML standard or on the HTML page
itself!
