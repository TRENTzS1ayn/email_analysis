When I said the "default" was alt=" " the understanding was that the
tool *could not* allow that to stay (go unpunished?).  It would force an
alert so that the author would have to do something and the choices
would not include leaving it alone.  She could either make it alt="" if
it were just another bullet or HR and enter proper text elsewise.
