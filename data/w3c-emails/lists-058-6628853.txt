Aah. The problem is that alt="" or alt=" " is valid html (or xhtml for
that matter) and is a perfectly sensible thing to have in some cases. (If
you want to describe the pretty curly roses and ivy motif you use for a
list bullet, you should do it in a longdesc.)

So it won't get picked up automatically - having no alt there at all will
get picked up, because it is a validity error anyway.

Which is why I prefer it as a solution.
