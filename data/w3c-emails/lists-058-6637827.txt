We still need priorities on 2.7.3 and 2.7.4, and all of section 3

My personal proposals are as follows:

collapse 2.7.1 and 2.7.2, as per Bruce's proposal earlier today

2.7.3 P1

2.7.4 P3

3.1.1 P1

3.1.2 P1

3.2.1 P1

3.2.2 P1

3.3.1 P2

3.3.2 P2
Editing structure needs more explanation. proposed: "Allow the author to
move or transform sections of the document structure"

Techniques
Allow selection, cutting and pasting of sections of the document which
retain markup when when pasted.

Allow the document tree to be manipulated, so that nodes can be moved as a
group. (This particularly applies to site management tools, where each
node represents a page or collection of pages rather than a single text
element) 

3.4.1 P1
I propose that this checkpoint be moved into section 3.2

3.4.2 Technique
I think this is really a technique for scheckpoint 3.2.2
