I disagree. Some of the ideas here should remain checkpoints. I would
rephrase as follows:

2.7.1: [Priority 1] 
Include direction for the use of all accessible authoring practices
supported by the authoring tool. (JR comment: "direction" may be a good
catch-all for the many different types of help+doc that will be listed
in the techniques)
2.7.2: [Priority 2] (JR comment: my suggested Priority) 
Help topics should feature all applicable accessible authoring
practices, regardless of the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Priority.
(JR comment: this is promotion with a big P! For example alt-text
doesn't need to be promoted because it is required, LONGDESC does need
to be promoted) 
2.7.3: [Priority 1] 
Examples must conform to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
(JR comment: text from section 2)
