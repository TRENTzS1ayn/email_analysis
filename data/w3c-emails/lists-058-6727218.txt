So the current consensus (which so far consists of me, William and Jan) 
appears to cover:

  2.7.3 P1
  2.7.4 P3
  3.1.1 P1
  3.1.2 P1
  3.2.1 P1
  3.2.2 P1

The following are still under discussion:

Jan has suggested that the following may be P1:
  3.3.1 P2
  3.3.2 P2
(They are the structured navigation checkpoints). I recall Gregory saying
that these could be P2, but I may be thinking about something else - I
couldn't find it in the minutes anywhere. I personally think they are P2,
which is a reflection of how strictly we should apply the criteria.

Section 3.4 as a whole seems to be under discussion at the moment.

We will not get a draft produced until Monday afternoon, so if we can get
enough feedback, especially on those where there currently appears to be
consensus, we could incorporate them into that draft.
