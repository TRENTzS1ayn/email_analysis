If you are on a really restricted budget for WWW8 and would be willing to
stay in a university residence, the UofT campus is in the heart of downtown
and is quite beautiful (you'll have seen it in most popular movies that are
supposed to have been shot at Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, Yale or other ivy
league Universities). The URL for summer residences is:

The old colleges are: Victoria, St. Michaels, Trinity, Knox, University
College and Wycliffe. The prices are from 110 to 150 a week Canadian, yes I
said a week.  Frequently this includes breakfast.
