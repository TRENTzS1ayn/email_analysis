You are right about 3.1 covering the issue of other suite tools
generally, but I don't think 3.2 covers it because that guideline is
more focussed towards flexibility of content presentation. A authoring
tool site map is not really content in the way we have defined it.

I think the intro to 3 should mention that these guidelines apply to all
tools in the suite, then 3.4.2 should be placed as a technique in 3.1.

General musing: the difference between (1) an authoring tool site map,
(2) a site map placed as content in a document and (3) site displays by
browser-OS hybrids could get very fuzzy depending on implementation
details. Should we explicitly mention that all methods for navigating to
and accessing documents for editing must be accessible?
