Hello, 

Here are some comments on the 13 April Draft [1]:

1) From 1.2:
  "To <dfn>conform to (or comply to) the
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</dfn> or the <dfn>User Agent
  Accessibility Guidelines</dfn>, as used in this document, means that
  the priority for implementing each checkpoint has the same level as it
  does in the relevant Accessibility Guidelines."

  I'm not sure what you mean by "conform to...as used in this document".
  How can you redefine conformance to one of those specs? This needs
  to be made clearer.

2) To line up with the WCGL, use the term "equivalent content"
   instead of "alternative content". While Eric Hansen does 
   not like "equivalent alternative" since "alternative" is built-in
   to the definition of "equivalent" for him, I see no problem
   in saying "equivalent alternative" (nor does Gregg).

3) I don't understand the English of 2.3.4

4) Technique 6 of 2.4.2: One can use "A" elements instead of "AREA"
   inside a MAP element in HTML 4.0.

5) Technique 1 of 2.6.2 is not clear to me. I think it means
   that alert levels should mirror WCGL priority levels, but I'm not
   sure.

6) I'd remove "to avoid frustration from Techniques 2 of 2.6.2.
   Also, maybe change "set the warning" to "set the alert level'.

7) Techniques 4 of 2.6.2 sounds like a checkpoint to me (it's
   different than 2.6.2 itself, but sounds similar).

8) I don't agree with 2.7.4, technique 3 as worded. I think
   it's important to emphasize that something is deprecated and
   also to provide examples of how to do it right. I don't
   agree with "rather than".

9) In checkpoint 3.4.1, what does "property of an element" mean?

10) In checkpoint 3.4.2, what does "structured tree file" mean?
