I agree with Bruce's wording and feel that Jutta's concern that we be
sure that it is implicitly understood that these things are themselves
accessible.  I don't think this should be in the checkpoint (call me Mr.
Terse) but I'm sure it's fairly clear elsewhere that *everything* about
the tools must be accessible.
