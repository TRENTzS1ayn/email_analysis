I would actually suggest that we leave off the + sign, as having re: added
to the subject line makes it clear enough already. It seems a bit of extra
work that is not realy necessary. On the other hand, replying to a
message, or keeping the subject line, are the two ways to ensure that it
is threaded properly in the archives, which can be very helpful.

  It was brought up at the last teleconference that it is very disconcerting
  to put a proposal to the list and get no response or only one response.
  When the responses are so sparse its not clear whether:
  - people disagree but don't want to stick their neck out
  - agree and think it is implied by their silence
  - think the proposal is too trite to respond to
  - haven't read the proposal
  - are too confused to respond
  - any other scenario, the imagination can go wild when there is a void and
  you get yourself into the right mindset.
  
  I propose that we try making this list a chattier, more friendly medium.
  When a proposal is tabled and you read it, please respond even if it only
  to echo what someone else has said or to say "sounds good but I need to
  think further on this" or to say "I absolutely hate it but I'm not sure
  why."
  
  So we can sift the responses from the added material, if you are responding
  and adding to the proposal please add a plus sign to the end of your
  subject head. This would look like this:
  
  Proposal subject head: Undeniably necessary addition
  Simple response without added stuff: Re: Undeniably necessary addition
  Response with counter proposal or added material: Re: Undeniably necessary
  addition +
  
  I propose we experiment with this for a few weeks and then decide whether
  it is helpful or cumbersome during the April 28 conference call.
  
  And people better respond to this proposal!
