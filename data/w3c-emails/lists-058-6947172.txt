There's some rage about PDF and I thought we might be interested in some
of the background so I'm posting this.

Hi Bill,

I appreciate your post.  I was just about to ask if anyone had ever talked
to T. V. Raman to see how he functioned at Adobe.

I've never seen a translated file until Kelly sent the sample.  It is
totally useless to us blind users, so far as I can determine.

I remember when I talked personally with Harley Hahn, he said that the
Internet began with PDF files only.  Fully sighted people soon began to
complain because they didn't want to look at that type of print on their
computers all day.  Then, web designers began to be more innovative.  Sad
that we now see the trend back to PDF presentation.

Pat
