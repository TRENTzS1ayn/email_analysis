I'm also busy doing other things nowadays and not spending enough time
with AU.

If the overall problem is: lack of participation, I'm not sure what
you're proposing is the right answer. I also agree with Charles that
breaking the threading by modifying the Subject line is not good.
 
What would help people like me, who are interested but sometimes get
out of synch with the WG (after a trip, or a busy period doing
something else), would be to get a good summary situation, probably
best would be off the WG Home page, as an addition to the issue list
page for instance, giving the overall status, prioritized issues to be
resolved, workplan, timeline, etc.

This could also be sent to the list every 2 weeks.

If the learning curve to get back in synch is fast, the better will be
the participation IMHO.
