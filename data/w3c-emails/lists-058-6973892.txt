Section 2.5 Proposal

2.5.1 Never remove markup that is recommended for accessibility.

Techniques:
(1) Do not change the DTD without notification. 
(2) Non-critical changes such as attribute ordering may be made without
notification.

2.5.2 Tools should be capable of updating their validation DTD's.

Techniques: when unrecognized markup is found, the author might be
prompted for the Web location of the generating DTD.

2.5.3 Unrecognized elements and attributes should be preserved until
removed by the author

Techniques: 
(1) Unrecognized elements and attributes should not be automatically
removed by conversion or housekeeping processses.
(2) The author may be provided with the option of removing all instances
of a particular piece of markup (element or attribute) as long as it is
made clear that this markup is "unrecognized", not "purposeless" and it
may have an accessibility function.
