If the "DTD registry" idea is given adequate notoriety by and within W3C
I think these ideas validate.  The notion that there might become a
centralized location which browsers could check to see what syntax
needed observance, etc. is very powerful IMHO - emphasis on the "H"
because I wouldn't have a clue how to go about ensuring that any
"approved" DTD furthered accessibility - but it smells right.
