I think the w3c approach is moving to the use of namespaces in XML, which
will allow the combination of the bits you need for a given document, with
the mechanics available on the web. This is getting a push by W3C in a lot
of what it is doing.

Ensuring accessibility in XML namespaces is a whole different can of
worms. The reason behind using applicable W3C specifications is that these
have already been filtered through WAI, and in theory are as accessible as
they can be. Beyond that it is outside the scope of the working group,
although where possible our techniques material should include references
to work being done.
