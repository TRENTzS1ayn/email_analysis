JW:: "Perhaps a requirement that the name of the element which is
currently under the editing cursor always be visible in the default view
presented by the authoring tool, would help."

WL: This may not come under the heading of "commercial suicide" but it
sort of flies in the face of the notion that we are dealing with an
HTML-illiterate author who really doesn't want to be bothered by the
ugly skeleton under her beautiful wysiwyg.  I guess if it's a selectable
option there would be no objection.  The problem is that any such
visibility would spoil the view.

JW:: "I am sure that you are aware of, and can develop, better solutions
to this problem.

WL: That's very flattering, however we were counting on you to do that
<grin>.

I believe the importance of content/presentation separation cannot be
overemphasized and hope that we find some balance in the brow-beating
department.  We must proceed as if CSS implementation in browsers will
be better in place when the tools we are trying to affect finally reach
the market.  We've got to start somewhere and without CSS the game is
probably lost because of the things Jason points out ("the indent
element", using structure elements for formatting, and the overall table
absurdity).
