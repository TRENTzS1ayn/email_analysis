Probably the best guide to what needs attention now is to check meeting
agendas, which are linked from the home page.

Should I post these direct to the group as well?

I definitely agree that the best way to get participation includes
enabling people to get the required information fast, and the idea is to
have that on the home page.

  If the overall problem is: lack of participation, I'm not sure what
  you're proposing is the right answer. I also agree with Charles that
  breaking the threading by modifying the Subject line is not good.
   
  What would help people like me, who are interested but sometimes get
  out of synch with the WG (after a trip, or a busy period doing
  something else), would be to get a good summary situation, probably
  best would be off the WG Home page, as an addition to the issue list
  page for instance, giving the overall status, prioritized issues to be
  resolved, workplan, timeline, etc.
  
  This could also be sent to the list every 2 weeks.
  
  If the learning curve to get back in synch is fast, the better will be
  the participation IMHO.
