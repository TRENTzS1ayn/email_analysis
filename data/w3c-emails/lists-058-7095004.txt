To: Charles McCathieNevile<charles@w3.org>, WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

In an attempt to get a handle on 2.5 I tried to restate the problem again.
It basically boils down to wanting to:
Prevent the removal of structure and content that adds accessibility but
may be part of older or newer markup that is not supported by the tool,
without preventing the tool from cleaning up the markup (which often helps
with access).

The dilemma is if the tool does not recognize the targeted elements how can
it distinguish between elements that help access and elements that hinder
access. Given the range of authors, it is highly unlikely that the average
author can handle the decision making. If mechanisms and conditions exist
that allow the tool to update and seek out information about the unknown
markup over the web, thats great but we cannot depend upon that.

Perhaps we need to become more specific without dating the guideline. Can
we establish in W3 some registry of elements that are necessary for access
in both older and newer markup languages and reference this in this
guideline?
