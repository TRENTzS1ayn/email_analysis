To: Authoring Tools WG<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


My proposal for the re-organization and re-prioritization of this
Guideline is as follows: 

1. take existing Checkpoint 2.7.2, renumber it Checkpoint 2.7.1, and make P1
2. take existing Checkpoint 2.7.3, renumber it Checkpoint 2.7.2, and keep P1
3. take existing Checkpoint 2.7.1, renumber it Checkpoint 2.7.3, and make P2
4. retain Checkpoint 2.7.4 as is

Why?  Simply because the current 2.7.2 is the crux of the entire effort... 
If we are going to integrate accessibility features and practices into the
overall look-and-feel of the tool, then we cannot, as GL 2.7 currently
does, encourage authoring tool developers and manufacturers to simply
provide documentation on the quote accessible authoring practices
supported by the authoring tool unquote in one discrete location and hope
that a) users of the tool read the help topic on accessibility, and b)
that the developers will also quote integrate accessible authoring
practices in all applicable help topics unquote.  What is needed is a
clear statement that whenever an authoring practice/method is discussed,
any and all applicable accessible authoring practices pertaining to that
authoring practice/method _MUST_ also be discussed.  Hence the P1
associated with my re-numbered 2.7.1 (the current 2.7.2)  Anything less
would be tantamount to sweeping accessibility features/practices under the
rug, which runs counter to the AU WG's mission.  If the goal is to
incorporate accessible authoring practices/methods into the tool (as well
as to make accessible authoring second nature to the user of the tool),
then the current 2.7.2 is unequivocably a P1, and should be made the most
visible checkpoint in GL 2.7 by re-numbering it as 2.7.1 and according it
a P1.
