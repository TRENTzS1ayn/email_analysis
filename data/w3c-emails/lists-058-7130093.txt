I think the checkpoints will be shuffled around again sometime
in the future based on priority, as it is.  I agree with your
assessment of (existing) 2.7.2 as "vitally important" but it does
not rise to the level of a priority one as defined by the current
priority listing, in my opinion.

This is an example of why I think we need to re-write our priority
definitions so that we can give P1 to our biggest and best stuff,
which we currently can't do.

What do you think of my proposal for new priority defs?
