Yes, except what I can tell from developers is that you won't
necessarily get what you want here.  If you want people to do
a certain level of compliance you have to DEMAND it instead of
giving them a lower priority -- they WILL do the P1 stuff before
the P2 stuff and there's a good chance they won't do P2.

Are we defining minimum acceptability or are we saying what we want?
I _want_ lots of things that are P2, so perhaps we need a definition
to make them P1's too -- if we won't be happy with simply P1 performance.
