Disagreed.  The two parts of the guidelines do completely different
things -- one measures how well the tool functions to create 
accessible content, and the other measures whether or not people
with disabilities can use the tool.

This means that any one set of definitions is going to be compound
ANYWAY.  I suggest that clarity is enhanced by setting a general set
of 'what priorities mean' at the start, and then 'how they apply to
this section' per section.  Otherwise we run into headaches!
