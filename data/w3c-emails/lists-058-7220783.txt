This is the reason why I want to frame the definitions to make it clear that
there are significant barriers still in place unless P2s are done.

Among the things I think are important which we have not yet discussed is
getting double-A conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. But
I am not sure if we can really make that a P1.

  Are we defining minimum acceptability or are we saying what we want?
  I _want_ lots of things that are P2, so perhaps we need a definition
  to make them P1's too -- if we won't be happy with simply P1 performance.
