No, that says they _can learn_.  That isn't the same as solving the
clueless author problem.

I want a WYSIWYG program that produces accessible output with no
learning curve.  No explanations of accessibility.  I want my mom
to be able to generate an accessible web page without even knowing
that blind users exist.  That's what the tool should be doing, and
if we can solve that problem, we've solved the biggest one, IMNSHO.

Documenting accessibility practices doesn't solve that problem.  It's
not a checkpoint under one guideline, it's the goal of the whole
document -- or it should be, at least.

Uh, no, that doesn't do that either.

Remember, the clueless user should be allowed to REMAIN clueless
and STILL produce a usable, accessible web page.  The authoring tool
does NOT have to teach them accessibility as long as the authoring
tool creates accessible web pages anyway!
