Sorry, I was a bit opaque there.

What I meant was that my grandmother's abilit to produce accessible pages is
addressed in other guidelines. 2.7 really only deals with her when she wants
to learn something.

If a clueless author wants to remain clueless they will avoid all manner of
help, and guideline 2.7 will not influence their lives at all.

And I absolutely agree that we will not solve the problem until accessibility
is recognised as being an ordinary technical problem to be solved, like
getting images to display or getting a browser to parse legitimate code. So
long as it is an optional extra, people may not take the option.

  No, that says they _can learn_.  That isn't the same as solving the
  clueless author problem.
  
  I want a WYSIWYG program that produces accessible output with no
  learning curve.  No explanations of accessibility.  I want my mom
  to be able to generate an accessible web page without even knowing
  that blind users exist.  That's what the tool should be doing, and
  if we can solve that problem, we've solved the biggest one, IMNSHO.
  
  Documenting accessibility practices doesn't solve that problem.  It's
  not a checkpoint under one guideline, it's the goal of the whole
  document -- or it should be, at least.

  Uh, no, that doesn't do that either.
  
  Remember, the clueless user should be allowed to REMAIN clueless
  and STILL produce a usable, accessible web page.  The authoring tool
  does NOT have to teach them accessibility as long as the authoring
  tool creates accessible web pages anyway!
