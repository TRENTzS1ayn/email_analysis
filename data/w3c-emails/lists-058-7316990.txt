WC:: "...place-holding elements that are not defined anywhere fit into
the picture?"

WL: Although this is an important point it is difficult to imagine it
being addressed in an authoring tool, it's sort of like the illegitimate
ALT="text" problem in that the tool that could recognize that "insert
description here" is different from "picture of my dog, Shea" would make
us all obsolete.  Trying to force the templates to spot unmodified
place-holders is a nice idea but...  E.g., in HotDog when you try to
save a templated file without replacing "enter title here" you get a
gentle nudge (after all the title of your web site could be "enter title
here"!) but of course not all template makers are going to furnish such
facilities.
