The statement we have currently aboutconforming to other documents doesn't
match the requirements for conformance to WCAG. I propose we use the
following text instead.


Conformance to other documents

These guidelines require conformance to the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines and the User Agent Accessiblity Guidelines. The priority for such
conformance is analagous to that required in those guidelines, as follows:

 * It is a Priority 1 requirement to be level-A conformant or to meet all the
Priority 1 requirements in the relevant document

 * It is a Priority 2 requirement to be double-A conformant or to meet all
the Priority 2 requirements in the relevant document)

 * It is a Priority 3 requirement to be triple-A conformant or to meet all
the Priority 3 requirements in the relevant document
