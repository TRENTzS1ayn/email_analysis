Errm, not quite. The draft sent to IG is likely to be the last draft they see
before Last Call, assuming we produce a draft we are happy to send to Last
Call by May 24 - our target date. (And I would very much like to do so -
having a recommendation should not wait for ever, and all it takes is a lot
of hard work to make the deadline...)

The current timeline is to produce a Public Working Draft on Wednesday, by
revising the conformance statement (see editors note in new draft, and my
previous email) and dealing with any issues raised by the interest group.

The next Public Working Draft is anticipated to be the Last Call draft, on
May 24 giving us a couple of phone meetings, the face to face, and then
another phone meeting to get it right.
