2.3.5 should be "an" object.

2.4.2 techniques include "...natural, intuitive fashion" which is a bit
vague to us old people.

In general the word "content" needs our attention, particularly since
there is something called "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" that
makes the practice of "separating content from structure and format" a
bit vague, even for young people.  In one case "content" means *meaning*
and in another it means meaning, structure, and format.

This may seem pedantic but might be a central cause for
misunderstanding, particularly since so many authors will feel that
format and structure properly used provide meaning.  It is well to speak
of "non-semantic" format but that may actually be rare.  Although
braille pays homage to formatting, it's pretty rudimentary so we have to
draw some lines indicating when it's appropriate/mandatory to describe
the intent of certain formatting procedures.

Sometimes it seems as if the uses made of styles need further
explanation but I don't think there's any attribute mechanism to point
out that drop caps are used structurally?

2.6 techniques mention setting warnings "quickly" and I would prefer
"easily" since the speed isn't obviously important.
