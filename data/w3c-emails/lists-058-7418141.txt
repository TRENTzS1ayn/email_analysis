Invalid documents are a basic problem in terms of how a browser should deal
with them. They are a particular problem for authoring tools, since if a
document is invalid (according to whatever its grammar is) a tool can not
have any good way of dealing with it - either it retains the invalid markup,
which as Bruce has pointed out in conference calls is extremely difficult in
practice (unless it is a failure of that tool, which could more easily be
rectified by the tool producing markup valid to a scheme specified by the
tool...) or it throws out everything which is not valid, which may result in
a loss of accessibility becuase the tool is not aware of some wonderful new
piece of markup. As an example, consider the RUBY element being developed by
i18n [1], and how a tool shold deal with taking one part of it to place it
somewhere else.

If the tool produces a document which can be validated to a published grammar
(P2 requirement from WCAG, and therefore inherited already as a P2) then it
can be dealt with. If it doesn't, then it has to make an arbitrary decision
about how to deal with a piece of markup it doesn't understand. The grammar
need not be a W3C specification, but it must be available for tools to check
against. See 2.5.1 in the current draft [2]
