CMcCN:: "it might be that we want to talk about the 'proper' as well as
the 'valid' use of markup"

WL: E.g. a picture of a table with ALT="table showing relationships
among items" might pass a validator?

The EO group is trying to "educate" a generation of authors to the
importance of providing access to their content and this seems daunting,
but necessary.  We are trying to make the tools authors use serve to
make it easier to "do right."  One aspect of this is to make it a high
priority that validation must be viewed in an informed way.  Perhaps we
must, in addition to making tools like Bobby work the best they can, try
to get the "official" validators to include some awareness of possible
"propriety" as well as "validity"??
