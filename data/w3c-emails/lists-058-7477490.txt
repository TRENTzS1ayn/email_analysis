In early CSS questions it often came up as to who had the last cascade
in the cascading styles, the author or the reader?  The idea that
finally won was that there would be a way for the users' style sheets to
prevail, which was in part for reasons of accessibility being considered
more central than the authors' pride of presentation.

The XFO thing is another opportunity for the author to force a certain
formatting to appear on a Web site.  This is why we must guard against
this end run around universal access.
