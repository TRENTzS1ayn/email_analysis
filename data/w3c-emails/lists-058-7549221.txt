Jutta's proposal for priority wording has my approval FWIW.  I might
leave out the "with disabilities" in the interest of the notion of
universal design.

It is quite possible that: all authors have some "disability"; all
authors find some difficult-to-impossible reaction to any of the
prioritized checkpoints.
