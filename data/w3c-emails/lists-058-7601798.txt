Some comments and questions on 2.6:

>Guideline 2.6: Provide mechanisms for managing alternative
>content
>Textual descriptions, including "alt"-text, long descriptions,
>video captions, and transcripts are absolutely necessary for the
>accessibility of all images, applets, video, and audio files.
>However, the task of writing these descriptions is probably the
>most time-consuming accessibility recommendation made to the author.

It isn't clear if the mutimedia creation tool will provide the
accessibility requirements or if the web site authoring tool will
provide the accessibility prompt.

>Checkpoints:
>   2.6.1: [Priority 2]
>       Include alternative content which complies with the Web Content
>Acessibility Guidelines for all multimedia files packaged with the
>authoring tool.
>   2.6.2: [Priority 1]
>       Prompt the user, on a configurable schedule, to provide
>"alt"-text for images, image maps, and image map links.
>   2.6.3: [Priority 1]
>       Prompt the author to provide a caption or transcription for
>any audio segment.

How will the authoring tool determine if one is included or not?
What if one is not and the tool is not the audio creation tool?

>  2.6.4: [Priority 1]
>       Prompt the author to provide a caption or transcription for
>any video segment.

How will the authoring tool determine if one is included or not?
What if one is not and the tool is not the video creation tool?
