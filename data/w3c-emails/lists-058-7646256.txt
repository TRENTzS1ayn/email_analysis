This may be acceptable sometimes.

If the same link can be accessed some other way, then it doesn't
matter if the link is invisible.

Example:

<A HREF="http://www.hwg.org/" TITLE="Go to the HWG"
  ><IMG SRC="hwg.gif" ALT=""></A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hwg.org/" TITLE="Go to the HWG"
  >HTML Writers Guild</A>

For graphical browsers, this displays as:

(Image -- Link)
(Text -- Link)

For non-graphical browsers, this displays as:

(Text -- Link)

I maintain that the above is better than:

_HTML Writers Guild_
_HTML Writers Guild_

...which is what would result if I had used ALT="HTML Writers Guild"
