Here's what the Web Content Guidelines says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The content of a document refers to what it says to the user through
natural language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc. The structure
of a document is how it is
organized logically (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of
contents, etc.). An element (e.g., P, STRONG, BLOCKQUOTE in HTML) that
specifies document
structure is called a structural element. The presentation of a document
is how the document is rendered (e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional
graphical presentation, as an
text-only presentation, as synthesized speech, as braille, etc.) An
element that specifies document presentation (e.g., B, FONT, CENTER) is
called a presentation element. 

Consider a document header, for example. The content of the header is
what the header says (e.g., "Sailboats"). In HTML, the header is a
structural element marked up with,
for example, an H2 element. Finally, the presentation of the header
might be a bold block text in the margin, a centered line of text, a
title spoken with a certain voice style
(like an aural font), etc.
