Section 2 intro: Still think should say "content, structure, and
presentation" instead of allowing "content" to include all that.  Note
that the first bullet says: "Separate structure and content from
presentation;" and later "...higher level problems of overall design,
content, description, etc."

In short, if one does a search on "content" and determines if it is used
as defined in WCAG definition section leave it alone, otherwise expand
to "content, structure, and presentation" as this will emphasize the
point made in the aforementioned bullet.  In this posting I will make no
further reference to instances of "content" in the document, but there
are more.

2.3 "...assist the author in generating textual equivalents..." I wonder
if we might again spell out the other equivalents like audio or
whatever.

2.5.2 Grammar checker should examine this; it's the markup that is known
to promote accessibility and the sentence might mean that the tool does
it.

2.5.3 And wherever else should end with a "." since the others do; also
I think all bullets end with ";"?

2.6.1 I think we "alert to" not "alert of"?

3 "Ensure that the Authoring Tool is Accessible to Authors with
Disabilities"  I guess I still think this should be "All Authors"
instead of "authors with disabilities".  The old Universal Design
argument. Further on: "...accessible to authors with disabilities" might
be "accessible to authors of varying skills, styles, and abilities".
Then "2.The authoring tool frequently encompasses the functionality of a
user agent or browser and as such should follow the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines. [WAI-USERAGENT]" should make it clearer that
this refers specifically (exclusively?) to those functions of the
authoring tool that mimic a user agent which is made clearer in 3.1.2
than in the introduction.  Perhaps we could use a checkpoint 3.2.3 of
priority 3 that provides a display of the document in its full anatomy
such as one sees in a browser's "view source document".  Some tools make
this hard to get to.

3.3 "...There are strategies that make it easier to navigate and
manipulate a marked up document" cries out for a link to such
strategies.

A general formatting recommendation: There should be a blank line
between the end of a technique and the presentation of the next
checkpoint; in the present format it looks like the technique belongs to
the subsequent, rather than the previous checkpoint.

I've not gone into the techniques, appendices, etc.
