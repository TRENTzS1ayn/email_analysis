On reading Jutta's proposed revision to Priority 1's definition I find:
"authors will create web content using the tool that does not conform"
and once again we are faced with the problem of the many faces of
"content".  If we are tied to the definition of content in WCAG "he
content of a document refers to what it says to the user through
natural language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc." we should
often substitute "web documents" for "web content" in this case as well
as many others.  We're getting there with "author" vs. "user" so we must
get there with "document" vs. "content".
