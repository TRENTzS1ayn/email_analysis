I like the idea of using document where we mean the whole thing.

  On reading Jutta's proposed revision to Priority 1's definition I find:
  "authors will create web content using the tool that does not conform"
  and once again we are faced with the problem of the many faces of
  "content".  If we are tied to the definition of content in WCAG "he
  content of a document refers to what it says to the user through
  natural language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc." we should
  often substitute "web documents" for "web content" in this case as well
  as many others.  We're getting there with "author" vs. "user" so we must
  get there with "document" vs. "content".
