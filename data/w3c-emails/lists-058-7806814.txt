I thought there was a standing request for examples as part of techniques -
don't wait until last call, do it now...

cheers

  I have been puzzled (creeping senility strikes again) by how to separate
  techniques from examples and it's getting clear.  The techniques
  "document" raises a lot more questions than it answers and will require
  a bevy of contributions in the form of examples; e.g., "Ensure that
  accessibility solutions are present in all help text descriptions of
  markup practices (e.g., IMG elements should appear with "alt-text" and a
  "longdesc" attribute wherever appropriate)." cries out for some specific
  code examples that the tool developer might even want to include in the
  product.  Same for almost every technique.  So there are several CPs/GL
  and there must be a multiplicity of techniques for most CPs and many
  examples for each technique??  The latter need not be "official" or even
  the province of this working group - we're above all that <sheepish
  grin> (did anyone ever see a sheep grin?).  So when we are at last call
  we might put in a request for contributions to the example set?
