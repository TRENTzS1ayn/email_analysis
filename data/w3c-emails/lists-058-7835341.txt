aloha, y'all!

i'm writing to inform you that, due to a rather nasty stomach virus, i
will not be able to attend this afternoon's teleconference, despite the
fact that i want to defend my proposal (that 2.7.2 be re-numbered 2.7.1
and accorded a P!, that 2.7.1 be re-numbered 2.7.2 and accorded a P2, and
that 2.7.3 be left as is) and that i am most interested in the discussion
of priority levels...

gregory.
