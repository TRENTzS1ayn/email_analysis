When Ian first proposed this I thought he was kidding and I didn't even
like the idea.  Now I am in total agreement with the points he raised
and those Charles just expanded.  I would add a rather silly one and
that is that the numbering system for the GLs would be a whole number
and only the CPs would be decimals - just like the WCAG.

Integrating accessibility as to the use of and output from the tools as
a single goal is quite compelling.  The more publicity we can get for
the idea that PWDs will be using the tools, the better.

At the Face2Face Ian said the idea would grow on us and for me it has.
