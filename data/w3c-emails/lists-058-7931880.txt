I am not in favour of merging the sections.

CMN:

JR:
I think that making this statement right up front muddies the water.
There are 7 guidelines that address how a tool can be made
document-accessibility-aware and 3 guidelines that address how to make
the tool interface-accessibility-aware. These are conceptually quite
different even though they tend to make "the communication medium" more
"accessible".

Yes documentation and configuration have a role in
interface-accessibility-awareness but that role is very different than
the author acceptance and education roles they play in
document-accessibility-awareness. It would be messy to talk about
allowing the author to configure checker timing and the font size in the
same place.

There ARE completely separate part to accessibility. In fact, WAI splits
them into 3 parts big enough to fit into 3 documents. Are document is
just unfortunate in that it straddles two parts that are just separate
enough that they need to be split into sections for clarity.

I think clarity would be enhanced by having a Guidelines section (i.e.
2) that is subdivided into A(what is now 2) and B(what is now 3) but
that would mean checkpoints like 2.A.7.1 and that is pushing it.

Basically, structure is desirable in a document when real difference
exist. It helps accessibility and understandability and I think it is
necessary in this instance.
