This is my point: no shift happens for readers. There is too much
information going past to remember that you just dealt
with 4 guidelines of type A then 6 of type B then 3 of type C.
The structural difference is lost as you read. 

In order to promote the structural difference, I think it
should be highlighted in a more compact way, which is
why I prefer an introduction with 2 or 3 parts to it. Plus,
if those parts appear in the table of contents, then the
distinction is captured in an even more compact way.

To the authors, the semantic distinction is obvious and
crucial to designing the entire document. To readers, my
experience (and that of people who tested the usability
of the WCAG) is that separate lists don't have
the effect that you seek.
