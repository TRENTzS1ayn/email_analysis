I think Kynn has clarified the point here somewhat.

The distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Although it is possible to make it
clearer, I do not see any good reason to do so, and good reasons for not
doing so. (As well as some not particularly strong arguments which would
nonetheless commend the idea to me.)

  The distinction is (currently) somewhat arbitrary.  I think for
  clarity's sake we need to either increase the separation (and I
  have suggested separate documents) or decrease it (which is what
  the Ian/Charles suggestion does).
  
  I support merging these two sections.
