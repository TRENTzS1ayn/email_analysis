Changes document will be updated in the morning (hopefully I will get the
issues list up to date as well).

Jutta and I noticed the intro text from 3.4 that was moved to become a
technique for the new 3.2.3 doesn't seem to make sense, and it seemed to us
that the best approach was to add the text to the guideline intro instead. We
have not made the change, since the group decision was made.

But I propose we make the change.
