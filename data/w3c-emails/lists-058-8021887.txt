[Ooops.  Meant this to go here.]

My Windows CE Palmsize PC computer has an HTML editor on it
(as well as several browsers).  Given that there are not
(to the best my understanding) screen reader packages for
Windows CE, what is the obligation of the editor (or the
browsers) to be accessible given that the operating system
is not? :)  [I assume the answer is:  "the point is moot
since there don't seem to be disabled people using Windows
CE, or if they are, they are not prevented from using the
system."]

Just a tongue-in-cheek, stayed-up-too-late thought.

(On the other hand, while my HTML editor may not have to
support blind users, it _should_ produce accessible HTML,
so how do we know which of the AU guidelines apply and
which do not, or will we simply assume that since it
can't be used accessibly, it isn't required to make
accessible HTML?  I can't tell if I'm asking stupid 
questions or if I've identified a problem in our current
approach.  I.e., I can't go to bSQUARE and say "here,
follow these guidelines to make your tool accessible"
because they _can't_ make the tool usable by, say,
Gregory.)
