Jutta's points are well made but, at least to me, unconvincing.  One
person's P1 is another's P(no big deal).  My "disabilities" are
different from Gregory's or Charles'.  The accessibility of the
interface is part and parcel of the tool's output and though I may not
care about some of the current Section 3 guidelines for my own use, some
of them actually matter a lot.  

We will have to discuss this thoroughly in Toronto but I vote for merger
at this time.  Perhaps my paper at Developers' Day - which you may
preview at: http://dicomp.pair.com/talk.htm - will figure into said
discussion.
