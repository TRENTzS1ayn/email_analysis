In today's NYT (I don't know if you can get to it?) at: 
http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/biztech/articles/10phon.html

is an article that presages what will be our main challenge over the
next couple of years.  Here's the gist of the article:
***
US West Corp. intends to announce Monday that it will introduce a phone
developed by Alcatel of France that includes a color screen, pop-out
keyboard and one-touch access to the World Wide Web

"This is the Internet for the rest of us," Solomon Trujillo, US West's
chief executive, said in a prepared statement. "Today, half of all
Americans still aren't on the Internet because it's either too
complicated or too expensive. With these new phones, we're going to blow
open the Internet revolution to everybody by moving e-mail and Web
access to something people are already comfortable with -- the 
telephone."
***
The article says it "could cost as much as $400" but they will almost
surely be given away in cereal boxes within 5 years.  Whether this
becomes a threat to our clients/friends or a gigantic opportunity is up
to us.
