This will be discussed thoroughly in Toronto, but I just want to clear up
one thing before the meeting. I was not implying that this has anything to
do with who the guidelines are for, both guideline 2 and 3 are ultimately
for everyone. The difference is that guideline 2 are ways in which the tool
encourages and helps me to make the document I am creating accessible and
guideline 3 are things that need to happen so I have access to the tool in
the first place.
