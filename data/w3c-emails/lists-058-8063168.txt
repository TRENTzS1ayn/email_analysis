JT:: "...both guideline 2 and 3 are ultimately for everyone."

WL: See how easy it is?  You've just merged *Sections* 2 & 3 by making
them *guidelines* <g>.  The contents of Sections 2 & 3 are *just*
guidelines and the differentiation along lines of whether they refer to
the interface or the output are entirely specious. Because we arrived at
the notion of separating them into "sections" on a particular basis
doesn't mean that such a division has any useful purpose - and many of
us feel that it is just a (very subtle?) form of ghettoization.  I still
vote for merger.
