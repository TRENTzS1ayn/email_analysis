     I agree wholeheartedly with Jutta.  Section 3 is logically distinct
from the other sections of the document.  It builds on and extends existing
documentation for making the UI of tools accessible on their platform.
Mixing in UI accessibility with creating accessible web content will make
the AU guidelines confusing to follow for tool developers  (e.g. the folks
who write my help text are completely separate from the folks who design
the UI for accessing help).

     I disagree with Ian about how to structure introductory text.  The
reader will be better able to put UI accessibility checkpoints in context
if there is introductory text immediately preceeding the related set of
checkpoints.  For example, references to other UI accessability documents
will have more impact when referenced in the section 3 introduction rather
than in the section 1 intro.  Proximity is important.

Subject:  Re: Merging sections 2 and 3


The two sections have very distinct and disparate goals. The goal of
section 2 is to encourage the average author to create accessible web
pages/documents/sites/content. The goal of section 3 is to make the tool
accessible to authors with disabilities. The two goals of the sections are
not muddied. The goals are so seperate that we cannot do without two
distinct phrases in our priorities. We judge the importance of the
checkpoints in each section using different reference points.

Even we who are steeped in this document sometimes forget which criteria we
should use. How many times has someone asked " how does this make the tool
more accessible" when we were working on section 2, and we have had to
respond "it doesn't." Merging the two sections would confuse and eliminate
the emphasis and definition of one or both goals.
