To all of you who are in Toronto this week please feel free to drop in to
the ATRC. We are open until around 6 every day. If you need a place to
check your email, get directions, get advice on what to see or just to see
the centre, you are very welcome.

The ATRC is in the Robarts library at 130 St. George St on the ground floor.
Robarts is a huge concrete structure that looks like the Loch Ness monster,
an eagle or a Canada goose depending on who you speak to. It is just south
of Bloor St and just east of Spadina. If you are taking the subway from the
Convention Centre get off at the St. George stop and walk south on St.
George.

If you have questions about Toronto you can also email me or anyone at the
ATRC. Our web site is at: www.utoronto.ca/atrc.
