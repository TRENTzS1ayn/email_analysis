I still believe that there are other distinctions besides sections
2 and 3; either we should make these more clear (e.g., have a 
section A about producing valid markup, a section B about prompting
the user, a section C about promoting web accessibility, a section
D about having an accessible user interface), or we should
collapse the sections into one list.

Hmmm.
