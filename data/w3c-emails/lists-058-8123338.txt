This chopping and rechopping sections went on for most of the pre-rec life of
the Web Content Guidelines. I can think of 2 new ways of dividing the
document up in the last 10 minutes. I think that the various divisions are
arbitrary, although some will be readily understood by more people than
others.

The two groups whose input is important is producers of tools and users of
tools (who are trying to decide whether their tool does what we think it
ought to do). If there is a division which clearly makes more sense to these
groups than having a single set of guidelines, then there would be an
argument for using that division. But I am not convinced that there is such a
division.

  Maybe we need to have four or five "larger" guidelines with checkpoints
  and techniques under each:
  
  A.  Create Accessible Documents
  
  >2.1 Generate standard markup
  >2.2 Support all accessible authoring practices of W3C Recommendations
  
  B.  Correct Inaccessibility Problems
  
  >2.3 Ensure that no accessibility content is missing
  >2.5 Preserve existing accessible structure or content

  C.  Document Accessible Authoring Practices
  
  >2.7 Promote accessibility in help and documentation
  
  D.  Provide An Accessible User Interface
  
  >3.1 Follow principles of accessible design
  >3.2 Ensure independence of authoring and publishing environments.
  >3.3 Provide accessible navigation
  >3.4 Ensure accessible representation of elements
  
  E.  Integrate Accessibility Naturally
