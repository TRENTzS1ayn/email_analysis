CMcCN:: "I can think of 2 new ways of dividing the document up in the
last 10 minutes."

WL: The absolute maximum number of "Sections" into which me may divide
the currently agreed-upon guidelines is 10.  The absolute minimum number
of "Sections" is 1.  On our plate right now is the decision of whether
to use 1 or 2.  Any argument used for 2 is likely valid for 3 - 10.  The
concept of division is anathema to the overall idea of inclusion because
the basis for the choice of 2 is essentially that there is "obviously" a
difference between the interface to the tool and the output of the tool.
From the point of view of Web Access this is not  "obvious" whether "the
folks who write my help text are completely separate from the folks who
design the UI for accessing help" in Bruce's context or whether "the
folks who create the Web are the same as the folks who 'use' the Web" in
my context.  I daresay that within any hierarchical tool design factory
there are divisions of labor along various lines that have historical
and practical bases but that shouldn't alter the notion that "we're all
in this together" and if we separate, or divide on the basis of
author/user we err on the side of exclusion.  I am not yet swayed from
the notion of oneness in our guideline set.  See ya
Friday/Saturday/Sunday.
