To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


So far we have:

1. Should the guideline on accessibility of the user interface be first?

2. How do we deal with relative priority?

3. Definitions for priority

4. Should we produce a draft this week, given that we expect one or two
proposals next week for the current section 3 to be made into a single
guideline?

(There are some other issues still hanging around, waiting for definite
proposals in terms of the document. I'll have a go at them, but don't know if
they will happen before the meeting)
