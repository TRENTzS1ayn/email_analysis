No. It was discussed at the meeting on Sunday morning and decided that we
would include a single guideline on making the tool accessible, and that the
techniques for that guideline/checkpoints would aim to provide a complete
checklist of user interface accessibility requirements.

This makes good sense to me - it is better than finding that developers on
some platform have been referred to guidelines which miss something
important, although they are in a set of guidelines which are in other
guidelines for different platforms or systems.

details from the minutes, which will be linked from the group home page
shortly, and are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-toronto1 for Sunday's
sessions.

  Should this be part of the User Agent Guidelines (instead)?
