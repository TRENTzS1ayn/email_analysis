No, because in order to make our document we have to know what
specific parts of accessibility guidelines aren't covered by
the existing documents but apply only to authoring tools.  Also,
in the Sunday meeting we decided to include a short synopsis of
general accessibility practices as list items in our document
for completeness' sake.

(The compelling argument is "it's okay to say that we will refer
to other documents, but what if someone writes guidelines for
linux (e.g.) that're incomplete -- it doesn't mention keyboard
accessibility (e.g.) -- at least we will have the concept
presented in ours.)

Also, the UA guidelines are still a work in progress; we can't
really refer to them without having to continually (as a group)
track whatever they do.  This is the problem that LOTS of WAI
groups have faced with the WCAG, having to change their own
approach as the content WG changes theirs.

So I would say, no, the "(instead)" part is not correct.
