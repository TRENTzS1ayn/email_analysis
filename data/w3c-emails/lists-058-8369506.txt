All the checkpoints in 2.2 (implement accessibility practices for
languages) and 2.6.1 and 2.6.3 (checking for and helping to correct
accessibility errors) seem to be relative in priority, as well as any in
"make the tool accessible" which refer to other guidelines.

2.3.1 and 2.3.2 (prompting for equivalent content and structural information)
are probably relative

2.5.1 "Understand accessibility markup for languages imported" is not
relative - it is P1 that all features are understood.

At least that's how I see it...
