Checkpoint 2.5.1 in [1] reads:

  "The tool must recognize accessibility markup for any language 
   or format that it imports or converts. "

What does "recognize" mean? I'm not sure what this checkpoint
is meant to ensure. Does this mean:

1) The markup must be supported according to specification.
2) All features of the markup language (or format) that are known
   to relate to accessibility must be supported.
   (This sounds like 2.2.1).

Jutta, I would like to discuss this at an AU meeting.

 - Ian
