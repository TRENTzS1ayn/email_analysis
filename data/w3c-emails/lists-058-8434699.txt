Summary of resolutions:

Guideline "make the tool accessible" to be first (issue still open)

Relative priorities to be handled by splitting checkpoints into multiple
checkpoints each of single priority. This will apply to checkpoints 2.2.2,
2.2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.6.1, 2.6.3, and is expected to apply to the new
checkpoints referring to accessibility of the user interface

in 2.6 validity is to be dealt with in intro not checkpoints.
