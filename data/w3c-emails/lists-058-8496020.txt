It looks like we will end up with duplicate information, when Ian and I

  This (expanding the platform guidelines in AU) doesn't make sense to me.
  
  We're going to end up with either:
   - duplicate information in both AU and UA
   - circular dependency betwen AU and UA
  
  What would make sense would be have the "Make the authoring tool
  accessible" checkpoint moved in UA altogether, on the ground that UA
  is not just browsing but also editing.
