I agree - the scope of the group is accessiblity for people with
disabilities. If other groups (mobile users, developing countries, etc)
derive a benefit that is a nice extra, not a core requirement, and cannot be
the basis for our own work (although we should ensure that we are not going
to make life unnecessarily difficult).

And some expansion on that point.
