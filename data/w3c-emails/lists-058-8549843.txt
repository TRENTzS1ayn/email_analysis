Notes:
1. This draft has the techniques for checkpoints or guidelines separated into
a different version of the document.

2. The numbering has changed, and will probably be unstable for a couple of
drafts. Please be sure to quote the version you are referring to unless it is
the latest one.

3. I expect that we will have a lot of discussion over the next couple of
weeks. Please try to keep the threading easy to follow by replying to emails
with the same subject header, and by separating different issues into
different emails.
