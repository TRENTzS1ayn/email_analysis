Eric proposed that the abstract and Introduction be the same.

I disagree.

I think the first part of The proposed Introduction is good - replace

The guidelines in this document are meant to help authoring tool developers
and vendors design products that encourage authors to adopt accessible
authoring practices. For the purposes of this document the term "authoring
tool" will refer to authoring tools, generation tools, and conversion tools.
These guidelines emphasize the role of the user interface in informing,
supporting, correcting, and motivating authors during the editing process.
For a more detailed discussion of accessible Web authoring practices, see the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( [WAI-WEBCONTENT] )

This document provides accessibility guidelines for developers of Web
authoring tools. Following these guidelines will: (a) help users of authoring
tools develop Web content that is accessible for people with disabilities and
(b) ensure that authoring tools themselves are accessible to users with
disabilities. Following these guidelines is also expected to make authoring
tools and the content created by them more usable for all users.

For the purposes of this document the term "authoring tool" will refer to
authoring tools, generation tools, and conversion tools. These guidelines
emphasize the role of the user interface in informing, supporting,
correcting, and motivating authors during the editing process. For a more
detailed discussion of accessible Web authoring practices, see the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines ( [WAI-WEBCONTENT] ). Because authoring
tools usually include some kind of user agent (e.g., browser), the _User
Agent Accessibility Guidelines_ also provide additional relevant detail.


I would prefer the following, essentially adopting one sentence from Eric's
proposal:

The guidelines in this document are meant to help authoring tool developers
and vendors design products that encourage authors to adopt accessible
authoring practices.  Following these guidelines will: (a) help users of
authoring tools (authors) develop Web content that is accessible for people
with disabilities and (b) ensure that authoring tools themselves are
accessible to authors with disabilities. For the purposes of this document
the term "authoring tool" will refer to authoring tools, generation tools,
and conversion tools. These guidelines emphasize the role of the user
interface in informing, supporting, correcting, and motivating authors during
the editing process. For a more detailed discussion of accessible Web
authoring practices, see the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (
