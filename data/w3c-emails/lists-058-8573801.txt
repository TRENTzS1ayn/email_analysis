To be honest, your proposals tend to be so huge and sweeping that
it's hard for me to get my mind around them and take the hours
that would be necessary with a copy of your rewrites, the original,
and your email on the subject in order to figure out what's going
on in there.  I feel when reading these that it might be better to
address each topic (or group of related topics) in a separate
thread in order to get better concensus rather than dumping a
straight list of changes to the WG.

I admit that I have a tendency to get lost in large lists of
suggestions and can deal better with "here's what I think we should
do about <issue>" style of discussion.  Am I the only one?
