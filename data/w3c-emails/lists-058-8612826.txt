Eric has proposed the following changes to the introductory material in the
guidelines section:

From the principles of accessible content listed in the old section 2:

Add to

Separate structure and content from presentation.

the following:

This separation makes it easier to for user agents (e.g., browsers and
related assistive technologies) to generate of several different renditions
(presentations) (e.g., synthesized speech, braille, visual display) from the
same underlying representation of the content and structure.

Replace

Ensure that accessible equivalents are available for all objects that may not
otherwise be accessible (e.g., text, audio descriptions for video)

With

Provide _ text equivalents_ for all objects that are not otherwise be
accessible (e.g., images, movie, audio clips, applets, etc.). Textual
representations are essential because they can be flexibly rendered in so
many accessible ways (synthesized speech, braille, and visually-displayed
text).

Add to

Provide consistent structure and navigation

the sentence

Such consistency facilitates comprehension and navigation.

If we keep the Techniques document in the form of the guidelines document
with additional material included, then it might be worth exapnding the
introduction to the guidelines material and including such additions. However
in the guidelines themselves I feel that these explanations are unnecesssary,
since these are in any case mere pointers to the essential ideas which are
spelled out in WCAG, and with which the developers will necessarily become
familiar from that document.
