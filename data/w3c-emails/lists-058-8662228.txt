To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


Guideline 2.6 currently deals with preserving accessibility markup in any
language. It requires that the tool recognise (2.6.1) and not remove (2.6.2)
markup which is known to promote accessibility.

This seems to me more properly to belong in Guideline 2.3 - implement
accessibility features. Currently that guideline only deals with w3c
recommendations, which seems like an artifical restriction. It is true that
we have much better coverage of accessibility features for certain W3C
recommendations, but this guideline is more or less a pointer anyway, and
there is no reason to restrict the scope in this way.

Guideline 2.6 also requires (2.6.3) that the author have final control over
automated changes to the markup. This seems to belong in section 2.7 -
checking accessiblity and helping repair it.

I therefore propose:

1. Remove the restriction to W3C Recommendations from Guideline 2.3 

2. Move checkpoints 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 to a asingle checkpoint in 2.3 - The tool
must recognise, and preserve in its output, all accessibility features of
documents in languages or formats which it imports or converts

3. Move checkpoint 2.6.3 into guideline 2.7
