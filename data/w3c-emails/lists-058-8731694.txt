I agree with Charles that my re-wording is not needed as a checkpoint.  I'd
rather see it in the techniques for 2.1.1.

Subject:  2.1.4 - identifying by text equivalent


Bruce Roberts proposed a wording change some time ago which nicely captured
the meaning of the checkpoint:

allow the author to identify all document elements that are editable or that
wil affect the output.

I think the checkpoint is not necessary, but if we want it we should adopt
Bruce's wording...
