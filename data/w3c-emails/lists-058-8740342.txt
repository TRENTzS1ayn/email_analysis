To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


The question of whether the user should be able to completely disable
accessibility warnings has no recorded resolution.

I think the discussion so far has suggested that the current guidelines allow
this implicitly, by providing for user configurability, and that the best
approach is to maintain the status quo, possibly with the addition of a
requirement that default settings be for accessibility warnings about
everything. It seems to me that this is already covered in 2.7.1 (and 2 and
3) - is it obvious already, or do we need to add something (and if so, what)?
