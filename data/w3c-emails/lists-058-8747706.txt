If we are to the point of discussing levels of alerting permitted under
the guidelines, I think we're in good enough shape to freeze and
publish.  It's getting a bit like the QuickTips where there is a bunch
of awfully minor stuff.  There are only 8 guidelines!  We can go on
about the details for the rest of our lives and still not satisfy every
conceivable nuance.  If we can get this set to the level of a proposed
recommendation, let's do it.
