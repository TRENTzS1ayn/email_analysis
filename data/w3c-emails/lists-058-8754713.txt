Aaah, but the devil is, as always, in the details.

I think there are still some larger-level issues (guideline 2.1 stands out in
my mind) which we are waiting to resolve before we can happily freeze. One of
the crucial factors in how long it takes is the amount of work we can get
done in preparing for teleconferences, on the list. We all have constraints
on our time, and should think carefully about what combination of email and
teleconference time is the most efficient way to resolve each issue to get us
to last call with a stable, thorough, and robust draft as soon as possible.

  about the details for the rest of our lives and still not satisfy every
  conceivable nuance.  If we can get this set to the level of a proposed
  recommendation, let's do it.
