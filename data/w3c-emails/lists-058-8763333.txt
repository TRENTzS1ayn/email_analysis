What are the points that must be addressed before we can say that what
we have is suitable for last call?

Although there are a couple of points referred to within the textual
parts that need a bit of tidying, the guidelines themselves are OK with
me.  If there are guidelines deemed unacceptable, let's work on that;
then to the checkpoints with the same question.  We don't need a lot of
back and forth on something with eight (count 'em 8!) guidelines.
