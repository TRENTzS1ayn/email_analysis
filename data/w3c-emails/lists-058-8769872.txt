In the event (IMHO a near sure thing) that the notion of "the computer
is the network" becomes increasingly a fact, I think our ideas of what
"tools" will be is going to change radically and the means for
publishing materials on the Web are going to be fewer in number and more
centralized - thus potentially more subject to conformance with
accessibility guidelines.

What if the browser/editor that forms the interface with the Web is not
a "commercial product" but is just sort of *there* - will we be in a
good position to affect its parameters to insure PWDs don't get ignored?
Will this "tool" be in fact rooted in W3C?  Are we through Amaya, CSS,
and the various "MLs" working on the heart of such a tool and only its
UI will be variable, and perhaps multiple?
