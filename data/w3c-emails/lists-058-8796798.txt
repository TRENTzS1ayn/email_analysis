The "relative priority" issue is addressed in the 527 document by this
clause:

"(Priority 1 for *** which is [Web-Content-Priority-1], Priority 2 for
*** which is [Web-Content-Priority-2], Priority 3 for *** which is
[Web-Content-Priority-3])"

How about:
"Priority level for *** corresponds to its priority level in WCAG."?

Where *** is "alternative content" in 2.4.2, "structural information" in
2.4.3, "accessibility problems" in 2.6.1 & 2.6.3.
