This sounds like the Priority 'R' proposal that Daniel put forward at
Toronto. I think it is my preferred model, but I would like to know which
option other people find the clearest.

  The "relative priority" issue is addressed in the 527 document by this

  "(Priority 1 for *** which is [Web-Content-Priority-1], Priority 2 for
  *** which is [Web-Content-Priority-2], Priority 3 for *** which is
  [Web-Content-Priority-3])"
  
  How about:
  "Priority level for *** corresponds to its priority level in WCAG."?
  
  Where *** is "alternative content" in 2.4.2, "structural information" in
  2.4.3, "accessibility problems" in 2.6.1 & 2.6.3.
