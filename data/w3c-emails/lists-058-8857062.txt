Wendy gave us a URL (http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/browser/) to check out on the
TRACE web site.  Phil and I had a look and believe the guidelines offered there
are too general to be useful to us.  The TRACE guidelines apply more to
electronic hardware devices and as such aren't readily applicable to software UI
guidelines.  Here's an example:

"Strategies for ensuring that the surface of controls can be easily
differentiated tactually from the main surface of a product"


I recommend we drop this line of inquiry.
