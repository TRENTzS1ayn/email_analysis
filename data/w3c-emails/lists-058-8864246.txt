I also had trouble using the TRACE guidelines. However, I have expanded the
suggestion I made for techniques slightly, having reviewed IBM, SUN,
Microsoft, Apple, EITAAC, US Dept of Education, Australian Government
guidelines as well as the TRACE documents.

Assuming that this is the discharging of your action item from the face to
face meeting, I will post my proposals to the list shortly. This represents a
summary of those guidelines, part of the action item I and Ian took from the
teleconference after that meeting to look into producing a W3C Note as a
stable reference.

Cheers

Charles

  Wendy gave us a URL (http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/browser/) to check out on the
  TRACE web site.  Phil and I had a look and believe the guidelines offered there
  are too general to be useful to us.  The TRACE guidelines apply more to
  electronic hardware devices and as such aren't readily applicable to software UI
  guidelines.  Here's an example:
  
  "Strategies for ensuring that the surface of controls can be easily
  differentiated tactually from the main surface of a product"
  
  
  I recommend we drop this line of inquiry.
