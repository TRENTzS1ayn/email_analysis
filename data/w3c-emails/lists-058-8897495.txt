I definitely support combing the two checkpoints, and offer a proposed
rewording to clarify a couple issues.

How about:
Preserve accessible content during conversions or transformations. 

The issue that I am trying to clarify is that a tool might make
transformations either while importing or exporting. I interpretted
Charles' proposal to only address exports.  I'm not sure that my proposal
makes it any more clear.  

I deleted the explicit mention of types of conversions/transformations to
leave it open to all types.  I don't feel strongly about leaving them out.
