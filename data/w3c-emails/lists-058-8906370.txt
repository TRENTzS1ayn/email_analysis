I like this wording. I would still be inclined to say "accessibility features
of content" (as per Eric's suggestion).

  How about:
  Preserve accessible content during conversions or transformations. 
  
  The issue that I am trying to clarify is that a tool might make
  transformations either while importing or exporting. I interpretted
  Charles' proposal to only address exports.  I'm not sure that my proposal
  makes it any more clear.  
  
  I deleted the explicit mention of types of conversions/transformations to
  leave it open to all types.  I don't feel strongly about leaving them out.
