TRACE, ATRC, IBM, American Foundation for the Blind, are all members of the
group, and publish extensively in the field. My review of the area over the
last two weeks suggests that IBM, Microsoft, EITAAC, and Sun have all relied
extensively on the work of TRACE. (As an historian, an important part of my
expertise is looking at documents and determining what the dependencies are.
It was an interesting exercise in this case.) Although I doubt that any one
member of the group has sufficient expertise to create this information from
nothing, I think the required expertise and the necessary background
information are in fact readily available within working group. Part of that
expertise is an understanding of what information a developer needs, and how
best to present it. Your (Bruce's) expertise in that particular area is an
important ingredient.

I haven't come up with this information because I am some kind of genius. The
checkpoints as I have proposed are those which seem, after discussion and
reflection, to provide the necessary information for what must be done. The
techniques I have collected and proposed are based on careful review of the
following documents:

       I'm still uncomfortable with having multiple tool accessibility
  checkpoints.  I'm O.K. (marginally) with the checkpoint for following the
  operating system standards with a large list of techniques behind it.  Beyond
  that, I would like to be convinced that this group has the correct expertise and
  can spend the appropriate time to define other UI accessiblity requirements.  I
  know I don't have that expertise or the time.  Can other folks speak to this?
