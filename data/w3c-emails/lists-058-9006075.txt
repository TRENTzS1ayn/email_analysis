I take the word "will" to mean the tool must ALWAYS create accessible content.
Am I reading too much into that word?  I.E. the tool can't ever create
inaccessible content even under user configurable settings.  An example where I
might decide as an author to create potentially inaccessible markup would be if
I used PowerPoint to generate PDFs on web pages for my talk at a conference or
for my Intranet.  If it's possible to do that by changing default settings in
the tool does that mean it doesn't achieve the goal??  If so, I have a problem
with the goal as stated.  I prefer either of the following statements:

     Authors can create accessible content

     The authoring tool creates accessible content.

The fact that this is a *GOAL* makes it not just OK but mandatory that
it say "will create" since that is the goal.
