aloha, all!

in fulfillment of one of the action items i took at yesterday's
teleconference, here is my proposed rewording for Checkpoints 2.1.3,
2.1.4, and 2.1.5

three notes:

1) the basis for the rewording of these checkpoints is the working draft
of 27 may 1999, which was the draft being discussed at the 2 june
teleconference, and which can be found at:
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOL-19990527.html>
in the latest working draft, however, these checkpoints are enumerated
as follows: 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4, and since this draft,
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOL-19990602.html>

2) optional--but in my view, essential--verbiage is enclosed in
curly-brackets (i.e. these things: {})

3) i attempted to send this out yesterday, shortly after the
teleconference ended, but due to connectivity problems with my local
service provider, wasn't able to establish a viable connection until
today...  consequently, i ask that anyone responding to this proposal
on-list also Cc their post to the following eddress:
<unagi69@concentric.net>

--- begin proposed rewording of Checkpoints 2.1.3 through 2.1.5 ---
2.1.3: [Priority 1] 
The author must be able to change the rendered view of the document {being
edited) without changing the presentational markup defined for the
published document. 

2.1.4: [Priority 1] 
Allow the author to display a textual equivalent of each element or object.

2.1.5: [Priority 1] 
For each element of a document, the properties of that element must be
accessible to the author. 

--- end proposed rewording of Checkpoints 2.1.3 through 2.1.5

i have a few, more verbose, iterations of 2.1.3, but i think the one
included here is strongest, due in no small part, to its terseness...

gregory.
