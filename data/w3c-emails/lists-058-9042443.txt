Just so everyone is aware that the list really gets to hear directly what the
group members have to say...

aloha, jutta & charles!

yes, call me an idiot, for i am such--at least for attempting to
compose (or, rather, refine and fact-check) a post to the AU list whilst
connected to a remote shell account via an extremely slow dialup 
connection, in which there is at least a 30, and often a 75, second delay
between the typing of a command, and its execution...

in any event, whilst editing my action item on GL 2.1 whilst logged into
the account which is subscribed to the AU list, i inadvertently sent out
an incomplete post...  since i don't know if the posts are directly
distributed to the list via the listmail software or are passed by one or
both of you for review before they are redistributed, i thought that i'd
address this explanation/excuse to you directly, rather than to the list,
on the off chance that the incomplete post hasn't yet been posted to the
list...

if, however, the damage is already done, consider this a disclaimer, and
please forward it to the list...

thanks,
gregory.
