I prefer the second, briefer wording for the current 2.1.2, with the
definitions given.

I would like to propose that we reword 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, in part based on
Bruce Roberts' proposal initially suggested in April, as follows:

Allow the author to identify (in an accessible way) all elements and
properties in the document which are available for editing. [P1]

I am assuming in this that identify in this checkpoint, combined with 2.4.1
allow the author to edit (everything) is enough to explicitly require the
ability to read the various objects.

As a further point of clarification, I am wondering about the scope of 2.1.2.
It seems to me that it is only a P1 requirement in so-called WYSIWYG editing,
although in that case the need is pretty clear.

In fact WYSIWYG editing, and the ability to display textual equivalents of
objects in the document (and visual equivalents as well - a sound object
might have a textual identifier, a visual icon, and a transcript or
description file), seem like partial approaches to satisfying 2.1.3 / 2.1.4,
given the requirement that WYSIWYG editing allows for different rendering in
the editing view and in the published version.

This requirement also relates to checkpoint 2.1.1 and the User Agent
Guidelines, but I will write about that as a separate proposal.

cheers
