Currently we have

2.1.1 [Priority 1]
Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and
conventions

and

2.1.6 [Priority 1]
Ensure that user agent functionality offered by the tool (e.g., in a preview
mode) conform's to the W3C's User Agent Accessibility Guidelines

It seems obvious to me that User Agent Accessibility Guidelines would outline
accessiblity standards and/or conventions which are applicable to something
with user agent functionality, so I think 2.1.6 is redundant. Further, I
think it means that this document depends on User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines becoming a recommendation first, and that may or may not occur. SO
I propose (again) that we drop 2.1.6 as a checkpoint.

Also, the priority for 2.1.1 seems to be a relative one. I so I propose that
checkpoint 2.1.1 be

P1 for accessibility features which are critical, P2 for those which are
important, and P3 for those which are beneficial.

This seems completely in line with our current definition of
priorities, and clarifies the situtation for a developer (assuming that the
many guidelines available explain how important various features are).
