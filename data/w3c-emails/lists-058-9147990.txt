Well, I have looked through the definition section. I propose that we make
the following changes to the Guidelines version of the document:

Prompts and alerts:

Since this section has been included whole as a technique I think we should
give just a short definition of prompt and alert:

Prompt: Ask the author to provide information, for example through a dialog,
or as parameters to a command. A prompt requires a response.

Alert: Notify the author. There are many ways of doing this, which may or may
not require author action, and different techniques may be appropraite in
different circumstances. See "techniques"

Markup editing tools and functions:

I think we should define what we mean by authoring tool, and leave out the
rest.

Authoring Tool: As used in this document the term authoring tool includes any
tool which is used to create or edit content for the Web. This includes HTML
editing tools, conversion tools, database programs with webserving
capability, graphics and multimedia packages used to create content for the
web, and sofware which converts or saves other document types to formats for
use on the web.

Documents, Elements and Attributes. I think we should redefine Document as
follows:

Document: A single resource which is delivered via the web, or published to
the web. For example, a web page in HTML is a document, but any image
included within that page is also a document in its own right, and can be
produced or edited by an authoring tool, most commonly a graphics pakage.

Accessibility terms:

I don't think these are well defined. They are defined by reference to
definitions in WCAG, but the terms are not defined in that document either. I
think we can write specific, appropriate definiiotns for how we use them in
this document, and we should do that.

Inserting and editing

I don't really think we need these definitions.

Selection, Focus and Events

I don't think we need these definitions either. I think we only use the term
view, and in that case I think we should define subsets of View as Gregory
proposed, and I think that the definition of view we currently have is a
technique appropriate to 2.1.2, and possibly 2.1.5 and 2.1.7.

I haven't worked out exactly what I think we should do in the techniques
document, so for the moment I propose leaving it alone.
