It would be good to produce a new public working draft in the next week or
so. It basically depends on having the terms and definitions section cleaned
up, and sufficient material in the techniques (especially including the
sample implementations section) document.

It takes a couple of weeks to cycle a draft through the interest group, so it
would be nice to get it out as soon as possible. This depends in part on how
much we can get done between as well as during teleconferences - I had hoped
we could get there after the meeting this week, but it may take another week
to have it ready.

This is an issue for discussion at the meeting tomorrow, assuming we get
through the rest of the agenda.
