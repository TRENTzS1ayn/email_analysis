New draft:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990610

NB please review the techniques document, since that includes the techniques,
guidelines and checkpoints, priorities, and the definitions section.
Currently only the abstract, status, introduction and references are
different, and the techniques document doesn't have a conformance statement.

Changes lits updated:

Minutes from yesterday:
http://www.w3.org/WAi/AU/telecon-9jun99

Start of next weeks Agenda:
http://www.w3.org/WAi/AU/telecon-16jun99

Items so far: Relative priority for 2.1.1, and more discussion of the
definitions section.

Other things open for discussion on the way to a TR draft include definition
of priorities, and the sample implementations section.

cheers

Charles
