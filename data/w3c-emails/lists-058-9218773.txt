I propose that we add the following text after the goals:

The priority of a checkpoint is a reflection of how important it is to
meeting those goals. 

and the following after the definitions themselves:

It should be noted that meeting the checkpoint does not guarantee that the
goals will be met. In particular, if an author is trying to create
inaccessible content a tool cannot necessarily prevent them from doing so. It
is assumed that the user would prefer to create content which is accessible.
