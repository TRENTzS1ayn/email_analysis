1.3 Checkpoint priorities
[Editors' note: These definitions are to be further refined]
          There are three goals:
                The authoring tool is accessible 
                Authors will create accessible content 
                The tool will encourage creation of accessible content 
          [Priority 1] 
                Essential to meeting those goals 
          [Priority 2] 
                Important to meeting those goals 
          [Priority 3] 
                Beneficial to meeting those goals

I don't think these *GOALS* need any "further refinement" or laborious
definition.  It is often claimed that we never "define" accessible but
since it is an operational thing, a "proper" definition might emerge in
the mind of a thoughtful guideline reader without some tortuous
explanation.  Accessible means almost all authors can use the tool and
almost all surfers can glean info from the output of the authoring tool.
It doesn't mean the output will be useful to people who cannot read or
understand the "content" but it does mean Helen Keller could probably
find a recipe for chocolate chip cookies and possibly even put up a page
attempting to explain what "water" meant to her.
