I think we should have the link text which explains that the priorities are
defined in terms of their importance to meeting those goals, just to make the
thing a bit more readiable. The rest of it i think we can live without.

  1.3 Checkpoint priorities
  [Editors' note: These definitions are to be further refined]
            There are three goals:
                  The authoring tool is accessible 
                  Authors will create accessible content 
                  The tool will encourage creation of accessible content 
            [Priority 1] 
                  Essential to meeting those goals 
            [Priority 2] 
                  Important to meeting those goals 
            [Priority 3] 
                  Beneficial to meeting those goals
  
  I don't think these *GOALS* need any "further refinement" or laborious
  definition.  It is often claimed that we never "define" accessible but
  since it is an operational thing, a "proper" definition might emerge in
  the mind of a thoughtful guideline reader without some tortuous
  explanation.  Accessible means almost all authors can use the tool and
  almost all surfers can glean info from the output of the authoring tool.
  It doesn't mean the output will be useful to people who cannot read or
  understand the "content" but it does mean Helen Keller could probably
  find a recipe for chocolate chip cookies and possibly even put up a page
  attempting to explain what "water" meant to her.
