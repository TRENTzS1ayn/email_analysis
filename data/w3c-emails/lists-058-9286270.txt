The current (10 june) draft succinctly lists the goals of the AUGL as:

-- begin quote
* The authoring tool is accessible 
* Authors will create accessible content 
* The tool will encourage the creation of accessible content 
-- end quote

There have been strong objections voiced, particularly by Bruce Roberts,
to the wording of the second goal, and, so, as an attempt to address this
concern, I propose the following re-wording:

--- begin GJR's first formulation of goals ---
There are three goals:

1. The authoring tool is accessible 

2. The authoring tool will create accessible content by default,
   according to a user-configurable schedule

3. The tool will encourage the creation of accessible content 
--- end GJR's first formulation of goals ---

- OR -

--- begin GJR's second (more verbose) formulation of goals ---
There are four goals:

1. The authoring tool is accessible 

2. The authoring tool will create accessible content by default

3. Mechanisms for creating accessible content are controlled by a 
    user-configurable 

4. The tool will encourage the creation of accessible content
--- end GJR's second (more verbose) formulation of goals ---

Personally, I like the brevity of my first iteration, but I think the
second (more verbose) iteration is clearer, inasmuch as it touches on all
of the points we are trying to express:

1. the tool itself must be accessible
2. the tool must create accessible content by default
3. the tool should provide as much user-configurability as possible, and
4. the tool should teach authors how to construct well-structured,
   accessible pages, even if it does so in a subliminal manner

One last note: Regardless of whether or not either my re-wordings are
accepted, I would like to "see" the list type used to enumerate these
goals changed from the current unordered list to an ordered list.
