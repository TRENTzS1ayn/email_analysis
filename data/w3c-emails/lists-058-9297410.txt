To: Authoring Tools WG<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>

GJR:: "Allow the author to display an editable equivalent for each
element,  object, and property which is available for editing."

WL: Are there any objects that are *NOT* available for editing? If not,
why not? Aren't "properties" attributes of "elements" which in turn are
objects? Is "display" adequate to the authors' purposes? Why must the
tool display an "equivalent"?  

Perhaps: "Allow the author to accessibly edit every object"?
