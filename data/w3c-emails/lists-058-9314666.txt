GJR:: "The authoring tool will create accessible content by default,   
according to a user-configurable schedule"

WL: Please put a full stop after "default" - enough "user-configurabale
schedule" already in place.  Not sure about "will create"; might be
"creates" to parallel first goal and "encourages" in the third one, else
"will be" for "is" in first goal?
