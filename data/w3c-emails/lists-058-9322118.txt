With the present statement of the goals, did we lose the goal statement
regarding the tool generating accessible content somewhere and what was the
justification? Goal 3 addresses the prompting, education, verification,
alerting etc that the tool must do, which is all that a tool developer has
control over given that we want it to be on a user configurable schedule.
The present goals don't address what the tool does without the author's
explicit intervention. I would propose that goal 2 be that the tool
generate accessible content.
