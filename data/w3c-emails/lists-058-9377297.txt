To: WAI AU Guidelines<w3c-wai-au@w3.org>


We currently have a section which defines alternative text, longdesc,
d-links, and so on. Most of these terms are not used in the guidelines. I
think we should use a single term for alternative content, and it should be
defined, but I think we can live without the definition for the IG review
(who knows - we might get a really good idea out of the review).

I therefore propose we remove that section of definitions from the guidelines
document.

As an alternative, I would offer a definition of alternative content:
Alternative content is specifically designed to be equivalent to some other
part of the content, and useful in a different representation. For example,
an image such as the icon for the search function of a ste might have the
term "search" as alternative content, marked up by use of the alt attribute
for the HTML IMG element.
