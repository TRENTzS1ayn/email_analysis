"An authoring tool which offers a "rendered view" of a document, such as
a browser preview mode, may provide an editing view whose presentation
can be controlled independently of the rendered view. 

"A "WYSIWYG" editor may allow an author to specify a local stylesheet,
which will override the "published" style of the document."

"may" somehow seems overly permissive.  If you just can't stand "must"
then at least go for "should"!  Since this is P1, I vote for "must".
