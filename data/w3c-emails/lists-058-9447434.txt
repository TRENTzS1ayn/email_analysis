These are techniques - possible ways of implementing the checkpoint. The
checkpoint requires that some mechanism is provided, but there is no
statement about which particular method a developer uses. Hence "may", which
seems to me should be consistent throughout the techniques.

  "may" somehow seems overly permissive.  If you just can't stand "must"
  then at least go for "should"!  Since this is P1, I vote for "must".
