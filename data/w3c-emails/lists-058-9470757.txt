2.3.3 might include the recent urgings to "where appropriate" use
graphics and perhaps simplified text as an alternative.

2.4.1 "Default to an accessibility error such as no "alt" attribute for
images." I think this is so that the alerting function comes into play
and perhaps that should be stated.

2.4.4 "See also checkpoint 2.4.4 " ???

2.6.3 "Provide context sensitive-help" misplaced hyphen.

Under 2.6.6 there are "techniques:" nad then "techniques for this
guideline" and this is a construct unique to this location??

"Guideline 3.2 Alt-Text for the HTML 4.0 IMG Element" is not a
"guideline".

We might want to get Alan Cantor's treatise on keyboard (mouseless)
operation to include in examples?
