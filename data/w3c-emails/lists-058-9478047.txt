My comments interspersed - look for CMN and WL

  2.3.3 might include the recent urgings to "where appropriate" use
  graphics and perhaps simplified text as an alternative.
  
CMN: Good idea. Want to propose some wording?

  2.4.1 "Default to an accessibility error such as no "alt" attribute for
  images." I think this is so that the alerting function comes into play
  and perhaps that should be stated.

CMN I Agree
  
WL:  2.6.3 "Provide context sensitive-help" misplaced hyphen.
  
CMN: Whoops

WL:  2.4.4 "See also checkpoint 2.4.4 " ???

CMN: ???? too. I'll check where that comes from
  
WL:  Under 2.6.6 there are "techniques:" nad then "techniques for this
  guideline" and this is a construct unique to this location??

CMN: No, the same construct is used for another guideline.
  
WL:  "Guideline 3.2 Alt-Text for the HTML 4.0 IMG Element" is not a
  "guideline".

True. Something funny is going on - that is generated by Scripts.

WL:  
  We might want to get Alan Cantor's treatise on keyboard (mouseless)
  operation to include in examples?

CMN just send the URI...
