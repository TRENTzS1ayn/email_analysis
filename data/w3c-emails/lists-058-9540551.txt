technique 2.?.?:
Alternative content should not be limited to text when considering alt,
title, longdesc, etc. since in many cases (author-determined) better
expansion of information can be transmitted with graphics, sounds,
animations, etc.

When an author wishes a wider audience she must get the opportunity to
provide alternative renderings of content at varying "reading levels"
such as a precis explaining the intent of material that cannot be fully
comprehended, but might be appreciated by readers other than the
intended ones.
