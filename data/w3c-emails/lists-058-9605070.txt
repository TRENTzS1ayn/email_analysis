  The authoring tool is accessible.
  The authoring tool produces accessible content.
  The authoring tool encourages the creation of accessible content.

  Subject:  Re: proposed re-wording of goals statement
  
  
  It seems to me that there is consensus on goal 2 being stated as "the tool
  will create accessible content"
  
  Gregory has effectively proposed an extra goal - that the tool be user
  configurable, which I would express as the user having ultimate control.
  However I don't think that is necessarily a goal, since i think there are
  circumstances in which the user's control is properly constrained without
  having an impact on the reaching of our goals. We have checkpoints which
  specify where user control should or must not be constrained, and I prefer
  that way of dealing with it.
  
  So it seems to me that we have 3 goals:
    * The authoring tool is accessible
    * The tool will create accessible content
    * The tool will encourage the creation of accessible content
  
  (I have changed the wording of the second goal to match what seems to have
  been accepteable to everyone).
  
  Are these acceptable as the goals?
  
  Some pseudo-philosophy for people who want to read it...
  I think the overall goal is that people will be able to use tools to
  produce
  good content. We give checkpoints a priority so that developers know what
  they really need to work on, and what they can aim for next time (making
  the
  assumption that most developers will not actually do the complete job the
  "first" time). We explain how we are arriving at the priorities so that our
  process is more transparent, and to give enough information that the
  priority
  scheme can be applied to an unaddressed question.

    With the present statement of the goals, did we lose the goal statement
    regarding the tool generating accessible content somewhere and what was
  the
    justification? Goal 3 addresses the prompting, education, verification,
    alerting etc that the tool must do, which is all that a tool developer
  has
    control over given that we want it to be on a user configurable schedule.
    The present goals don't address what the tool does without the author's
    explicit intervention. I would propose that goal 2 be that the tool
    generate accessible content.
