I propose changing the following paragraph:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Accessible Web content is achieved by encouraging authoring tool users
("authors") to create accessible Web content through mechanisms such as
prompts, alerts, checking and repair functions, help files and automated
tools. It is
equally important that all people can be the authors of Web content,
rather than merely recipients. It is therefore of critical importance
that the tools used to create
this content are themselves accessible. Adoption of these guidelines
will result in the proliferation of Web pages that can be read by a
broader range of readers
and in authoring tools that can be used by a broader 
range of authors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

With this one:

Authoring tools produce accessible content in several
ways: by generating accessible content automatically,
and by encouraging accessible authoring practices
through prompts, alerts, validation, and repair mechanisms.
The authoring tools themselves must be accessible so that people
with disabilities can develop Web content. Developers
who follow these guidelines will enable all authors to
produce accsessible content for the Web more easily
and more efficiently.
