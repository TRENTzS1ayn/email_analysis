1) Propose changing:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Authoring tools are used to
automate the mechanical tasks that are part of producing Web pages. The
power of this automation can enhance the accessibility of the Web if it
is used to ensure that the code produced 
promotes accessibility, and frees the author to concentrate on the
higher level problems of overall design, content, description, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

to:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By automating some editing tasks, authoring tools
can produce content known to be accessible at the
same time they allow authors to concentrate
on higher level authoring issues. Automation does not
mean authors may ignore accessibility issues, but it
does mean that authors can leave mechanical tasks
up to the authoring tool.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

2) In the second paragraph, change "some features which"
to "some features that".

3) In the second paragraph, insert a reference (and link) to
   [WAI-WEBCONTENT] after "Web Content Accessibility
   Guidelines".

4) In the second paragraph, propose changing:

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  The accessibility of the content produced depends on the ability of
the tool to be used in producing accessible markup, and on the user
interface of the tool enabling, informing, and encouraging the use of
accessible markup authoring practices. These Guidelines refer
extensively to the Web Content accessibility Guidelines, which details
accessibility requirements for markup itself, and include checkpoints
which are basic requirements for the accessibility of the tool and its
output. In addition, there are guidelines and checkpoints which are
uniquely relevant to the role authoring tools play in guiding the author
to produce accessible content.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

to:
 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  Two factors affect the accessibility of content produced
  by authoring tools: the quality of the markup created
  by the tool and the success of the user interface 
  in enabling, informing, and encouraging accessible
  authoring practices. For issues relating
  to accessible markup, these Guidelines refer to 
  W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT],
  which explain in detail how content developers can
  construct accessible Web pages and sites. For authoring
  tool accessibility, the current guidelines explain
  how to create a user interface that is accessible and 
  promotes accessible authoring practices.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>

I propose dropping references to checkpoints and
guidelines from the Introduction since they are 
explained two sections later.
