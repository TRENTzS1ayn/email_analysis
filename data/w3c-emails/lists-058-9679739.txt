1) Checkpoint 2.3.2: Change "is conformant to" to
   "conforms to". Make this change globally.

2) Checkpoint 2.3.3: Change "are conformant to" to
   "conform to".

3) Guideline 2.4: In intro text, rather than say
   that text equivalents are "absolutely necessary", just
   explain why they are important: they may be rendered
   as speech, braille, and visually. Change the second
   sentence to read something like "Since producing
   text equivalents can be a time-consuming task..." and
   then merge with the second paragraph. For example:

   "Textual equivalents, including "alt-text", long 
    descriptions, video captions, and transcripts make
    multimedia content accessible since text may be
    rendered as speech, braille, and visually. [Add
    more rationale here if desired, stealing from
    WCAG.] Since producing text equivalents can be a
    time-consuming task, authoring tools should
    assist the author with mechanical tasks (such as?)
    and help the author ensure that text equivalents
    accurately convey the functionality of
    the related multimedia object.

4) Drop "This will lead to an increase in the
   average quality of descriptions used." I don't think
   this prediction is necessary, in particular because
   just before it there are four good reasons to include
   pre-written descriptions. What does "average quality"
   mean?

5) In checkpoints 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, change "information"
   to "markup".

6) In checkpoint 2.4.2, language changes are mentioned.
   How does the tool know when the language changes in
   the document? If known automatically, the tool should
   insert the markup itself. If not known automatically,
   it can't alert the user when the information is missing.

7) Checkpoint 2.4.5: change ", which" to "that".
