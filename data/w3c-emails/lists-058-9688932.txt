1) The first sentence of the rationale sounds like
   an inevitability. I propose rewriting it as follows:

   "When adding features to software, developers must
    ensure that they are integrated into the overall
    "look and feel" of the software. Consistency
    promotes accessibility and acceptance of new features.

2) Checkpoint 2.5.1: Could be split into two checkpoints.
   Not crucial.

3) Checkpoint 2.6.1: Change "which" to "that" several times.

4) Checkpoint 2.6.2: What does the "nature of an alert" mean?
   Does this mean "severity"?

5)  Checkpoint 2.6.3: Change "which" to "that" several times.

6) Checkpoint 2.6.5: Change "accessibility status" to
   "document accessibility status".

7) Checkpoint 2.7.2: Change "Explain the use of accessible
   authoring practices" to "Explain the accessible authoring
   practices".

8) Checkpoint 2.7.3: Change "Examples must not use
   inaccessible markup" to "Do not use inaccessible markup
   in examples."
