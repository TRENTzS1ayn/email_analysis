My comments sprinkled throughout - look for IJ and CMN

  1) The first sentence of the rationale sounds like
     an inevitability. I propose rewriting it as follows:
  
     "When adding features to software, developers must
      ensure that they are integrated into the overall
      "look and feel" of the software. Consistency
      promotes accessibility and acceptance of new features.
CMN
Actually, I propose expanding slightly on your text, so it reads

...Consistency promotes both accessibility of the tool and author acceptance
(and therefore use) of new features

However I will not make either change to the draft for the Interest Group on
Monday, unless there is strong support and no dissent from the list during
the day.

  2) Checkpoint 2.5.1: Could be split into two checkpoints.
     Not crucial.
CMN  
Noted as issue for working group
IJ
  3) Checkpoint 2.6.1: Change "which" to "that" several times.
CMN
I did a global search/replace for them. One of the features of an Australian
editor I guess *grin*
IJ  
  4) Checkpoint 2.6.2: What does the "nature of an alert" mean?
     Does this mean "severity"?
CMN
I think it means the nature - its severity, the way it appears, etc. I don't
think we should constrain this too much, although we may want to give
examples of possible changes in the techniques document.
IJ
  5)  Checkpoint 2.6.3: Change "which" to "that" several times.
CMN Done
IJ  
  6) Checkpoint 2.6.5: Change "accessibility status" to
     "document accessibility status".
  
  7) Checkpoint 2.7.2: Change "Explain the use of accessible
     authoring practices" to "Explain the accessible authoring
     practices".

  8) Checkpoint 2.7.3: Change "Examples must not use
     inaccessible markup" to "Do not use inaccessible markup
     in examples."
CMN
These seem like simple editorial changes - unless there is any dissent they
will be made.
