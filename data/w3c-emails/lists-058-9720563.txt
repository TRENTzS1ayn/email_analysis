These are proposed changes to checkpoint text, that are in some cases
substantial. I have made a much more conservative change to 2.1.2 than
proposed, to bring the grammar in line, changed "which" to "that", and noted
the rest as issues for the group.

  1) In rationale text, I find the sentence that begins
     "There are strategies" not useful. It should be
     strengthened. (No proposal yet).
  
  2) Checkpoint 2.1.2: Change from:
  
     "The author must be able to change the editing view without
      changing the presentational markup defined for the document
      currently being edited."
  
     To:
  
     "Ensure that the author may adjust the document
      presentation while editing without affecting the
      presentation specified for publication."
  
  3) Checkpoint 2.1.3: Change "which" to "that".
  
  4) Checkpoint 2.1.3: Change from "Enable navigation
       and editing via the structure of the document" to
       "Allow the author to navigate and edit the
        document based on its structure."
  
  5) Checkpoint 2.1.5: I don't understand this checkpoint.
     What does it mean to edit the structure of the 
     document? How does this differ from editing the
     document?
  
  6) Change first sentence of Guideline 2.2 from
     "The first step towards producing content is conformance
      with standard, which promotes interoperability." to
      "Conformance with standards promotes interoperability
       and accessibility."
  
  7) Checkpoint 2.2.2: Change "Extensions to W3C Recs"
      to "Proprietary extensions to W3C Recs". I'm not sure
      why this is limited to W3C Recommendations, in fact.
     
  
  5)
