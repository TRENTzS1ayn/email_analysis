  1) The title "Scope of these Guidelines" confuses me.
     This section discusses two things: (a) the audience
     for the guidelines (b) what is meant by authoring
     tool. I think 1.1 should be merged into the first
     two paragraphs of the Introduction and follow
     this outline:
  
     - Authoring tools play a critical role 
     - Here's what we mean by authoring tool
     - Markup must be accessible (cf. WAI-WEBCONTENT)
     - Tool must promote accessible authoring practice
       (e.g., by automating tasks)

CMN
I agree, but don't have text for this. Given that Dick Brown has also raised
questions about this section, I have left it alone for the present, and hope
we will have a cleaner version for the next draft.
IJ  
     Note: This proposal kind of subsumes one I
           just sent on the Introduction text.  
     
  2) The term "Web format" is used several times, as is
     "Web content". What's the difference?
CMN
A Web format is a format which is used on the web. Content is something to
which a format may be applied, or which may be expressed through a particular
format.
IJ  
  3) In fourth bullet, propose adding the word "content"
     after "multimedia".
  
  4) I think section 1.2 should be dropped and replaced
     by a section entitled "How the Guidelines are
     Organized", as in the Web Content Accessibility and
     UA Accessibility guidelines. Refer to [2].

CMN 
Both seem like good ideas to me, but I have noted them as topics for the
group to resolve.
