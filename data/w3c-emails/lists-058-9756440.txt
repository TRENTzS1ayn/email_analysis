I agree that it's important to be flexible, but imprecise language
should be avoided. The word "nature" to me, implies something that
cannot be changed by the user - something's nature is inherent
to it (e.g., human nature). 

Actually, I don't think alerts have severity - errors have severity.
Alerts just let you know what the severity is.

Proposed: 
  "Allow the users to control the timing and presentation of alerts."
