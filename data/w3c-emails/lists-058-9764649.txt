Ian,

I agree with and like the rewording of the introduction and abstract with
the exception of the proposed rewording of the paragraph on the benefits
and role of automation:

It still seems awkward and not to the point. The point we want to make is
that we want to free up the energies and attention of the author to
concentrate on accessible authoring practices that require human cognition
and judgement by automating or semi-automating tasks that can be carried
out by the machine.

Knowing our intention can you propose another revision?
