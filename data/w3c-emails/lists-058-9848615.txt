Hi all.

We are working from the 21 June draft, which has been linked from, the
relevant places since 21 June. You maight be on a proxying delay.

The differences are fairly minor - see the changes log (which is now linked
from the status section too). From memory there are a few more techniques,
and the definitions and priority definition sections have been edited a bit.

  aloha, charles!
  
  are we supposed to be working from the 21 june draft, cited in judy's emessage
  (which you forwarded to the AU list) 
  or the 17 june draft, which is still linked from the AU portion of the WAI
  pages as the current working draft, or are the 3 one and the same?  from other
  posts, it seemed as if it were a further revision, based on the list
  discussion...

  PS: feel free to post this to the list or not, as you see fit...
