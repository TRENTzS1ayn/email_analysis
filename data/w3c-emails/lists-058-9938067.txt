This issue came up tangentially on WebWatch and David asserted the AU
guidelines would discourage use of (file name , file size) as a
machine-generated initial value for ALT text.

I am not sure if the benefits of this practice have been duly considered by
the group, so I am repeating them here for your consideration and balancing
off against all other relevant interests in this matter.

Rules for checking HTML are being discussed and developed in the Evaluation
and Repair working group in the WAI.  You can join.  See
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/> for more information.

In particular, there is a working draft description of these rules at


http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/docs/Implementation.html

Comments should be addressed to <w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org> and follow-up to
comments can be read at <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/>.

Yes, these people are cooperating with the author tools group.

This is debatable.

I fear that the file size has gotten an unduly bad press because there are
no representatives of the "low bandwidth network connection" user group
involved in the discussion.  File name and file size suits the needs of
this group of users very well.  For them one role of the ALT text is as a
link label for the optional retrieval of the image.  As a starting
insertion, if the user will take just a moment to edit based on this
beinning, it makes a lot of sense.
