As to auto-insert of file name/size for ALT: I don't think it should be
"nipped in the bud" because it is *something* and that's a GOOD THING; I
think it must (if feasible) be the source for a prompt because that's a
BETTER THING.  IOW if no ALT was put in by author, tool should do file
info but prompt for improvement from author.
