As an alternative to not doing anything at all about ALT, filename and size
is useful. In addition, the file size (in particular) is valuable to people
who are in low-bandwidth situations.

But without some idea what the image is about, the information is still not
very helpful, because you don't have any way of deciding whether or not the
information is useful. For an example of how unhelpful this can be, point
lynx at http://www.footy99.com.au - something I do most weeks.

The argument seems to be the same as that for text only sites. It is an easy
way to automatically do a bad job. But you cannot be certain that you have
provided anything meaningful, let alone useful. To allow a tool to stop at
this seems to me a failure - it relies on any accessibility information being
included by an accident of nomenclature. As an initial default, there is a
risk that the benefit it provides will be outwieghed by it being interpreted
as an acceptable alt text in most contexts, and not requiring further author
attention. I think a tool which strongly encourages author involvement in
producing sensible and meaningful alteraative content, and which can maintain
metadata to offer more valuable defaults for alternatives where they have
been previously defined, will minimise that risk. A tool which does not
require any action on the author's part, or "hides" the ability to change
alternate text at the back of some chain of menus will maximise that risk,
which has been realised in a widespread pattern already.

There is another way to get the same information - the name of the resource
can often be determined by the User agent - which has it so it can ask for
the image, and the file size is one of the things HTTP sends with a head.

  off against all other relevant interests in this matter.

  Rules for checking HTML are being discussed and developed in the Evaluation
  and Repair working group in the WAI.  You can join.  See
  <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/> for more information.
  
  In particular, there is a working draft description of these rules at
  
  
  http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca/docs/Implementation.html
  
  Comments should be addressed to <w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org> and follow-up to
  comments can be read at <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/>.
  
  Yes, these people are cooperating with the author tools group.

  This is debatable.
  
  I fear that the file size has gotten an unduly bad press because there are
  no representatives of the "low bandwidth network connection" user group
  involved in the discussion.  File name and file size suits the needs of
  this group of users very well.  For them one role of the ALT text is as a
  link label for the optional retrieval of the image.  As a starting
  insertion, if the user will take just a moment to edit based on this
  beinning, it makes a lot of sense.
