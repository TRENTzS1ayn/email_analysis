Hello,

In the 14 October draft [1], G4 reads:

  "Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content"

I propose changing this to:

  "Provide ways to check for and correct inaccessible content"

A couple of reasons:
 - I don't like "methods" here. Method implies for me some methodology.
   I believe what is meant here is "service" or "tool" or "feature" or
   something similar. I propose "way" since it's a little less specific
   than "service".
 - I think "check" should be "check for" anyway.
 - None of the other guidelines use gerunds (not important, but still)

- Ian
