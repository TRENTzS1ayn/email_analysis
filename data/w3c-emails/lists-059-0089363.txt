We address this problem through reference to the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, most obviously in guideline 1.

An example of an authoring tool that handles this in an advanced way is
Microsoft Word, which allows the creation of various headers and footers, and
columnar text, but can reproduce a linear flow order.

  WYSIWYG editors tend to make the orders different whenever the user
  starts moving things around,  and  hand-crafted HTML can be just as 
  bad.
  
  
  In fact, in a 2-dimensional graphical layout, "the order" is not always
  obvious. defined, or best suited to the needs of blind surfers.
  
  
  Therefore, when sections of the page have an order controlled by a style
  sheet, the tool needs a way to independently control the order in which
  those sections appear in the HTML.  The result would be displayed in a
  separate window, with means to showing what corresponds to what, just
  like in the email with subject: " Last call AU: simultaneous
  presentations"

  I think this would best fit under guideline 1.  
  
  
  I'd give it a priority 1.  It addresses the biggest hassle I'm currently
  facing as I try to transfer newsletters from a major desktop publishing
  program  to a web site.
