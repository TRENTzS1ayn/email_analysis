Yes, the AU guidelines implicitly refer to the need for the HTML to be in
proper order.  But I don't see any reference to a feature that's often
needed to do so, viz

     a way for the author to <strong> explicitly </strong> specify the 
     order in which those elements appear in the HTML.  

This is needed if all you have is a wysiwyg view, in which a sighted order
has slid things around on the screen.  In other words, the x,y coordinates
have been specified via positioning but no serial is defined.  The program
can apply heuristics to find the serial order, but they don't always work.
(That's what they tried to do at Adobe.  I think they put in some hard
effort with good people but there are still PDF documents where the order
comes out screwey.)

I feel rather strong about this because the problem comes up with Microsoft
Publisher.  I need to put up some pages that were created by someone who
slid text around, and the text order in the HTML is really mixed up.  I
wrote Microsoft and they weren't able to help.  If they want to keep the
slide around interface, they need to have explicit positioning.

Word is different than Publisher because you can't just arbitrarily
position something somewhere: you have to insert it in a flow.

The difference is that in publisher you define an object and then give it's
x,y position.  In word you define a serial order.

It's true that there are some simple presentations like having just two
columns where the order stays defined.  But even if a simple heuristic can
deduce the reading order from the visual presentation, that may not be the
optimal reading order for someone who is blind.  For example, you may want
to move a bunch of menu links from the beginning to the end.
