There is a specific techniques suggestion in checkpoint 4.1, and the
reference to WCAG in checkpoint 1.3. In addition a technique has been added
to checkpoint 1.2 in the next draft.

  Yes, the AU guidelines implicitly refer to the need for the HTML to be in
  proper order.  But I don't see any reference to a feature that's often
  needed to do so, viz
  
       a way for the author to <strong> explicitly </strong> specify the 
       order in which those elements appear in the HTML.  
  
  This is needed if all you have is a wysiwyg view, in which a sighted order
  has slid things around on the screen.  In other words, the x,y coordinates
  have been specified via positioning but no serial is defined.  The program
  can apply heuristics to find the serial order, but they don't always work.
  (That's what they tried to do at Adobe.  I think they put in some hard
  effort with good people but there are still PDF documents where the order
  comes out screwey.)
  
  I feel rather strong about this because the problem comes up with Microsoft
  Publisher.  I need to put up some pages that were created by someone who
  slid text around, and the text order in the HTML is really mixed up.  I
  wrote Microsoft and they weren't able to help.  If they want to keep the
  slide around interface, they need to have explicit positioning.
  
  Word is different than Publisher because you can't just arbitrarily
  position something somewhere: you have to insert it in a flow.
  
  The difference is that in publisher you define an object and then give it's
  x,y position.  In word you define a serial order.
  
  It's true that there are some simple presentations like having just two
  columns where the order stays defined.  But even if a simple heuristic can
  deduce the reading order from the visual presentation, that may not be the
  optimal reading order for someone who is blind.  For example, you may want
  to move a bunch of menu links from the beginning to the end.
