phil asked, quote Gregory, are you reversing your opinion/resolution that the
document should NOT go forward to proposed recommendation?  It is implied that
you are but you didn't explicitly say it.unquote

aloha, phil!

no, not at all -- just making clear what some may think is a subtle
distinction, but one which i don't want to be lost...

first of all, i am confident that ATAG is the strongest, most coherent, and
concise document yet to be issued by the WAI, and am grateful to all concerned
for being allowed a part in its refinement...

as for "minority opinions", i understand that this is semantic, rather than a
substantive, issue, but semantics, unfortunately, often triumph over substance,
which is why i  aired my concerns on-list, so that my dissent on the issue
would remain a matter of public record...

many of the individuals from whom i solicited comments upon the ATAG during
last call also expressed concern about the quote hiding unquote (their word) of
the guideline addressing the accessibility of the tool itself, but restrained
from posting comments to the list, as they (obviously more politic persons than
myself) understood that, whenever a document is being drafted by consensus,
certain compromises need to be made, and the fact that 7.1 is a Priority 1 does
mitigate the sting of this particular bargain...

my only concern -- and the concern of others who raised this topic
independently with me -- is that it not prove to have been a Faustian
bargain...  perhaps i and others who share my point of view have just been
embittered by our experiences, but in some cultures, i believe they call that
type of experience wisdom...

gregory.

CYNIC, n.  A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not
as they ought to be.  Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out
a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.
