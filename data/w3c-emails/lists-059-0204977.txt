Congratulations folks.

The director approved the guidelines as a Proposed Recommendation. The W3C
members have now been asked to advise the director on what to do with them
(Make them a Recommendation, work on them some more first, drop the whole
activity).

Over the next four weeks Member organisations will give their advice (like in
Last Call, and in other ballots, most are likely to come at the end of the
review period, allowing the members to read the guidelines and think
carefully about them.)

Member comments can be made privately or publicly. In four weeks time the
working group may be asked to answer questions or address issues raised by
the member review. In the meantime, it would be good to improve the
techniques document, expand our knowledge of existing tools and update the
evaluations that we did against last call and earlier drafts.

Congratulations and thanks to everybody for the hard work that got us this
far, with what I believe is a very good document. Please hang in there for
the last hurrah - we won't know what that will be like until the review is
over in four weeks, at the earliest.

And for those who wonder "what have we wrought?", the Proposed
Recommendation draft is at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-WAI-AUTOOLS-19991026
with techniques at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS-19991026

cheers
