Martin,

thank you for your comments. I hope the points you raised are satisfactorily
addressed in the latest techniques draft at
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS-19991026
If not, or if there are further techniques you think we should add, please
let us know - the Techniques document is still only a Working Draft.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  The guidelines document is extremely general, it doesn't
  look like there are any issues.
  
  I found some issues in the accompagning techniques document:
  
  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-AUTOOLS-TECHS/
  
  
  Under Checkpoint 3.1:
  In Japanese, prompt the author for kana text that can be used
  as a ruby for unusual or complex kanji.
  
  This should be generalized. The problem of pronouncing unusual/rare
  ideographic characters also exists in Chinese, Koreane (and Vietnamese).
  In Japanese in particular (and to a very limited extent in the
  other languages), it should be "kanji or kanji combinations".
  A reading in a combination can be difficult even if reading
  the single components is easy, and vice-versa. Ruby probably
  should be mentionned only as one potential technique.
  "complex" should be removed, because there is no really significant
  correlation between the complexity of a character (e.g. in terms
  of numbers of strokes) and the reading difficulty, unless
  this is specifically mentionned to care about people with reduced
  vision (in which case this should probably be mentionned explicitly).
  
  
  Under Checkpoint 4.1:
  Where there is a change in the character set (or subset) used,
  prompt the author to identify whether there has been a change
  in language 
  
  Change "character set (or subset)" to "script". The term
  'character set' is confusing, and in any of it's current
  usages, not really what you want to say.
  
  
  Regards,   Martin.
