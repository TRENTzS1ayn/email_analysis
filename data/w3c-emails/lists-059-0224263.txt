Martin,

We have addressed this issue by creating a "relative priority", which is
defined once in more detail and with examples.

Cheers

Charles

  Just found the following:
  
  1.3 Ensure that templates provided by the tool conform to W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].
                [Priority 1 for level-A conformance, Priority 2 for double-A conformance, Priority 3 for triple-A conformance]
  
  Very confusing: I first read it to say that for better conformance,
  this point has lower priority. Didn't make sense at all.
  
  One way it makes sense to me is to say "Priority 1 stuff of the *Content*
  guidelines is required for level-A conformance of *Authoring*".
  The other way round, it can also make sense: "Level-A conformance
  stuff from *Content* GLs is Priority 1 for *Authoring*.
  
  Anyway, I guess a clarification is necessary.
  
  Regards,   Martin.
