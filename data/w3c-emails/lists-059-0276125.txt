Congatulations everyone and thanks for all the hard work.

Although we have postponed today's teleconference, I've had several emails
asking for an opportunity to get a quick debriefing on what happened on
Monday and to plan for what will happen in the next few weeks.

Since we have the bridge booked would people like to get together for say
10 minutes and just touch base?

Jutta
