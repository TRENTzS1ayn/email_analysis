The example introducing [Relative Priority] is good, but it's kind of
wordy and without a better structuring, hard to swallow.

I suggest (make in two bullets and get rid of some unimportant
rationale/solution to make it shorter).

New text:

For example:
 - Providing text equivalents for images and audio is a priority 1
requirement in [WAI-WEBCONTENT] therefore, it is a priority 1
requirement for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the
author for (3.1) equivalent alternatives for these types of content.
 - Expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM
elements is a priority 3 in [WAI-WEBCONTENT], therefore, it is only
priority 3 for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the author
for (3.2) this information.

-- End new text

In the above: "priority 1" and "priority 3" are in strong and
"therefore" in <em> to make the binding clear.

I also suggest moving the definition itself (It is priority 1 to...)
before the example, right after [Relative Priority], to use the
example as explanatory material after the important stuff has been
told.
