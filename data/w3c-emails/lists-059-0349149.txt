  The example introducing [Relative Priority] is good, but it's kind of
  wordy and without a better structuring, hard to swallow.
  
  I suggest (make in two bullets and get rid of some unimportant
  rationale/solution to make it shorter).
  
  New text:
  
  For example:
   - Providing text equivalents for images and audio is a priority 1
  requirement in [WAI-WEBCONTENT] therefore, it is a priority 1
  requirement for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the
  author for (3.1) equivalent alternatives for these types of content.
   - Expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM
  elements is a priority 3 in [WAI-WEBCONTENT], therefore, it is only
  priority 3 for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the author
  for (3.2) this information.
  
  -- End new text
  
  In the above: "priority 1" and "priority 3" are in strong and
  "therefore" in <em> to make the binding clear.
  
  I also suggest moving the definition itself (It is priority 1 to...)
  before the example, right after [Relative Priority], to use the
  example as explanatory material after the important stuff has been
  told.
