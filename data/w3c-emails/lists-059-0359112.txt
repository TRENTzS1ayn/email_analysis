aloha, charles!

as long as you are contemplating a change in the wording of the explanation of
Relative Priority, please reconsider the use of ACRONYM and ABBR as your P3
example...

as documented in my exchange with phil jenkins on the w3c-wai-au list, in posts
archived at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0092.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0093.html
and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0096.html

i am adamantly opposed to the use of ACRONYM and ABBR in the Relative Priority
example, as they are far more important to accessibility (and interoperability)
than the P3 accorded them by WCAG...

yes, i know that WCAG as it stands today does accord the use of ACRONYM and
ABBR a P3, but there has been much debate on several WAI lists as to the
importance of the use of ACRONYM and ABBR (as well as their expansion slash
exposition to user agents), and it would, therefore, behoove us to use a less
controversial example, several of which are provided in the posts cited
above...
