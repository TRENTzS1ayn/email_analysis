Folks,

We didn't have much actual meeting today - Jan, Gregory, Jutta and I turned
up, and briefly discussed meeting timelines a little, and whether anyone had
a good idea about how to label the priority of 7.1 - mostly in terms of how
it should appear in the checklist.

Next Wednesday the review period will have ended, and if there are comments
we will be trying to resolve them as fast as possible. I realise (now I have
been told) that Thanksgiving is a big thing for the US, so please let us know
if you will or will not be attending that meeting.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  Yes.
  
  I'm sorry, I have been offline for a few days when I did not expect to be :-(
  
  Rough Agenda: extended meetings for resolving any issues raised in PR, what
  kind of priority marker 7.1 has.
  
  I imagine it will be fairly short.
  
  Cheers
