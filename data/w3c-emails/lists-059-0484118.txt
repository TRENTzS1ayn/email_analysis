Folks,

We will also be able to meet on Monday 29 November. I would prefer to
schedule more teleconferences than longer ones, since I will have arrived in
Australia on Monday morning (Sunday night US time) and find very long
meetings more difficult to minute and concentrate in.

As I mentioned in another thread, the Day before thanksgiving is the first
meeting after the close of review, and at the very least we will be
discussing what comments have come in. Could people please send regrets to
the list if they are unable to attend that meeting.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  We need to schedule extended meetings the week of November 29 to deal with

  for 9 hours over the course of a week to close out their document.
  
  Could people please schedule in teleconferences from 3:00pm Boston time to
  a time to be determined, on both Tuesday November 30 and Wednesday Dec 1.
  We will send details about the number to call soon.
  
  Thanks Jutta
