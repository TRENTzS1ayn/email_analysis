Well, the feedback is always welcome ;-)

To the specifics... (my interpretations marked with CMN)

  Overall, the guidelines in Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 seem
  reasonable and a step forward in promoting accessible content and authoring
  tools.  However, the specification should clarify its intent.  Is the
  expectation that an authoring tool should make existing functionality
  accessible (and generate accessible content) OR that an application should
  meet all spec requirements -- even when these requirements are not
  available for other users -- (and generate accessible content)?  It is one
  thing to expect that existing functionality be made accessible, but quite
  another to add functionality to an existing application.

CMN Yes, we recognise that. In general it is existing functionalities that
need to be accessible, although there are a couple of functionalities
required by users with disabilities, which are brough out in guideline 7, as
you note below.
  
  We have a few specific questions/comments/requests-for-clarification
  below.
   Hope our feedback isn't too late to consider...

  In the 1.1 checkpoint, what is meant by "conversions"?  Does this include
  converting one file type to another as in the case of encoding audio or
  video content?

CMN Yes, it does mean converting from one file type to another.
  
  1.2 Ensure that the tool preserves all accessibility information 
  during authoring, transformations and conversions. [Priority 1] 
  
  ++++++++++++++++++++++
  In 7.1, who's "standards and conventions" is the authoring tool supposed to
  be adhering to?  Who set these standards?

CMN There are accessibility standards for many operating systems, and there
are standard specifications for almost all of them. In most cases they are
written by the developers of the system. Some of the references provided are
to well-established research work which has formed the basis of many more
specific standards. In many cases, particularly in moving beyond simple HTMl
editors to more powerful or complex authoring tools, the application is also
a user agent, in whch case the user agent guidelines should be met.
  
  7.1 Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards 
  and conventions (Priority 1 for standards and conventions that are 
  essential to accessibility, Priority 2 for those that are important 
  to accessibility, Priority 3 for those that are beneficial to
  accessibility). [Priority 1] 
  
  ++++++++++++++++++++++
  In 7.2, can an application depend on the operating system's accessibility
  standards?  For example, for entering text in a dialog, can an application
  depend on the OS to be capable of zooming in/out?
  
CMN Certainly.

  7.2 Allow the author to change the presentation within editing 
  views without affecting the document markup. [Priority 1] 
  
  ++++++++++++++++++++++
  Can 7.4 - 7.6 be appended to include "to the extent that the application
  supports this functionality"?
  
CMN These functionalities are required by authors with certain disabilities,
and need to be implemented by tools. although thay can only be implemented to
the extent that a particular format permits (for example there is not a lot
of structure to a basig jpeg, but there is in an accessible movie
presentation or a structured vector graphic).

  7.4 Ensure the editing view allows navigation via the structure 
  of the document in an accessible fashion. [Priority 1] 
  
  7.5 Enable editing of the structure of the document in an 
  accessible fashion. [Priority 2] 
  
  7.6 Allow the author to search within editing views. [Priority 2] 
  

Thanks for the feedback. I hope this clarifies.
