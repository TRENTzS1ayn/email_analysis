The meeting tomorrow will be at the usual 3:30, on the normal phone number -
+1.617.252.7000

The agenda will be discussion of the Proposed Recommendation Review - since
that does not close until tonight I will post the relevant information as
early as possible tomorrow.

I will provide more details about next week's meetings tomorrow.

Cheers

Charles
