Re: adding functionality for accessibility, perhaps a specific example

seem reasonable.

what doesn't seem reasonable?  that you should offer the same functionality to
all users?  the ATAG doesn't describe how to build a tool for a niche market
(read: users with disabilities), but, rather, how to build a tool that can be
used by all persons, regardless of perceived disability, to create content that
can be used by all persons, regardless of perceived disability...
