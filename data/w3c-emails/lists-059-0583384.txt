I won't be able to make the meeting this afternoon.  Next week is looking
iffy as well (I'm in process of changing offices/towns/divisions).

Based on my participitation in and review of the AC discussions I would
suggest the following items need to happen to close out the document:

1) Add text to section 1.3 that states something like:  "this document is
meant to provide direction for tool vendors and, given the state of
authoring tools currently, should not be used by regulatory bodies to
specify conformance levels until appropriate".

2)  Re-open priority definitions to capture the idea of "average" user
that's been used in direct conversation to assign priority level to
checkpoints.

3)  A technique or Note be created showing a matrix of ATAG relative
checkpoints along one axis, and WCAG checkpoints along the other.  Based on
the current state of the art, each box of the matrix should be filled in
with one of:  Done by tool alone, Done by author alone, Done by author in
conjunction with tool.  Some of these may be difficult to assign but the
benefit of clarifying responsibility for the tool creator and the
possibility of reducing whole sets of checkpoints will be well worth it.
